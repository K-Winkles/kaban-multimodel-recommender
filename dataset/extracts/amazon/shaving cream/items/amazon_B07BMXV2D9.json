Primary use is to shave legs and armpits and the best things about this product is the very small amount needed to create the \"slick\" needed over the area to be shaved so you can run your razor over it. Do NOT expect this to foam like other products. It creates this smooth slick lather over the area to be shaved so your razor glides over it without any nicks or cuts. It's not a great lavender smell, but I like it over some of the other more manly fragrances this company produces. I will continue to purchase as long as price is reasonable as it takes such a small amount to create such a nice slick lather to get a irritation free shave. I have sensitive skin and I have had zero issues with this product ANYWHERE on my body that you can imagine shaving.",
