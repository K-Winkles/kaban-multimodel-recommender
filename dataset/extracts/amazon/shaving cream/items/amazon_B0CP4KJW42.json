        "description": "Introducing the Gillette SkinGuard Shave Gel, part of Gillette's shaving regimen designed specifically for sensitive skin. SkinGuard revolutionizes the process of shaving by making shaving at home more enjoyable, including for men who tend to be prone to skin sensitivity and irritation while shaving. As a perfect complement to the SkinGuard razor, the Gillette SkinGuard Shave Gel provides a lubricating layer between the skin and the razor while you shave. It's made with shea butter and vitamin E, and is designed to reduce friction and help protect the skin while shaving. Complimenting the rest of the SkinGuard shaving regimen, the Moisturizer is scented with a hit of crisp mint, fresh lavender, and warm wood. Our specialized shave gel offers a smooth and comfortable shave experience for sensitive skin, providing the care your skin deserves. It is clinically tested, and provides just the right degree of closeness and comfort, while ensuring a precise and clean shave. To use, lather the foaming gel generously into wet skin before your shave to hydrate skin and hair and help the razor glide smoothly. Shave and rinse well. Experience the confidence that comes with 'the best a man can get': a shave that's as easy as it should be-comfortable, smooth, and clean. To help prevent new razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and shaving irritation, use SkinGuard regimen.",
