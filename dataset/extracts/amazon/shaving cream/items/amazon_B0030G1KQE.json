I got a great boars head brush and an English shaving soap.So every morning I\u2019d use a hot washcloth to soak my face, soap my face up and shave. Really wasn\u2019t satisfied with results.Told my barber about the problem and he showed me what he uses for his customers! Gave me a container to try and I\u2019ve never looked back. I put it on my face, rub it in... wait several minutes and shave. Hair comes right off the razor blade! Almost no cuts (I did change from S..... blades to A.....) blades. Blades work great!Could not be happier!",

                "reviewText": "Mention on a shaving forum piqued my interest. I'm comparing it to my usual low priced, mass-market, go-to brushless shaving creams such as: Cremo, Gilette Pure (tube), Proraso, Kiss My Face.Compared to the others it goes on a little thinner but is by no means runny even when you add water. The smell is love-it-or-hate-it I guess; a kinda menthol eucalyptus scent which is unusual compared with the other brands.In use it softens the beard adequately and it reasonably lubricating for good glide. But while the competitors leave enough of a trace on the skin to smear a little from adjacent areas for a quick buffing or touch-up; not so with this as there is absolutely no residual lubrication left after 1 pass.This really shows when you wash your face afterwards. It takes multiple washes with the competitors (above) to remove all traces which means they leave sufficient conditioning ingredient on the skin. This cream by contrast is one-and-done. As soon as you wash it off it seems there are no traces left. I kinda wonder about what the lanolin etc. are doing if I can't detect their presence after one splash with water.So it's \"just OK\", not bad, really, but at this price point I'm going back to the others.",

You could easily pay double for some other pre shave cream with a different scent and fancy packaging but this stuff works! A little bit goes a long way. Rub it in with a Brush or without one. Add a bit of warm water and let it skin on skin then apply shave cream over this. One of these jars will easily last me a year.",
