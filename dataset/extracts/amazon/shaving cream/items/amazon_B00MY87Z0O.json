Does it make me itch or have a rash of any kind? NO! Does it keep my skin from getting cut while shaving? YES! Do I have allergies, hay fever, migraines, or any other allergy symptom after using it? NO! So this product is made for people like me who desperately need something hypoallergenic and fragrance free. Thank you Vanicream for blessing my life with such a wonderful product - you truly have because I can now wear dresses, tank tops, skirts, and shorts again!",

The odor is not pleasant, it's so-so, I'm not impressed with how it spreads on my face for shaving.I shave during my daily shower so my beard / stubble is soft. The texture is smooth but it doesn't seem to provide much lubrications between the razor and my face. I've tried to use greater amounts for shaving but again it doesn't spread very well.The redness on my face has not greatly diminished but I'll continue to use this Vanicream since I have two tubes of it and I'll need to let my Dermatologist know after a month or so if my redness has gone away.Right now I'm only so-so about this product.",
