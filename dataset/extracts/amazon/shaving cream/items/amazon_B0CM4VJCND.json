A synthetic \u201cknot\u201d, as it\u2019s referred to in brush-maker speak, is far easier to deal with than a knot made of badger or boar hair and can be acquired for a very reasonable price. \u00b7 Start with a damp brush, not a dripping wet brush. This will give you the ability to control how much water goes into the mix and when. \u00b7 Shave with just enough pressure to maintain blade contact- let the blade do the work. And while we\u2019re on the subject, make sure your blade is sharp! \u00b7 Rinse your razor often to keep the lather channels open- a clean wet razor glides easily and efficiently. \u00b7 We feel that slowing down and enjoying a traditional 3-pass shave is the ultimate way to experience Amaretto Speciale. This systematic approach to shaving will remove hair easily with far less tugging of hair follicles and blade pressure on the skin. Pass 1: shave entire face \u201cwith the grain\u201d of hair. This is typically in a downward direction and will remove the bulk of the hair. Pass 2: shave entire face \u201cacross the grain\u201d of hair. This is typically in the right to left direction and will further remove stubble and pick up any hairs missed on the first pass. Pass 3: shave entire face \u201cagainst the grain\u201d of hair. This is typically in an upward direction and will give you the super smooth finish we are all after. \u00b7 After your shave rinse off your face and neck with cold water. This simple practice will close up your pores and help reduce irritation. \u00b7 Follow up your shave with Amaretto Speciale Aftershave Splash or Balm to further moisturize, and protect.",
