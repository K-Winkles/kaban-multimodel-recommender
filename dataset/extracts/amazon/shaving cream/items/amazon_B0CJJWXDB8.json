                "reviewText": "I have found dermaplanning to work out better for me at removing facial hair and peach fuzz versus with a razor. I feel my skin looks and feels smoother with less irritation that shaving can cause. That being said I have wanted to try skinny confidential's hot shave cream since I own their hot shave dermaplanning razor and was glad to see this product become available. Before receiving the cream I was just dermaplanning on dry skin or the morning after using face oils. Both of which worked out fine. The cream itself comes in a pretty pink squeeze tube. The cream is a slightly thicker consistency with a slight smell. I left my face wet after showering and just used a dime sized amount of the cream and smoothed over my face. It did give me a nice close smooth shave and removed all my hair/peach fuzz along. I did have to clean the razor off after every swipe as the cream builds up on the razor. I was able to wash it off of the razor once done. I washed the remaining cream off of my face and then moisturized as normal. My face is not only hair free but the surface of my skin looks quite smooth as well. I have sensitive skin and have no problems with any irritation from this as well. Overall a good shave cream from skinny confidential",

Anywho, I saw this and ordered it to accompany my SKINNY CONFIDENTIAL HOT SHAVE Razor.It\u2019s essentially shaving cream targeted for females, I guess, to use while dermaplaning. It\u2019s pricey and while I don\u2019t know how it would be using regular shaving cream, this definitely gives me a closer shave. My face wasn\u2019t irritated either, which is great now that it\u2019s gotten colder and my face is sensitive now. The area I dermaplaned and used this, feels smoother and looks better.I really do like what this does for my face and while it is pricey, I only use this for my face. So, I don\u2019t really mind the price for the size.",

It was used on the armpits since they\u2019re sensitive. It did seem like my razor glided much more easily than normal. I may have even gotten a closer shave as a result as well. Too bad it\u2019s such a small bottle though! I would love to use it on my legs but this would be rather cost prohibitive given the small tube and relatively large surface area of the legs.Overall seems to give a really nice close and smooth shave compared to other shaving aids. Since it is marketed for women specifically, it would have been nice to see a larger bottle so it could also be used on the legs. But hey, maybe more women are shaving their faces than I realize who would be happy to have a smaller bottle for that purpose alone.",

I was able to get a close, exfoliating shave\u2026 totally removing my peach fuzz and dead skin. The tube is a great size and I feel like this will last me a while, it doesn\u2019t take much.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a sad fact that as we get older hair shows up in places it never really did before. I\u2019ve been using body wash to shave my face so I decided to try this shave cream. It has a nice thick whipped consistency and is unscented. It applies nicely and is easy to use. The reason for the 4 stars is the price point. While it did leave my face feeling nicer than my body wash I can\u2019t see myself repurchasing this at its current price. I will say this is a unique product and I do believe there is a market for it.",
