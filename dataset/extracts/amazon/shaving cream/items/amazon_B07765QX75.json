I am prone to occasionally switch to other product for a sake of change, but this cream is so great that I stick with it for years to come.It creates a great lather, and shaves very closely with cartridge blades I use.In my experience, one package of this shave cream lasts around 4-5 months with 4 shaves a week in average.",
