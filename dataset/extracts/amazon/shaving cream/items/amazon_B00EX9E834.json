                "reviewText": "I've used Nivea products for years. Their after shave \"balm\" is so soft and smooth, that I never used any other after shaves that sting or burn again. The \"balm\" is the after shave, in other words. But, for this product of Nivea shaving gel cream, it's the softest shave I've had after using many different products with trial and error for years. This gel foams so easily once rubbed in your hands. Whether it's an electric razor, a thin beard!a+, metal razor, or any other product, combined, the use of these two Nivea products will keep your face from having knicks or small cuts on it. I mean, I've gotten to the point now where I haven't received any minor cuts at all. Both products seem oily upon application, but dry within 5-minutes after full wash off. Or, just dab it with a towel after you're Done and ready!NOTE: This is NOT a thin cream. It shouldn't be used as one or used in place of a cream. Overall, I give this shaving gel a letter grade of A- only because no product is perfect. Amazon has maniacal reviewers, so, I'm keeping this review as objective (as possible). My number ratio rating is an 8/1!0 Highly recommend!",
