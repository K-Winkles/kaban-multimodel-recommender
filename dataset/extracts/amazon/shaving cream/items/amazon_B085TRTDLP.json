                "reviewText": "This has lasted me more than a year and a half. It helps me shave better. I definitely recommend. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I will purchase this again. The scent is nice, but I will probably get a different scent next time to change up. The only downside is that I have to try to remember to put it away when I have company, lol.",
