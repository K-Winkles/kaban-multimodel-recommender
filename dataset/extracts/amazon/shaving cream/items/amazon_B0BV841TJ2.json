                "reviewText": "The Kitsch Smooth Shave Butter has redefined my shaving routine, elevating it from a mundane task to a luxurious and pampering experience. As someone who values a smooth and irritation-free shave, this product has quickly become a staple in my grooming regimen, and here's why.First and foremost, the texture of the shave butter is simply divine. Its rich and creamy consistency glides effortlessly onto the skin, creating a silky-smooth surface for the razor. The buttery formula is not only indulgent but also incredibly effective in providing a close and comfortable shave without the fear of nicks or irritation.The scent of the Kitsch Smooth Shave Butter is a delightful addition to the overall experience. The subtle and refreshing fragrance adds a touch of sophistication to the shaving routine, making it a sensory delight. It's not overpowering but leaves a subtle hint that lingers pleasantly, creating a spa-like ambiance in the comfort of my own bathroom.What truly sets this shave butter apart is its moisturizing properties. The nourishing ingredients, including shea butter and aloe vera, work in harmony to hydrate and soothe the skin. After each shave, my skin feels remarkably soft and moisturized, eliminating the need for an additional post-shave lotion. This feature is especially appreciated during colder months when my skin tends to be more prone to dryness.The Kitsch Smooth Shave Butter has exceeded my expectations in delivering a shaving experience that combines luxury, effectiveness, and skincare benefits. It has become a must-have in my grooming routine, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a shaving product that goes beyond the ordinary. Treat yourself to the indulgence of Kitsch and transform your daily shave into a moment of self-care and bliss. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I was starting to get some razor burn when shaving my armpits and was thinking I needed to replace the razor head. In the meantime, I ordered this because it was about the same price as the shaving cream I had been using and this product is equivalent to 2 cans- so why not try it out. I didn\u2019t even replace my razor when I tried this product out and no more razor burn!!! And I\u2019ve noticed less overall irritation and fewer ingrown hairs. It\u2019s been almost 2 months now and I\u2019m still getting great results- without having to change my razor blade. So, basically, you\u2019re potentially saving on two fronts: shaving cream/whatever you\u2019re currently using to shave, AND on new razors. I tell everyone about this Shave Butter Bar. I even want to try out their other bars because this is so great.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for shaving while travelling. I didn't want to have to deal with the fuss of a mini shaving cream can or anything liquid so it brought me to this lovely solid bar. The scent is light and pleasant. It travels okayish, it'll get a soggy if left in a wet environment where it cannot dry properly so be careful. It also clogs up some razors (I was using the billie one with it and sometimes the shaving soap kind of overloaded it, but it has no problems with my safety razor). All that to say I actually do like this shaving soap! It provides great protection for shaving AND leaves my skin feeling soft/moisturized afterwards.",

This was not irritating at all to either skin or nose. Scent washes off well and does not linger. Definitely helps with skin with razor burn tendencies. Would buy again.",
