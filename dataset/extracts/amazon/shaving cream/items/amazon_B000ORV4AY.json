I had to be careful putting it on the shaving brush because it was kind of hard and could fall off. It also became difficult to get out of the tube as you got to the end. The new formula has resolved both those issues, and the product quality remains stellar. The cream comes out of the tube easily and foams up better, much easier to work with. Weleda nailed it.",

The shaving cream is lighter than other 'natural' shaving creams I have tried. Just a tiny pea sized blob is enough to make plenty of lather to shave my neck and chin which I do daily. Note that it comes in a tube with a screw cap, just like toothpaste and not under pressure. It would be convenient if the cap had a flip back top to it, since fiddling with a small screw cap with hot wet hands in the early morning can be a challenge.",

                "reviewText": "Am I using the same stuff as everyone else?? I can only assume that what I received was counterfeit or had been sitting on the shelf for years and had separated out. The cream is super thick and has a strong tea tree like aroma. Not a bad start. After reading some reviews here I was looking forward to a nice lather after putting about a 3/4\" strip in my bowl. I wet my boar bristle brush with hot water, shook out the excess, and started working the cream. It basically dissolved into the brush and produced no lather, not even a little. I thought maybe it needed more water so I added a few drops at a time looking for a sweet spot. Absolutely nothing at all. Next, I decided to follow the label and just rub it into my wet skin with my fingers. Again, the nice thick cream turned into nothing. From what I can tell this stuff is behaving like what a lotion would if you add a few drops of water, it just thins out, and produced 0 lather. I also think it's because it has too much oils in it. After doing the bit with adding a few drops of water I eventually had a skim of water in the bottom of the bowl, and could see oil on the water, but no lather! I can't remember a time when I've been this hopeful about a product (because I love the other Weleda mens shaving products) and been so let down. I feel like it's 1999 again and I just got done watching Star Wars Ep: 1. I guess I am going to request a replacement or something on the assumption that this tube was messed up somehow, and will update my review if it is better.",
