Impressive.I used Brickell shave cream for many years. But the latest jar seems very different - the texture and the density are very different. And the problem is that the \"slickness\", the \"glide\" is gone. The blade is not gliding anymore, it's scrapping. It's still more or less Ok if you use it with multi-blade razors like Gillette Mach or Fusion, but I'm using double-edged safety razor and getting nicks and cuts when using the current Brickell cream. Have no choice but to switch to another brand.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Thrown away after the second shave. Can't take it anymore. The smell is SO bad, doesn't mix well when you shake it (shook it like crazy, didn't help) and just makes for an overall bad shave. My 2 star is now going down to a one star because I thought I could get through this tiny bottle but.........just no. Put this product out of its misery.Will not be buying again. Spent $12 on this shaving cream and it looks almost like a sample size (not actually the sample size because I got a sample of it before which I mistakenly forgot to use before I bought this). If you shave a lot and like to use a good amount of shaving cream do not buy this, it'll last you maybe 4-5 shaves. As far as the actual product, it felt like I was spreading some clumpy Cetaphil on my face and didn't really help with my shave much. Lastly, the smell (in my own personal opinion) is terrible, it smells like a cheap form of alcohol, almost made me gag honestly. I LOVE all the other Brickell products I have tried so far (which is the only reason it got a second star), especially the face wash and the face cream but this totally misses the mark.",

                "reviewText": "One of if not the best smooth brushless shaving creams I\u2019ve ever used. First the scent is masculine but not overbearing nor old like your fathers or grandfathers scented shaving cream. The cream is smooth, scented and not greasy or sticky. It offers a nice moisturizing effect on my skin. You don\u2019t need a lot of product to apply to face, neck, or in my case scalp. The premium brand razors that I use work great in conjunction with the cream and remove hair without any difficulty. Three strokes at most. I shave every other day so I don\u2019t have a great deal of hair to remove as I\u2019m very consistent. The value for the money is top notch as I\u2019ve used other brands that cost and arm and a leg and don\u2019t offer The same results. Furthermore, the bottle lasted well over 6 weeks. Lastly, the tube is easy to use for travel. Highly recommend.",
