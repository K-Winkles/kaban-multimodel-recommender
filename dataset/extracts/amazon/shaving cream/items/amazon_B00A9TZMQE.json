        "description": "Proraso Shaving Cream, Protective and Moisturizing Proraso Shaving Cream, Protective and Moisturizing formula, comforts your skin with extra-soothing and softening ingredients. The Vitamin E protects and nourishes dry, rough skin while the aloe vera provides extra hydration that softens and soothes. The traditional vegetable stearin-based formula is enriched with nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils to protect the skin before, during and after shaving, and helps the blade glide smoothly, reducing razor burn and rashes. Proraso Shaving Cream is still made today in accordance with a rigorous 'hot soap'-making process, which results in an ultra-rich soap that, especially with the aid of a brush, produces an incomparably thick, creamy, soft lather. It makes for a close and comfortable shave, while protecting the skin and leaving it soft and hydrated. How to use: Soak your Proraso brush in a bowl or cup filled with hot water for 5 \u2013 10 minutes before your shave. Apply a warm, damp towel to your face (or splash face with warm water) to open the pores and prep your face for shaving. Once done, apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Apply another hot towel, holding it to your face for 15 to 20 seconds. After the brush has soaked, gently squeeze out excess water, still leaving the brush mostly wet. Squeeze about 2cm of your choice of Proraso Shave Cream between the bristles of the brush and massage into your stubble or scruff using circular motion. Dip the tip of your brush back into your hot water and continue working the brush into your facial hair. After a couple minutes of 'working' the brush in your facial hair, the shaving cream turns into a creamy and compact lather that will soften all beard types, making shaving a pleasant daily ritual. Shave and rinse face thoroughly. For an optimal experience, finish with another application of your warm, damp towel, followed by your favorite Proraso After Shave Balm or Lotion Barber's choice since 1948 No parabens, no silicones No mineral oil, no SLS No artificial colors No ingredients of animal origin Over 95% natural Made in Italy",

Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don't have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute. If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if you\u2019re shaving in the shower.

The best lather comes from a brush and shaving cream or soap Applying shaving cream or soap with a brush increases the volume of your beard hair and allows for a closer shave.

Of course, after you get out of the shower it's not going to stick with you anyway.I personally like the Proraso shaving cream specifically for sensitive skin the best - that's just me. I like many of the others for their scents, such as the Sandalwood, but I always go back to the sensitive skin shaving cream.Did it moisturize any better? I can't tell. But it's as solid shaving cream as any other I've used.",

Although I like all the varieties and find they perform great, the scent of Proraso blue and the sandalwood (red) are my favorites. There's a minor annoyance buying from Amazon however: This time, the thin cardboard box arrived crushed, and the tube of cream inside was badly dented. Since it wasn't punctured, and won't prevent dispensing all the product, I won't be returning it. But especially since it's happened with previous purchases, and is a common problem reported in reviews, Amazon should stop shipping easily crushed items (like non-rigid boxes) in envelopes, even padded ones.",

                "reviewText": "I went back to wet shaving (from a Braun electric razor) early this year. After 30 years of shaving almost every day with the electric, I retired and now only shave 2-3 times a week. Electric just didn't work for that. After a few months with seveal different multiblade razors, I wasn't satisfied. In July, a started using a DE razor. For reference I use a Viking with the slightly longer handle. After a few weeks of shaving, getting my technique down and testing several popular blades, I have settled on, and regularly use Feather blades. I have used the standard Proraso tube, as well as this one, Cremo, and Taylor of Old Bond Steet St. James collection in a tub. I have come to prefer the Taylor.I still give this 5 stars overall. If there were 1/2 stars, I might take 1/2 off, but only COMPARATIVELY to the Taylor (maybe fairer to say Taylor would get a 5+). This creme has a very nice fresh smell and is supposed to be easier on the skin. I am not sure I see any difference from the regular Proraso Cream. It lathers well with a brush and lubricates reasonbly well. But the lather doesn't last well. I find that by the time I finish one side of my face the remaining lather nas thinned out and dried some and I have to constantly re-lather. But that is not a huge deal. The TOB lather lasts much longer, and lubricates better in my opinion. For tube cream users I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. I really like the Proraso products and use their aftershave and a couple of their colognes regularly now.",

                "reviewText": "WINNING!Razor burn sucks! Short of perhaps getting eaten by a shark that walks on land and breathes air or gouging one's eyes out with a dull plastic spork, it is without question the worst thing in the history of time that can happen to a man.While we often think about how the razor and aftershave affects razor burn, we sometimes do not consider the middle part...the cream/gel/foam. This intermediate can play a big role...it can lubricate the razor (or increases resistance), moisturize the skin (or dry it out), open up pores (or clog them), increase the cutting efficiency of the razor (or negatively impact it), etc.Proraso is probably best known for their aftershaves, which are fantastic. However, this Shaving Cream is something you certainly do not want to pass up on either. Their Shaving Cream is just as much a moisturizer as it is a shaving cream, which may be why this stuff works so well. Obviously, shaving itself drys out skin, and dry skin=irritation. This shaving cream contains some serious ingredients to keep the skin from drying out, and when you finish up and rinse the area off, you do not get that uncool radiating feeling of irritation that you may with other products. It also contains something that keeps the razor well-lubricated, and helps stop it from shaving \"too low\" to a point where severe razor burns follows...but at the same time, it gives a super close shave regardless of what kind of razor you use.So, if our discussions about shaving generally include the topics of:--Getting the closest shave possible,--Reducing/preventing as much irritation (razor burn) as possible, and--Moisturizing skin to prevent irritation that comes from dry skin,then using a good razor, this Shave Cream, and following it up with Proraso aftershave lotion will leave you amazed how well the above goals can be accomplished.I agree with those who say you can use your hands to work the lather (I generally do), but also agree it works better with a brush.",
