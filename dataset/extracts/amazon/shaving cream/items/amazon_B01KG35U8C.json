I have sensitive skin and had a hard time shaving every day with cheap foam and gel stuff. With this product I don\u2019t even have to use very much and I can shave every day with no problem. Some say to expensive. Not at all!! I use to purchase this when it was being carried at Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom\u2019s, Sephora majority of the big department stores and it sold for $20 and when to $28 before the pulled the product from all retailers. I can only purchase online now which fine especially for the price. Even if I paid $28 or when I did. I could shave everyday and this would last me about 5 months. Now if you use the cheap $3 maybe $4 now at the store. That stuff you have to pack it on and it goes so quickly that you replenish that at least twice a month. Now that\u2019s 5 month using two per month at $4 a piece that\u2019s $8 a month times 5 months that\u2019s $40. I spend $12 less and I get a better product.",

If someone tells you there's no such thing as inflation - like my idiot friend - then, I would reasonably expect it to be $20 after 55 years. But, no, the last time I bought it through Amazon was two months ago and it was $25. In two months, the amount went down and the price is now $46 !!! It's the best, but it's not worth $46 bucks! I've bought my last, at least through Amazon. I find this outrageous (and doubt that this review will see the light of day).",
