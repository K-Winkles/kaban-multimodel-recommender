It does not lather up like a regular soap or shaving cream but I actually prefer that when shaving the bikini area, that way you can see better. This gives me the closest shave I\u2019ve ever gotten before and if need be you can shave over one spot more than once and still no irritation. I\u2019m also very sensitive to soaps in general so I\u2019ve always had to use the most basic of basic soaps and shaving creams out there which for the most part seem to be garbage. I absolutely love this shave cream! I even use it to shave my legs from time to time and it\u2019s amazing, just depends if you want to use up your product faster. Then I always follow it up with the After Shower Spray which you\u2019ll never guess\u2026. Is Amazing also. I\u2019ve skipped the spray before just to see what the difference would be and it\u2019s not terrible because the shave gel works so well but the spray definitely soothes those sensitive areas and feels nice once you apply it. I also use the spray on my legs after shaving with of without using the shave gel prior and I never have razor burn. Totally recommend these two products.",

                "reviewText": "The shaving cream works great. Extremely gentle and non-irritating on the skin, even down there. The after shave spray also is non-irritating and feels soothing with a light lavender scent. The only thing is I personally didn\u2019t see a difference with ingrown hairs or bumps disappearing or going down after using the spray. It definitely feels nice to use though after shaving \ud83e\ude92",
