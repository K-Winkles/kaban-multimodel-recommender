                "reviewText": "I grow a beard during the cooler months, and I prefer to have clean, defined beard lines. I purchased this after visiting the barber and realizing they use a clear shave gel to see what they're doing - no more guessing!I pair this with a beard shaping tool (mine was purchased branded as Beard Ninja, but there's lots of clones out there that do the same thing) and a double-sided safety razor. Combined with those two things, I have the cleanest beard lines ever!This product smells great and provides a great glide. I usually wash my face with Clean & Clear, pat dry, then while my face is slightly damp I'll fill my palm with a FULL pump. That full pump is enough to cover my entire face.My *only* slight complaint is I feel I may use more of this product compared to shave foam, since the foam expands so much and you always feel like you have more than you need. With this product, you might pump it a few more times but you're able to only use what you need, though you may end up purchasing it more often. \u200bI liked it so much that I purchased another set as a gift for a buddy of mine and he loves it too! Highly recommend and will purchase again.",

Unfortunately nothing I tried would give me a nice smooth shave without any razor burn, irritation or bleeding, until I found Mane Tame! This shaving gel is thicker than your average shaving cream (which for me is a good thing) and doesn\u2019t foam up and stays clear so you can easily see where you are shaving or need to line up your beard/mustache. Also it smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft after. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or anyone who want to try something different than regular shaving cream.",

                "reviewText": "I used this product for the first time today with my straight razor and wow...what a difference. The smell and texture is really good. Right now I am using the gel with my straight razor to line my mustache and sideburns. I am happy to note that I got no nice or cuts. This really worked well with my straight razor because it is clear and I could see what I was doing. That and because the gel forms a \u2018shield or protective surface\u2019 between the blade and my skin and allowed the razor to glide across those areas. I am a beginner with the straight razor so trust me when I say I needed some forgiveness. I did not get that ease of use with my other fine shave soaps/creams.The gel left a refreshing feeling at the end of the shave. My skin felt healthy and smooth.",
