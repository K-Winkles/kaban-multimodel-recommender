                "reviewText": "I actually stumbled across this shave butter by accident as I had been using another manufacturer shave butter, and was very pleased with it, but ended up buying this as a one off. Though the package says it\u2019s a shave butter, its consistency and appearance is more of a clear slime. Don\u2019t be discouraged by this, in my opinion, it\u2019s actually a much better shave. Years ago I used a shave gel made to wet shave in the shower, that was just a slime that wouldn\u2019t lather up. It was the best shave of my life. The dollar shave club shave butter is the closest to that experience I\u2019ve come since. The clear slime offers less material to clog up the razor and allows the razor to glide smoothly over the hair without matting it down. My recommendation is periodically splashing water on your face to keep it from drying up during the shave.",

                "reviewText": "Thinner out of the tube than my previous shave butter, yet it provides more defense against nicks and is more moisturizing despite my tendency to hit most areas 2 or 3 times from different bangles. I do not have to use quite as much for the first application and no longer have to reapply which was not uncommon with other brands I have tried. It has a slightly medicated aroma that some might find displeasing. I prefer it to a more tropical scent of one of the brands I have tried. I give it 5 stars. The slightly thinner feel also works better with my electric razor when I feel like skipping the blade that day. Never had success with an electric until I found this shave butter because electric shavers rub my face raw. This product has changed my routine since I can mix it up & not have to use a blade every day.",

This is the best shave cream I have ever used and I have been shaving for 48 years. I don't care what kind of razor you use you will not get a better, smoother, closer, cleaner, shave. It also softens up your skin and the thick patch at the edge of my neck and face is smooth as a baby's behind. Would give it 6 stars if I could...",

                "reviewText": "I used to use Dollar Shave Club products for years. They were affordable and effective. Unfortunately, since the company was sold, the quality of their products has suffered. The gel is not as thick or slick as the original formula. You also won't get as good of a shave. The only thing that's a plus is that it's still translucent which allows you to shave and shape your beard line. I would not recommend this or any Dollar Shave products anymore.",
