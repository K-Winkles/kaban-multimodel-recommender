                "reviewText": "(I originally posted this review on Badger & Blade, an outstanding website devoted to old-school shaving) Taconic Shave LIME Shaving Cream with Organic Oils - 4 oz. - MADE IN THE USA While looking for a quality shaving cream or soap for summer use, I discovered Taconic Shave Tequila Lime Shaving Cream with Organic Oils. I'll call it Taconic Lime from here on out. The reviews on Amazon.com and other sites were extremely positive, though the number of reviews was small. I love lime, the ingredients are organic, and the price was reasonable, so I pulled the trigger.The scent is natural and refreshing -- mostly lime, but with a hint of Tequila. The \"cream\" itself is so hard that is should not be called a cream. It is not hard like a soap, however; it is truly a paste. There was a tiny amount of separation of the ingredients, with a small amount of liquid resting on a crust of firm paste. I just broke the moist crust with my index finger and stirred the mixture, leaving everything mixed and smooth. The cream worked beautifully for me, so it was a non-issue. Other reviewers had a problem with this, so I decided to include it.Then, I went through my normal shower and face preparation, wet my badger brush with hot water, squeezed it out, and twirled it around the surface of the Taconic Lime Shave Cream until a little of the cream stuck the tip.It does not take very much -- at all -- to whip up an excellent lather with Taconic Shave Lime. It took a few strokes more than with Proraso or Art of Shaving, but the lather is moist, rich, thick, and slick. It is closest in consistency to Mitchell's Wool Fat, but slicker -- and more moisturizing.The lather felt so protective that I made one more pass than usual, ending in a Baby-Butt-Smooth shave! I left no nicks or abrasions behind. The lime scent is pleasantly strong during the shave itself, but lingers barely above the surface when the shave is done.Taconic Shave Lime rinsed easily in warm water. After a quick pass of alum and application of Art of Shaving aftershave balm, my face felt excellent. Refreshed, moisturized, but not greasy.I will use the shaving creams & soaps I've used before as points of comparison during this review: D.R. Harris Marlborough, Mitchell's Wool Fat (under the Kent label), Art of Shaving Sandalwood, Proraso original, Proraso Sandalwood, and Spencer & Devon Sagebrush.D.R. Harris Marlborough provides rich, thick lather and an extremely close shave, but leaves my skin feeling slightly dry. Taconic Lime gives an equally close shave, but with a richer, thicker lather and a far more moisturized face.Art of Shaving and Proraso products give a similar lather -- and nearly as much moisturization. However, they require more product than Taconic Lime does. To be clear, though, Taconic Lime provides the best moisturization of any shaving cream I have ever used. It is quite remarkable.Taconic Lime lather is also similar in consistency and performance to Spencer & Devon Shaving Cream (which will be the subject of a review in the near future). Both yield outstanding results, and both moisturized my face better than I could have hoped. The Taconic Lime made slightly thicker lather -- and had slightly more lubrication. To be fair, though, I have only used the Spencer & Devon cream a few times, and I have not yet perfected my lathering technique with it. That part of the review may change once I dial in my technique with the Spencer & Devon.Quibbles:There is only one aspect of the product that could use improvement. The opening of the plastic jar is quite small -- smaller than the diameter of my medium-sized badger brush. Though I can presently twirl the top of my brush in the cream, once I use some up, I'll have to scoop a small amount out with my finger and transfer it to the brush. I'd like to see a jar similar to that made by Art of Shaving, which uses a larger container with a smaller scooped-out part inside so that all of the product is easily accessible to the brush. A minor quibble, to be sure, but a fair one.All-in-all, Taconic Shave Tequila Lime Shave Cream is a superior product in all ways. It provides a shave on par with the best products I have used -- and at an excellent price. In addition, I require less product per use than products of similar quality, and Taconic Shave Lime provides the best moisturization of any shaving product I have used.",

                "reviewText": "I am very disappointed in this product. The \"cream\" is so hard that I had to add water to the container and stir it with a wood stick -several times- and I still have to scoop the cream out with my finger and put it on my shave brush. It never makes a rich lather in any way and leaves the brush stiff and gummy feeling. The only positive thing is it smells pretty good. I am ordering the Art of Shaving brand of cream asap and throwing this in the trash as soon as it arrives. I have used that brand several times, it's more expensive, but it only takes tiny dab on the tip of the brush to work up a thick, rich lather.I gave it very one star because I can't give it a zero rating.",

                "reviewText": "I've been on the look for a new shave regiment, and this was part of the three-piece set I picked out (for the other two parts, see my reviews on the Clubman Pinaud Bay Rum Aftershave and Dreadnought Preshave Oil). I was very interested in the bay rum scent, as I've heard a lot of people give the scent such rave reviews.The scent for this shave cream is very subtle, but is a nice, sweet smell. It is not overpowering in the least, and depending on your aftershave, you probably won't even know it was there when you're done. I wouldn't describe it as a 'tropical' note, much more of a spiced scent. It makes me think of Christmas more than the Caribbean. That is not to say I couldn't see this as an all-year scent, but some people may find it to be a Fall-Winter scent, and trade off for something lighter in the rest of the year. Living in NY, I have a long rotation for Fall-Winter, anyway.I did pick up a bay rum-scented aftershave just for the purpose of reinforcing the scent when I was done.As for the cream itself, it's a nice, dense cream that lathers equally well in the hand as I'm sure it does with Taconic's recommended method of a shave brush. The number one question probably most people are going to have is 'how long does it last?' I ordered mine on January 10th of this year, I shave on average 3-5 times a week, and I'm not even halfway done with the jar. At the current rate I'm going, it would probably last easily 4 months. I also lather twice, in that I go with the grain the first time, re-lather, and go against for a cleaner shave, so if you're a brush user, you'd get even longer out of this product. Even just lathering by hand, I'm only using enough later to cover about a finger pad, add a little water, and rub in circular motions on the face.The cream is a coconut oil base, with natural ingredients and glycerin added for scent and foaming action. There is a bit of glycol in the list, but it's near the end, however it still can't be called 'alcohol free,' but most higher-end shave creams have some form of alcohol in them.The only issue I have with the cream is that it does dry out very quickly; usually after 2 days of non-use, there's a less-moist layer on top. It doesn't dry out completely, but if I use what's on top, I get decidedly less lather. It's an easy fix; I just dampen a finger and stir it up a bit. This is very common with creams that come in a tub like this, but it doesn't usually happen so fast.The Taconic cream is a great value, and beats out a lot of the competition that are selling their stuff for almost double what I paid here on Amazon (14$ at time of order). I think it's equal to, if not better than, Art of Shaving shave cream. I haven't tried Jack Black for comparison, and I doubt I will unless they stop making this cream, because I am absolutely hooked.",
