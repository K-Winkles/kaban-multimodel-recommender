It showed up two hours later. Thankfully the product was in the bag. I decided to get a small bottle of seduction coochy. The smell is interesting because I\u2019m not sure if I like it although I do love the brand. Will have to try it and then post an update. It may need to be an emergency back up to the other one I have from a friend if I do not end up liking it.",
