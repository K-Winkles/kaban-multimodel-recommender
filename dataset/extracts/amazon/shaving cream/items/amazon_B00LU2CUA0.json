For background, I\u2019ve been wet shaving for over 10 years. I\u2019ve tried many of the English shaving creams, which are all great too. I\u2019ve also used the sandalwood and bourbon scented shaving creams from the popular store that is in many malls here in the US. With the experience of using all those others, I was ready to try something new. The descriptions and other reviews of this one were attractive so I thought, \u201cwhy not?\u201c It didn\u2019t disappoint. In addition to everything stated, it comes in a beautiful jar, and a little shaving cream goes along way. This jar looks like it\u2019s going to last quite a while.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a lot of different shaving creams and soaps over the years, Crabtree & Evelyn soap, Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, L'Occitane en Provence Cade cream, but this time, one of my favorites, the Cade cream was out of stock and had been for some time, so I went looking for another. I found this St. James of London Cedarwood and Clarysage cream and I'm glad my previous cream was out of stock. I'll stick with this one for as long as I can.One thing I noticed, right away, is how concentrated this shave cream is. A very tiny dab at the end of a wet brush (perhaps a dime size dab if your using your hands instead of a brush) gave me great lasting lather, that also smells great and makes my skin feel good afterwards. I use Thayer's alcohol-free witch hazel as an after shave. I highly recommend this shave cream. Seems the Brits know how to make it best.",

In my opinion, this product is tied with the Cremo brand for best shaving performance. Fragrance intensity is subtle, tied with Cremo, less than TOBS. I really like the scent of this product, but not everyone is a fan of all things cedar (their loss). I really like the solid feel of the heavyweight glass jar. Probably not the lightest thing to take when traveling, though.",
