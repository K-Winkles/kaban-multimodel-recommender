But alas, this was just a run-of-the-mill shaving cream with a different smell and no menthol kick. After years of searching several countries for menthol shaving cream, I have the answer. Barbasol produces it's menthol shaving cream for a foreign customer and keeps some in the US warehouse to sell to us old people who still want it. You can buy a case from Rochell at 1-800-841-3221. This is the result of three years of hunting for menthol shaving cream! Life is good",
