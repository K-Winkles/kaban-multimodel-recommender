When I used it I was impressed by how my Razor was gliding across my cheeks and neck especially my neck area because that usually feels like I am ripping up wings with a backhoe in reverse no matter what razor I'm using or gel on shaving with but this stuff was as if I had butter or oil across my skin without the texture. And also didn't get greasy or sticky and when I was finished I did not need to apply aftershave moisturizing cream like I've had to do ever since I was in niddle school. I've been shaving since the 6th grade and have been getting ripped off on expensive products the entire time I'm now 40 this product feels like I came up on the company that made it because it was very cheap and gets the job done better than I could have ever expected.",

I still ended up still slicing myself with the razor even though this stuff claims to prevent cuts and puts a \"protective barrier\" which it clearly doesn't. The only positive is my skin is very soft from the shave and I didn't react to it. That's about it. I wouldn't recommend as I still cut myself despite the advertising suggesting it wouldn't do that.",
