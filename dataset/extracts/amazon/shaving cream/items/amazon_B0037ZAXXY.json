However, even though both gels and foams are effective at giving you a comfortable shave, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel contains hydrating emollients and lubricating ingredients. By helping to lock in moisture and soften facial hair, you get smoother razor glide and less tugging of the hair for a more comfortable shave versus Gillette foam. What is the difference between shaving with shave gel and shaving with soap and water? Shave gel tends to be less drying than ordinary soap and water and won\u2019t clog your razor the way soap can. Shave gels help retain skin moisture, making hair easier to cut. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel is available in several varieties. How does 2-in-1 shave gel with skin care work? 2-in-1 shave gel with skin care has three effective lubricants, which enhance razor glide for a smooth, comfortable shave that helps protect your skin against nicks, redness, and tightness. What is a clean-dispense actuator? The clean-dispense actuator allows you to lock the gel actuator closed by turning the head into the locked position. This prevents excess gel from being extruded, resulting in a cleaner canister and less waste. What is a gel gauge?
