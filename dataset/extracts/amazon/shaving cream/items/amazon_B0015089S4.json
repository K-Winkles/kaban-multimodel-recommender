                "reviewText": "I have been using Kiss My Face fragrance free moisture shave cream for about 8 years, but it is no longer available.I have been searching for a fragrance-free replacement and have read many reviews on several websites.I have been shaving in the shower for 53 years and it's the last thing I do after washing my hair and body. By then my whiskers are soft and my face is wet.Two products seemed to match my fragrance-free criteria. Alba Botanica Very Emollient Cream unscented and Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel with Oat and Vitamin E no scent added. The cost on Amazon Prime is about $.57/oz for each.I loaded a new blade into my Gillette Fusion Power Razor and shaved half my face with each product.The results were equally as good. In fact, much better than the Kiss My Face. You only need small amounts of product and they should last a long time. Each left my face soft, smooth and without irritation.Rinsing the blade in the shower was not a problem, however, the Alba did take longer to rinse, and I can see where it would be more difficult to rinse in the sink.Alba does contain lavender and it is delectable so while it is technically fragrance free it does have a scent.I highly recommend both products and give a slight edge to the Aveeno.",

The cream is thick, doesn't run, and only a tiny bit is required to shave both legs. My husband also likes it for his face, but perhaps a little less than I do. The consistency is different from other products, and if you're used to a foam, this is going to take a little getting used to.",

I would say that it feels almost more lotion-like than typical shaving cream.

                "reviewText": "I've seen a lot of complaints about this product in the reviews. However, I have been using it for a few years and really like it. First, it is very moisturizing so you do not need to soften your beard first with hot water. A little room temperature or cold water works fine.Second, you only need to spread a thin layer for it to work. It's a bit messy so every few strokes, I wipe off the excess into a tissue. If you do that it will not clog up the razor too much.I get a good shave from it and best of all, it is quick. As long as you wash your face afterwards, you'll be good to go.I buy the unscented because the Mango-Vanilla and Coconut-Lime are both horrible! The scents are overpowering and crude, like a really cheap perfume. I really liked the Aloe-Mint scent, but sadly that one seems to have been discontinued. If Alba is reading this, please bring back the Aloe-Mint, or come up with new, better scents,. Please. Thanks!",
