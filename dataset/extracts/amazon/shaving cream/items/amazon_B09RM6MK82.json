                "reviewText": "I bought this pack of Gillette razor blade refills because I wanted to try both the Fusion5 and the Pro Glide blades. I have been using them for a few weeks now and I am very satisfied with the quality and performance of these blades. They give me a smooth and comfortable shave every time, without any irritation or cuts. The lubrication strip helps to glide the razor over my skin and the precision trimmer is great for edging and shaping my beard. The blades are easy to install and fit all Gillette 5-blade handles. They also last for a long time; I can get up to a month of shaves with each refill. I think this is a great deal for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a premium shaving experience.",
