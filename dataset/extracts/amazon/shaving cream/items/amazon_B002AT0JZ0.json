                "reviewText": "I just recently made the plunge into the world of \"Real\" wet shaving using a DE Safety razor. I did a lot of reviewing of products before I bought. From everything I read I knew I wanted to get a Best Badger brush 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White & Chrome Handle with Free Stand From Parker Safety Razor and a good shaving cream. After doing the research on and off of Amazon I decided to give the Taylor of Old Bond Street a try as my first good shaving cream. After much debating I choose the almond scent.I found this shaving cream to be easy to lather. I'll explain how I form the lather later in this review. It goes on nicely and seems to work well for my face. The almond smell is nice but light. I would personally like it to have a slightly stronger scent. But I do like that it wears off quickly and does not conflict with my aftershave. Moving from the world of spray can foams, I think this cream is wonderful.This is my first brush on shaving cream so I don't have allot to compare this too. But this shaving cream does it's job and the cost seems reasonable. I would recommend at least giving this shaving cream a try. I plan on trying a few other scents in this line. I also plan on trying a few soaps. But I think the bar has been set high by starting with this cream.How I make a good lather: I did a bunch of research on how to create a good lather with a cream. After that research I found it was actually very easy. And this method works like a charm with this cream.1) Prior to showering in the morning I run the sink to get the hottest water I can. I then fill a ceramic (non-white) bowl with hot water, then put the bowl in the sink and fill the sink to the top of the bowl. I then put my brush and razor in the bowl to soak while I shower.2) After showering I pull the bowl from the sink (leaving water in sink) and dump the water from the bowl (back into the sink). I just pour out the bowl and do not dry it.3) Shake your wet brush a few times to knock off the surface water. Just a few times will do it. When done you shouldn't have any visible drops on the outside of the brush.4) Dip the brush into the tub of cream making contact and pressing down slightly. Then spin the brush 2 full rotations and remove from tub. A little goes a long way here. You can always add more if needed later. You should see a small amount of cream on the tips of all the hairs.5) Swirl brush in bowl in one direction. I go clockwise. Perhaps those south of the equator would go counter clockwise :). Every 10th or so swirl pump the brush once or twice. Repeat until you get a good lather. If you don't start getting a good lather (to thin) in 30ish swirls, spin brush one more time in the cream tub and then continue swirling.I've found this method to be foolproof and gives you a warm and wonderful cream. There is a possibility that you get too much cream versus water with this method. It hasn't happened to me, but if it does (super stiff or chunky) then just wet your fingers in the sink and sprinkle a little water in the bowl. It's likely that different types/quality of brushes could require more or less spinning in the bowl. You'll get the hang of how many times to spin and how hard to press after a few shaves. Remember when spinning the brush in the bowl less is really more.",

                "reviewText": "I have always had at least minor irritation from shaving, and I never found a razor that I truly liked despite having tried all kinds of Mach 3, Quattro, Fusion, etc. multiple-blade razors. I decided to give a try going back to safety razor shaving after having read lots of blogs about how much better it was than standard disposable offerings from the drug store.I bought a cheap safety razor to get started, and bought some Israeli blades from Ebay (with a reputation as being \"the best\" all around blades). No matter what I did, something was never right and I was constantly tearing my face up and leaving more blood dripping than I've ever had before with a disposable razor. I knew there was something I wasn't doing right, so I put the last essential items in place by ordering a Parker badger hair brush and this Lavender shave cream from Amazon.THIS IS WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS - JUNK SHAVE CREAM! All I can say for a simple recommendation is for men to THROW AWAY all the gel goop that you are buying from CVS or Walgreens. All that shave cream from a can is complete GARBAGE compared to this stuff. I'm certainly no professional at shaving, but I managed to use the badger brush to take a dime-sized dab of cream from the pot and lather it into a decent volume of cream. Putting this stuff on my face was great aromatherapy and it 100% smoothed out my shaving. With a new blade in the razor I got one of the best shaves I've ever had with ZERO cuts on my face. There were a couple times when the cream would dry out a bit but all I had to do was take a small dab of water from the sink on the tip of the brush to wet my face again and it was perfect again.I can't recommend this shave cream enough to potential buyers, even to guys who will continue to use the drugstore disposable razors. This is about $12 for a good-sized pot of shave cream and only the smallest dab is needed to make enough lather to cover the entire face for two or more coverages of a shave. I can easily see this pot of cream lasting 2-3 months which is about the length of time that I would go through 3 or 4 cans of Barbasol or other shave gel. Given that those \"premium\" shave gels from Schick or Gillette sell for $3-4 a can you are talking spending about the same amount of money on this shave cream and getting a BETTER SHAVE. BUY THIS INSTEAD - there is no reason not to.My only complaint was packaging - the plastic pot came inside a clear plastic bag from Amazon. When I opened the bag the pot of shave cream was wet and slimy as if the container had leaked a bit before being sent to me. Since Amazon packaged it in a plastic bag before putting it in the box I can only assume that most or all of the items leak a little bit in transit, so this must be standard for this item. I simply rinsed the container off in the sink and it was fine, but I still didn't quite expect it to arrive like it did. I would give this a 4.75 star review if I could but the benefits of this shave cream make me round up to 5 stars instead of down to 4.",
