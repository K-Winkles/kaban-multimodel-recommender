My face feels as smooth as a newborn baby's cheeks after shaving with this cream. However, the only flaw of this product that I've observed is that it can cause a slight skin irritation (a mild burning sensation) if I don't wash my face off immediately after a shave. That said, there has not been any facial appearance changes (e.g. skin rashes, redness) due to the aforementioned irritation, & as long as I wash my face or shower right away, I can easily avoid any irritation.Bottom line - I'm still highly satisfied with the purchase, I think I finally found a shaving cream that gives me the best looking & most comfortable shave, & I'll likely make this my default shaving cream.",

It's completely clear when it goes on, which I don't prefer, but rubbing it in a bit turns it white enough to have some contrast. It is very slick and helps the blade move smoothly but unlike some others out there, doesn't leave any oily residue on my hands or face. I'd make this my go-to if it wasn't for the crazy high price. So instead, I'll keep a bottle around for special occasions.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is great! Quick background, I have thick hair and sensitive skin, so finding products that work has been a journey. Cremo is great, but I found I had to use a ton of it for good results. Now this Marlowe shave cream with Prorasso pre-shave cream, Personna Med-Prep Blades, and a Viking Blades Emperor Augustus razor is about as good as it's gotten for me so far.Tube will probably last a while. I use about a quarter-sized dollop. Make sure to lather it up a bit, but you definitely don't need a brush.",
