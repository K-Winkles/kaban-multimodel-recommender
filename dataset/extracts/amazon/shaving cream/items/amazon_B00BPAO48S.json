                "reviewText": "I've been using a soap and brush for my shaves for over 20 years, prior to that I used the canned gels and foams. I've tried a pretty good variety over that period of time. I can say that Taylor of Old Bond Street products rank quite high on my list of quality products.The grapefruit scent is a very strong, vibrant, \"pure\" grapefruit aroma. It really smells as if you had just cut a ripe grapefruit open and squeezed it. Unfortunately, after the shave is done and the face is rinsed, the scent doesn't linger on my skin. Some people may report some longevity, but most citrus scents just don't seem to linger on my skin. ( After my first shave with this, I splashed on some Lucky Tiger aftershave, and had a few moments of rich citrus bliss, that sadly faded all too quickly.)From a technical standpoint, this cream performs similarly to the other Taylor of Old Bond Street creams that I've used. That is: very rich and creamy lather that is easy to produce with a brush. I use a boar brush and face lather, and after a few swirls of the brush on top of the cream, I was able to quickly whip up a dense lather on my face. I use a DE razor, so I really prefer to have a soap/cream with good slickness to it, and ToOBS is always a safe bet in that regard. After the shave, this rinses off easily, and leaves the skin feeling good.I find this to be an above-average shave cream, the scent is quite nice, and the performance is top-notch. I will purchase again, and will recommend to others.**** The following information was not factored in with the above review, as it is a reflection on the seller, not the product itself. I know that there is a place for \"seller reviews\" but I want to make sure that as many people as possible see this so that they can be informed of possible issues.My tub of shave cream was purchased from the seller \"eSource\" and handled by Amazon. When the tub arrived, it was not sealed in any manner. There was no leakage in the shipping box, though. When I opened the tub, it sure seemed like an awful lot of container for such a small amount of product. As I stated in my review above, I've used ToOBS products before. I know that product is packed by weight, not volume, usually, and that some companies will put shave soaps/creams in big containers to leave room to lather. This seemed off to me, though, so I weighed my tub. I have access to certified/calibrated scales at my workplace, and my tub weighed in at under 4oz., inclusive of tub. The container specs 5.3oz. of product. This is a significant difference, in my opinion. Did I receive a return, or was this a filler error? Either way, this should not have shipped to me as a new product.I contacted Amazon through the standard \"return item\" protocol on the order page and listed my issue, and they refunded a portion of the purchase price. There was no discussion with me about anything, and it's practically impossible to actually talk to anybody, just a generic email that said, \"we refunded X amount to your account, sorry blah blah blah\".The seller never responded to me.Overall, I'm just very disappointed with the experience, despite being very happy with the actual product. I know that this is the danger of internet shopping vs. brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon is usually on-point, but this one slipped through the cracks.So, if you receive a tub of this that seems peculiar, do yourself a favor and weigh it. Get the amount of product that you paid for! This isn't the first item that I've received that I have suspected of being a returned product which is why I'm taking the time to write all of this out.I hope this helps somebody.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased as a gift, so can't speak to how it feels on the skin, but it smells as close to a ripe Grapefruit as anything I've found. Fruity products typically smell fake, or stale or are mixed with other things that totally overpower the fruit, but not this. It's Grapefruit and just Grapefruit. It's strong enough to be enjoyable but not so strong that it offends. 4 stars only because I can't speak to how it feels on the skin.",
