                "reviewText": "I am have been wet shaving for 12 years. I have used all types of soaps and creams for my daily routine. I find it easier to use a canned foam spray for shaving other body parts. I decided to give this a shot because I like the Proraso shaving soap. It feels very similar to whipping up your own lather with their soap products. It also has the same scent as their other products. There are 2 negatives.1. The can is WIDE. I have used other canned foams in the past and this is the widest one of them all. I could not store it in my normal location. I had to store it under the sink rather than my medicine cabinet.2. The foam is not thick like other brands. I find that I use more foam when shaving than I was expecting.If you are a Proraso user and like their soap then I recommend using this option if you are looking for ready made product.",

Works well with cartridge razors, but not so much with safety razors. It\u2019s so thick it\u2019ll clog up your blade real fast, especially if you have a thick beard. A gel would work better. I sometimes water it down and use a brush. What I like best is that it matches my Proraso aftershave. I prefer it when I don\u2019t have to wear conflicting fragrances.",
