                "reviewText": "I originally decided to try Proraso after Esquire Magazine endorsed it. I had been a big fan of Noxzema's Menthol shaving cream (in the classic blue can) but sadly that became harder and harder to find and I believe it has been discontinued. Barbasol has/had a menthol option but I was not impressed with it. I was a bit apprehensive at first due to the price but after the first week I was completely converted. The Proraso is not quite as strong in terms of menthol as the classic Noxzema was but it is by no means subtle and I suspect that if you are a menthol fan (like myself) you will be more than satisfied. I would give it 5 stars based solely on the quality of the shave and skin feel but I was pleasantly surprised by two other aspects of the product. First, as other reviewers have mentioned, you only need a small dollop of this stuff to get a good shave. I shave almost every day and my original can has lasted over 10 months. Second, I do not know what kind of old world Italian magic Proraso is putting in this stuff but my skin has never looked or felt better. This was completely unexpected. It is not often when a product exceeds your expectations to such a high degree but I must say it is literally and figuratively refreshing.",

It's so rich and thick out of the spout, you only need a small dabberoo.I only shave once a week, so one can will literally last me for YEARS. (My previous can lasted 3 years and still had life in it when I bought this one) Paying 12 bucks for even a slightly better product than Gillette Foamy or a store brand is a no brainer over the long haul.I combine this shaving cream with the Henson safety razor and I actually ENJOY shaving now. Never had a better shave. My face feels 'alive' after I finish.",

                "reviewText": "The smoothest shaving cream I've ever used. I still use cremo & secret shave when i'm in a hurry but the Proraso Shaving Foam is a whole other level of smooth. It's now my go to. It feels great on your face & smooth as butter. I have a few other shaving bowls & creams but Proraso just works for me. I get an irritation free shave everytime despite having mildly sensitive skin. I use this method.After a shower & gentle face cleanser, i start with the Proraso Pre shave & a warm barbers towel let that sit on my face for a couple minutes. Next apply some of this great shaving foam, do a down pass, reapply for an up pass & check for anything i missed. Then i apply just a small amount for a 3rd & final light cleanup pass. Rinse with some cold water on my face & Dab (not wipe) with a dry towel before applying some Proraso aftershave. The one for sensitive skin works well but i really like the way the classic green line smells & performs. I never have irritation after i shave like this. And i always use a light facial moisturizer/lotion when i'm done shaving & use something with vitamin E under the eyes. 15 minutes & i'm confident & ready for the day. I can't say enough about this Shaving Foam. If you want to know what all the hype is about treat yourself to a great shave with a can of Proraso classic green Eucalyptus Shaving Foam. In a can, the tube or a bowl. They all work great but like that the can takes less time. Try it if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did and the can lasts a while so it's a good value too. Happy Shaving!",

                "reviewText": "Mit den Jahren habe ich ja so manchen, z. T. via Werbung hochgelobten, Rasierschaum gekauft und eingesetzt. Dabei waren diverse Sch\u00e4ume und Gele, mit ebenso diverser Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit in Sachen Auftragen, Gleitf\u00e4higkeit der Klingen und Hautgef\u00fchl nach vollendeter Rasur. Dieses Produkt hat mich restlos \u00fcberzeugt und ich frage mich, warum ist mir dieses Produkt nicht schon eher begegnet? Offenbar ist es nicht n\u00f6tig fett beworben zu werden, denn er spricht f\u00fcr sich selbst und wird daher mit Sicherheit gerne unter Freunden weiterempfohlen.Walnussgro\u00df auf die Hand gespr\u00fcht, l\u00e4sst er sich wunderbar leicht auf dem gereinigten Gesicht verteilen und bildet einen gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig d\u00fcnnen Schaumfilm. Die Klinge gleitet durch die Stoppeln wie durch warme Butter und der Teint erf\u00e4hrt eine belebende Frische, dank eines Hauchs von Menthol. Dabei erlebe ich die Rasur sehr schonend f\u00fcr die Haut, denn es bleibt kein Rasurbrand und die Haut trocknet auch nicht aus, nachdem ich sie mit einem Schwall kaltem Wasser von den Schaumresten befreit habe. Au\u00dferdem wei\u00df ich es zu sch\u00e4tzen, dass sich die Zwischenr\u00e4ume der Rasierklingen nicht so leicht zusetzten und verkleben, wie ich es leider, speziell bei der Verwendung von Rasiergel, h\u00e4ufig erleben musste.Fazit: Dieses kleine Highlight am Morgen kann ich nur empfehlen!",
