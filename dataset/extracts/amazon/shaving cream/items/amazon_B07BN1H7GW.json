Because it is non aerosol it is great for traveling. When flying, I simply squeeze out the Cremo into an approved TSA container.",

Despues de dar la primer pasada, usualmente es suficiente solo a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s agua con las manos para reactivar para la segunda lo cual ahorra tiempo y producto.La frescura que deja en la piel (y lo increiblemente suave que la deja!) es genial. Deja una sensaci\u00f3n de limpieza y comodidad en la cara, he notado que no es tan necesario el uso de un aftershave al usar Cremo ya que deja mi piel bastante bien y no irritada, ya que mi piel, principalmente el el bigote es bastante sensible.Definitivamente volver\u00e9 a adquirir este producto, posiblemente en otras fragancias, aunque este par de tubos me durar\u00e1 bastante tiempo ya que un poco sirve para mucho (posiblemente con el tama\u00f1o de dos monedas de $1 cubrir\u00eda toda mi cara incluyendo la barba hasta el cuello.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try this shaving cream after reading the reviews and I DID NOT regret it. I have been using Kiehl's Ultimate Brushless Shave Cream - White Eagle for many many years to shave my head and face but still was not 100% satisfied as I had to use quite a lot of product to achieve the desired clean shave, and I would still have problems shaving against the growth. Also it clogs up my razor and made it dull very quick, and its much more expensive ($18 for 5oz)Creemo shaves like a dream and I only used 1/2 (or less) than I previously used with Kiehl's. It does not clog up my blades which made them much easier to clean and last for a longer time. I also had very minimal razor burn and nicks, even with shaving against the growth. Not to mention I bought them for about $11.50 FOR 2 6oz TUBES!!!!Cheaper, last longer and does what it says. Am looking forward to trying the original and other fragrances. 10/10 Would repurchase and highly recommend!!",

I had the worst time trying to get a shave. The cream clogged up my razor so bad it took me about 5-minutes to jet-wash it from between the blade. i should have just thrown away the blade.So, because it was my bad I decided to give it another try. This time paying attention to the instructions that say to only put an almond-size squirt and use water to mix. Unfortunately, I had the same results...just lessor than before.With all the design and hype I feel the product missed on the essentials. The cream should never clog the blade and razor whereby rinsing alone does not dislodge the gunk.",
