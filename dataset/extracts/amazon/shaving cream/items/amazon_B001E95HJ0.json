I picked up two different ones one for him and one for me. Also gave one of each to my daughter for her and her husband. Have heard same from her. Since the husband also shaves his head and says that it definatly works well for preventing nicks and cuts from shaving. They are bothe very happy with how well they work.Feel nice goes on very evenly. After shaving the skin feels soft and moisturized. Nice and smooth better then before you shave definatly. Great for dry skin. Make both my skin and tattoos on my legs look and feel better after I get done shaving.Has a great scent so it also leaves a nice scent on your skin after you shave. As well as putting a nice scent that spreads out from the room after you shower.Glad I found this deal and chose to go for it. Hadn't actually bought shaving cream at all in quite awhile.Was needed for around here and daughter needed something so I searched til I found a good product and a great deal. I try to have things like this and soaps body washes shampoos conditioners around for any guests since I rent out rooms now and then. So always need to find a good deal and all that much better if it's a larger quantity.",
