                "reviewText": "This stuff smells awesome. It doesn't break out my sensitive skin. I gave four stars because, for the price, I was expecting more out of this shave syrup. I use the same amount of this as I would other shave gels/creams I tried. While it's a good product, I personally get the same results from some cheaper options. So I will finish using this syrup but will probably buy something else afterward.",

Typically once my legs are wet I\u2019ll just put a little bit in my hands and lather it on my legs. While you\u2019re shaving the suds do disappear BUT you don\u2019t need to add more unless you want - you can just continue to shave. It has a great scent and leaves my skin smooth.",
