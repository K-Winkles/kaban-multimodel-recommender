                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great even for MEN",
                "reviewText": "First off, I am a MAN and I have been using this product for years. This truly protects my skin better and makes the task of shaving easier than any of the other 'Men's Shaving Gels/Creams' I've tried over the years. I personally only shave my face/neck and intimate area, and this product does a fantastic job. I think the aroma is light and pleasant, but really only notice the aroma while shaving. Perhaps if I shaved more surface area regularly (legs and chest as well) then maybe the aroma would be noticeable afterwards and linger. The only scents I notice throughout the day come from my normal soap/body-wash and shampoo, whereas the shaving gel isn't even noticeable. There are a lot of user comments on both ends of the spectrum when it comes to scent. There is an ENORMOUS difference between something smelling awful, smelling awful on you, and/or being a scent that smells fine but you don't want to smell like it all day. I shave in the shower, and always rinse my face after shaving. I have never noticed a lingering scent, or residue on the skin left from shaving with this product. Most of the time there should be no noticeable difference having bought this in a store vs online. However, online orders tend to sit out on your deck for hours before being brought inside. If this was a t-shirt or the weather was always pleasant between 40-80F then it wouldn't matter. However, people leave this out for hours both during freezing cold temperatures and in scorching direct sunlight. Too long in the cold and you'll notice it's harder to get all the product out (even waiting plenty of time for it to acclimate before use). This contains a lot of different oils (sunflower seed oil glyceride, hydrogenated vegetable oil, fruit oil, and olive oil). When left in direct sunlight on a hot day, the ingredients can start separating and breaking down. This in turn can attribute to many of the comments about it coming out discolored, runny, altered fragrance, etc. Bottom line this is a real good product, just don't leave it outside too long during either extreme of the temperature spectrum.",

I'm always surprised when I splurge on some more and see what a difference it makes. Skintimate is what I've been using since I started shaving and it makes me feel very girly when I do. Smells good but not too strong. Lathers up very nice. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to keep the nozzle clean. And if you leave the jar in the shower for too long it starts to get rusty. But other than that, it's wonderful.",

                "reviewText": "By far, always the best shaving cream! I think if men knew about it they\u2019d use it! My son had to borrow mine once when visiting, and loved it as it never knocked him and made his face soft! I\u2019ve used this brand for 25-30 yrs and every time I e tried another brand, I regret it! I hate that the price has tripled in past 5 yrs, so I\u2019m always looking for sales and then stocking up! This shaving cream balloons up in your palm, so you only need a little for an entire leg! I haven\u2019t knicked anywhere in over a decade!!",
