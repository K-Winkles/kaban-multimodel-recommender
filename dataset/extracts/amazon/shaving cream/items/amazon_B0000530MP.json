                "reviewText": "As someone with very sensitive skin and curly hair that grows quickly, which is also prone to becoming ingrown, this is one of the first times that a shaving cream has been a sublime experience to use. All throughout my life shaving, at 41, after having tried a huge combination of shaving cream that\u2019s been marketed to Men, something had to change, and finding this was a blessing for multiple reasons. 1. It didn\u2019t cause me to have a rough shave, given that it\u2019s extremely soothing and it applies smoothly. 2. For the amount you get, the price is superb, coming in at less than Men\u2019s shaving cream, while still providing 3 more regular sized shaving cream gel cans. 3. The scent is a very neutral shea butter formula that doesn\u2019t cause any conflict with aftershave, or moisturizer.In every regard, that makes this product an easy 5 stars from a comfort and shaving perspective. Even with a multi blade razor, after rinsing my face with hypoallergenic soap and warm water to make shaving go much more smoothly, there aren\u2019t the usual small cuts that occur with any other shaving cream that I\u2019ve tried. Shaving doesn\u2019t feel like an ordeal anymore, so that\u2019s another definite plus. It\u2019s impossible not to highly recommend such a fantastic product.",

                "reviewText": "I love this shaving cream. It\u2019s the only one I can use that doesn\u2019t leave my legs irritated for days. I have to give it four stars thou because they have double the price and it\u2019s still continuing to rise every time I look at it. I get inflation, but the price is now almost triple what it used to be and unfortunately this is the only place it seems you can buy it.",
