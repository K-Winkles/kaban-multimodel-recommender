You just need the tip of a finger in it, spread that around, and super smooth creamy shave. I'm the person to just keep trying other stuff and always sure there's something better out there, but I've stuck to this for a few years now.The scent is nice, I prefer this to the amber, tho I prefer amber usually. It doesn't really linger, it's not a cologne, but it's pleasant to shave with. Washes off face and blade easily. Not much more I can think of to say, stuff just works and lasts a good long time.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to go a little \"old school\" with my shaving a few months ago. I had no intention of going straight blade, since I think Gillette nailed it with the Power Proglide Fusion. I stopped by the Art of Shaving store in the mall and was impressed with what I saw, so I decided to not experiment with other brands and go with this one. I couple of things:1) It definitely appears to be overpriced. I'll experiment with some other creams soon, and perhaps some soaps, but they all appear to cost much less than this one. Still, at just under $25 for, what, 6 months of shaving? That saves me money over what I was doing before with the canned stuff.2) I don't have sensitive skin - the only reason I wanted to try this was to, well, try it! I wanted to do the whole brush thing, and so far I've enjoyed the experience. However, this stuff REALLY makes my skin feel \"refreshed\" afterwards. I'm guessing that's because there there is less \"junk\" in it compared to the canned gels and creams.3) Someone wrote in one of the comments that the Sandalwood scent is too strong. No way. If you use this stuff correctly (a little dab on your brush, work up a lather, apply to face), you can barely smell the Sandalwood. I'd say the scent is perfect. If you rub gobs of this stuff on your skin, maybe it can be too powerful. I haven't tried.That's it! Why 4 stars and not 5? Well, I'm not BLOWN AWAY with the quality of the foam. That's probably my fault for not yet having dialed in the foam generation process, but that's how it goes. I mean, if it was idiot-proof from the get-go, it would be a 5.Oh yeah, because these creams don't have a lubricant like the canned stuff, you need a pre-shave oil. I also bought the Art of Shaving Sandalwood pre-shave oil, and I would absolutely recommend that. However, it is also pricey, so I will be making my own from now on (2 parts Castor Oil, 1 part olive oil, a dash of essential oils like sandalwood).",
