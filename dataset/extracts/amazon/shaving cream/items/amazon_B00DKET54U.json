                "reviewText": "I can't give this five stars ... yet, but I'm pretty sure that after a few more shaves, I probably will.This shave cream prepared my face and neck for a smooth, comforable shave, even though I was using a blade that had already been used a few times, and I was shaving a two day growth of beard.I only used a pea sized (or smaller) bit of the shave cream.After reading all the reviews, it seems obvious that most of the negative reviews came from users who didn't understand te product and expected a full, billowy lather like you get out of an aerosol can. They probably used way more than they needed in order to get this lather. This large amount may have clogged their blades, was difficult to rinse out of the blades, and produced a very strong scent. I can see how, operating on the assumption that it took a LOT of product to create a LOT of foam, the negative feedback was appropriate -- although the product was used incorrectlyThe goal of his cream, as I understand it, is to ceate the conditions necessary for a smooth, comforable shave. The goal wasn't to compete with Edge, Barbasol, Colgate or other aerosols that produce a lot of thick foam.I slapped warm water on my face to warm the skin and hair I put a small amount of shave cream in the palm of one hand, and spread it onto my face with the other hand. I put a litle water on my fingers and rubbed it in, producing a thin 'foamy' film. (Although I have a shaving brush, this didn't prodce a lot of laher for me). Once the cream was worked in, I shaved. The shave was smooth - possibly smooher than I got from other products. After shaving, the remaining product washed off, leaving no residual fragrance. THIS, I BELIEVE, was probably the right way to use this shave cream.So- after two shaves - I LIKE it. I may add more to this review after a few more shaves.---I've had this for a few months.I really like it.I started using more than a 'pea' sized bit of this shaving cream, and am able to get usable 'lather', just by speading it over my slightly warmed skin.The other day, after a week of no shaves, I used it again, not expecting great results. It spread well over my beard, created a nice lather, and the razor had no problems shaving my long whiskers off. Even with an old blade, the shave went very smoothly.I'll stay with this shaving cream - I'm not sure about the effects of caffeine on the quality of the shave, but the mint smell isn't overly strong and washes off, and the overall shaving experience with this shaving cream is good.",

First few shaves I felt it was a bit hard to get an even spread over my chin and neck, and my blades were gumming up. Then I got the hang of it:- Squeeze a small amount on one hand's fingers- Rub the fingers of both hands together to spread evenly on both hands fingers- Run some hot water, then pat the lotion your face ... dip fingers in hot water .. work it into a lather on your fingers and your face- When you shave, run the blades under the hot water a bit more than you would with commercial creamsBy using a small amount .. working up a lather using a bit of hot water ... and rinsing the blade a bit more often it works amazing. Smooth shave, pleasant scent and no toxic crap absorbing into your skin.AND you can make it last a long time following these tips. I'll order again \ud83d\udc4d",
