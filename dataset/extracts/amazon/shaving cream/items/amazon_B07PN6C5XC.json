                "reviewText": "I bought this in Nov. of 2020 and here it is July of 2021 and I have just finished one can! The reason I bought this was, I was in the hospital for heart surgery In nov. of 2020 and in the hospital had a great shaving cream with a great smell. I had been using a gel which had a smell I didn't like. After I got out of the hospital I went looking for a shaving cream like what I had there. I remembered from the old days barbasol. I am 77 years old.. and I seem to remember when I was young that this was a big item back in the day, and if I remember correctly Farah Fawcett was the model. Many of you won't even know who she is but she was considered one of the most beautiful women of that time. Anyway I thought I would give it a try and I was glad I did as not only has it performed fantastically , it smells great as well . A little goes a long way as you can see. One other big benefit I have found Is my razor is lasting as long as the shave cream. I have not changed blades in all this time! Unbelievable but true. I have the Gillette fusion and don't want really to use them because of the politics of the day . I use barbasol and dry my blade after using and I am still getting a great shave! Believe me or not, Barbasol is the reason. I sound like a company rep I know but this is a real review. try it you will love it.",
