                "reviewText": "I have atopic dermatitis (eczema) and shaving my legs is a big irritant if I don't really protect my skin (my shins are a problem area anyway). I have been using an eczema body wash from Eucerin to shave, but it's just so-so because it's a bit thin. Traditional shaving creams aggravate my skin sometimes, and I hate metal can rings left behind from the ones I have found that don't. This stuff is great! No metal can rings to stain my bathroom, and it provides great protection for a smooth shave; plus, it helps moisturize my skin! I shave every day, so I've been using this daily and the plaques on my shins have been much more manageable since I started. It doesn't cause any irritation (even though it does have a nice, light scent). I don't shave my bikini area (I wax because of ingrowns), but this is great for my underarms as well. I'm sure it's equally soothing for the bikini area.I am a convert. I will not shave with anything else in the future, and if you have eczema I definitely recommend giving it a try.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this for my bikini area, legs and armpits. I have to say, it\u2019s much better than what I have used previously.I normally use shave gel that gets foamy. My skin would be dry after using my usual product but this makes it feel moisturized.The scent is water lily and stays after you have rinsed it off. Although the title says you don\u2019t have to rinse off after using, I\u2019m already in the shower and it\u2019s habit to rinse off. BUT if you do decide to not rinse off, the smell is quite lovely.I\u2019ve noticed no nicks, irritation or razor bumps after shaving, particularly my armpits. If I shave with my normal shave gel and than use deodorant, it would occasionally burn but not with this. I was able to use deodorant with no ill effect.I had low expectations for this, because I figured all shaving creams/gels do the exact same thing but not this one. I would definitely recommend it!**Spouse used it on his head/face and he said it definitely felt like the shave was smoother than other gels he has used.**",

It is water lily scented. It has 24 hour moisturization. It contains aloe and shea butter.Trying it out:I used this twice in a week's time. I found this average to what other shaving creams offer.This is a cream style shaving cream. It isn't going to lather up and foam like others. This makes it easier to shave the bikini area.I like this style of shaving creams. My favorite brand is a cream style shaving cream also.On the bikini area, I used a brand new razor when using this cream. I found it moisturized well. It smells wonderful! It seemed the razor glided over the skin leaving my skin smooth.On the legs and under arms, I found it just as effective. The razor glided over my skin also leaving it smooth.In both cases, I can feel the extra moisturization.Next day, I did find I had some redness/bumps at the bikini area. I found I had no itchiness. Legs and under arms it worked great.4 stars:I switched to my favorite brand years ago when I saw the positive results. I find the Schick's version a good shaving cream. It worked well while shaving. I wish I had less redness/bumps after using though. I find it a great alternative to cans of shaving cream.",

I liked that there was no rinsing needed, and I just needed to rub in the excess. The second time I used it in the shower, on my legs and bikini area. I don\u2019t know what is in this that makes everything so smooth and bump-free, but that\u2019s what it does! It\u2019s been a couple of days since i shaved, and the area is still smooth.I thought it would be a lotion, based on the shape of the bottle, but it really does come out as a cream. Plus, since there is no metal can, no rusting of the container in the shower! It has a nice scent to it as well. It\u2019s a great product, and I will definitely be getting more when the bottles run out.",

                "reviewText": "This shave cream is nothing fancy but seems to work well. The scent it pretty innocuous and it is thin enough that it is easy to spread. I would prefer if it was slightly thicker but it seems to do the job well enough.At less than $5 a bottle this is reasonably priced.Overall happy with the \"Schick Silk Bikini Shave Cream | Shaving Cream for Women Bikini Area, Intimate Shaving Cream 2 Pack, 6oz Each\".",

                "reviewText": "Being honest I am a little skeptical about products that are made one purpose and consequently come with a higher price point - I find shave gel is shave gel and the good branded ones all work well no matter where you use it.This one however does double as a moisturizer and a little goes a long way - it is also a nice compact squeeze bottle so it is very convenient for travel. You don\u2019t need to use additional moisturizer when using this.It is gentle on the skin, has a pleasant scent and is not irritating! You get two in the pack and they are long lasting and can double as an all over shave gel / moisturizer!",
