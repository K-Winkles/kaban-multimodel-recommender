As you can see from the images the tin is not even close to full, you can see the bottom of the tin. The tin, lid and product it contained does not even weigh close to what just the product is supposed to weigh. There is supposed to be at least 28.5g of product excluding the tin. Not 35g like the listing says. The tin and contents only weigh 21g.Second issue. The product that is in the container is hard. This product is supposed to be a cream. No wetting of the product is needed. The contained product is hard, previously bubbly, and doesn't smell right.A replacement item is scheduled to be sent soon. The original order took a long time to process and ship via amazon shipping.Reuzel is a good company and all other products I have ordered in the past were excellent.",

I\u2019ve been around the block a few time, okay, a lot of times, so I know quite a bit about quality shave soaps and creams. This rates right up near the top in slickness and overall quality. I\u2019m over 70 so I\u2019ve cut a few whiskers and I\u2019m well versed in wet shaving. And, yes I also initially tried to use a brush with this cream. But, live and learn and just use a dab on your finger tips and rub it on your face, no brush needed. It\u2019s just a really slick cream that provides an excellent close shave and it has a nice aroma and a great after shave conditioning feel on face. I also have sensitive skin and this one really works for me.",

                "reviewText": "But it is amazing. Before you shave, wash your face, soap and hot water, rinse, put a little dab on 2 fingers and rub into the skin anywhere you have shaving problems, neck and throat especially. Do NOT use a brush, it takes very little to go a long ways. Lather up using your soap of choice. This cream does not lather at all, but it's like a Teflon coating for sensitive areas.",
