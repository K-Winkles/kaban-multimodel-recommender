                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this gel for years and it is my \u201cgo to\u201d for shaving both my head and face. For my head, I use an OmniShaver, and for my face, a Panasonic Arc5 shaver. A small amount mixed with water and applied to the skin creates a slick, lubricating surface that promotes shaver glide. The ingredients in the gel - soy, aloe, conditioners, and Vitamin E \u2013 soften the hair, promote swelling of the hair that facilitates capture by the shaver foil, and eliminates ingrown hairs, razor bumps and razor burn. The gel smells wonderful \u2013 almost like an oatmeal cookie \u2013 and the ingredients are actually good for the skin and leave the skin feeling moisturized with a smooth, glowing, healthy appearance. Target stores in the United States make a generic version of this gel called Up & Up Smoothing Shave Gel Soy, which is a little cheaper than the Aveeno version but is equally effective and smells equally fantastic. I can\u2019t recommend this gel highly enough.",
