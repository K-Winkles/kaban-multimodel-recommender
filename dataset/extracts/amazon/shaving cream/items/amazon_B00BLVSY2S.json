It's incredibly comfortable to work the cream into a lather and a little cream goes a long way in covering the area(s) you're looking to shave. No worries about nicks or bumps, as the cream provides a nourishing protective layer.The fresh, classic fragrance is enjoyable as you're shaving -- the essence of the fragrance remains subtle once you're finished shaving and will last throughout the day. Post-shave, your skin will be left feeling soft and moisturized thanks to the aloe vera in the cream. Using Clubman's shave cream is the perfect way to freshen up and get that close shave that will make you feel ready to the conquer the day.",
