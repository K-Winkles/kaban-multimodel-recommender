When it goes on it\u2019s very creamy but as soon as I start shaving any water that hits it makes it disappear. I\u2019m glad I tried it but honestly the price discourages me for the amount you get and it\u2019s not a game changing shaving cream. I shave just about every day and if this was around 14 bucks I would buy again. It\u2019s just not worth over that to me.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product hoping to love it as much as the influencers said I would, but sadly, I didn't. It's fun and looks like unicorn frosting, but that's where the pleasure stops. It smells so sweet and tropical, and it turned my razor purple. Like stained the plastic part of the razor purple. Smell and stains aside, the product really didn't do anything more for my skin or shave experience than the product I typically use that's a fraction of the price. Overall, I won't be purchasing again.",
