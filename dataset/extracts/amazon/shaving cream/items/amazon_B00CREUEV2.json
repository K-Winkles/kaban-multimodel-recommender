I also hated shaving my face, which led me to trying stuff like this on my face in High School. I got scabs on my face because those products were for body only, and they didn't even get the hair off at least (on my face). And now, years later, I finally found THIS! And it worked! Is it bad for my skin though? Probably. My neck and cheeks felt weird afterwards, like maybe dry? The next morning my face felt normal, though. As far as I'm aware, this is still new. So I'm sure they're working on improvements. I have light skin and dark hair, by the way.",

It also doesn\u2019t smell as strong as Nair does so it\u2019s a win/win. The only con is that you need to mix it with water every time and that can be tedious. The mixing process takes awhile too because the powder is so fluffy. It doesn\u2019t easily mix. Other than that, the results make it worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I'm pale, and have dark colored leg hair. I have not shaved in weeks, so my leg hair was pretty long. My leg hair also is sparse in some areas.Attempt 1: Lower Left Leg (I have somewhat sensitive skin, and was nervous about chemical burns so I did this as gently as possible regarding time left on and removing it)I mixed 2 teaspoons of powder with 2 teaspoons of water as the container instructed. The mexture was too runny. I added another teaspoon of powder, and it became thicker, almost glue like consistency, and wasn't really runny. I set the timer, applied it with a paintbrush, and shortly after the timer went off, I rinsed it off with cool water, while simultaneously using a spatula in stubborn areas. It seems like I rinsed with water for about 5 minutes. I'd guesstimate about 65% of hair was removed. I was let down by the results, especially because of the hassle of mixing the solution and the amount of time the process took for just 1 leg, and just figured this isn't the product for .e.I'm stubborn. After waiting a couple of hours and not having any burns or skin reactions, I decided to try again on my right leg.Attempt 2: Lower Right Leg*After watching some more videos, I found a very small pastic container with a lid. I used 3 teaspoons of powder and 2 teaspoons of water, closed the lid, and shook the container for about a minute. I opened the container and saw that it was mixed well, like a smooth peanut butter consistency, but there was still some excess powder remaining. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of water, and shook like crazy. Upon opening the container, there were smooth ball formations of the mixture, so I just smashed/mixed them up with a spoon, and it looked ready to go since it was not runny at all, resembling smooth frosting/peanutbutter.*I again applied the mixture with a paintbrush going in the direction of my hair growth(downwards). I turned on the 7 minute timer after I finished applying it all to my right leg. Around the 4 minute mark, I noticed some areas were already dry (the mixture never got quite dry in my 1st attempt on my left leg) so I misted those dry areas with a spray bottle. After 7 minutes, I got a soft wash cloth and saturated it with cool water. Using moderate pressure ( because I was still worried about irritating the area), I began removing my hair going against my hair growth (upwards), rinsing the washcloth off between each swipe. I'd guesstimate over 90% of my hair was removed.The 2nd attempt obviously worked better for me. It was much easier to mix it that way, and not as time consuming. Removing the mixture with a soft wash cloth wasn't irritating, and I felt the product was removed completely, and my right leg definitely feels softer than my left leg. I feel like the 2nd attempt took half of the time of my 1st attempt. Each time I used it, I only experienced a mild tingling sensation for about 2 minutes. I'll definitely use this product again, and will update if I become brave enough to use it on more sensitive areas. Please like my review if you found it helpful. I'm attaching pictures of the difference between my left and right leg results after using the product.",

                "reviewText": "I'm the unlucky one. You know, that girl with skin so white it's transparent AND has the thick, dark black leg and arm hair. Yeah, I pretty much have pubes for leg hair.I'm sick of shaving. I go through razors like candy and since my hair is thick, I can't just grab the cheapo ones. I heard the rave reviews, and the smell warning, but since I was sure I'd killed my sense of smell between accidentally mixing mustard gas to mop floors & getting the coof twice, I figured I wouldn't smell it.Man was I wrong.Firstly, The water to powder ratio is off, especially if you're trying to do more than a test patch, you'll want a smooth, thick, spreadable but not watery texture. If you are able to supply it without getting it everywhere, you gotta keep it moist and not too thick or thin.The smell is horrid, some have said it's like rotten eggs or sulfur, no. It is way worse. The stench lingered and permeated my entire house, with the bathroom door closed.And to remove it, for the love of God, use the back of a butter knife or spoon edge and drop the roll of caked mud into something you can throw away issue of your house. Screw the wash cloth, it'll cake it up quick, keep the smell through 2 washes and you don't want that thick mixture going in your drains.And after you DO get it off, you'll rinse it 5 times, still smell it AND have a film of white powder... until you scrub it. Rinsing won't work, soap won't work, you gotta soap and loofah or rough washcloth the area GENTLY! IF you go too rough, you're gonna have a burning sensation for days only in the places you scrubbed.It works.It absolutely works.It works for the coarsest thickest hair.It doesn't stubble for at least 3 days.But, for the love of all that is holy, do not let the mixture stay in your house - in a trash bin, on a rag, in your drains. Just scrape and toss in the dumpster or trash bin outside.Use only when absolutely desperate.Nair takes longer on my hair, but, I'll take that smell over this every day.",

I noticed that the original formula would irritate sooner than it got to the hair. It\u2019s not the case with this one. It\u2019s much softer on the skin. I\u2019d say conditioning",
