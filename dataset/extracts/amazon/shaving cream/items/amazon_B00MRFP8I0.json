                "reviewText": "I am absolutely thrilled with the Anthony Shaving Cream for Men with Sensitive Skin! As someone who has struggled with irritation and discomfort while shaving, I was skeptical about finding a product that could truly address these issues. However, Anthony Shaving Cream has completely exceeded my expectations.From the moment I opened the package, I was greeted with a refreshing and invigorating aroma of eucalyptus, spearmint, and rosemary extracts. The scent alone set the tone for a luxurious and revitalizing shaving experience. The combination of these natural extracts not only provided a pleasant fragrance but also contributed to a soothing sensation on my skin.One of the standout features of this shaving cream is the inclusion of squalane, which is renowned for its moisturizing properties. I was amazed at how effortlessly the razor glided across my skin, minimizing friction and reducing the risk of nicks and cuts. The cream created a rich and dense lather that allowed for a close, comfortable shave without any discomfort whatsoever.The true test of any shaving product lies in its ability to prevent post-shave irritation, and Anthony Shaving Cream aced this aspect. After using this cream, my skin felt incredibly soft, hydrated, and noticeably calm. The cool and refreshing sensation lingered long after I had finished shaving, providing a refreshing boost to my morning routine.I also appreciated the thoughtful packaging and the easy-to-use dispenser that ensured I could get just the right amount of product without any mess. The 6 fl oz size is perfect for both home use and travel, making it a versatile addition to my grooming routine.In summary, the Anthony Shaving Cream for Men with Sensitive Skin has won me over completely. Its blend of squalane, eucalyptus, spearmint, and rosemary extracts creates a harmonious symphony of soothing, refreshing, and conditioning benefits. If you're in search of a top-tier shaving experience that caters to sensitive skin, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this product a try. It's transformed my daily shave into a revitalizing ritual that I genuinely look forward to.",

                "reviewText": "I've used many shave creams. Discovered Anthony cream shave years ago. Won't use anything else. Coupled with a good 5-blade razor, it gives the best shave. So smooth and frictionless that I don't remember the last time I cut myself or irritated my face. A tiny dab the size of 2 baby peas is all it takes. I shave every other day and 1 tube lasts me about 18 months, so what seems like a pricey cream really isn't. An even smaller dab of the Anthony face balm after shaving and my face never has that post-shave burn. Great stuff. Note to the folks at Anthony: PLEASE don't mess with, or \"improve\" these products. They're perfect. Quality means a thing does what it's supposed to do better than anything else.",

                "reviewText": "I did like the scent. I use shave cream with my wet/dry electric. It seems to dry out if you don't keep the razor very well lubricated, as in almost constantly wet. I know that sounds like common sense, but it dries out (and that's the best description I can come up with) faster than almost any other quality shave cream I've used. It just doesn't feel as well lubricated compared to others. It's not a bad shave cream, but I won't purchase again.",
