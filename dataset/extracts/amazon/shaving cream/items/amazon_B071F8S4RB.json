This stuff is by far the slickest shaving cream I\u2019ve ever used! I tried lathering this in my shaving bowl and it doesn\u2019t lather at all. I consulted my cousin on this and he said you don\u2019t need to lather it just massage into the face and beard and wet your face with hot water before. So I did. It only takes a quarter size amount and I got the closest and smoothest shave I\u2019ve ever gotten! This stuff is top notch! The scent is old school barber shop scent that is truly an original scent. This product is imported from Holland and it say Holland\u2019s finest. They aren\u2019t kidding! It\u2019s well worth the price and I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "If you like a change from the daily can of Barbasol or Gillette shave cream, look no further. This little can holds a lot of shaves as the cream is fairly concentrated, and it doesn't take much to get a good coverage. It doesn't lather like from a can, but is more like a thick cream soap. The shave is awesome, and the ingredients contain a natural mild numbing agent in case you do get a nick or cut. Best of all, it leaves your skin smooth and smelling great! I was a bit skeptical at first when I ordered it, but my first shave changed all that! Great for a travel kit.",

I walked in a Barber shop and asked what he recommended and he gave me this one so I tried it and fell in love with the product. I immediately went on Amazon to see if they had it and they did so ordered two more. My wife was pretty amazed that I git so excited over shaving cream but I look forward to shaving now and the smell. Start the day right. She works with me and she enjoys the smell on the way to work as well.",
