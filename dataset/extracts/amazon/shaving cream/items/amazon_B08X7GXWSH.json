I went through 2 bottles of this stuff in a month of two because no matter how much concentrate I add to my machine it comes out a liquidy mess. I have to catch a bunch of the soap in a towel before it\u2019s even usable. 1 bottle would last me FOREVER. it always came out so good and fluffy. My clients love it!

The shaving cream softening my beard better than any other and is heated well enough so as not to be too hot. Its a quick and relaxing daily shaving experience. I also have learned that HARRY'S SHAVING BLADES FROM Germany are the best I have used and are much more economical compared to Gillette products. The latter are available on the New York Times website.",
