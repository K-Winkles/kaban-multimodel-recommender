I find the scent to be unusual and it could be a little stronger.The push button on top of the can to eject the gel is balky such that it takes some fiddling to get the gel on your hand; this could be a defect in the particular can I received?",

                "reviewText": "I think that the product, including the nozzle which the gel comes out of, is very well designed. The fact that the nozzle is flush means, that it will not trap any moisture when rinsed. But what I do not like is the fact that the company has used the very small diameter of the nozzle, as well as the fact that the gel foams after it has exited, as it is supposed to, as an excuse to put only a very small quantity of gel into the container.Also, the increase in volume due to the gel foaming, leaves the user with foam that has the wrong texture. The foam is finally a bit clumpy, rather than smooth and firm. This is due to a calculated density ending up just a bit too low.Yet, because of this extremely miserly behaviour, the same narrow container still serves me well after a full month of use.Dirk",
