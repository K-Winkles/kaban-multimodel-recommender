Also how well I was able to shave not having to look through all that lather. This happened years ago and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since. Love this stuff",

I tried it with my Skull Shaver Pitbull and it works great. The lube doesn't gunk up the shaver. It washes off your hands easily so you can get a grip on your shaver. I love that it is clear so I can see around my goatee. It does dry up a little faster than I would like. I will have to wet one side of my face at a time and then apply to my head after I am done shaving my face. It definitely gave a smoother shave than dry shaving with the Pitbull.",

Then Jack Black the next day and throughout the week.At times I may use an electric razor and I'll use Jack Black lube for trimming after an electric shave.I have a heavy beard and this lube does the job like no other.Use Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream after shaving for best results.",

Tiene un olor incre\u00edble, facilita el paso de la m\u00e1quina como debe y deja la piel sinti\u00e9ndose agradable. Si bien puede doler un poco en el bolsillo, creo que vale totalmente la pena.",

I can not believe how effective, smooth and near perfect this product is\u2026. The Braun series 9 takes to this like a piping hot knife going through butter\u2026. It is as close to a razor shave you can take that machine and it is such a smooth finish, absolutely zero irritation, honestly my toxic trait think it was a fluke the first time\u2026.But trust me this product for those who want to shave their head also\u2026. This is the one\u2026 the golden goose with all the eggs\u2026. Don\u2019t bother with anything else\u2026. Nothing beats this product\u2026.",
