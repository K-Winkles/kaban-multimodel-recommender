                "reviewText": "As with all Truefitt & Hill products this is an excellent shaving cream. I was pleasantly surprised by the light refreshing scent of this cream. I usually stay away from the perfumed products and was a little hesitant with trying this scent, but after reading other reviews that commented on the light fresh scent I relented and decided to give it a whirl. As I work in a medical practice I do not like to wear heavy scents, this was not an issue with the 1805 fragrance. I found it to be light with a mild spice that leaves a pleasant undertone throughout the day, I would equate it to maybe a classic ocean faring scent, my wife says it smells more floral (I was unable to detect this floral aspect), and states that she does like the scent.The cream itself is excellent, as would be expected from this very reputable manufacturer. There were no disappointments to be found here. The cream is very luxuriant and incredibly slick and smooth, and I did get an incredibly close shave, that resulted in neither razor burn nor nicks. I will say that this is a premium shaving cream and probably does work better with a higher end badger brush, probably best badger at the least. I say this due to the fact that it worked best with slightly more water than I would use with a D R Harris or TOBs cream but closer to what I expect when using the G F trumper creams. I state this only because I know the difference I achieve in lather between my pure badger brushes and my silver tip brushes as the latter are able to retain much more water. I do not view this as a negative as this is a premium cream and thereby may be expected to work optimally with premium accessories (this is of course an assumption on my part). I will however test this cream with my pure badger brushes to confirm my speculation and will update this review If I find my that I am in error. (I apologize to any boar brush users as I am unable to test this, as I do not own one)UPDATE!!! I must admit that I was mistaken in my earlier conclusion about brushes. I used my least expensive pure badger His Tweezerman Deluxe Shaving Brush (my travel brush) thinking I would work up from here. The shaving cream lather was excellent, while it was slightly thicker than I prefer when using my silver tip brush, it still lathered excellently. I was concerned that it would not hold lather for all three of my passes and my final touch up pass, but the concern proved false as there was ample lather for the complete shave. I did add drips of water to base of brush through lathering process in order to thin a little as it did remain a bit thicker on the brush. I therefore must revise my earlier comment and say this is just an excellent cream regardless of the brush you are using. Although my personal preference would be that I like the consistency offered by a brush that retains a little more water.I shave with the same ritual daily, only substituting one item at a time when trying new products. 1. Homemade shave oil that I apply in the shower and allow to soak in to beard and skin. 2. Face wash with Musco Real Glycerin lime soap. After showering. 3. Taylor of Old Bond Street Herbal Pre-shave Gel 4. Truefitt & Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar 5. Applied with Kent Brushes Shaving Brush Large Size (BK8) 6. Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated with Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 100 Ct 7. Hot then cold water wash then alum applied. RazoRock Alum Block (Clean and replace shaving gear while this is allowed to sit on face, followed by cold water rinse.) 8. Geo F. Trumper's Limes Skin Food, 200ml Applied to towel dried skin and not diluted with water. Two drops is sufficient to cover entire face and neck. I allow this to soak in while I brush teeth. 9. Aftershave by Feather (unscented during work days) non work days Castle Forbes Lime Oil Aftershave Balm Again applied to dried skin.",

                "reviewText": "I ,like many others, started out with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce when I began wet shaving. I like to have a big variety of soaps & creams (I have enough of them to last 10 years right now, it is a major disorder!) When I finished my tub of TOBS I decided to go with Truefitt & Hill to get a different take on the Sandalwood scent.All I can say is WOW. This product smells NOTHING like TOBS Sandalwood, it really smells much more like it is perfume cream, in fact I am not sure if I sense much Sandalwood (in the Proraso Red sort of way). Now I loved TOBS Sandalwood but for some reason this perfumed scent from Truefitt & Hill is just intoxicating! I like it so much I find myself sniffing the container when I am in the bathroom.With a nice Badger or Plissoft brush you will whip up a massive lather with this cream. For some reason I could not get my Semogue 830 Premium Boar Bristle Shaving Brush to work with this cream, I am not sure what it is but it just ate the lather. That is not the case with my Silver Tip though, just swirl the tips in the tub lightly and I have a lather bowl full of thick and luxurious goodness!If you are not a fan of perfume/cologne scents then I strongly suggest you do not buy this cream, you are probably best to go with TOBS. If you are like me and you are down with a scent that perhaps a King of England might have worn back in the day you have to give this a shot!",
