Mightily formulated from Aloe Vera extract for skin hydration and Peppermint oil for cooling sensation to provide you a crisp clean smooth shave. With its Sandalwood oil scent and extra glide lubrication, you will enjoy the ultra-clean beard edging and smooth shaving experience. Plus its packaged in easy squeeze 10 fl oz bottle for comfortable gel dispensing - no clog, no mess, no waste. Say goodbye to shave foam! #2 FACT: SHE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE Agreed! The Legendary Fac\u00f3n Straight Razor gives you a Pure Raw Classic shaving experience regardless of how long you've been in this game. Pop your favorite blade in and enjoy a smooth and close shave that's almost impossible to achieve with conventional cartridge razors or electric shavers. It's meant for folks who want to make a statement. That's why straight razors are preferred choice of barbers, salons and hair/beard enthusiasts. And SHE will thank you for it! #3 FACT: I'M SEXY AND I KNOW IT Sure if you say so! But I am thrilled to share the secret. I obviously shave with Fac\u00f3n Clear Shave Gel. It helps my beard, mustache and hairline looking fresh as if I just came from the barbershop. Plus I love to support small businesses. Mom and Pop shop working tirelessly to produce premium quality products and make sure all their customers are 100% satisfied while giving back to the local community. Isn't that awesome? Yup! Welcome to Pure Raw Crisp Clean Classic shaving experience!",

                "reviewText": "I honestly don't know how I feel about this product, used it 4 times now, on my side burns it works great 0 complaint. However when I use it to shave my head it's been inconsistent, it works and isn't bad but it almost clogs my razor so I have to rinse it off very frequently. I've shaved my head for 5 years, I've used many products and this isn't something I normally have to do on a single stroke.As the product states it's non-foaming, it's a gel, and for my head I feel I have to use an unreasonable amount as this isn't exactly concentrated. Any amount of moisture will instantly water it down causing it to lose a good bit of slickness. I feel I have to apply it heavily just to shave my head, which will not be a problem for most people I would assume.I don't know exactly how to put it in words but with applied thing it's not that great, its intended to use as is, you really can't apply a thin layer and expect it to work well. The gel does not like moisture, really any amount of moisture will cause the gel to evaporate and turn into water and run off my head (and occasionally in my eyes). I do shave my head in the shower though, so maybe if I did it outside of the shower this wouldn't be an issue.I just wish the gel didn't turn to water due to moisture in the shower, or me sweating because of the moisture. I do like the scent though, very pleasant, and it leaves a nice feel on my skin, just feels soft and moisturized I really enjoy that about the product. I've never used a product like this, I bought it at random when it had no reviews so I just figured I would try it.Overall I like it I just wish the product handled water better, a lot of people do shave in the shower, moisture is unavoidable for many. I also wish it was more slick when applied thin, but overall I do like it but if these few things didn't happen I would use it daily without complaint. I think anyone who just shaves there face outside of the shower wouldn't really deal with these issues and would probably really enjoy it as its worked very well for my side burns and trimming my beard lines.",
