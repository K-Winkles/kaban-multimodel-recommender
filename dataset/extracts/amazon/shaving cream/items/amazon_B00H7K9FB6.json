I found this shave lotion via EWG SkinDeep database for being non-toxic. A little goes a long way and so the bottle lasts for a long time. I'm not a huge fan of the scent, but that's not important to me. I never get a shave rash when I use this lotion. I think it's a good value and would recommend.",
