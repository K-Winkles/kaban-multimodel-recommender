So at first I wasn\u2019t a fan and thought I was going to return it, but after giving it a few more tries I ended up loving it. I think that it must\u2019ve been in a hot truck when it was delivered because the soap was so thin it was coming out as soon as I took off the lid. But after a few days it thickened up and it lathers very well. I also feel good knowing it has no bad chemicals in it. Next to no smell, if anything a little earthy. It does have that \u201cdry squeaky skin\u201d effect after using it but doesn\u2019t last long. And again you only have to use a little bit and it goes a long way. I already bought my second bottle and will continue to use this. The only thing I would change is the bottle itself, I would prefer a pump for easier use.",

                "reviewText": "I started using this product as a shave gel because it is the only one I'm not allergic to. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very watery and would be better with a pump. The bottle has some weird religious phrases that are off-putting and the fact that they are on a soap bottle makes me think the owners must be nuts because no marketing company advised this design. My guess is they know the product is too runny but it is the lack of ingredients that cause contact dermatitis that make it that way. I figure I have to chose between runny without rashes and thick cream with skin irritation. The smell isn't pleasant but isn't terrible. None of the products for skin sensitivities smell very good because they don't have added fragrance. On short trips where I need to minimize liquids in a carryon, this doubles as body wash and shave gel. I hope I find something better but for now this works because I don't get a rash or dry skin when I use this and I shave my legs every single day.",

                "reviewText": "I have very sensitive skin, so finding something to shave comfortably with is never easy for me, but I am always looking for something new. After reading all the good reviews of this product, I ordered it with high expectations. But I\u2019ve only shaved for the first time this morning since receiving this last week, and it was BRUTAL.My razor pulled my hair in a painful way and I was not able to get a close shave like I need without passing over multiple times, leading to me having an embarrassingly red face as I prepare to go to work this morning.Also, the consistency is basically that of a slightly thinner maple syrup: just not good for shaving, not for me anyway. And it\u2019s supposed to be scent-free, but this is not the case. The sticky, syrupy soap has a distinct odor, and it is not good. Finally, the syrupy soap just got everywhere all over my bathroom sink, making a ridiculous sticky mess everywhere that required much clean up my once I had finished shaving, painfully. Just an overall very unpleasant shaving experience.But the real kicker is this: the shave soap is \u201cnot returnable\u201d even though it is not listed in the seller\u2019s list of \u201cunreturnable\u201d items anywhere! So I am stuck with this bad (at least bad for me) product and have no ability to get my money back. This kind of policy is really just absurd in this age of digital commerce. It wasn\u2019t expensive, but that isn\u2019t the point: if your customers genuinely dislike your product, online merchants have a responsibility to make it right and not stick their customers with products they greatly dislike.So beware: returning items and getting refunded by this seller is basically impossible, even when the particular item you buy is distinctly NOT on their ridiculous list of \u201cnonreturnable items.\u201dWhat is this seller thinking? Not the way you cultivate brand loyalty by sticking customers with items that do not at all work for them and that actually was painful to use. Very few merchants on Amazon are so short-sighted as to refuse returns and refunds for their products: but this outfit is apparently a very unfortunate exception.",

Quite simply, you have to know how much to use (which is a very small amount each time), and how to apply it (very thinly). I have been using it for a week now, and I can already see the difference. I shave my head, so need something that does not clog my pores. I can already see a huge improvement in my complexion.",

I love that this product uses organic ingredients that help hydrate your skin without irritating it with chemical fragrances. The smell is pleasant without being overpowering and the consistency is like any other soap. The color is a medium/dark brown which seems strange, but once you read the description it makes sense so don't be surprised by the color! The product left my skin feeling great and made for a smooth shave. Overall, a great organic alternative to regular shaving cream!",
