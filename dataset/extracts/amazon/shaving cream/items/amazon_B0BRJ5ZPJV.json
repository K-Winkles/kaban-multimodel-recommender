Our Blueberry Shave Syrup eliminates the need for this additional step while still allowing you to receive the benefits of exfoliation. The result is simply the smoothest shave possible! In addition, our vitamin-enriched microspheres dissolve quickly directly on your skin to provide antioxidant protection from environmental damage. Enhanced with blueberry fruit extract, this clear formula will help eliminate irritation caused by frequent shaving, leave skin incredibly smooth, and minimize razor bumps & ingrown hairs. Perfect for use on legs, bikini area and under arms.",

A little bit of the syrup went a long way, and the scent was not overpowering which I was glad of. I shave my legs very infrequently so the hair was quite long, but with this I honestly think it was the fastest shave I've had because I didn't have to keep going over the same areas multiple times. I'll definitely be sticking with this in the future.",
