The scent is light and pleasant. It lingers for a short time post shave. Would definitely recommend, and will purchase again as needed.",

It smells masculine and fresh - sort of a forest smell but not too much pine or woody-ness so it\u2019s not heavy or overwhelming.",

I loved the process and the old fashioned feel. It was new to me, so naturally I went overboard trying different shaving soaps. A LOT OF SOAPS. Most of them were terribly disappointing. The best brand, by far, that I have ever used is Taylor of Old Bond St. Every time I get such a thick and consistent lather. It's so enjoyable to use their products. They smell wonderful and provide a nice smooth glide across the skin. This is, without question, the only brand I intend to use for the rest of my days.",

Each aroma is of course subjective, but I enjoy them all. Their shaving creams in particular work great, are super simple to use, last a long time, and are well priced. Part of my routine is to use the shaving cream along with a soap, aftershave, or cologne from the same line. Even then their aromas are not overpowering, and are therefore pleasant for weekday use near people or at work.",
