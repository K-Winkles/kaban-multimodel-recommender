                "reviewText": "This stuff if the bomb! I have been using this shaving cream for quite sometime now! It makes your skin sooo smooth. A little bit goes a long ways. I used to use a similar product that was more than twice the price that I honestly did like a little better however price wise I just can\u2019t justify it when this does produce almost exactly the same effect . Because of costs I will continue to purchase this one. And I really do like it! Everyone\u2019s skin I am sure likes different types of products but if you need moisture in your skin this will definitely help with that!",

                "reviewText": "I love that this shaving cream has an ergonomic grip to the bottle- perfect for in the shower. Under the cap is a pump like that of a lotion bottle. The consistency of it feels like lotion too. It's difficult to use in the shower if it gets wet because it makes the shave gel really thin. It smells fantastic (vanilla) though, and feels very hydrating. You do have to rinse it off your razor really well between passes because it clings to the blades. I really like it so far though. I like to make my own DIY natural products for personal care and frankly I can't keep up sometimes, so this ready-made relatively clean shaving lotion that smells great, works well, and is a decent price is a great find. I bought another scent too but haven't tried that one yet.",

It does help in moisturizing my really dry skin on my legs & it is fragrance free. It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s just kind of so so, just not very exciting. I was hoping for a nice emollient like one I\u2019d used before from a different company. My skin is sensitive & very dry so I always exfoliate before I shave. I may end up giving this to someone else & go back to my shaving cream I used before. So disappointing.",

So, figured I would try looking on Amazon and lo and behold not only did they have the coconut scent I love but several other scents too. So, I bought them all and not disappointed with the smell of any of them. This is the best absorbing hand cream I have ever used. Doesn\u2019t leave your skin greasy or dry in a few hours it lasts through a few hand washes. Really the best.",

I suppose it does a decent job but chunks of it remain stuck to razor and shower walls and floor despite rinsing. Be aware of the potential for slippery surfaces especially if you are prone to falling or at risk of injury. Also, the scent is rather strong. Not unpleasant, but something to be aware of for example if you use other scented bath products with scents that don\u2019t mix well.",

I haven\u2019t gotten razor burn since! I love the thickness of the formula, it\u2019s not too foamy or creamy, smells so nice. And it is a completely smooth shave every single time. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!",
