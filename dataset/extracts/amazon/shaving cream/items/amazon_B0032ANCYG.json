As always with sensitive skin, please try a small amount on a part of your body. Usually wait 24 for any reaction. I do have eczema and dry, damaged skin from cold winters.

Skintimate has other scents that will make you smell like strawberries, which is rather odd for a manly man like me (cough), but this one doesn't leave any.It says to wet the skin but you have to make sure that your skin is not DRIPPING wet before applying or else it will just run off. Use plenty and you'll avoid any irritation.And to avoid irritation even better, make sure to exfoliate often to avoid ingrown hairs.Yes, I am a man... giving skin tips.... for where the sun don't shine.",
