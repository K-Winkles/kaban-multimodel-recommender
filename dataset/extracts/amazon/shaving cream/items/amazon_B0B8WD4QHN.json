                "reviewText": "Several years ago I decided that I was no longer going to use canned shaving cream after I read the label and realized that they use hydrocarbons as the propellant to get the cream out of the can. Since such hydrocarbons contribute to climate change, I decided to switch to shaving soaps with a shaving brush to help reduce my carbon footprint by that tiny bit. But the shaving soaps I was using, bars that fit into a shaving cup, didn't provide the thick, long lasting lather that I like when I'm shaving, so I was still trying to find a product that would both lather well and not use hydrocarbons.When I first opened this container, I was sure that it was not going to be the solution. The shaving cream is frothy and light, and I didn't think it would last very long, making the cost per shave too high to justify. However, I have found that only a tiny bit is all I need to get a thick lather that provides excellent lubrication and a very comfortable shave, even when I haven't shaved in several days. For me, just touching the tips of the bristles against the cream and giving the brush a little twist is usually all I need to do. That little bit of cream on the tips of the bristles will usually be more than enough for the shave, and I now expect this container to actually last longer than the solid bars I have been using, making it a good value.",

They tell you a small amount goes a long way, and it really does. I've been using a dab about the size of an almond, and that has still produced even coverage over my face. At that rate, the small jar is going to last a long time. The cream feels smooth and pleasant going on, and gives me a clean, refreshing shave. I'm very pleased with it, and I think it's a good value.",

The shaving cream is really \"creamy\", feel great on screen and you can actually feel the hydration effect on it. I've been using shaving creams instead of shaving foams for a time now and to be honest, this one is one of the best ones I've tried. I believe the product is great value for money as I've had spent more money on bigger brand named products that didn't feel as good as this one. I would recommend it 100%.",

The shaving cream gives a very good lubricating surface and lets the razor glide across your face. I really like that it does not leave my face feeling oily like some of the others I have tried. The smell is pleasant without being over powering, I will definitely be switching to this brand.",

The product itself is light and seems to have a whipped consistency to it. it goes on light and does not stand up well to moisture. You end up using more than one might think per shave and it is not especially good at preventing nicks and cuts as it does not cling well to my face. All in all I would not get this again.",
