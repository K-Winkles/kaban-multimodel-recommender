The lather from this stuff will be fairly thin, but the glide and slickness is there to provide a comfortable shave. There is nothing really wrong with the product, but I rarely use it by itself. I usually put a pea-size dollop in a bowl, load my shaving brush with Col. Conk glycerin soap, and then lather it up. Overall, it is a good cream at a great price point.",

No matter where I search for products I always find them at Amazon at a better price and almost always free shipping. Using Prime my stuff got here on the second day and in great shape. No bar style shaving soap lathers up and does as good a job as this Arko in a tube. One tube lasts me about one-and-a-half months shaving every other day. I can re-lather twice for my typical 3-way shave using one application. Always a great shave every time. This is second only to Proraso Shave in a cup soap.",

If you do use too much it almost gets slimy under your razor, less is more and it works great. This is my favorite shaving cream and I have a sensitive face and neck. My two cents.",

                "reviewText": "I used a similar product (palmolive or gillete) when I first started shaving in 1977. Used it for 13 years before changing to shaving bowl or shaving stick for last 30+ yr. Changed back as I found it increasingly difficult to get shave sticks or bowls in local shops and I have zero desire to purchase modern woke gels etc.It works fine, good creamy lather, no adverse skin reaction. A 1.5'' squirt gives a good lather, enough to shave twice however using less seems to make the lather a little thin. I would estimate the tube will last at least 3 possibly 4 months and have alreadyreordered 2 more tubes as this is a permanent swap.5 star product.Disclaimer - we have soft water here in Scotland, I cannot comment on how it would work in a hard water area.",

                "reviewText": "Another great product from Arko. Like their soap it lathers really easily and expansively. I use a brush and bowl and it only requires a little drop to provide a lot of lather. I didn't notice much, if any smell, to the cream and not much cooling menthol effect. However, these aspects are minor as it provides a really good shave and very cost effective, perhaps more so than their shaving soap.",
