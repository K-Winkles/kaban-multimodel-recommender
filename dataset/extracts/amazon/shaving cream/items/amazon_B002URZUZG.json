Gone was the irritation I had suffered for years before.It is a little thinner that what you might be used to but a very small amount goes a very long way and doesn't clog up your razor.Shaving once a day, a tube typically lasts me about 3 months.That makes it great value for money, even with the markup here over the TJ price.I couldn't recommend this product enough!!!5+ Stars for sure!",

It's nice, but very subtle, unlike most shaving creams I've come across. It doesn't foam like crazy (a sure sign of less chemicals than the average) and makes my skin feel AMAZING. I have very sensitive skin, and it NEVER irritates it.The biggest proof of how much I love this: I live in Holland, and when I visit a city in the states with a TJ, I BRING IT HOME WITH ME. When I move to Austin, TX at the end of year, where there is still no Trader Joe's, I'm going to order it from Amazon.I can't imagine using any of the standard stuff now that I've tried this!",

Honestly I am a chicken and I would never do laser or anything that would hurt me bad. I tried the strips and I couldn't deal with the pain and I have tried other products that would never try again in my life but I suffer from bikini bumps every time I shave and I hate it!! It itches and the bumps hurt at the same time, I can never feel comfortable.I wanted to try this cream in the bikini area and even though it is clean and smooth and the vitamin E helps, I do not think it helps with the bumps.I gave it 4 stars because it is really nice for the legs but if you are looking to buy this product for the bikini area to avoid bumps, then this is not the product for that area.",

Leave skin feeling super smooth and moisturized. I have also noticed the hair doesn't grow back nearly as quickly nor as coarse as with other gels/creams while using the same razors. It is significantly cheaper to pick this up in your local Trader Joe's however. I don't understand why they gauge the price on Amazon just go to the store. Same goes for TJ's other hygiene products, they are all cheaper in the store and all that I've tried have been awesome (check out the Coco butter)",

Most shaving products fall into around 3 categories it seems - hard soaps that you have to lather up, creams that lather up, and this type that dont lather but dont really need to - the idea that you apply it directly without lathering. I like that its ready for use right away without lathering and I find it puts a good protective coat on my skin and helps in the cutting very well.",
