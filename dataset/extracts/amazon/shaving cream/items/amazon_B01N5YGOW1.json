                "reviewText": "I was trying to find something other than the shave gel I was using, I noticed that my legs were very prickly the next day even with a new razor and they were also super dry. I was thinking about using a shave oil but I was afraid of how slippery the shower would get.I came across this, I have used this brand before and I think the only reason I stopped was because the regular shave gel was cheaper. I decided to go with this one.I was not sure about the scent when I first opened the container but when I used it in the shower yesterday I really like it!!It is a very light scent, so even if I wasn't a fan I wouldn't mind using it until it runs out. Luckily I like it!This smells like a fresh light rose to me so not that artificial rose smell. A real rose that has that slight earthy undertone. I think it smells light and refreshing and does not compete with the other products in the shower. I do enjoy how it does not have a strong artificial smell.So, This product does not lather up.... it is not meant to! it is like putting a lotion on your skin. A little goes a long way. I will use about a quarter amount for each full leg and you just run it on your legs like a lotion (don't rub it in obviously) you just need a little on your skin and your razor just glides through it and gives you a close shave. My legs feel soft and moisturized the day after shaving. I think it is because with the gel my legs weren't fully getting shaved because the razor was mainly pulling off all the gel.I think this is a great product and I will keep getting it, so worth it!! They do make a lot of scents and I am not sure what is different about these packaging vs the other scents other than this looks a little more luxe so maybe the scents are a little more complex and not singular fakey smell",

I usually use the Schik Intuition razors, but because the replacement heads are expensive and the conditioning bar wears out before the razor, I needed to find something to condition my skin while I continued to use the razor.

The price point is expensive, but it will last you a while!",
