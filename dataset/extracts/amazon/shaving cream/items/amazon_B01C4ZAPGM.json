IntiMD COOCHY PLUS Intimate Shave Cream aims to eliminate the discomforts associated with shaving of sensitive and intimate areas by developing extra-strength MOISTURIZING+ agents to effectively improve the intimate shaving experience. The powerful moisturizers help soften the skin and hair, requiring less pressure from the razor, while also reducing irritation and the occurrence of snags.

This trait also helps the body correctly distribute nutrients, relieving many menstrual symptoms. A great added bonus of this amazing root is its potent aphrodisiacal qualities, known to increase libido as well as alleviate stress-related sexual dysfunction.",

                "reviewText": "I am a full-time model (this is my fiance's account, so don't mind the name) that works with swimsuit and underwear brands. So in addition to healthy diet, working out, and never-ending casting appointments, I need to keep my body hair in check. My colleagues and I have probably gone through hundreds of different shaving cream out there. While there have been a few that we liked (EOS Ultra - $10 / bottle, Kiss My Face - $7 / bottle to name a couple) , but a lot of times, we continue to deal with razor bumps, itching and nicks.Bought the Coochy Plus because it was recommended by our traveling masseuse (if you are reading this, thank you Keya!!). Did a little digging and I think Coochy Plus is a second generation of the shaving cream called Coochy. Anyways, there has been a lot of good reviews for the Coochy, but not a lot on the Coochy Plus. So here we go.First, the name. My fiance was laughing hysterically when I first showed him the shave cream, until I realized the play on word of the name, Coochy. So you may or may not want to leave it out in the open. The shave cream comes in a subtle and classy tube. Make sure you remove the top cap, to break the double seal. As soon as you break the seal, you can smell it. If the fragrance of the shave cream matters to you, all I can say is it smells gentle, light sweetness and playful. Definitely not overwhelming. (My fiance said it kind of turns him on)I have a very sensitive pubic skin, so I choose my shaving cream very carefully as well as keeping a very strict shaving routine. First, always exfoliate the area first. Do this with baby oil and rub the area for 2-5 minutes (this also helps soften the skin and pubic hair). Always use a razor that has more than 4 blades. I am currently using Rite Aid Renewal Razor that has 5 blades. A lot of websites tells you to take a hot shower/bath before, but I don't. Apply enough to cover the entire area and a bit more. You can never be too careful. Then shave, but DO NOT put too much pressure. After you are done, simply rinse off with warm water.To say I am in love with the Coochy Plus is an understatement. I absolutely adore this. No razor bumps, nicks or itching. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Usually, my pubic skin may have some light itch the day after the shave, but I barely noticed any itch after using the Coochy Plus. Will definitely continue to use this throughout the year to see how well it works in different weather. Needless to say, if you are constantly shaving your intimate areas, I highly recommend Coochy Plus.Now the price. $11.85 for a 8oz shaving cream makes this one of the most expensive shaving cream I have ever tried. But based on the result, and the fact that it gives me more confidence at my work, it is a godsend.",

After the first razor pass, my skin felt different at first touch. It felt like a more comfortable shave but also, it got SIGNIFICANTLY closer to the skin than anything I've used prior, which I've never thought I'd find those two attributes in one product (feels counter intuitive, closer shave that feels better? Pretty sure it's wizardry).I didn't change my blade or anything else before I used it so I can confidently say with absolutely certainty that this life changing result was purely due to this product.I'm in love forever, I can't wait to try more products in this line, and I can promise you, it's worth it's weight in gold, so definitely worth the higher price (also, it's a large bottle). You'll look and feel different, better. I've even already gotten a compliment from a long term partner who didn't know I changed my product (;Love. Love. Love.

I have been wanting something natural that results in a smooth shave without any nicks or burning and without all the chemicals. I saw this and it had ingredients that I thought would help with smoothness and possibly no burning on the very sensitive areas. It's better, but not as big of a container, but do like the fact it's a cream, but seems to take more. I tried an experiment.... After the area gets warm in the shower, dried it off and rubbed coconut oil on the area then the Coochy cream. This did help, but noticed the oil dissolved the thing on the razor that helps with it's slickness/roughness. Sounds like a lot of trouble to have a clean shaven, smooth, nice smelling coochy with no nicks or burning involved! Since I was out I purchased one from Walmart by Gillett called Pure, not bad, but has menthol in it so probably will try Coochy Plus again. There were 2 other brands in Walmart in the mean time I might try and they are much more cost effective so I don't feel so bad if I don't use it all up.",
