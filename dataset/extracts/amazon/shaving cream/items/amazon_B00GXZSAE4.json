                "reviewText": "Why am I reviewing something that is no longer manufactured and has sometimes been listed as 'unavailable' on Amazon? To record, for posterity, what an excellent product it is? To stage a hopeless protest against its discontinuance? To make symbolic plea to get it back in circulation? Maybe all of these.I love how well this works, either applied more as a cream directly by hand or whipped up into an excellent foam using a brush.It is a great travel option, given its size and the fact that it is not under pressure.It creates a perfectly balanced (not too light, not to heavy) buffer for the blade.It rinses off cleanly, leaving my skin feeling smooth.It does not dry or irritate my skin.I use the Nivea post-shave balm (also sensitive) afterwards, which is quite good in itself. They have a similar scent. When I first tried both, they were carried by my local supermarket. I recall feeling so fortunate to have found very high quality and dependable products available close by and at a fair price.I never tried the standard non sensitive version of either the cream or the balm, so I cannot compare.I have also tried the very good, canned Nivea shave gel - it was a gift from my wife. It works nicely, smells good, is convenient to use at home. That being said, I am a traditionalist who ditched the can and multi-blades years ago, and picked up a brush, safety razor and non-aerosol cream. Nivea was a great daily go-to. I like Proraso, too, which has similar features. I still think Nivea lathered a bit better.So I just bought this (Greek market?) four-pack. It will last some time. Who knows, maybe there is a stockpile in cool storage somewhere I can return to when I run out again.Meanwhile, if anyone from Nivea reads this - I know there are so few of us Americans who actually shave this way. I know there may be no profitable business reason to do so - please bring the tube back.On a related note, I've believe more and more Nivea is now sourced/made in Mexico. I suspect production of this product stayed in Germany and needed to be phased out. I was hoping - as there must be half a dozen or more Nivea varieties of the shower 'gels' - that this gem could somehow stay in the line up.(For what it's worth, the sensitive skin version of the shower gel is also very good.)",

                "reviewText": "It's a pretty cheap shave cream. But just cuz it's cheap doesn't mean it is low quality. The smell is pretty mild. It's a clean scent, it doesn't stick around for long after the shave so it wouldn't clash much with an aftershave or anything else. With a brush the lather I get is slick and thick. It's a good product, and it isn't that expensive, so I wouldn't feel bad about using a bit more than I need to. Or even using it every day. (I don't need to shave that often, but if I did, I could see using this and it wouldn't break the bank.)It put it right next to Proraso, it may not be some life changing product, but it's a good solid cream. I think it would work very well for someone just getting into wet shaving/ or using a brush and cream or soap.While I don't have that sensitive of skin, I will say after I shave with it, I don't feel like I need to use as much aftershave balm. My skin feels good after using it even before any aftershave balm.",

                "reviewText": "I have always used nivea's sensitive shave gel and foam for shaving but wanted to try this with a shaving brush. Amazon is the only place I have seen this so it's quite rare which was reflected in its relatively high price at just over a fiver a tube. I have used it a couple of times with a brush and have created a good lather each time and have achieved a comfortable shave. The tube should last a good while, longer than a tin of gel or foam. The cream is of inferior quality compared to more luxury brands as you would expect so unless you can source this at its recommended price, I'd give it a miss.",
