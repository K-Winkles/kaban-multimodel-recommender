This comes in a handy pump dispenser, Bold comes in a much less convenient tube that sits on its wide top. If you use this or Bold with a multiblade razor, both will gum up the razor unless you have hot water to rinse it. If you use this stuff and don't rinse it off your face, it'll burn a little after awhile, Bold is a bit more comfortable after shaving. Last but not least, you get 8 ounces of this for about what you pay for 4 ounces of Bold.In a perfect world, Bold would cost the same and come in the same pump dispenser... but since it doesn't, I'll probably buy the BodyVerde again.",

With this dry shave gel, I only need to initially wet my skin with my wet hand from the sink. Then smooth this on (feels like lotion) and shave. Only downside is the razor will clog so I wipe it off occasionally with a dry paper towel. It's quick and painless. And lotion use afterwards is not even necessary because your skin will feel soft from the cream. A truly unique product and I even use it under arms. Lasts awhile too.",

I don't do that anymore because it didn't work as well as in the shower where it stayed moist. Now I just use it when showering, but it's good to know that I have the option of using it without water as well. Also, though it's expensive for what it is, I like it better than other shave creams and I've pretty much tried them all.",
