Even though the warning says not to use it on freshly shaven heads, I tried it anyway because I had to go to work the next day and couldn't wait.I tested the product on a spot for the suggested 4mins, and no hair was removed. I applied to my whole head and waited 5-7mins...when I say my head was SMOOTH. No hair at all remained.Did it burn? Not really. It was starting to get a little warm, and that's when I washed it off. My head stayed the same amount of warmth for about 30-45mins and then I started feeling the coldness from not having hair for the 1st time.The smell wasn't bad. It was like a deluded Nair. If you've smelled the normal Magic Shave and are hesitant, do not be afraid to try this. It doesn't smell like that at all.My head stayed smooth for about 2 days before it started growing back, which was longer than I expected because my hair grows FAST (well, where hair still grows at least...).Would I try this again? Absolutely. It worked so well. It didn't hurt. It didn't stink to high heck. It was no work at all. I wish they had an industrial sized bottle of this.",

                "reviewText": "Where's the magic in Softsheen Carson Magic Razorless Shaving Cream? From my experience, the only magic here is how it managed not to remove hair as advertised, rendering it a spectacular failure in terms of performance.I purchased this product based on many positive reviews promising a razorless, hassle-free shaving experience. With hopeful anticipation, I meticulously followed the instructions. To test its efficacy, I first applied it to a small patch on my scalp in an area shaved down to stubble, leaving it for the suggested time of 4 minutes. Nothing budged.Undeterred and hoping for a better outcome, I extended the application time to 7 minutes in a separate area. While this resulted in some hair removal, it was minimal at best, almost laughably so.The product does not appear to be expired; I can't imagine what went wrong. Could it have been a bad batch? While I'm tempted to try it, this initial disappointment has tarnished my trust in the product's claims.To anyone considering Softsheen Carson Magic Razorless Shaving Cream, tempering your expectations or considering other, more reliable alternatives. In my experience, the magic promised by this product is more illusion than reality.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a razorless alternative to using razors to keep my head smooth other than razors. I did a Google search and many websites pointed to this product. Razorless Cream Shave for Bald Head by SoftSheen Carson was recommended on many websites so I decided to give it a shot.After prepping my head and following instructions, I dabled a thing layer on a small area to see how would my scalp react to it. After leaving it for the recommended 4 minutes and wiping it off, it was able to remove most of the hairs where I applied the cream and only left me with a small itching sensation.Be aware that many people will react differently from no reaction to burns so DON'T skip this step.I then began to apply it on the rest of my head, but I left it a bit longer to about 8-10 minutes. After time passed, I grabbed a small towel and filled the bathroom sink with some warm to hot water (not boiling) to help me remove the cream.After wiping the solution off, I noticed that it was able to remove most of of the hairs on my head and without any other problems, at least most of my head. In a small area in the front of my head, it left a reddish area that was burning a bit but it went away after several minutes.There were a few small areas where hair stubble remained and added a bit of cream again and repeated the process as above. It removed most of that remaining hair from my head.There are my overall opinions on it:Pro: It works in removing most of the head hair leaving it with a smooth look and feel that even the sharpest of razors cannot do. The cream is easy to apply and to remove.Cons: It does have a smell like most hair removal solutions, but it is not very overpowering. It doesn't remove all the hair 100% so you may need to apply a bit more or just use a sharp razor. Depending on your skin, might leave you with an unpleasant itching or even burning areas so please don't skip the testing step.Overall I liked this hair removal product and I will but it another time when I run out. I will continue to use it carefully.Remember, results will vary depending on the person so please do a little test and read all the instructions.If I could I would give it 3.5-3.8 stars out of 5 stars.",

I have been shaving my head for 12 years and always wanted to try a dipiliatory aftwr seeing how it worked for my black friend. My mistake, I think, is assuming hair is hair. I know this says it's formulated for black hair, but I figured at less than 1/8 of an inch, hair is hair.I put it on as directed, tested a spot after 4 minutes, and then at 6 minutes I removed it with a wash cloth. Nothing. The hair was untouched. So, I shaved in the shower as usual and felt a slow burn after. However, this is the closest feeling shave I've ever had, and it looks great.The product felt cooling while it was on my head, and the scent was nice compared to Nair and Veet (others I use on my body). So, 3 stars for the product, but only 3 because it didn't remove my hair.",
