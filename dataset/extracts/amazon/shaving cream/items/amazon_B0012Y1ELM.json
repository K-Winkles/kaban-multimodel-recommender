                "reviewText": "This Palmolive shave cream is FANTASTIC! I love and embrace a real barber shop shave experience! A few years back I researched and fell in love with the art of an old school close shave. I invested in what I believe to be best double edge razor and blades to the best imported shave creams, oils brushes and tools and included lots of me trying many, many shave products . My goal was to find the closest shave possible and simply the best shave experience. This Palmolive is a top shelf import great shave product! I like this product better than anything I have tried at any price! I find it odd the the American market does not embrace tube shaving creams as the only choice is can shave cream or can gel when a dab of this Palmolive For Men Classic Palm Extract Shave Cream is far, far, far superior to any can cream at any price!I do find I like to mix shave products for better results based on years of my trial and error. My perfect shave mix starts with the green tub of Proraso shave soap, then add a dab of this Palmolive shave cream and 2 drops of shave secret shave oil and whip into a rich lather using a badger hair brush and I get the best closest shave I have ever had. This Pamolive is great on it's own but my special mix takes my shave over the top!",

Amazon just stuck the 2 electronic pieces and this shave cream into a thin-walled brown shipping envelope that had no internal air bubbles, just thin paper. The shave cream took a major hit during the shipping, yet to see if the 2 electronic pieces will function. At least if Amazon had used a small box in this shipment; Terrible Packaging!",

I am not sure, but it's still the best shave cream and gives the closest best shave.Wet your face with hot water. Put about an inch of this in one hand. And divide that up on each cheak and on your chine. Then rub into your face until a rich cream forms. Then shave. Great stuff !",
