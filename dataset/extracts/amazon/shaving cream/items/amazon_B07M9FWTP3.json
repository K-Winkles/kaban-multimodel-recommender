I have sensitive skin and there\u2019s not many shave soaps or creams I\u2019ve used that haven\u2019t irritated me and made my face (and especially neck) red, but this one I was very pleased with. Lather builds well, a little goes a long way, with decent slickness for a second pass. Didn\u2019t dry my face out and the clary sage scent is moderate and very nice, but doesn\u2019t last long post shave (not a pro or con for me particularly but might be for some). Plus it works with and w/o a shave brush, I personally use a shave bowl as well but it\u2019s not necessary as face lathering works just fine.",
