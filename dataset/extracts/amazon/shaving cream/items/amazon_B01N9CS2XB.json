You also don\u2019t need too much product for each shave, which helps the product last longer. It has a really nice cooling scent and feel after the shave.

                "reviewText": "I recently switched from The Art of Shaving (TAoS) shave cream to this.Pros:As good or better in all aspects. Especially price. The scent is nice, although not the Sandalwood scent that I am used to or have encountered before. It's not bad at all, it's just not 'sandalwood'.Cons:I prefer unscented shave cream so that any lingering/latent scent from shaving is not present post-shave, when I may choose to use a different scented after-shave lotion or cologne. I don't like having competing scents, neither does my wife.It would be great if there were an unscented version of this. I would definitely buy that. I will definitely buy this product again.",

                "reviewText": "I looked for a long time to find a shaving cream that wasn't loaded with ingredients that I didn't want all over my face.This one fit the bill, and it did not disappoint. I've used Proraso (which is very nice), and Art of Shaving (all Sandalwood), and for the price, smell, and feel, the Rocky Mountain wins out.Not to put down Proraso or Art of Shaving. Art of Shaving Sandalwood has an amazing smell, and I love their pre-shave, and after shave balms, but I wanted something with fewer, and simplier ingredients.The Rocky Mountain Barber Company (whew, that's a lot to type, let's go with RMBC), shaving cream is made with the following:Water, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (coconut oil), Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Aloe Barbadensis, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance/parfum, Menthol, Sodium Borate, Glyceral Caprylate and Glycercal Undecylenate, Allantoin, Santalum Spicatum (sandalwood) oil.It's got real sandalwood oil in it (other creams will only list it as fragrance, but this has the real Santalum Spicatum in it), but the smell, probably from the coconut oil is somewhat sweet, and the addition of menthol makes it go on very cool. You almost don't need an after shave balm with this. Just rinse with cold water, and you'll really feel it. It's awesome.I will say that this is much more viscous than other creams. It goes on thick, and I find myself needing to really clean out my double edge razor. I think the trick is that a little goes a long way. There's no need to over-do the application.Since it is a little more viscus, I find I need to clean out my application brush a little better than with other creams.Small price to pay however for a shaving cream that is fantastic.The tin is high quality and could be used to store spent razors (if you use double edge) for later disposal.All in all. This is great stuff.",

                "reviewText": "So I'm looking for a new pre-shave, shave cream/soap, and after shave balm. My fall-back go to since 2010 has been the Art of Shaving Sandalwood. In the last couple of years they've changed up their formula, and it doesn't have the same long-lasting smell as it did before. What I'm looking for is a scent that people smell and comment on how great it smells, like they did when I first started using AoS products. This product didn't fill those hopes.This shave cream is mediocre.Pros:- It has the exact same scent profile as the oil and after-shave balm, so you don't have to worry about conflicting scents.- It made a pretty good lather. Others, as I've read, had trouble with this however I didn't. It needs a little moisture to get going, but was pretty good.- My favorite part about this was the added menthol umph! I didn't expect it, and I really welcomed the feeling.Cons:- The scent, like the rest of the line of products doesn't meet the AoS Sandalwood standard. This stuff has more of a barbasol scent, but added in a hint of sandalwood with a sweet smelling profile. Almost as if you combine barbasol and swisher sweets (small, sweet smelling cigars). It's not a bad smell, just not what I'm looking to be my go-to scent.- The scent wears off about halfway through the day. I want a scent that stays.",

                "reviewText": "I got into brush shaving a while back and was paying $$$$ too much for Art of Shaving versions of the oil and shave cream. Tried several other shave creams and soaps, besides AOS, including Lather & Wood and Van Der Hagan. AOS products usually provided richer lather, but were too pricey. This shave cream reminds me a lot of the AOS shave cream, but at a much more affordable price. Lather is rich and creamy off a brush. You don't need much. Maybe a dime size dollop. I put that on the lid and use the brush to work up a lather that I then apply to my face. There's usually enough cream to do one pass with the grain and then lather up again to go against the grain. The menthol is a nice soothing touch that I really enjoy. And the cream provides great glide for the razor. The remainder also rinses off cleanly. I'm definitely going back to this one again.",
