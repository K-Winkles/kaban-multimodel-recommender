                "reviewText": "I've been using the Kiss My Face Moisture Shave for years and would never use anything else. After trying dozens of different shave creams, I have found nothing that compares to the KMF shave cream.As someone with very sensitive facial skin, along with thick, coarse facial hair, I really need a cream that will protect my skin while allowing for a very close shave. KMF lubricates the skin incredibly well and I never end up with irritation after shaving. Personally, I love the smell of the Peaceful Patchouli - it's my favorite. But each of the other scents are very pleasant and don't linger. I have found that the product tends to work best if you take a moment to massage the cream on the face before beginning to shave.If you're wanting a more natural shave cream, I can't recommend this product highly enough!",

                "reviewText": "I've tried all kinds of shaving products from foams/gels/soaps/lotions. They all essentially get the job done. I've found that for my face, the soaps/brush end up being too drying, and some of the \"moisturizing\" lotions are sometimes just too greasy. The foams & gels are okay, but I don't need a can rusting in my shower. This product is just right for my face in the spectrum of moisturizing qualities. This has excellent glide with both disposable multi-blade razors and with classic safety razors and also rinses away cleanly.After a few months in silicone refillable travel tubes it dries out and is a little challenging to re-constitute",

                "reviewText": "Overview- Great for guys who shave traditionally. Maybe for gals, too, but I can't speak to that! It gives a lot of creamy lather with excellent slickness. The slickness spoils me because I can go over the same spot without causing irritation more times than I can with other creams or soaps. It took a little courage to get past the thought thought that KMF stuff is for women. However, it gets lots of raves on Badger and Blade, a traditional shaving forum that is mostly male.Why didn't I give it 5 Stars? - This cream is labeled fragrance free, and I believe they did not add any fragrance to it. However, it still has a distinctive smell. I think the smell is the natural smell of the ingredients that is normally covered by the added fragrance in other creams. I didn't think too much of it, until my wife kept asking why the bathroom smelled like chemicals when I shaved? So, I switched to KMF Lavender with Shea Butter. I think it has less smell than this cream, and the added Shea butter is great for my skin. And my wife is happy. I was worried about smelling like lavender all day, but I barely smell it while I'm shaving, let alone when I'm done.How I use it- I use a shaving brush to build a good lather. I soak the brush while I shower, then shave right after getting out of the shower while my whiskers are still wet. I rub some of this cream all over my beard. How much to use will vary buy person, start out with a dollop about 1 1/2 inches long. After I've applied cream to my face, I take the brush out of the mug where it was soaking, shake a little water out of it, and begin rubbing the brush gently in swirls all over the cream. After a few seconds, it will start to build lather. The large bubbles will get finer and finer until I have a nice thick lather. If I think it is too dry, I dip the very tips of the brush in water, and continue swirling. When it's ready, I smooth it over my face and pick up the excess lather with the brush. The lather now resides in the brush and I set it on it's base, and reapply between each shaving pass.",

                "reviewText": "Don't expect a lather when rubbing into the skin. The 'film' you get from this product is to coat your face with a slippery liquid such that your razor can easily glide across your beard/skin and you can minimize your skin from razor irritation and cuts. This concepts works well, but the down-side, in my opinion, is that (1) your razor may get clogged with this somewhat sticky substance and require you to use high pressure water to force the substance out of the multi-blade spaces of your razor, or use a tooth brush to remove the blockages, and (2) your skin will get very slippery with this substance and you will need to repeatedly wash your face to thoroughly remove the substance. If you have the time and not in a rush, then this product is recommended.I usually mix this product with liquid soap or just use liquid soap to shave with my Gillette five-blade razor. After use and rinsing, I pour alcohol over the blades and let dry.",

He was ecstatic and said that it certainly did make shaving a breeze. He loves this product, and I love the perfect light patchouli scent.
