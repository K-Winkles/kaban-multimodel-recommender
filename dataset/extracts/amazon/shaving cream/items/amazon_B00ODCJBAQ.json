                "reviewText": "Coming from Proraso Sensitive creams, this is worlds better. There is no need to use a bowl, just wet a brush, give it a few swirls, and it is ready to brush on your face. It quickly makes a super thick soft cream that feels like a soft pita bread on your face. The scent is 95% nothing, and 5% plants, super super minimal. This does not leave behind a moisturizing sticky layer like Proraso does. This can be a good or a bad thing, but it makes washing your face after so much easier.I have very very sensitive skin, and this seemed to do a lot better than the Proraso. I use this and a Rockwell 6s, and I am able to get far fewer ingrown hairs, less redness and irritation. I think it may be slightly easier to cut yourself though, since there is no film left on your face.Afterwards my skin feels super smooth, and moisturized. I love this stuff!Cons: The clear plastic seal inside the cap separates, and falls off. I fixed this by making some double sided tape, and attaching the plastic air seal to the inside of the lid.The packaging is plastic which cannot be recycled, and TOBS does not currently sell cream refill pucks. They really need to change the material of the container, or offer refills wrapped in paper, as it is not sustainable at all.This aside, the product is quite expensive, but I am satisfied. It does super super well on my ultra sensitive skin!",

I would never go back to cartridge razors (worse shave, MUCH more expensive).I just switched to this particular type after using the avacado type for years (seems like it's been discontinued). This cream is slick and frothy, giving a good shave without irritation. I shave 1-2 times per week, using a pea-to-marble size amount, so this little tub lasts me close to a year. I even use their travel size shaving cream.",

And it would usually just be a little too thick for the razor. I knew when I switch to a safety razor it would be even more of a problem. So I use this with a safety razor and it works beautifully and my skin has no negative reaction. Given the fact that almost everything causes the problem with my skin from my knees down this is amazing stuff. I do wish that it came with a a little tiny spoon that would let me scoop out just a little bit of it. I don't like using the back of my thumbnail to do it because it gets under the thumb nail but it works. My suggestion for improvement would be for this company to actually put with it a tiny flat plastic Scooby thing to use to dish out a tiny bit of it.that said you only really need a very little amount of this with a wet shaving brush and bowl and it whips into perfect condition the shave 2 legs. It is a good budget item.",

                "reviewText": "I am a professional honemeister and straight razor enthusiast. This is by far the best cream I have used to date, after having tried many many soaps and cremes. My priority was to find an organic cream, so my \"values\" override potential performance advantages of standard, synthetic ingredient products. However, I have found no downsides to this organic cream, and have no need to regard it as a \"compromise\". It does everything I would want any cream to do, and even better than any standard cream, at that.I have learned in my trade that many users do not know how to properly whip up a lather and this is due to many variables including type of brush, soaking brush for 15 minutes in warm water or not, your water hardness, temperature of water, how much water is added into mix, and total whipping time. It takes a good 3-5 minutes and slowly adding in water to whip up a consistent, shimmering lather. Experiment with these variables and you are sure to find the right blend. I find only a peanut sized amount of cream is sufficient to produce enough lather for 4-5 full face coatings (passes). This is MORE than enough, as most should not need to perform more than 2-3 passes at a single session.Good luck and have fun!",

I have previously used the Sandalwood cream but my wife is seriously put off by the smell, and I also think the smell is rather strong although I have gotten used to it. But the Organic cream lathers practically just as well as the Sandalwood and it has no smell, so it's a winner! I have considered buying their soap products but they are priced the same as the shaving cream, so why bother with the extra work? Taylor's shaving creams are the best in the world and this product is no exception.",

This cream is stiffer and lasts longer by some 30% ie 4 months instead of three for the same daily use. The depth of foam takes a little more effort, but spread is excellent and scent is simply neutral. I will now be repeating as my regular order. Just need all the perfumes to be available!",
