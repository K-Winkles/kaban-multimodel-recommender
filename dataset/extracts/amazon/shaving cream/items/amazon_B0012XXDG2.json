                "reviewText": "I love this cream. I just put a bit on my hand, pat my hands together, and then rub on my beard. I don't see any need for a brush/mug. It goes on easy. I get a more gentle and smoother shave than I have had with any other brand/type. It is not the cheapest. It goes a pretty good ways for me. Super slick. I don't find it gums up my razor if I keep it rinsed well.Update: I just reordered two more tubes of this shave cream. It IS the best shave cream I have ever used. I have a relatively coarse beard and need to shave every morning if I want to have a clean face, which has nothing to do with this cream. It provides as close a shave as any other cream I have ever used.A little bit does indeed go a long way for me. It is super slick. As someone else said, I use about a dime size (tube thick). It doesn't lather up much. I'm not sure what that matters actually. As slick as it is I don't need it. And it washes off clean and fairly quickly. It has a subtle scent which is different than I have ever smelled before. I find it nice and it doesn't really smell after I dry off. I am not a shave cream snob as (no offense intended) some others seem to be. They like their rituals and if that works for them, great. I don't use a shave cream brush. I just put the small amount in my palm and use a couple of fingers from the other hand to mash it up and then apply. It also will not gum up my blades as I have seen with some other foamy creams. I guess I am giving it a rave review, and I am.",

Not wanting to take too many liquids or gels, I bought this on arrival.This is the best shave cream in my experience, seriously. I'm actually a beard person, but I still shave to keep it trim. Combined with a badger-hair brush for lathering, this cream foams wonderfully and shaves cleanly. Unlike most American products, Speick does not overload their products with perfume or unnecessary ingredients. This has a lavender scent that is subtle and not unpleasant. Also, I use only about a 1/2\" ribbon of cream for each shave, with more than enough lather created for the entire shave.",

La schiuma prodotta dal pennello (con una quantit\u00e0 di acqua non eccessiva) \u00e8 abbondante e densa e protegge bene la pelle. La qualit\u00e0 che pi\u00f9 si apprezza \u00e8 la lubrificazione: una volta passato il rasoio, la pelle non si secca ma rimane scivolosa. Questo permette di ripassare la lama senza che s\u2019inceppi. Unico neo: la crema da barba \u00e8 contenuta in un tubo di alluminio, che forse nel trasporto in valigia risente un po\u2019 troppo degli urti. Non per\u00f2 tanto da rompersi.",
