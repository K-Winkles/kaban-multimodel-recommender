Such a clean scent and the foam is like silk on his face. It allows such a cleaner shave than anything else I've used and his face isn't all red when I get done. I love this product. I was hesitant to buy it, because it's so expensive on Amazon, but I couldn't find it anywhere else. So I splurged and bought it. I am not sorry at all.
