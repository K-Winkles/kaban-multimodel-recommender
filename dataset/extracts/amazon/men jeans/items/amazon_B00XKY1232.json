                "reviewText": "I like these pants; they fit great (I prefer a little loose rather than tight/slim pants) and give me the impression that they will last a while. I've washed them several times now and they still have that same dark blue color, so no fading yet, and they don't seem to have shrunk any. The only thing I've noticed with them is that the side leg pocket is just a tad smaller (in width) than all the other carpenter pants I wear. I intentionally buy carpenter pants, and have for many years, because I always keep my iPhone in the side pocket (the deeper one, not the shallow one). But with these pants, I noticed that I have to work my phone in just right to get it to fit properly. But, it still fits, and these pants look and feel nice, so I am happy.",

                "reviewText": "Been wearing these carpenter pants ever since the Faded Glory carpenter pants became unavailable about 7 years ago. They've been good cheap work pants that have worked well for me and not been too big of deal when a pair accidentally gets destroyed. I do have a few issues with them though, specifically with how it seems they keep shrinking the tech pocket down to where many standard phones won't fit anymore.I have visited local wally worlds checking every pair of these pants in my size for probably 6 months, trying to find one that would fit my phone. All of them were way too tight of a fit. I could tell even if I could get the phone around the corner the pocket itself was slightly too narrow.Decided to gamble online and purchased 3 pairs of 40x32 and to my surprise they all fit perfect, doesn't seem to vary from pair to pair. The tech pocket on all 3 was slightly larger than what I had found in the store, but I still had to stretch the opening and pop a couple stitches to comfortably slide my phone in and out of it. One thing I have noticed when these pockets have been a little tight at first, when you are constantly putting your phone in and out of it, it does loosen up with time, so a snug fit to start is not a bad thing. Just wish I didn't have to pop stitches to get it started.I had already contacted the manufacturer about the tech pocket getting too small to fit common smart phones, they said they'd forward it to the product development engineers for consideration, so hopefully in the future we'll see this pocket open up a little more. I don't expect it to fit the big \"note\" style phones, but an extra 1/4\" of width would make a world of difference for most people who love these pants specifically for the good design and placement of the cell pocket... or \"tech\" pocket.My other issue I brought up with the manufacturer was the pocket liners. They are terribly thin and it doesn't take long for my keys to start poking holes thru the bottom. At least I can fix it by folding over the bottom of the pocket and stitching it up, but it would really be nice if the material was a little better like what you get in Carhartts. These are cheaper than the Carhartts, but not by that much. I definitely prefer the cell phone pocket design in the Wranglers. Carhartt's cell pockets like 1/2\" wider, but too shallow. The top of my phone pokes out and there's nothing to keep the phone from falling out if I'm working on the ground or even just reclining on a couch. Glad I found some Wranglers that will work, and 3 identical pairs too!",
