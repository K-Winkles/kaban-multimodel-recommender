                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a pair of ARIAT Flame Resistant pants and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As an overly worked and ruggedly handsome husband and father, I needed a pair of pants that could keep up with my abuse, not wear thin and still be comfortable. These pants exceeded my expectations in all of those areas. The material is durable and has held up well to daily wear and tear. Additionally, the pants are extremely comfortable, with a relaxed fit that allows for plenty of movement. I was also pleased to find that the pants are breathable and don't cause my important bits to sweat uncontrollably. The added bonus of having a lower likelihood of my pants catching on fire is a comforting plus. Despite the price, I will be buying another pair as soon as my wife allows me to spend my overtime money on another pair. Overall, I highly recommend these pants to anyone in need of durable, comfortable, and flame-resistant pants.",

Ariat has found and exceeded that point. I love carpenter jeans to throw dikes and a screwdriver in, but i find myself misplacing stuff or sticking my phone or wallet in one ofthe shallow pockets on accident and losing them. Over all not bad for fr, and seem much better made than others, but i will try to find somethin a bit less excessive next time. Maybe a different style because they are durable.",

Please note I consistently wear a 32 x 34 in Levi and Wrangler. I see there are a few choices in color and although it should not be different sizing and construction we will see. The other pairs I ordered are the kacki.Previous post- Received Ariat Relaxed Workhorse Boot Cut pants and they were very very big. I normally wear a 32 x 34, weigh about 165, and 5' 10\". There was a substantial amount of room throughout. The legs and waist were probably about 4 \" in excess. Pants were well made and useable pockets to last all day long. I liked them so much that I ordered a 31 x 32 and will give that a try. I am looking forward to receiving them.",
