The jean fit, style, and comfort to match your various outings and not look like you are wearing the typical \"blue jeans\". The price is great for the style, fit, and durability of Wrangler.",

                "reviewText": "Just recieved my 4th pair of these jeans. Ordered in 2021,2022, 2023, and again in 2023. The 2021 pair just kicked the bucket a couple weeks ago and the 2022 pair just started a hole in the knee. After receiving the 4tj pair today, I realized the two pair from 2023 are slightly larger in the waist and about 1.5\" longer than the previous pairs. Picture attached. I'm someone who probably \"really\" should be wearing a 28 or 29 length, so adding extra length to the 30\" length is slightly problematic. I still love them and just realized they are made in Egypt instead of China like the first pair I ordered (I think they were). Probably won't get them hemmed, but will try real hard to shrink them some lolPrevious review******Ive ordered 3 pairs of these and they've become my forvorite jeans. The picture I've taken is newest to oldest. The oldest pair are just over 2 years old and they get worn to work frequently now. The knee opened up about 6 months ago. The second pair is about 10 months old, and I can see the knee is getting pretty worn (I've worn them a TON) , so I wanted a new pair for church, etc.I like that the hole seems to \"shrink\" with the jeans when washing better than regular jeans. I'm assuming this is due to the spandex or whatever they have in them. I love these jeans!!!!!",
