We believe that clothing should be designed to fit the needs of the people wearing it. We have held this belief to our heart from the beginning \u2014 from 1947 , when we started up in Greensboro, North Carolina. We embarked on a platform of innovation and with an idea to create jeans, jackets and shirts for cowboys. We added special features. We added functionality. For instance, flat rivets that wouldn\u2019t scratch your saddle, watch pockets, seven belt loops (instead of the usual five), and yoke seam over panel for keeping your wallet in place. Functional design details still remain vital, adapting to modern looks and needs. Now, with jeans being worn by millions every day, we are totally committed to improving the everyday functionality of our jeans and to make a huge and positive difference to your life. Our ground-breaking innovative platform, Denim Performance, started with our understanding of what riders need from a pair of jeans: Tough Gear, Sun Shield, Cool Vantage and Water Repellent. We move with the times, often leading the way to providing more comfortable, more stylish and more innovative every day denim wear.

While these are not as thick as the cowboy cut regular denim, they are an excellent alternative for a dress pant option while still wanting to wear boots with. I have these in dark denim and black and they are some of the most comfortable wranglers I own. They are a bit smaller compared to the regular, thicker denim cowboy cut but not alarmingly tighter. That is why the these jeans make a great alternative for dress up events. Paired with a blazer or dress shirt, one can still remain cowboy/country without having to ditch the denim. High recommend, and stick to your regular wrangler size.",

Too big equals a bit of a sloppy look. Plus the denim is lighter weight than expected. Pretty much still looking for the right khaki pair of jeans.",
