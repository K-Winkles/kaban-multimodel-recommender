                "reviewText": "I consider myself to be a biased reviewer as I typically drift towards Japanese denim , own about one hundred pair of jeans, and typically spend $200 minimum on each pair.I am 5\u20199 174lbs and well built.I ordered a 32 waist and 34 length. These jeans fit fantastically, I\u2019ve ordered four more pairs. I like additional length in the inseam; I was surprised that even at a 34 inseam and at my height 5\u20199\u201d the jeans carry less length than expected as the jeans stack around my ankle or an inch below it.These are advertised as mid-low rise and I find this to be mostly true, they can be work higher on the waist than a true low or mid rise jean.There is a decent amount of stretch in these.Have washed several times with no change in color or size whatsoever.As a guy at 5\u20199 fairly short but built around ~175 these may be the best fitting jeans I\u2019ve ever found bar none. I own plenty of naked & famous, nudie jeans, 3sixteen, Japan blue, apc, ACNE, etc and these Levis carry one of the best fits I\u2019ve ever found. Snug around my glutes but some room and flex in the fabric, fit well around the front rise, snug around my thighs and calves. Not too tight anywhere at all. Not a skinny Jean, slim is the correct description.Can\u2019t recommend more highly",

                "reviewText": "Look, when it comes to proper fitting clothes i do not mess around. This jeans literally makes me smile sheepishly. As a 5ft6 male with an athletic build you can imagine i have a few struggles with off-the-rack pants every now and then. However, this 512s are not my exact fit length wise regardless, every other thing is PERFECT. With 24\" quads, 14\" calfs and 31\" waist, the 30*30 size has a sublime fit on me. Although, i have to roll the pants up twice since i wear chukka boots most of the time, it still looks exquisite. Needless to say Levi's outdid themselves with this cut. It is not skin tight like the 510's and the leg opening is not wide like the 511's. It's a hybrid of both. It has enough room in the thighs with a decently aggressive taper below the knee (that is miles from skin tight) and ends up with a 13\" leg opening at the bottom. This is my dream jeans. I've attached a photo to show you how gorgeous i look in this. I ordered the Avenger (black), Skarkely (navy) and Noise Addict (gray). Thank you Levi's.",

                "reviewText": "So people can use me as comparison: I am 5'9\" 155ish pounds, slim athletic build, typically wear 30w30l. Slim fit is my go-to because regular cut looks like boot cut and are just too baggy.These pants are fantastic. Great fit in the waist and thighs (thighs are nearly skin tight, just a bit of room which was expected, I have pretty bulky thighs). Very comfortable and has a lots of stretch for mobility. No problems doing the Asian squat (google it) or any other movement for that matter.Reason for 4 star - these fit much more like skinny jeans than they do slim fit. The calves have a little room but they are tight enough that they ride up my calves a bit throughout a workday. They also seem to be a bit shorter than a 30l usually is, I could have gone 32l and rolled them slightly for a better fit, but a 31l would have been perfect.I like the 512's overall, but I'm going to give the 513's a try. I think the slim straight would resolve my minimal issues with the slim tapered.In short, if you're looking for a fitted but not skin tight, I'd skip the tapered legs and go for the straight cut.",

                "reviewText": "This is about the Marshmallow Burnout Distressed (white pants with trendy holes) size 34x32. The material is a little rougher than my other Levi\u2019s. They feel a bit tighter all around. I bought a size 34 and they fit nice and tight. I\u2019m too fat for a size 32 but can fit a size 33 and 34 with a belt (I suppose I have an odd shape). These pants fit fine without a belt. So if you\u2019re pushing the boundaries on a size 34 you might want to go a size higher. If you\u2019re a size 33 they\u2019ll fit you fine.I\u2019ve purchased about a dozen pairs of Levi\u2019s over the last year all 510 and 512 from all over the internet and in stores. The fit is unique to this color and style. All my other Levi\u2019s do have their inconsistencies but they all fit great and are amazing.I bought these for $17.37 to bum around the house in so no complaints here.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a pretty muscular guy--in particular, I squat frequently, and have very large quads--as such, I like a jean with a stretch and a taper. For the past few years, I've been wearing Levi's 511's, which are actually pretty good, however, my biggest gripe with the 511 is that the pants are always way too long. I am 5'8\" and 215lbs, and wear a 34 waist with a 29 inseam, yet, I still have to roll my pants multiple times in the 511 in order to prevent bunching at the bottoms of the jeans.On the contrary, the 512's, which fit much the same in the waist and thigh, hit me right in the ankle with no bunching whatsoever. Additionally, these pants have a much harder taper below the knee, providing a sleeker silhouette, which is pretty nice when you're built all wide and blocky like yours truly.Depending on your style and your needs, these may be a better option than Levi's 511 jean. I know that I will certainly be wearing the 512 from now on.",

                "reviewText": "For a close-up view, refer to an image posted by the 1-star reviewer, Luis C Gonzalez. Be aware that this hole is cut out of the back right pocket on purpose and there is no stitching at the hem. Both are visible in the images available by Amazon for this particular color. Also, be aware that these run really, really small. The taper on the legs is more extreme than the hips but it is an extreme taper. For reference, my size is 28x32(+/- 1 inch in waist and length). I started with 28x32, then tried 29x30, and finally 30x30 which are still quite tight in the legs, but 1 more inch in the waist will be too loose. If you want a looser fit as seen in the model's photos, you should start with at least 3 sizes larger.",
