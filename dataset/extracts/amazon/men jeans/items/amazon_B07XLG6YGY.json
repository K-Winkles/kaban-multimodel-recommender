He normally would go for the regular fit but since he lost weight he needed the slim, something less bagging as he put it. I was worried that he might have an issue getting them over his ankles, which you see sometimes with slim pants, but he had no problem. He loves them. We had purchased a couple of these exact pair at Macys for my stepson for at least $20 more than what I paid on Amazon. He is a tall guy and needs slim fit, not skinny fit, as well. He loves the jeans, the fit, and the style. These are perfect for any age for someone looking for a comfortable, durable, slim fitting jean. Sorry I have no photos as I had the jeans sent directly to his house.",

Then recently I found out about the Levi's 531. They have the same amount of wiggle room and comfort that the Wrangler jeans had, but now with a modern twist of tapered lower leg part. Pretty satisfied with my purchase, will update on the longevity of the jeans in the future. My Wranglers typically last 3-5 years of moderate wear.",

                "reviewText": "I used to really like wearing my 511's and 514's but I've been resistance training for the past couple of years and my thighs have increased in mass. Stretchy 511's still kind of fit but are more like tights and 514's basically cut off blood flow at the thighs. I've ended up tearing several of my pants when I've tried to squat wide setting things down that I was carrying.I've bought four different pairs of these in four different colors. The black ones (Native Cali I believe) fit a little more loosely than the other three. I think they provide a pretty solid fit overall. They bunch just a bit at the knees and ankles which I'm fine with as this provides some flex. I'm not as worried about tearing them as other pants when I squat and they look good all around. I'm suspicious that those who don't like them and think they're 'baggy' are people who don't really need an athletic fit i.e. they don't work out or haven't progressed much in their working out. I'm hopeful they'll come out with more colors and not just in denim.",

                "reviewText": "Each pair, style, and color should be rated by themselves. So, I upgraded the 531's to a five star. Because the manufacturer seems to care about the aesthetics of the back-pocket stitching matching/mirroring each other. I bought three different pairs of this fit number and the pockets are not veered off in the back. Many times, I would return pants for having poorly stitched back pockets. Such as one pocket sitting too high or too low than the other. Or one or both pockets moved too far away or one close and one far away from the stitching. But so far. All three pairs seem to have been stitched by skilled experienced hands.I expected this Far Away color to fit similarly to the black Cali Navi. But these pants are a tad bit wider down the legs. But the waist is spot on. However, these pants still give a better tapered look than the Levi's 541 fit. So overall they still look and fit better than the 541's. I also wear the same size in these 531's as in the 541's. But there are some size discrepancies between these Far away (grey) pair and between the Native Cali (black) pair. However, not enough differences to change a waist size or inseam length. These pants stretch. So, if I decide I want a snugger fit in the legs. I could wash them and dry them on high heat to shrink. So far, I have washed my pair in cold water right out the package and hung dry. And as of now all three pairs of these 531\u2019s color and fabric durability has held up well.",
