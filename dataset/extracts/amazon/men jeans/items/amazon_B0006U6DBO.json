                "reviewText": "Jeans to me are something that need to fit, fade, wear, tear, wash, move, and work the right way anytime you need them to. With Wrangler, you get all of that and you get it all of the time. I've always worn Levi's but have always had the thought in the back of my mind that my jeans never quite fit the way i wanted them to. Like most people, I kind of just dealt with it and wore jeans that \"did the job\".I am a guy who, like some others, have an athletic build. Getting jeans to fit just right has always been a bit of a challenge. I finally bit the bullet and decided to do a bit of research on jeans that fit not only well, but correctly. I noticed there weren't many reviews about Wrangler jeans other than what's seen on their website. Could these be the great white buffalo of denim and we just don't know it because people don't want to share their secret? I figured it's time to make a review of these jeans and possibly help out the next person that's on the fence about buying Wranglers over Levi's because let's face it, It really sucks when you try on a pair of jeans at the store and then say to yourself \"I can find these online for a better price\" and then go home, buy the jeans online, receive them, and then they're not what you expected them to be. What's even worse is when you tear all the tags off of them, assuming they're going to fit right, wash them, and then they don't fit and you have to find some shady way to get all the tags back on the jeans, pretend you didn't wash them and send them back only having to wait longer to get another pair of jeans mailed to you.More times than others, Wranglers are referred to as \"Nut Huggers\" but, they're more than that. These are jeans that fit the way that jeans SHOULD fit. I stumbled across the Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut 13MWZ and in this case, the Wrangler Men's George Strait Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jean which are more of a \"fancied\" out version of the regular 13MWZ. I took my chances and was blown away at the product i received.Enough about my rambling. Let's get down to the nitty gritty:Sizing - You're going to want a waist size bigger than what you normally wear because they're cotton. They WILL shrink. If you wear boots and like the \"stacked\" look around the ankle, go up one size in length. For me i normally wear a 32Wx33L. With the Wranglers I bought a 33Wx34L and they shrunk down to denim perfection. I wash my jeans in cold water and dry with normal/medium heat.Fit - One thing I do not like about jeans these days is most are made with multiple materials that allow the jeans to stretch. Wrangler 13MWZ and the George Strait Cowboy cut jeans are 100% Cotton. In my opinion, they have just a bit (the right amount) of stretch while also maintaining their structural durability. They're not stiff to the point you feel like you're wearing sheet metal around your legs.Waist - The waist on these jeans is going to ride a bit higher than you might normally be use to. These DO NOT sit under the waist. This could be why they're referred to as \"nut huggers\" because when you wear them it does feel like they're pulled up a bit on you. That's how they're designed. Not to hug your little ones, but to stay on you while you're getting stuff done like mowing the lawn, working out in the field, running errands, picking berries, arm wrestling, doing heavy squats, etc. (Ladies if you're reading this, you could probably get away with wearing these as high waist jeans or \"Mom\" jeans.)Legs - These jeans are not relaxed fit nor are they boot cut and they're definitely not skinny jeans. They are designed as \"Cowboy cut\". They have a bit extra room in the groin area and the thigh region has an exceptionally well fit with just the right amount of room for someone like me that has the athletic build. towards the ankle, they fit to be worn around a boot. Again, they are NOT boot cut but you can pull them over boots.Color - The colors that Wrangler offers are pretty much endless. There is a color of these jeans out there for just about anyone and everyone. They do start to fade once you start wearing them and washing them but who doesn't want they're jeans to fade? If you're worried about losing color you can always resort to turning the jeans inside out before washing them. (I'm not sure if that actually prevents color loss but I've always been told it works with most clothes going in the laundry.)Belt loops - This is a big one for me. I'll put it to you like this. Wrangler jeans have seven belt loops. That's two more than Levi's do. My biggest pet peeve when wearing Levi's is that when i bend over or am sitting down, the waste of the jeans in the rear tends to slide down on me while my belt stays riding on my skin and not the jeans. Maybe it's just me, but i do not like that. With Wranglers, I don't have that issue due to having the extra 2 belt loops on the back of the jeans.Pockets - The rear pockets are the same size as pretty much any other pair of jeans out there. The front pockets do lack in size (depth) but I don't really put too much stuff in my pockets other than my car keys and cell phone.That's all I got. Am I sponsored by Wrangler? No. Do I rope cattle or work on a ranch? No. Do these jeans fit me the way I want them to? Yes.Buy these jeans.",

                "reviewText": "I've worn Wranglers many years and usually wear the 20X design but like all jean makers nowdays they became hip huggers--short at the toy maker room. I researched and determined the Cowboy design had a longer crouch. But these jeans have very small pockets in front and back . Lot smaller than my 20X and my old George Strait Wranglers. Otherwise they fit great.",
