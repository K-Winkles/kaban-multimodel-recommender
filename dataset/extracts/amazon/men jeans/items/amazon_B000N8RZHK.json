                "reviewText": "I recently bought a pair of 505's and really like the feel of the denim but the legs and opening at the bottoms are way too tight. I have been buying Dickies for over 20 years and the only reason for me to look elsewhere is the front pockets! They are way too short! The rest of the jeans are perfect. The fit at my waist is great, the legs are slightly loose and fall just right over shoes or boots. (this is not the case with 505's) If anyone at Dickies is seeing this, Please just make your front pockets longer (the way they used to be!) and I'll give you 5 Stars! I have to take at least one of those stars away as I've found some quality control issues with these jeans. I had only worn one pair of the two I bought. The second pair doesn't fit correctly, they feel like a size smaller. Both are 33\u00d732 but aren't the same. I ended up with one pair that fits well(short front pockets) for the price of two. Which makes Levi's look better and better.",

If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page.

                "reviewText": "I really like 501's so tried these as an alternative, can't stand the pre-washed, pre-faded junk that's everywhere, that stuff is for women. If your a man and you like men's jeans look no further. First I followed the instuctions on the first wash, inside out on cold and then dried on low, but they didn't shrink very much so I soaked in very hot water for a few hours, wrung out and then dried them on high and they shrunk to size. I also skipped the spin cycle on the wash cause I was afraid they would get ruined like 501s do. Compared to 501 shrink to fit(STF) they are less finicky the first few washes for 501 I felt like I had to baby them the first few washes or they wouldn't fade right. Creases from being in the laundry basket could end up as permanent lines after a wash. These are holding their color great and not fading quickly. The color is better too in my opinion, nice and dark. 501s get blue very quickly. Also the cut is much better the crotch is lower and the legs are straight so they are not tight at all, very relaxed cut of jeans. 501s could get pretty tight depending on how you were sitting and the crotch wouldn't leave much room if you get my drift. One thing I noticed is they are not as thick as 501s, this could be a good or bad thing. Most likely it's due to cheaper denim so probably won't last as long as 501 but they will be cooler in the summer so won't sweat as much in these, so it's a trade off. Also after I shrunk them they are a standard fit to most other jeans but bigger than 501s which I think run a bit smaller than normal jeans. Also unlike 501 you don't have buy a larger size and try to guesstimate how much they are going to shrink. What it says on the jeans is what it will shrink to after a few washes, this makes things so much easier. I do miss the button fly on my 501's and there doesn't seem to be other colors than blue, that being said these jeans beat 501's hands down. Simply amazing for the price. Seeing as I can buy 5 pairs of dickies rigid for the price of one levi 501 I have to give this a 5 star. If they were 40 bucks I would give them a 4 star, still great jeans at that price. BUY THEM!",

                "reviewText": "These are made from tough, rigid denim similar to what's on premium-priced shrink-to-fit jeans, but without the high price. It took 3-4 washes and a couple of days of wearing the jeans to get the fabric to soften up, but I consider that a good thing. It appears that it'll be as durable as the best of other denim jeans, and it's a nice fit - loose enough to be comfortable, without the baggy look that seems so prevalent today.It also took about four washes to get the denim to finish shrinking. I followed my usual protocol (wash in hot water separately, dry until slightly damp, wear until dry, then wash again in cold water, dry completely, and wear as normal), and they were still a bit looser than the final fit - a couple more cycles in the dryer brought them in just a bit more. This probably isn't a shrinking technique that the purists would use, but I'm too busy to put a huge amount of time into getting my jeans shrunk just so.One caution: As with other brands of shrink-to-fit jeans, these ended up shrinking a little more in length than similarly-sized preshrunk jeans. I usually wear a 34 inseam in preshrunk jeans, and with these and other shrink-to-fit jeans I find that just a little too short, so I end up going to a 36. Having experienced this with various other brands, I wasn't terribly surprised, but if you're used to buying preshrunk jeans it's a good thing to keep in mind.",
