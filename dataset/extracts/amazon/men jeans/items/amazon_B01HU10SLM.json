This extra bit of stretch provides added comfort, while also ensuring a superior fit, whatever your body type. Premium Quality We\u2019ve all dealt with the frustration of zippers that don\u2019t close properly and belt loops that fall apart. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve designed a pair of high-quality men\u2019s jeans that will last for years to come. The reinforced stitching prevents tearing at the seams, and brass rivets help hold the fabric together for long-term durability. Perfect for Work or Play Whether you\u2019re going camping with the boys for a weekend of fun or heading out on a 10-hour work shift, these jeans are all you need. Stylish enough for the office and amazingly comfortable for everyday wear, Urban Star jeans are well known for their versatility. Sure to become your go-to pants for every occasion.",

                "reviewText": "I am extremely happy and very suprised at the way these jeans fit and feel. I'm an average build with a little bit of a stomach, not a pot belly. After wasting alot of money in search of comfort on levi 550'5, 559's, wrangler relaxed fit, comfort fits etc, they are all getting donated every last one of them I have never found a pair of jeans as well fitting, relaxed and comfortable as these! They are either too long, too short, too baggy, sag in the front or in the back or to restrictive when I sit down, not to mention heavy with really thick material. I loved the first pair so much in light blue before I even took them off as I was trying them on I immediately ordered the dark blue, black and gray pairs too. I wear between a 36 and a 38 waist, my length is about a 30-31.Because it has a stretchy waist I went with the 36x32\"s with these jeans and can wear them without a belt with zero restriction or discomfort and maximum comfort. The crotch and the rear fit so comfortably and perfect with absolutely no sag or bunching up. Thighs are relaxed just right, the don't hug my thighs and yet are not baggy and it seems as though they are tapered just a little down to my feet where they look clean with my boots, shoes, and sneaks without being baggy, like a straight leg or a boot cut meaning I can lift my leg and the jeans don't pull up and move around a whole lot.The length is also perfect. I have never had a pair of jeans that a 32 length would fit just right. They were always wayyy to long for me and would bunch up like parachute pants which I hated.The material is light, soft and flexible as needed with zero restriction . They feel great even in this hot florida weather. The gray is very nice as is the dark blue and the black. I could not be happier. I'm actually contemplating buying another set of all 4 colors as backup in case these wear out. I don't think I'll ever be going back to the other brands ever again. Prices are very worth it and shipping was fast and on time. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "About 7 years ago I bought a pair of these pants from Costco. They're durable, comfy, stretch, and fit very well. They seem to not sell these at Costco and have him for a few years now so I've been buying them from Amazon. I use these pants for work and outside of work. They're honestly the only pants I like to wear and own like 12 pairs of them. You're picky about pants or have a job where you're bending over up and down climbing up ladders ETC I highly recommend wearing them. Jobs like mine and other labor intensive jobs are uncomfortable enough especially in the summer so having comfortable pants is a necessity for me. Definitely recommend buying them",
