These fit just right - not skin tight and not baggy either. I absolutely LOVE these, and they come in so many fabulous colors and you can't beat the price. They also hold up well to many, many washings, but do fade a little over time, which isn't a problem. My husband is too muscular and has too much booty for these, but if you know someone on the thin side, buy them! You won't be sorry.",

The price was not bad either.What I didn't like so much:I thought it said 38x32. But maybe I read wrong? Because the length of the pants is about 5-6 inches long, it felt like these were a \"tall\" fit more like a 38x36. Since I normally wear a 38x30, I planned to take them to get altered anyway; but figured to share with others just as fyi. Also, I bought 2 different colors, and on both the button seems rather loose. The taylor I took them to, said to expect to replace the button in a couple of months. I also felt the back seat of the pants was too low and didn't quite give full coverage adequately. Meaning, they feel like when I bend down or crouch down a \"plumbers crack\" is happening, if you get my drift. Which I found odd, because someone else reviewed them saying these worked perfectly to provide coverage if you have a larger than average buttocks. I didn't have the same experience.I guess you get what you pay for?",

They're thinner, stretchier, cooler material than a pair of Levi's 511 stretch jeans - so probably not as durable or warm, but they cost 70% less, so I'd rather have 3-4 pairs of these for my money. There's nothing weird about them, the label is hidden by build - they look like Levis. Colors and sizes were accurate and they they're not wrinkly if you hang them up right out of the dryer.",

                "reviewText": "When pants could be made of the same fabric, but one place has it for a certain amount, and the other place has it for 100% more, it can be pretty tough to think that the lesser priced one would have the same quality as a higher price one. In this case and with these jeans, what's been proven to me is the only difference is whether or not you would care if you drastically overpaid on something or not. The fit looks good, I will mention because I noticed it, when I was at work and just standing, that the heat built up a little quickly. And I'm sure it is an aspect of the fabric. But I didn't wash them before I wore them because I had to go right to work, and if you wash them first in cold water and no dryer not even tumble dryer, they dry quickly and will feel a lot better. I am perpetually broke, and overly practical. I recommend these jeans, or send me a message and I'll give you 10 bucks if you don't like them lol. I am 6 ft tall, so I'm told, I can never turn my head around enough to actually see. I weigh probably 170, most in the form of a belly built by cookie dough ice cream. So it's not a even amount of overweightness, but a particular genre. I wear a 33 waist, with a 32 inseam. As with all jeans now and the past 6 years for some reason they're not cutting the cuffs at all so you got to roll them up. But the bottom is tapered just enough to where you can roll it up as little bag in it looks normal. They're just good for the price. It seems exactly right, and I'm very surprised that they were Amazon brand when thinking of the quality and affordability.",
