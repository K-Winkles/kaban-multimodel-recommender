The stretch fabric and waste are very soft and comfortable The do run a full size bigger than any other jeans I wear. For me, Levi's 550 tend to run a size small in the waste and Silvers true to size. These Lucky 363 vintage jeans fit well all over, slightly lose in the waste but not so big you have to wear a belt. I have big thighs so they are snug, but not tight, when first put on but loosen a bit after an hour or so. If you want jeans that do not feel like you are wearing jeans, these are the ones for you. They are not nearly as heavy duty as Levi 550 so use for typical blue collar type jobs might not be the best. Office jeans, around town jeans, they are perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I've ordered several of these Paradise Valley 363s. They are comfortable and a little relaxed for a straight fit without being baggy or too wide. However, I have noticed that that the ones made in the Indonesian factory are noticeably better than the ones made in China.First, I immediately notice the pair made in Indonesia are thicker and heavier. They may take a few washes to break in and soften up but I suspect they will be more durable and last much longer.Second, the patch on the back is real leather and can be used as a belt loop compared to the plain plastic-looking patch on the pair made in China.Third, the smaller patches have white and gold color where the pair made in China only have white.Finally, the pocket liners are deeper and have clovers on them, but the pair made in China don't. If you have a tall phone or carry a lot in your pockets, you'll notice the shallow pockets on Chinese pair.Overall, they are both great, but the pair made in Indonesia look and feel more like a $100 pair of jeans.The pictures are side by side comparisons, both ordered from this listing only days apart and both shipped from Amazon. Both pairs have only been washed and dried 1 time.",
