These jeans have no option for inseam length and are super long on me.- The waist was slightly loose on me despite ordering my size, but nothing a pair of suspenders can't fix.I am buying another pair of these pants in black. I love them.",

                "reviewText": "Surprised by how utilitarian these jeans are. Wear them, wash them, dress them up with a white starched shirt and Chelsea boots or dress them down with an Altamont 1969 T and loafers. The blue is royal sapphire and subtly very handsome. Quality: Ok for the price. Fit: I am 5'11 and 155 lbs. I usually wear a 34. The stretch factor allowed for me to comfortably order a size 32. The fit was great. I also ordered a 34 and the fit was fine, as well. The stretch makes the diffficulty of finding your correct fit easy disappear. The length is my only complaint. It is 32 for all of them. I would like to have had the choice between a 32 and 34. I bought most of the colors, but the white and royal sapphire are my favorites.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these jeans about a year ago, however I only started wearing them a few months ago. I've worn the jeans less than ten times in the past three or for months, just wearing around the house, not doing any work or physical activity in them, basically just comfort jeans for around the house hanging with my family. The jeans are just a tad big on me, so not even close to being tight, yet after wearing only a few times holes started developing in the knees and the pocket liners ripped after two washes, I own LOTS of similar jeans from different brands and have had zero issues with them, this is the only brand I've had trouble with. Wish I would have worn them right after purchasing so I could have returned them when I realized how poor quality they are. I would highly suggest seeking out a different brand if you're in the market for some skinny jeans.",
