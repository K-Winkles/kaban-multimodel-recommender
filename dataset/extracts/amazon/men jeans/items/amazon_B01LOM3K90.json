I am between a 32 - 33 waist and got these in a 33. They fit well, although I could of easily had a great fit in a 32 as well. The cotton blend in these make for a stretch denim, which in turn makes the waistline very comfortable and flexible. The stretch in the waistline easily allows for an extra inch - possibly two.By way of comparison, I also wear Diesel, Lucky, Levis, Silver and some other David Buffalo Bittons.Giving these a 5 star rating doesn't come lightly - Diesels are great and the others are very good as well.These are easily the best Buffaloes I have gotten. Fit is very similar to the Lucky Heritage 121 slims - however, these are softer, have more flexibility and with my 33's (versus getting the 32's), the fit is marginally looser than the Lucky 121's.If you like the Lucky 121's, you will definitely like these Buffaloes. If you are between sizes, order down for a comfortable, snug fit ... up one inch if you prefer a somewhat loose fit.Got these for about $33 - a great deal considering how comfortable & stylish they are.If you like this cut of jeans - ones that are marginally slimmer than your typical straight leg - these are it.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought many pairs of Sixes in the past. The quality of these is slightly lower than expected, and they have a tendency to lay oddly on my legs, with the outer seams clinging to the outside while the inside seams hang far from the inside, resulting in a slightly goofy look unless you've got shoes that can force the cuffs into their proper place. If they were any shorter, they'd look absolutely stupid with a pair of Converse, which are my go-to shoes, but if you get them at a length that stretches to the ankle they look fine.Aside from the fit, the material is fantastic, as always. Soft denim with a deep indigo wash (I bought the Authentic Deep Indigo) that doesn't fade much with repeated washing. It's got a good amount of stretch that doesn't shrink much in the wash and will stretch back to its original form within a few hours of wear.Would I recommend them? Depends, I guess. If you're looking for something long, I'd go for them, as most shoes will force them into a proper fit. If you're going for the slightly high cuff hipster look, they'll look awful, so don't bother. It's also possible I got a pair with misaligned seams, but I can only review the product as received, so that's what I'm doing.",
