                "reviewText": "I've been on a weight loss journey for the year, and had to get some new Jeans. I didn't want to purchase too many or go to the expensive Big and Tall shop, so I tried a pair of these. The first set I ordered fit well, but there was still a bit of room with the stretch. I picked up a size down and they feel great. The jeans fit well and I ended up getting a few compliments when I wore them the first time. The nice thing is that as a lose weight, the stretch will help the jeans to fit well for longer and I can delay getting a smaller pair. I ended up getting 2 additional pair because I love them so much. Much cheaper than the Harbor Bay jeans I've been buying and seem to be similar or better quality.",

I recently got into a motorcycle accident and while I suffered road rash all over my torso and arms only a small scratch on my knees because of these jeans. They're comfy and tapered which makes them look good but also pretty tough, I went down at 60km/hrs and they were still fine. If the emergency room didn't have to cut them off I'd still have them.",
