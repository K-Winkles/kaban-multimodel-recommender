                "reviewText": "Well for starters, I'm 45 and I dont wear skinny Jeans! So dont get that impression of these jeans. I'm 6'4\" 235 and I can get away with the 514. I have an athletic build. I wear 36 Waist 34 Inseam. I have to say that the 34 inseam is LONG so be careful. When I was a kid I always had to hunt for 36 inseam 501's but these days a 34 inseam is PLENTY long so either My legs have shortened and my torso kept growing of over the years Levi has changed their dimensions to make people feel shorter?? I dont know.ANYWAY..... They are my new favorite Jean! These are advertised as slim and that is what they are. They are tighter in the thigh but still comfortable. However the seat and crotch have plenty of room and for me the low rise is also more comfortable then the old style 501's or even 550's. I have actually grown tired of the baggy look anyway. If you are chubby or thick, well these might not be your style. But I am still trying to look hip in my 40's and these 514's are the trick!They fit exactly as the 527 but the Boot Cut 527 has a larger leg at the bottom and larger opening. I like those as well but they are a bit to belled out for me. The 514 still has a large leg opening and looks great without being overly belled out or being tapered down too much like the old 501's when I'm wearing my flip flops (I live on he beach)They ride Loooow. So beware. If you are not used to the low ride style I suggest you get a pair and try them out. I wear a belt to adjust the ride so it doesn't slide ! Having to pull up your jeans all the time when you sit gets old so for me a belt is a requirement with the low ride jeans.LOVE 'em !",

                "reviewText": "Took a chance on ordering some more stylish-looking jeans for my husband (I can't get him into a store - he hates shopping), and these are just fabulous! Highly recommended, and don't worry - the sizing is generous/reasonable. I was a bit worried, because sometimes Levi's jeans don't fit all too well (at least on me), but these are just amazing - a must try item, in my opinion. The wash (Overhaul) was just perfect - a teensy bit of slight fading, but without looking too distressed, blingy or \"trying too hard.\" Very stylish and still classy. These look like expensive designer jeans, and are extremely flattering on. My husband looks like a million bucks in these jeans, and I'm so glad I ordered them.These jeans will look good on if you're 17 or 79, if you're on the slim side or on the plump side - doesn't matter - these are the jeans you want to get. I'll definitely be ordering more.In terms of fit/sizing - I will say that you can comfortably go with your \"size\" without worrying that these will be too small. If anything, they are a little bit more generously sized than other brands, but this does *not* mean they look baggy or outdated. They are slim fitting but without being too small. Hard to explain - but the cut of these jeans are very fashion-forward, and yet you're not dealing with baggy pants or super skinny pants. They're just perfect.Must-get jeans, and they will work for any size, any age. Super stylish, not too skinny and not too loose.I've been buying stuff online from Amazon for years, and these jeans are so good that I'm actually writing a review. Really good service from Amazon, and these jeans are just fabulous - I'd highly recommend them to just about everyone - no matter what your size or age - they're that good. Bonus points for being able to order the inseam you want instead of dealing with designer jeans that are too long and have to be professionally hemmed.Definitely try them. Will work for just about everyone - they aren't too baggy and they aren't too skinny - but still super-stylish looking. They aren't too \"blingy\" either. Just fabulous actually, and it doesn't matter if you're a college student or a retiree, if you're slim or or not-so-slim - they look great. Not sure about the difference between all the various washes available, but the Overhaul wash is a good one, if you're going to try these.",

                "reviewText": "Nabbed a pair of these 514s in Rigid dark wash on sale for less than $30 and sized up a couple inches in the inseam/leg to give a more roomy fit that isn\u2019t too tight/short and I\u2019ve bought a pair my usual size in the past that barely hit below my ankle, so sizing up in the leg was the right idea. I don\u2019t have fat legs by any measure, but these do almost fit like skinny jeans on me unless I size up a little. If you like the regular fit 501s, or 505s, these fit almost the same except for sitting lower on the waist and having a slightly more narrow cut. (Levi\u2019s are known for inconsistent sizing and poor quality control, however Amazon is great at accepting returns if they don\u2019t fit as expected).They look good and the rigid jeans are 100% cotton, and not stiff as I was afraid they might be. Denim is medium weight, ( not too thin and not as thick as some of the classic wash colors. Definitely would recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "I switched entirely to 514s because of the stretch waist band. My weight goes up and down 5 pounds, occasionally more. This stretch waistband helps keep my pants up and sticking to my belly. And I dont have to have 2 sets of jeans. When the 36\" didn't fit, I had to have 38\" jeans. two sets of jeans... sigh. Well, 514s solve that: I buy 36\" and it expands for Thanksgiving day then shrinks back to normal. And since I have no back porch (no hips) the stretch keeps my pants up, not falling down.",

I have lots of 514 jeans that I've purchased at legitimate retailers and these are different in small ways. The waist size is slightly smaller than other 514s. They are also slightly tighter around my legs. Neither is off by so much that they bother me. In fact the legs fit and look a little better. The buttons and tags also have slight differences.Long story short: These may be fake but they are nice. I got them for $24 and I'll buy more if that deal comes up again.",
