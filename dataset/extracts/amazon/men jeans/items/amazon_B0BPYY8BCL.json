However they attract fuzz like crazy (as someone with pets this is already an issue). I think it's just the material, as I have had other jeans that were similar to these and had the same issue. Seems like I have to have a lint roller near by at all times - maybe Amazon should make that a \"frequently purchased together\" recommendation.",
