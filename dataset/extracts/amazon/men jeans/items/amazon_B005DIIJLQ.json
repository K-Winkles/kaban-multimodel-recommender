                "reviewText": "Good looking, a comfortable fit and very good fire protection. After three months of daily and very rough wear, these are worn out but I can't imagine anything else performing better under my conditions. I'm ordering another pare and when those wear out, I'll get more of these.I have a summer job cutting steel at a metal recycler. I work 8-9 hour days in the hot southern summer sun. I wore and sweat soaked these every weekday for over three months, washing them on hot or warm every night. They've held their fire resistance for all that time.Only once did I nearly burn through them and that was when I carelessly turned the cutting torch directly on the pant leg for about three seconds. Even then, they did not catch fire and my leg was not burned. The fibers wore away quickly in that spot so that it looked like they were worn out and a hole developed there a few days later. But that took a direct blow from the torch. Regular streams of hot sparks did not burn through these.Because I'm climbing over piles of scrap steel with a lot of jagged edges, the pants did tear frequently below the knee where they would come into contact with torch-cut steel. I suspect that this would happen to any fabric pants though.I'm ordering another pare of these and may look into leather shin guards to protect them from jagged steel edges. I like the fit and love the fire protection.",
