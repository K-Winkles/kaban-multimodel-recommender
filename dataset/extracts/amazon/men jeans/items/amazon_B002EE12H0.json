Carhartt makes a heaver denim which will put up with more wear, but these are more comfortable, not as stiff, still wear well. Generous boot cut. Will buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I am not a carpenter or workman who wears these jeans in a construction or workshop/factory setting. I am instead a retiree who works from home when I do work. I was looking for a pair of jeans with lots of pockets so I would not again lose my iPhone out of a pocket that is way too shallow for its own good. I row on a machine, and as a result, my legs have gotten bigger; I was looking for pants that did not fit like sausage casings. I also find it uncomfortable to sit on a wallet, and wanted some alternatives to a back pocket. I found all the features I wanted in these jeans.For the environment I need these jeans for, the fabric is heavy enough; if you are a construction worker your needs will likely differ. I bought a pair of the heavier-weight fabric version as well. The main pockets are nice and deep; no involuntary donations of change every time you sit down. The side pockets are large enough for the iPhone 5 sized phone. I can also put my wallet in the side/leg pocket so that I don't have to sit on it, which I find quite literally a pain in the butt. There is room in the thighs in case you don't have minuscule quads. If I had one wish, it would be that Carhartt make a line without the hammer loop. If I were still working in an office, these are perhaps a bit too informal, whereas without the hammer loop I wouldn't hesitate to wear to work.This was my second purchase of Carhartt; the first was a flannel-lined pair of black jeans. So far I have been very happy with both purchases. I particularly like all those extra pockets.Update: March 2022Since the original review, I've had a chance to really compare the two fabric weights. The 15-ounce fabric was great, and wears wonderfully. I bought additional versions of the 15-ounce fabric pant as my waist size decreased. I am not as fond of the 12-ounce version. Late in 2021, when trying to reorder the 15-ounce fabric, I learned that Carhartt had discontinued this model. It's a shame. I was hoping that they would bring it back, but it hasn't happened so far. As noted in the original review, I wish they would come out with a line using the original 15-ounce denim without hammer loops. It would also be great to make at least one of the pant leg pockets a bit larger so that it will actually fit newer cell phones. You can't fit even an iPhone X into the leg pockets. If anyone from Carhartt pays attention to these reviews, that is my 2\u00a2 worth. I will add that I have started to explore alternatives to Carhartt, and am prepared to switch to a different brand.",

                "reviewText": "Update. Pockets way too small. My phone feels like it will rip them whenever I sit. Very uncomfortable. I got 2 sizes wider, maybe just one for more flex, less chance or tearing in seam. They do end up looking like clown pants. They pull on leg hairs or I need to pull them up my legs when bending. I wear them much less than cheaper ones I got. So they might end up actually lasting. If they keep me warmer than normal in winter, I will boost their rating. For now, I regret buying.Original review. I got them to try out, but ripped the tag and decided I might as well try an expensive pair of jeans at wor. I have been ripping all my other jeans at work. I'm about a size 36 to 38 waist, I got these in 40 waist, since I bought other carhart stuff that ran small on waist. These are good, feel a little too big, but I want more loose jeans for work, hopefully they won't rip in the inseam, like my straight and athletic fit jeans have been. Also, these better be more rugged. These jeans feel kind of thin, to be honest.. Time will tell, or I'm abandoning this brand for more affordable jeans if they rip in same area in less time than my cheaper jeans did. They seem good, kinda loose fit, which is new to me, since either usually get more straight fitted jeans. But I can't keep ripping all my other jeans. I also like that they have 36 length. I kinda like em upon first try on.",
