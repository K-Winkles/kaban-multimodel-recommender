                "reviewText": "I do computer support so I spend a lot of time under desks working on towers, so I need pants that have a loose, comfortable fit but with more durability than most business-casual kaki type pants. When I first got these they were great - they're comfortable, even when bending over or hunched under a table or stretching around equipment. I was a little concerned about the thickness of the material though, it was noticeably thinner than my usual Levi jeans.I need to card into many doors, so the wallet comes out a lot, and in less than a week i was in a hurry somewhere and caught my back pocket trying to put my wallet back, and the pocket ripped at a corner. I thought the threads had just pulled out, but the threads held and it tore a hole in the pants instead. I ignored that for a few days and on another wallet insert, it tore further. Taking the pants off and examining them, BOTH of the outer back belt loops had also torn holes in the pants, along with a strange hole in the crotch I have no idea how it got there. I un-stitched and removed the belt loops to prevent further damage and those are now at-home jeans.Must have been a bad batch I thought, and ordered a replacement pair. Within the week, and despite being very careful with them, I noticed I had already torn another hole by a belt loop. I guess I'll be removing both of those back belt loops before they also tear further out. I placed a red cap behind one of the belt loop holes to highlight it in the picture. The loop is still attached, it's just waiting for another tug on the loop to widen the rip.This is pretty disappointing, they're not really that much cheaper than a higher quality brand like Levi, but they ARE more comfortable. I'll probably be ordering another pair or two, and removing the belt loops immediately. I just have to be really careful with the back pocket, it was shocking how it ripped with no warning when I missed with my wallet. At least with the belt loop rips it just shows off my tucked in shirt. When the pocket rips bad it shows off my undies.At first I thought it was a design flaw, anchoring those two belt loops in the middle of un-reinforced jean, but I looked at some of my other jeans and that's where they were anchored too, and I've NEVER had this problem before with any other brand. I guess if they're going to use thinner jean material, they need to either remove those belt loops, or add a patch of reinforcing material there, to prevent tearing. Maybe add that (or the commonly used jean-rivet) to the top edges of the pockets.",
