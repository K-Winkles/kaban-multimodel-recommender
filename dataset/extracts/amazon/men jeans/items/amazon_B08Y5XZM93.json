I was seeking a lower price point so I could keep one and gift one to a family member. I ordered these the first time, then canceled the order based on some feedback about possible fakes due to the price being under $19. However, I decided to order it again and, although it took about 10 days to get here, it turned out to be great. They are name-brand, fit and stretch well, and look really good. I'm very glad I decided to purchase these.",

Some relaxed fit jeans like Wranglers can be comfortable, but the quality has gone to hell. I had one pair rip along the front of the crotch just while trying them on, right after I bought it, and another pair that was supposed to be the same size but was way too small. These Silver jeans have been amazing. Very comfortable, and I ordered two pair of the darker jeans which fit true to size, but the lighter wash jeans were a little more snug. Still comfortable, just slightly tighter. The quality is great, they feel a lot like some Levis 505s that I had. Best jeans I've seen anywhere at that price, Id recommend to anyone looking for cheaper jeans that fit non skinny guys.",
