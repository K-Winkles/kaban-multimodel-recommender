Wore a pair to work and was very surprised, they are extremely comfortable. Lots of extra room and stretch plus they feel good. Only problem i saw was a worn section where the zipper bottoms out and the fabric is now thinner but shouldn't be a problem. Id definitely recommend",

                "reviewText": "I've always worn Wrangler or Levi's and decided to give Lee a try. These carpenter jeans are super comfortable and really soft. But they seem to be plenty strong too. I slide on and off a forklift all day and these Lee jeans are really comfortable to work in and I stay surprisingly cool wearing them. I like them to fit a little loose for working in and ordered 52 waist like some of my other jeans. I could wear 50 waist and probably be pretty comfortable too but I wear a tactical nylon duty belt with the 52's at work and they are super comfortable. No binding when I move around or squat and I've just been really pleased with Lee's products so far. Wrangler stopped being a consistent size when they moved to Mexico for production. I would buy 3 or 4 pairs of jeans all the same size and 1 or 2 of them would absolutely be to tight and not fit. I stopped buying them. The Lee jeans won't break the bank either. Buy a pair and try them, you won't be disappointed.",
