                "reviewText": "I ordered a pair of the black jeans and a pair of blue. Tried on the black jeans first and they fit perfectly. When I tried on the blue jeans the crotch was so low it impeded my walking. Same jeans just different colors, they should fit the same. Well I found on the stitched in tag the pants were actually relaxed fit. Every other tag and even printed on the jeans in the inside waist band was labeled slim fit. I checked the black jeans and the stitched in tag said slim fit. I thought ok a factory mistake and sent them back for an exchange. The second pair fit better but not as good as the black jeans so I checked the stitched in tag and they said straight fit. Every where else it was listed as slim fit. To get two pairs in a row labeled as slim fit that was actually a different fit means they must have had a pretty significant number of jeans labeled wrong make it through QC. Check the stitched in tag to be sure you got the fit your ordered.",

It angers me very much when companies lie about their sizing.I purchased a slim fit skinny Jean and like always I go up two sizes to make sure there is room in the leg.I couldn\u2019t even get these stretch jeans up my leg. And then I held them up and see how small they really are. The waist is clearly not a 42 like it says. In the photo I laid the IZOD jeans on top of the Ethanol jeans that are the exact same type and size. THEY are extremely different in size. Even with all the spandex stretch, NOBODY with a 42 waist is getting in those jeans. I am a 38 waist.",

Que sus tallas no son precisas, no se si al etiquetarlos no se fijan si son medidas diferentes, pero a pesar de que en todas las ocasiones he comprado la misma talla y corte, siempre me quedan o muy aguados o muy apretados. Llevo 7 compras y solo 2 me quedaron bien, otro pues no tan bien pero me lo qued\u00e9 para no regalarlo.
