                "reviewText": "I have worn Eddi Bauer Relaxed Fit Jeans for many years. I have always ordered 30 inch inseam. The actual length of the inseam was, in fact 28 inches. This past year I have ordered several 28 inch inseam jeans. When I started wearing them, they were too long. I measured and the 30 inch jeans were actually 30 inches. Now it shouldn't be a defect to have the sizing actually be the sizing but when there is a change from the previous design, it would have been helpful to have it mentioned somewhere.",

                "reviewText": "Editing about 3 months after purchase. I wash in cold water and air dry. The first weekend I wore the jeans I noticed that the rear waistband sags a lot when bending over or sitting, but notably the hips seem tight and inhibit full range of motion. I'm reducing to 3 stars, and I really don't like these jeans anymore.So the fabric is great for jeans. They do well after washing. I hang them to dry.Now, the part that is a nuisance. The front pockets are too tight. The opening for the pocket is too small. It's hard to get my hands in and out of them, and this makes it difficult to easily and quickly retrieve keys, phone, etc. If you've got man hands you may have trouble. Certainly, it's very difficult when sitting but not necessarily so with other cuts of Eddie Bauer jeans or other manufacturers of jeans.Please, Eddie Bauer, make the pocket opening bigger looser or something!",
