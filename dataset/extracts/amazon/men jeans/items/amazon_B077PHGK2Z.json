                "reviewText": "I tried on the regular fit version at a department store - I liked them, but I didn't end up buying them (I was there for jeans...) I'm glad I passed because the slim fit are just that much better looking.I gambled on the first pair - some slim fit pants get hung up around my calves which is neither comfortable nor appealing. I have fairly muscular legs but I also like the look of slim fit better than most regular or athletic fits. I figured I could always return if they didn't fit me. These Dockers are just right, however, leaving just enough room but still creating the trim look you want in a slim fit. The fit also makes these pants more versatile, as they look good dressed up or down. The regular fit would tend to be a little sloppier if trying to dress up with a sports coat, something that I used to hate when I was less discriminating in my khaki choices. The \"jean cut\" pockets are pretty much hidden when wearing a sports coat, though unless you're really going for a dressier look, that's not an issue anyway (and in that case, you're probably going to need some honest-to-goodness dress pants). Dress shoes, chukkas, boots, or fresh sneakers all look right at home with these pants.The waist sizing is right on with the two pair that I own, and at least with these two pair they are cut and fit identically.Finally, on a comfort level, I can only thus far speak for summer. The fabric is pretty impressive - much cooler to wear than any denim I currently own. Would I still wear these in the winter? I mean, they're called \"all seasons tech pants.\" I don't ever worry about my legs unless I'm outside in freezing temps for hours at a time. In that case, I wouldn't choose khaki pants for that anyhow. I'll have to update in a year as to the durability.The first pair I purchased was on Prime Day and the color I bought were marginally on sale for something like $39. At that price, they are a very good pair of pants. The next pair I purchased were on sale for $19.99. Anything under $30 for these makes them an incredible bargain. That said, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these pants at full price.",

The first pair fit great at the thigh and was slim & good all around. The next 2 pairs that I ordered the thighs were very loose in fact the legs were not as slim either on the bottom close to 7 3/4\u201d width when the first was 7\u201d. Seems there wasn\u2019t any consistency in the productIf slim was advertised it should have been a slim pair of jeans not skinny mind you. In fact I had to pay more and get both altered per my specifications, which I felt is not called for. Dockers need to make changes in order to please their customers.We buy to wear we don\u2019t buy to alter!!!",

They are very tight from the lower thighs through the calves. I'll have to return them. I don't think sizing up would help because then they'd still be too skinny around the calves but then too loose around the waist (is that what they mean by \"SLIM\" fit?? High waist size to thigh and calve size ratio??) doesn't seem like a good description to me).For reference: I am 5'11\", 160lbs, 31 inch waist and usually wear 31\"W x 32\"L pants. If your thighs and calves are muscular at all, I don't think you'll like the way these fit (unless you enjoy skin tight pants!).",
