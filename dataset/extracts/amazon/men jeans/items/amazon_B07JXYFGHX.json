Industry-standard sewing machines couldn't handle our designs, so we broke them apart and rebuilt them to produce our one-of-a-kind vision. With its five-needle thread at two-stitch-per-inch process, our Super T stitch was instantly recognized for style that was unlike any other denim brand in the world. True Religion's designs soon caught the attention of the world's most iconic style leaders, and demand for our denim grew rapidly. Everything from there on out was committed to be bigger, better, and bolder than the rest. As our stitching evolved, True Religion became synonymous with quality craftsmanship and bold style designed to stand out. Our specialty denim fits, washes & treatments, were all designed with amplified details to grab attention at every turn. Our iconic horseshoe was born from the silhouette of a Buddha's smile, and our hardware was inspired by the romance of denim's 140-year history. We have always been fashion forward, even from behind. Our styles inherit the swagger of their given name. The Joey. The Ricky. The Halle. However, it's the Fearless Style Leaders who rock True Religion with a Be So Bold attitude that ignite the world with bold statements of creative self-expression. We became famous because we were like no one before us, and what began with a stitch now leads to a future of innovative fashion designed by the fearless, for the fearless.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of these jeans is excellent. The fit is superb. These are not selvedge. They can be washed. No dye ever came off on anything I ever sat on. No change ever came out of my pockets. And while I dont carry a knife like the other negative reviewer, what do you have in your pocket, a machete? I have 3.5 inch Kershaw that fits nicely. These are WELL MADE STYLISH jeans. IF you want jeans to do construction then buy the carharts like someone mentioned, and look like a construction worker.If you want a nice pair of jeans that you can wear out to dinner with a jacket or casually with a t shirt, look no further. True religion has styles from mild( im 52) to wild for my kids ( 19 and 16). Are they worth the dough over a pair of levis? You decide. I think so and I love my Levis too .",
