These Konrad fit jeans by Silver Jeans Co were just what I\u2019ve been searching for! The waist fits tight enough that they aren\u2019t falling off, but the stretch material will allow him long-term wear as he\u2019s growing. The 30\u201d inseam is a bit long for him yet, but that\u2019s a common problem for us and one that I know will resolve itself when he hits a growth spurt.As my son is not a big fan of wearing denim materials, I was pleased to hear that he finds these jeans very comfortable. They look great on him and I\u2019m thrilled that he\u2019s no longer wearing athletic-style pants everyday. Although I would say these are a more premium brand based on the $98 price tag, I am more than happy to invest in something that looks good and I know he\u2019ll wear. Since they\u2019ll last a long time, I find the price very fair.",
