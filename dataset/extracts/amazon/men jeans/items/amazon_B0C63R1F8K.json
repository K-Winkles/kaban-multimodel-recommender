I tend to wear out jeans or work pants like carhart pretty fast in the crotch area due to my profession and thick thighs. I really like the fit as well as they aren\u2019t super snug. You can actually place items in your pockets and still be comfortable. The color is spot on to the image Amazon provides. Follow the washing instructions on the tag to prevent them from shrinking or getting too tight over the course of their life.Will be buying again as these are my favorite!",

I am now 72 years old & saw the Wranglers in my search for Levis. What the hey I'll give them a try. I bought 1 pear of Wranglers & 2 pear of Levis. I received the Levis the next day but the Wranglers toke 2 weeks. They finally arrived & I am put all 3 in the washer. Pulled them out of the dryer & the Wranglers felt different. When I put them on the first time they felt great. I will b it y more in the future.",
