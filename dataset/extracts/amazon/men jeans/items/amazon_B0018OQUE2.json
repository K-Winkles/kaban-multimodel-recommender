                "reviewText": "For years I wore the same jeans to work. Wrangler 34x34 boot cut. Over the years they fit a little different but they worked well and fit somewhat the same every time. When they changed to flex denim I quite buying them. I hated the feel they felt baggy loose and low quality. I bought some Arizona jeans a few years back that worked great but could hit the time to buy more cause they were out of stock. So in come Amazon.Tailored I'm a 33x33 so for years I've bought 34x34 because that's the most common size for your average guy. These fit great. They might be a little tight in the crotch area but with a few washes and any 100% denim will stretch a bit they're fine. We also don't dry out jeans and hang them up inside to dry so that will help with them shrinking. The rigid is a raw denim as they say and it's not been washed. I work a factory so that's perfect, they feel tuff and industrial and seem like they will last a long time. They are dark in color they will bleed in the wash so beware of that. I would soak them a few times before washing and be sure to keep whites out. You also have to be careful of streaks. Like detergent getting on it and they having some discoloration from that. Not a big deal for me but if you want them as dress up jeans I would pull them inside out as the wash instructions say to try and prevent that.I did buy some of these in the rinse color from a local store. They are the same color and fit exactly the same but they are washed once before they are sold. So if you don't want that stiff raw denim just get the \"rinse\" color. In all they fit exactly the same because you will wash the rigid and will be become rinsed so to speak.In all I hope that they don't change these jeans. It's kinda hard to find 100% cotton denim. I just don't like the flex and blended denims and just want stick to one size and one brand. I did buy there 527 bootcut and they are nice too but the denim is much thinner. I bought those for my non-work jeans. These 517's seem like good work jeans that hopefully will last a while.",

These jeans have that authentic and durable denim feel without all the polyester stretch (which I don\u2019t mind in other jeans). They sit a little higher in the waist that 511s for anyone familiar with those. They are a bit snug in the thigh given that they don\u2019t stretch but as someone with an athletic build and a 29\u201d waist, I expect this. They fit true to size, I bought my expected waist measurement and they are snug enough to not need a belt but not uncomfortably tight.",

                "reviewText": "They are robust jeans...and the long admired history of Levi's jeans means nobody would much care what I think of them anyway. They are known to be good and durable. I didn't wash them before wearing them, and found that they had a new-jean \"stiffness\" about them, which always made me glad to get home and strip them off! They didn't chafe my skin, but perhaps a few washes will soften them up. Some people suggest that jeans never need washing, but months of dropping mustard and ketchup into your lap would soon make them look a bit gross. They appear to be quite color fast as the laundry water did not turn really blue when I washed them. I like the boot-cut because I am older, and prefer a slightly flared ankle look, rather than tight fitting skinny jeans. They are also easier to get your feet down into if they have wider ankles...and you won't fall over when putting them on! The sizing is quite accurate, if you know your measurements. I haven't checked to see whether the jeans give a decent \"plumber's crack\" when I bend down, but I suspect they probably do. Ask your girlfriend or date to let you know if this is the case when you wear them.",
