                "reviewText": "Purchased these pants along with two other brands hoping to get at least one that fit well.Thankfully, I did. I ordered a size 42x32L. I'm trans female to male and have a decent set of hips and a bit extra around my gut. I'm about 5'5\" and 240 lbs.At first I was skeptical about ordering men's skinny jeans. But, after trying and failing to find relaxed, straight, or boot cut jeans for men that wouldn't feel like I had a river of fabric around my legs, inseam, and ankles; I was happy to find that my fit was on the \"skinny jeans\" side.The fit just like a relaxed or straight fit on me and don't hug my hips or thighs too tightly. I ordered a size up to start, found it was a bit too big and ordered a second pair true to size. While waiting for pair #2 to come in (40x32L), I did a shrinking wash in the dryer--normally I do not dry my pants in the dryer--and they fit *perfectly* after it. The second pair was too small, so I sent it back and easily had a replacement sent out in size 42x32L.I highly recommend getting a pair a size up and then doing a cold wash (to preserve colour), then drying them on medium heat. Did the trick for me. Also, don't dry you jeans in the dryer if you don't want them to shrink. This blend of fabric is especially prone to shrinkage.I've bought three pairs of these and am actively waiting for more colours to come in stock. They are my go-to, have nice, deep pockets, are comfortable enough to sleep in, and have the perfect amount of stretch.",
