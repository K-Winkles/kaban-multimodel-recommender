People still wear them?\".Material isn't fooling anybody into thinking you're wearing a nice (or even a HALF decent) pair of jeans.Everything about these is a hard NO from me...",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my son who is 6\u20193 and very skinny (about 135-140 pounds). His jeans are very hard to find. I usually get them from Hollister or Abercrombie, but they never have his size in ripped jeans.... and he typically wears a 30X34. Now onto the jeans I received. They looked cute, although you can tell they aren\u2019t great quality compared to the real jeans I buy him. Much thinner. They come right at his ankle and they should come below the ankle, so when he sits, they come up. The waist is a bit too big and so is the crotch area. The legs look great. Not too tight like skinny jeans. He likes them because of the rips, and I\u2019m not returning them because I knew they probably wouldn\u2019t fit him perfectly. And honestly unless you were staring, you wouldn\u2019t see the imperfections. I wish there were a longer option. I hate jeans that are this universal. It\u2019s a chore shopping for the tall and skinny and still remaining stylish. It\u2019s the same with shirts. He can really wear a small, but I have to buy an extra large to get his arm length covered. This review is of no fault to the jeans, except that they are thin. I\u2019m writing this incase there\u2019s another buyer who is tall and thin.",
