                "reviewText": "I\u2019m old school late 90s-2000s were my particular era..I didn\u2019t do jinkos, and I damn sure wont wear skinny pants(ridiculous) my go to jeans were always Buckle..Big Star Orion boot cut, they sat lower on the waist, snug not tight in the thigh, with a 19-21 inch opening, as I am a boot/T-shirt guy they were perfect\u2026 they stopped making them and now everything I like is called \u201cvintage\u201d and I had to dig through eBay and other second hand clothing sites to find them because eventually there\u2019s just not any material left to work with..I also never ever ever got the destroyed jeans..I always thought\u2026why would I buy destroyed jeans\u2026they are gonna look like that eventually(and they always did) if I buy them already worn/destroyed then the shelf/hanger/washer/dryer life of them are maybe 1/10th of what it would be..anyway second hand sites worked for a while but sizes and age ultimately dwindled to a point I had to start looking..while these are not exactly like my Orions, I\u2019m older and fatter, (hey..20 years to go from 29-30 waist to a 32-33 is not as bad as it could be) when I found the dimensions and compared, I gave them a shot..and it was good. I really like the Lucky brand, I just hope they keep making the damned things..I also like that the makers must have a sense of humor\u2026the inside of the fly(after unzipping) says \u201cLucky You\u201d that alone gets a couple stars from me..they fit just fine for me, I was afraid they might be tight from other reviews..(it\u2019s possible they are in denial) I\u2019m a solid 33 in everything else and these are almost perfect..my one and only one thing I am not a big fan of is the mix of material, it\u2019s got that bit of stretch in the denim\u2026I get why they do it and I don\u2019t mind it enough to change my opinion, it really does make fitting easier but Im a purist about that..I know this is a ridiculously long review\u2026but I am particular about jeans and I know I appreciate more info when I can\u2019t just run through 5 pairs at the store to find the right fit\u2026I\u2019ll certainly buy more..that\u2019s certain.",

I can't speak on the durability of these since they are all still new. The newer material that is a little elastic is a nice and makes them very comfortable. I hope that these will last as long as jeans that are without the elastic material. I plan on buying more pairs of jeans from Lucky Brand in the very near future.",
