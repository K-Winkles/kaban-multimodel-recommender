The branding on them, and the logo, and subtle details make it very unique, so that if you tuck your shirt in, it stands out and says \"I'm a Tommy Hilfiger pair of Jeans\".They fit perfectly. The fabric is amazingly soft and durable. They are not super white, and have almost a very slight ivory to them.I didn't think I'd picture myself wearing white jeans, but I can't wait to pair these up with the right shirt and shoes and get a new look I haven't seen myself in.I definitely recommend these and think they are very good if you're looking for a great value, with form, fit, function and a lot of fashion.",

Apparently slim fit really means it is for people with skinny legs. For me, the trunk of the pants over the calf portions of my leg was way too tight. For men with larger calves, this is not for you. On the other hand, if you have skinny calves, then this is a good pair of jeans. I like the look and style of the jeans, just wished it wasn't slim fit at the calves.",
