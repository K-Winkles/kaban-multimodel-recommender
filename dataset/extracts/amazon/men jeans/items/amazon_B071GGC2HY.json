I'm not sure how the fabric's going to wear for me as a tradesman. However, at this price I can afford them to be a little bit less robust. These things sure are comfortable. And because of the stretch fit I look really good in them. The material is a little thin compared to old style jeans. however, compared to other genes in this stretch style material they are a little thicker than some I have tried on. These are a little low on the waist, which I like. And while they have a stretch material they aren't binding me anywhere I don't want to be. zipper is medium wieght. stiching is good. front pocket will fit a Samsung s23u and because of the stretch fit does not hinder my movement.I am 5'11\" 148pnds @13% body fat. 29x32 fit me absolutely perfect to my preferred style.",

I purchased another brand and thought I'll never find pants I like. My sister said check for slim pants and I did. I ordered three different pair. They all fit me great but one pair was outstanding, it was the Lee brand. After having them on for a couple days I was convinced I had the perfect pair of pants. I'm 5 ft 7 in, and am 145 pounds so I ordered 30-30 size they are just right. I love these pants, they are a bit stretch so go with your regular size and you will be very happy. Good materials good fit and made very well.No matter what you are doing these pants will fit right in. Busines or casual you will show off your best side. I've had nothing but compliments on these pants. I got the Conrad color because they look new being the darker blue. Hang your stuff in a pair of pants that shows who you are.",
