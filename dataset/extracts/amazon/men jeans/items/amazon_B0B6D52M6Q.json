                "reviewText": "So, let me just start off by saying that, we have other straight-fit jeans and while they are roomy, they were still cut to not look frumpy or ill-fitting. We have a pair of gap shorts that fit great and we knew going into to these that they wouldn't be skinny jeans or fitted, but they wear incredibly large in the thighs- and this is on someone who is 6' 2\", medium build.All that said, if you like or need that style of fit (cyclists, or body builders who don't skip leg day), the typcial GAP quality is all there. Construction is great, as is the fabric/stitching.I'm giving this 4 stars because, like other GAP clothing we own, it is very well made with quality materials and a perfect size 36 around the waist. They did lose a star because the pictures in the product listing simply just do not illustrate how baggy these are in the thigh area.",

They are straight leg, and as the tag notes they are relaxed through the hip and thigh, and I had not fully appreciated that relaxed notation when ordering them, and they are indeed a bit wider at the thigh area than I prefer, so if you prefer a less baggy thigh area, then these may be too wide there for you. I wasn\u2019t looking for a slim thigh, but I was looking for more of a regular straight cut through the thigh and these are a bit more wide there, but that is only my fault for not fully reading the accurate product description. Otherwise these are great, the material feels good, and the fit is as expected based on the description. They appear to be well made.",
