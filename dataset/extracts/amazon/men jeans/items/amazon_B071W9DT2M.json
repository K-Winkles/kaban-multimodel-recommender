My wife wanted me to get some nice jeans that were for going out and NOT FOR WORKING lol. My wife, along with all her other jobs, also doubles as a fashion consultant and picked these out for me. They seem to fit true to size, maybe a tiny bit small. So if you're in between sizes, order up a size. They're very comfortable with just a little bit of stretch. The pockets aren't quite as deep as I would like, but that's not a huge issue as there is still plenty of pocket to work with. If you're a big dude like me, just go ahead and order them. I am 5'11 and 330 lbs with a disproportionately long torso and short little legs. I usually wear either 38 or 40 waist so we ordered 40x30. If I could find a 29 inseam I think these would be the perfect fitting jeans for me. I will for sure order more though.",

They are still roomy in the leg, but the length is just too short. I saw that these can be double what I paid for them- if I had paid that much, I would have been very upset.

                "reviewText": "These jeans have that baggy 90s feel, very roomy, soft denim and have a good amount of stretch, without looking like a stretch jean, they look thick and good quality, which they are.Im a big lad, 6ft and 18.5st have big thighs and lower leg and usually this means I don't have enough room in jeans for much else if you get my drift. These jeans have saved my spuds from their usual crushing fate and have lived in them since they arrived. I actually ordered a second pair within 15mins of wearing them.They are slightly larger than the label size, I have a 41 inch waist, the 40 fits well and isn't tight at all.I expect many guys would find the loose fit of these jeans too much but for me they're perfect, takes me back to my skater jeans days in the 90s. They have worn look to front pockets and have triple stitching on many parts, washed out look and are soft and comfortable to the point that you put them on and don't want to go out. I would recommend these highly. I managed to get my pairs on a deal due to sizing but they are well worth the asking price.",
