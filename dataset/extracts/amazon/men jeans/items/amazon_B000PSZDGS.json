                "reviewText": "Last year I purchased a pair of Duluth flex carpenter pants. After first wash and dry they shrank a size. Not a deal breaker but I went into a house to remediate a bedroom full of mold. The areas where bleach got on the pants created holes. Some big enough you can feed your hand through. Not something you'd expect from a pair of pants that cost $80. Of course when I reviewed their pants on their site they didn't publish it.Now getting to these $25 pants. But first let me tell you what I put a pair of pants through. I do appliance repair and installs. So I can be taking dishwashers, microwaves, washer and dryers and even refrigerators up and down stairs. I do plumbing. I'm bending down low to clean old DE filters inside drop tanks for public pools, working on peoples toilets, garbage disposals, faucets. I do HVAC. Nitrogen and B tanks are heavy. Often taking them up and down stairs. When sweating compressors inside condenser units half my body is inside the unit while my legs are suspended in air. Not uncommon for me to carry 5 gallon buckets of paint up stairs with a sprayer since I do painting too. Also do trashouts. Sometimes I'll get a job where bottomfeeders will leave behind every bit of furniture inside their third floor apartment after eviction. So I can be in a situation where I need to he[p carry peoples furniture down flights of stairs.I need a pair of pants that are durable, can hold some tools and most of all comfortable.These are very comfortable pants. I don't feel restricted when doing all the moving that I do. I got the 33s and that's exactly what they are. After multiple washes they have not shrunk. Although discolored from bleach and exposure to chlorine they did not form gaping holes like the Duluth pants did. I carry a pair of channel locks and a Kliens 11 in 1 tool in the right double pockets. Vice grip wire strippers in back pocket. I have one tool pouch on my left hip and a heavy rugged phone inside case on the right. Both hang from the belt. The belt, even under load, is held very secure by these pants no matter what I'm doing.Really can't say enough good about these pants. The only improvements I would suggest are the two front pockets. I like the location of the pockets, just wish they were roomier. Holding a minimalist wallet in the left pocket is tighter than I like. It would have been nice to have a loop on the front right side of pants to secure a key lanyard for the keys I use throughout the day. That was the one feature I can say was good about the Duluths. Also, I wish the the inside of the leg pockets were condura lined. Over time the channel locks will wear down the fabric inside that pocket and fall right down my leg. Have yet a single person notice when that happens. I've been wearing carpenter style pants for a long time and so far I like these the best.",

With that being said they are very high-quality looking pants. Good sewing and a nice fabric. I might have to get a couple more pairs when they are on sale again.",

I\u2019m not massive, but I don\u2019t have skinny thighs. I can\u2019t wear these pants because my inner thighs and groin start rubbing to the point of irritation almost immediately.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m an HVAC mechanic by trade so I need durable work clothing that can handle occasional rough use (crawling under ductwork, kneeling on roofs in inclement weather, climbing ladders loaded with tools, etc). Strong deep pockets are important, as are strong seams to prevent splitting when stretched past their normal design. I\u2019ve used Carhaart for years but the prices on these Dickies tempted me to give them a try and so far, after about three years of use, they are every bit as good, perhaps even better in some ways. I buy four or five pairs a year as part of my company\u2019s clothing allowance and so far none of them have worn out or even gotten holes. Judging by the performance so far, I\u2019d expect to be able to make them last through years of moderate abuse.",
