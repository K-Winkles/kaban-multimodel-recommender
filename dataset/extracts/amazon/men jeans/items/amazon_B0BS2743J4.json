But if you never skip leg day, you can show off your hard work at the gym with these jeans.Normally, I wear 33x30 but I ended up buying 33x34 due to the lower cost. These pants will need to be fixed.

                "reviewText": "I would have given these jeans a 5-star review, but there are a few things that kept me from doing so. First of all, the listing would tell you that there are several different shades/colors of blue, but when you get them the differences are so subtle that they can only be seen in bright light/daylight. Essentially, if you order a darker shade of blue, it doesn't matter what color you order they all come in looking the same. Second, the sizing is a little off. While I was flattered when a waist size 32 was big on me, I wasn't fooled. I wear Volcom pants and wear a 32 or 33 inch waist, but in this jean, I ended up having to go with a 31 inch waist and having the legs look a touch more fitted than I prefer. The 32\" waist is considerably too big in the waist & hips area, but fits great everywhere else. Finally, these jeans have a very weird coin pocket. Unlike ALL other jeans, where the coin pocket is sewn onto the body of the jeans, this coin pocket is sewn onto the pocket, making it hang/look a little odd. Not a deal breaker, but not ideal.",

I'm glad I found them on here they're great just to Lounge in do labor in skateboard or whatever. They stretch just perfectly without even noticing they are, the loops and buttons/zipper are high quality and the modern fit cut is probably the most comfortable/best looking compared to those like slim fit and others that also look great with sneakers or boots. I purchased two pairs of the blackout I will be purchasing them again.update: I have been wearing them out if most my jeans for months now an they are still great. I would advise to only wash with water and a drop of detergent and hang dry if getting the blackout. I used too much soap and had to rinse them twice an they kinda faded on me but the jeans are still dope. I will be purchasing more.",
