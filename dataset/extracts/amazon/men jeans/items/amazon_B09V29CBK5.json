                "reviewText": "Even the most basic store brand men's jeans start at about thrirty bucks and go skyward from there. And it's hard to find name brands any lower than that no matter where you look. This must have been my lucky day because these cost me about thirteen bucks, and that's for GAP which is usually something I expect to find on the fancy rack. I didn't expect much and I really never expected them to fit - not just to be the right size but I mean really fit, you know what I mean, fit to make me look good.THE FITSo let's start there, how do they fit? If you've heard the term like a glove that's these, I slipped them on with the tags still on them and the two most important parts that really count - my frontside and my backside, slipped right in like they were custom made just for me. I was impressed. I've tried so many of the no name brands and they fit like they were made for a space critter, one that has no curves on either side. Well I do have curves and how my jeans fit is important to me. These amaze me.THE QUALITYThese look and feel like jeans used to long before they were mass produced in a factory in a far off place. They are almost all cotton and that feel can't be replicated by synthetic materials. The stitching is traditional, the pockets are in in the right place, the belt loops are the right spacing and that all important thing they call rise, the spacing between the top button to just below where the zipper stops, is perfect, they looks like a man's jeans.YES NO MAYBELook I could go on but I've said what's important. I just want to make one thing clear. There are five different color choices but all of the reviews are lumped together. The choices included other subtle differences, the one I chose is light destroy. They look like jeans that have been washed a hundred times. And they come pre ripped. Many times ripped jeans look phony and pretentious but these look totally natural, and they are no reinforced, so they definitely will rip more. If you're okay with that, these are for you, just be aware that these are real rips. I don't care, I don't pretend to look casual, I really am, and most of the jeans in my closet are ripped and I didn't buy them that way - these just had a head start.",
