                "reviewText": "I grew up wearing Levis, both 501s and a zip-fly straight leg version that I think was the 505. So that was the 80's, right. Come back to Levis in 2011 and what you find is that the jeans either fit funny to match some modern style, or they're constructed with really poor quality - like, fall apart in the washing machine quality. Sure, Levis makes a made-in-USA 501s now, for only like a million dollars per pair; if you're like me, though, the years haven't been kind enough to permit you to fit comfortably in those. (Sort of like the mouse who wanted to throw a dance party, but he had no ballroom, if you know what I mean.)Anyway. I figured that at this price, with all these good reviews, something was outta whack here. But I bought a pair anyway - in Dark Stonewash, because I like to lighten them naturally.Totally stoked. So glad I did. They remind me of the comfortable, well-fitting jeans of my youth - they fit right for the middle-aged me, but they look good and feel great. Definitely agree with the other reviewers that they run a size big. In Dockers and Brooks Brothers my waist is a 36; the Carhartt 38s fit me perfectly. My inseam is 32 but these are a really long 32; I suspect they'll shrink up after the first wash.But they were a hit right out of the bag. I was going to come back and buy another pair but these seem tough and well made. I may not *need* another pair for a while.I dunno what people want out of a pair of jeans these days, but if you saw anything that reminds you of yourself in this review, do yourself a favor and buy a pair. You won't regret it.EDIT: It's April 2017. I've been lifting weights for a couple years and I can fit in 501s now. But these are still my go-to \"Dad jeans\" for dad jobs like mowing the lawn, pulling weeds, anything that requires a bit of mobility and flexibility. And this pair, 6 years old, so lightened by washing and rubbing as to be nearly white on the thighs, is just now getting around to fraying at the cuff and wearing out.Time to buy a new pair!",

                "reviewText": "Motorcycle pants can be expensive beginning at $100 on average or higher, and normal Levi's and denim jeans are to thin. These jeans are thick, have good room for the flexing required when riding a motorcycle or maxi-scooter. They should hold up longer for riding, especially since If you don't carry anything in the back pockets. They come in sizes for real men. Most jeans and pants are sized for teenagers. I wear a 46 waist 32 length. These jeans were long but didn't drag. The opening at the bottom of the legs went over my motorcycle riding shoes without a problem.They feel good. They look good. They are NOT \"Motorcycle Pants\" however, which have Kevlar and Protective pads, but they should provide a little more wear resistance than a regular pair of denim.I have a pair of actual motorcycle pants coming, but I will also buy another pair of these, because my daily clothes have to be able to double for motorcycle riding too.",

That isn't uncommon for Jeans in my experience. Other than that, they are still holding up extremely well, still look good considering I wear them everyday. I am confident my newest pair will do just as well.I appreciate that these are available in American Men sizes, which are difficult to find in retail stores.",

                "reviewText": "I've been wearing Levi jeans for over 30 years (501 & 550)...they've always fit and have been very durable. I don't mind paying more if I know I'm getting quality. Yes, I'm one of those that stick with a product for decades as long as the quality of the product remains superior and Levi's has always fit into that category ....until now. I recently bought several pairs of Levi's and the stitching on the back pocket \"V's\" started coming undone after a single wash. Not just on one pair ....on all of them. Extremely irritating to say the least ...especially since I paid almost $40 for each pair. In addition, the denim just doesn't seem as rugged/tough as it used to be. I suspect Levi has lost their dedication to quality to cut costs ... unfortunately, not all that unusual with a lot of larger companies these days.After some advice from a co-worker, I decided to try the Carhartt jeans (Traditional Fit) and purchased a single pair on Amazon to try them out. They arrived on Tuesday, I washed them Tuesday night, I wore them all day Wednesday, and today (Thursday) I will buy at least 4 more pair on Amazon. Folks, these are good jeans ...they're what Levi's use to be. As a bonus, they are much more reasonably priced (around $10 less than the Levi's I purchased). I've worn other Carhartt products over the years and have always been impressed ...I'm glad I found these jeans. Here is where you really need to pay attention ..this is my very first review I've ever posted on Amazon and I've bought a lot of products on Amazon. If that doesn't tell you something about these jeans, I don't know what will. My only concern at this point is to see how they perform after a long period of wear and multiple washes ...will update review if they don't perform as I expect they will.",
