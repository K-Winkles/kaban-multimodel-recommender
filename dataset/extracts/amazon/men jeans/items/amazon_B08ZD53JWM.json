                "reviewText": "I really like the pants. All except for the camoflauge in the ripped part on the thighs. I wear 36/30 pants. Unfortuanatly these pants do not offer any length, you just get to chose the waist size. So I ordered size 36 waist. They fit perfect on my waist. They are not too long or too short. They are not tight fitting or skinny like the model in the pictures. If you were a TALL skinny person they would fit like the model. They actually fit me very well and are very comfortable to wear. The material is better than I expected it to be. It is slightly streachy but not like a pair of spandex. Just slightly streachy. The pants look identical to the ones in the pictures. Spot on exact. The ONLY complaints I have is the zipper seems flimsy and the button as well. I did not like the camo in the rips. They are very well made, better than I expected. If the zipper and button was better quality these would be fantastic pants. I took an old pair of black jeans I had and cut out the camo on these and replaced the camo with black denim in the rips and now they look great. The camo just does not match the pants. If they had used just solid black material that would've been 100% better. If you wanted these pants to be really tight on you, I'd say to order a size smaller than what you would normally wear to make them fit tight. They do not feel cheap at all. They are not for working or sporting, they are for wearing out on the town or to school or something.",

So I bought two. The first size I fit was the correct size. They are skinny, slim in the legs and fit well with a stretch added without making it loose.These pants- are by far the best pair of casual jeans I have ever worn. I will proudly, keep buying from this manufacturer again and again. I'm already thinking of which pair to get next!EDIT: its been a few months since I bought these and they're still AMAZING. Wash great, warm or cold. I love them!",
