So I made another order going to the 32L insted of 30, it was too long , when I measured the length, I found the 30 is 27 and 32 is 32, back to my old Jeans the length of 30 was varied between 29 and 30 inch , Now I want to buy some more, but Im not trusting the sizes, it is the best Jeans but buy it from store not online, for me unfortunately this models not available in my area, if someone bought this model recently, check the length and updateUpdateNo more issues anymore in size it's became unified and perfect fit",

                "reviewText": "I am 6'6\" and 215 lbs. I usually wear 34x34 in jeans. These jeans are fantastic.Pros:They are better than other relaxed fit jeans in that they don't sag down as much - so when you're sitting, you don't have to worry about your undies showing. Compared to the Levi's 559 relaxed fit jeans, these jeans sit higher up. Yes, you can wear a belt (but who wants to do that?).Second, they are boot - cut, so when I put on longer socks, it is easy to pull the jeans over my calves, and they will fit over boots easier.Third, they are versatile. I can actually do a full squat without it being uncomfortable or worrying that the jeans will rip. They fit and look like just regular jeans, but they can stretch more than others.Finally, they are comfortable. I have plenty of room in the groin area, and they don't constrict any part of my lower body.Cons:The first pair that I ever bought (34x34) are starting to shrink after regular (once per week) use for about 6 months. They are tighter to put on versus my new pair (34x34), but once on, I hardly notice them. It could be due to the fact that some of these jeans aren't 100% cotton.Background:The reason I first bought a pair of these was because of my brother. I personally thought Levi's and American Eagles were the best, but after trying on several different brands and styles of jeans at Kohl's, these were my favorite. To be honest, the Costco Kirkland jeans are very good as well - they just don't look \"as cool\" as these though.",

However, ALL 3 PAIRS we purchased started to rip within a couple times of him wearing them! There is too much stretch in these jeans and not enough durable cotton fibers to bind the weave together. The areas by the back pockets ripped, also by a belt loop. Basically anywhere there is a thin area of material next to a thick, reinforced area gave out. My husband is not hard on his jeans, he wasn't working outside or with a physical job while wearing these. Also, it wasn't his wallet making the pockets give way because both back pockets were ripping out, not just one! We are past the return window, so I know we won't be able to recoup the $$$ we spent on 3 of these pairs, but maybe we can save you from wasting your money on these faulty jeans. Don't buy them!!",

Just because skinny jeans are a fad with most rappers, doesnt mean that everyone and their mother is gonna start wearing skinny jeans. I know plenty of dudes (me included) that will never wear anything else but bootcut jeans. These are affordable, stylish, and durable. You've got a good thing... Dont blow it.",
