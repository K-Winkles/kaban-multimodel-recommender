                "reviewText": "great fit. comfortable. reasonably price. respectable simplicity in style.I give these 5 stars. The 5 stars not necessarily being merited in its own right so much as by how difficult it has become to get a pair of men's jeans that are comfortable, stylish and reasonably priced. Otherwise, I'd rate these 4 or maybe even 3 stars. I initially listed only the pros to save time and to acknowledge that in the very large playing field of men's jeans, these are one of a few that are not truly horrible in style or comfort or both and many tack on a high price tag for the discomfort of either your lower body or your eyeballs. So where does Car Hart go wrong even with them coming closer to both comfort and style (or actually I am content with anyone who doesn't have a complete lack of style), closer than all except the wonderful consistency of Lucky. Normally I leave competitors out of reviews, but it has gotten so hard to find quality in the past 10 years that I wish to help those who seek quality find that quality. I also normally leave out brand names so that noone feels the review is a fake posted or motivated by a competitor. While noone besides I has the certainty, you will find it a good gamble to trust me.So to the negative in an otherwise positive jean. Simple. Insanely deep pockets -- literally very near the knees. If you have a need to carry a baseball bat in your pocket or you fear banks so much that you carry all of your life's savings in your pocket in some form, then these are the jeans for you to be certain. Very few other jeans are capable of hosting so much in their pockets. If comfort is more your priority, you won't so much appreciate the feel of your pocket change hanging out near your knees not to mention the awkward deep plunge into your pocket, digging in your pocket up to your elbows to access that change for the cashier at your favorite restaurant. Maybe the intent is to allow a farmer to carry a come-along in their. For those with no experience with farming, think about a farmer putting up a wire fence and pulling the wire taut between posts. Granted, it would be a very tall man to be able to place a come-along in even the very deep pockets of Car Hart, but if any jean could do it, it is Car Hart. However, for the closeness that Car Hart comes to comfort otherwise and for not gross or weird in styling together with their very reasonable pricing, I have deep respect, and I bestow to them 5 stars, and I sense they truly do intentional make the pockets deep for farmers to carry small tools inside of the, without having to resort to cargo pants that may present an opportunity for something to sang on power equipment or while tending animals. I am not a farmer, only a small town USA boy (old man now) who would work the fields on the outskirts of town some zillion years ago before an internet was even conceived. These deep pockets are common of jeans of old and jeans targeted to manual labor. These jeans are a nice weight compared to the 14 oz (oz/sq-yd) common of \"worker jeans\" or farmers jeans.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased these jeans over 5 times on Amazon and all of them have been good fits and worn well. I have several pairs in different stages of \"broken in\" status and am happy with them, BUT one pair failed after just a few uses. The zipper broke!I called Amazon and yes, I was a month past the return window, but I figured they might have a way to support a long time customer get a return pair. Nope. Customer service \"spoke to their lead\" and they repeated the same thing over and over again = no deal. return window closed. I was certain the goal was to get me to hang up and give up. Nice customer support Amazon. I gave up and hung up.Many bricks and mortar stores would let you return things for 90 days and have workmanship guarantees. Many brick and mortar stores will talk to a customer and try to find a fix. Store credit would be common for something that fails after less than 90 days of use. Not Amazon.I like these jeans a lot so will visit a alterations place and see if they can fix or replace the zipper but if they fail after you wear them 4 times, tough luck!",

Das ist aber kein Problem und vielleicht nur bei diesem Modell so. Oder ich bin dicker und kleiner geworden. Das ist aber eher nicht der Fall. ;-)",
