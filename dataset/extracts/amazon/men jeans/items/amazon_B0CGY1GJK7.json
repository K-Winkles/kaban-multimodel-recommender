                "reviewText": "Perhaps it is merely the connotation of jeans as being 'Denim', and Denim, being ...well; Blue Jeans.These IZOD 'jeans' do not feel like JEANS. ...They feel like dress pants. (of course, I did get `em in Black)The blend seems very lightweight--almost too lightweight for the broad-spectrum usefulness you expect from jeans. I cannot see these holding up to a lot of work=stress punishment.They do seem well-made, with good stitching, however.The 'stretch' aspect is apparent --the pants give as you flex. The waistband is reinforced, but has an annoying plastic-like 'IZOD' logo stamped at intervals...on the INSIDE. (seriously--my waistline does not need a Product Promo reminder)These seem more for your upscale moderately-physical user who wants to remain stylish...more or less.",

                "reviewText": "Handsome, comfortable black denim pants with a dark, opaque wash and straight leg construction. The product description calls them 'jeans' - this might be technically correct, but they wear more like a pair of Dockers than traditional blue jeans. Soft construction with a lot of stretch and lacking the texture I usually associate with denim. With the dark, dark wash they could easily pass for work pants or dress pants if you needed them to - even if dress codes would traditionally forbid jeans.The cut is a traditional straight leg pant. Size 34 waist was tight in the waist and rear compared to other brands' size 34s, tight in the thighs and then plenty of room in the leg. Other dimensions (inseam, etc.) seem to be sized properly. If you've got big thighs/quads/glutes it might be worth ordering a size up.Overall a great pair of pants at a modest price.",
