Putting them on the first time, I noticed they were too long by about 3 or 4 inches. I've worn the same size for decades and I had to roll the ends up or they would have been underneath my shoes. Within two weeks of frequent but not daily wear, they started tearing completely apart below the crotch. I wasn't running, hiking, doing yardwork, none of that, just walking around.
