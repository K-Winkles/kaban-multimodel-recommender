But they are like a box of chocolates- never know what you're going to get, even from purchase to purchase. I wear a 30-32 in the waist, depending on the designer and the kind of fit I want from them. But I knew from experience that these can be pretty unpredictable and don't care about your vanity. Thank goodness for Amazon try before you buy. 32 was TIGHT, 33 was still uncomfortable, 34 was pretty good, 35 was full mobility. The waist on these doesn't soften and mold itself to you over time like denim, so it's important that you get a size that will let you bend and move completely from the start.With all that said, I dig these pants. Flattering cut, especially if you're compulsively in cowboy boots like me. The high waist is very comfortable once you're sized right. Not too weird wearing them casually (although the permanent crease comes off a little formal), and easy to dress up with a tucked shirt and blazer. Overall, great stuff if you go in forewarned.",

                "reviewText": "I wear roper style boots almost exclusively to work, and during many other activities too. If I am in \u201cofficial\u201d mode, I tend to tuck in my shirt as well. I am also kinda slim, standing 6\u20192\u201d at around 180 pounds. I am 51 years old. I am a walking half century of wisdom and a statue of vintage sex-appeal \ud83d\ude02Anyway, my style is kinda retro, and I love these pants. With them on, my boots rocking, and a dress shirt tucked in, I look like I am ready to make a cameo on The Rockford Files or something, or maybe be an extra on North Dallas Forty. I love it. I bought a pair, wore them a couple times, then bought another in a different color. I wear them to work and look luscious. I have gotten numerous compliments, usually from the ladies. I swear to god I am not full of it!! \ud83e\udd23I think they are too pricey, but gettin\u2019s are getting right short if you like this sorta style and want to buy it brand new, so pony up, buttercup!! I\u2019ll bet they will discontinue them soon. Levis did that with a similar pant a few years ago.Much has been said about the sizing being way big. That\u2019s not my experience with the two pairs I have purchased. I measured myself at 36 at the waist. My favorite pair of jeans is 32 waist, 34 length. I ordered a 36 waist, 34 length in these, given that reviews said they were way undersized. Well, sent that pair back, and adjusted as needed. The right size for me is 34 waist, 32 length. That\u2019s about right according to my other pants, on average. So, I say order according to your true size and return if needed, instead of guessing like many have said.One thing of note: this sort of pant is a style. A western style. You gotta hike \u2018em up. The pelvis area is deep, so you have to pull them up like you\u2019re about to flamenco dance or take a Time Machine back to 1975, as a millionaire, and buy the damn Houston Oilers. That is the aesthetic. You gotta hike them babies up, tighten that beast under your navel, and own it. Next, you need to purchase a paddle from Amazon for beating off the babes!These pants are blatantly overpriced, made of less than desirable (but tough) material, but good luck finding such wonderfully retro styling for new anywhere else. If you are an analogous, old-school wanna-be cowboy/rockstar like me, I wholeheartedly recommend these pants!! I have bought two pair and will likely buy another in the coming months.",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching for the perfect pair of pants for a while now, and I have finally found them in these pants. I own about five pairs and I couldn't be happier with them. They fit me just like the picture, which is a rare find in clothing these days. Most of the time, I end up disappointed because the clothes I order online end up being either too big or too small, but these pants are true to size.One of the things I love about these pants is the way they fit me. They are not too loose in the leg and butt area, which is a common problem for me. I have a slim lower body and finding pants that fit me well can be a challenge. These pants, however, fit in all the right places and make me feel confident and comfortable.Another thing I love about these pants is their durability. They are made with high-quality materials and have a sturdy construction, which makes them feel like they will last for a long time. I have been wearing these pants regularly for a few months now, and they still look as good as new. They are also very easy to maintain, and I haven't had any issues with fading or shrinking.These pants have quickly become my go-to for any casual or even semi-formal occasions. They have a classic and timeless design, which makes them versatile and easy to style. They look great with a simple t-shirt and sneakers for a casual day out.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. They not only look great but also feel comfortable and are of high quality. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish pair of pants. In fact, I love them so much that I would buy another five pairs if needed. These pants have definitely exceeded my expectations, and I will continue to be a loyal customer.",

                "reviewText": "Nice quality and they look good. However I normally wear a 36x31 but after ordering several pants from Amazon over the years Amazon's ordering process advised me to order a 38x30 and I'm glad I listened. Even the 38 is pretty snug around my 36-37 waist and the 30\" length is about what my 31 length pants are. Good quality, just add a little extra for the waist size and shorten the length from you normally wear.",

La tela es un poco \u00e1spera pero me gustan porque parecen pantalones de los a\u00f1os 70s, es un estilo muy especial... no es para todo mundo, hoy los us\u00e9 con adidas samba y se ven muy bien... un poco largos pero estoy muy contento, comprar\u00e9 todos los colores que pueda haber... son fan de la ropa vaquera y ese estilo de pantal\u00f3n va con todo... ser\u00edan perfectos o al menos para mi ser\u00eda lo mejor que hubeira un poco el\u00e1sticos, para mi son 5 estrellas pero si tuvieran unos versi\u00f3n strech o el\u00e1sticos al menos un poquito ser\u00edan 6 estrellas... \u00a1c\u00f3mpralos! Est\u00e1n espectaculares....",
