Another pair I ordered had an outside leg seam that was not sewn. I've had similar sizing and sewing issues with these pants in the past. Unfortunately you have to experiment a bit with different pants of the same size. Free returns helps. But when you get the right fit and there are no sewing defects, they are great. They are a bit thinner material than other brand name jeans but I like the weight . They are soft, smooth and they move and stretch with you and look just like any other jeans. I have about 3 other pairs I bought a few years ago and they are still holding up well. One other complaint is the price has gone up about $10-$15 since then. But I think still worth it.",
