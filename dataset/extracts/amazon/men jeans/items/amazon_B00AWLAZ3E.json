                "reviewText": "When prowling for what you want on Amazon you need to read through the reviews to figure out why people like or dislike something because it varies from product to product. Duh, but you\u2019ll be surprised how often people will not look at something based on stars, and often times they are complaining about an issue that is of no consequence to you personally.These jeans are a great example. Most of the complaining I see is from people who should not be buying these jeans. I have been a tad overweight, to slightly overweight before, and I have been fit and trim. Every single person who knows anything about style reiterates over and over again that you should dress for your body type. But for some reason people continue to put crap on that isn\u2019t flattering and they shouldn\u2019t be wearing. These jeans are no different. Consult a jean wearing guide on your search engine or watch a video on the tube about what type of jeans you should be wearing for your body type.These jeans are primarly for someone who is fit, in shape, proportionate, or skinny. If you are not one of these, you probably don\u2019t want these jeans. I have one pair of Levi 527\u2019s that fit like these and 20 others that do not. This is the jean I have been looking for forever. Most jeans you buy are either tight all the way around like a (skinny/slim cut), loose all the way around like a (Boot Cut), or they are dad jeans, loose in the seat and tapered to a smaller hole at the bottom. I have had a pretty easy time finding jeans that fit nice with a pair of loafers of dress shoes or some sneakers, but all my jeans to go with my boots bag too much in the rear. These are the answer to that problem. These are fitted in the seat and taper down to a boot cut at the bottom. The amount of time I\u2019ve spent looking for jeans that actually do this seems like forever. If you want a wider cut to go over your boot, but you have nice legs and a butt and are in the right shape these are the perfect jean for you. Women like to see mens rears as well, and they don\u2019t always want you to wear sneakers. So if you wanna throw on some cowboy or rocker boots and not have a bunch of sagging and bagging in the thighs, these jeans are for you.",

                "reviewText": "*Update* I liked the first pair so I ordered a second in a different color. They fit exactly the same, look great and are well stitched. This time, however, the zipper was screwy. If you've ever over-stuffed a suit case and the zipper separated without you unzipping it, that is what the issue was. It took a while to get it back in the groove and even longer to get it engaged all the way down. I ended up putting a drop of laundry detergent on it for lubricant and worked it back and forth until it was fully engaged from top to bottom. They are perfect now, however I have to knock a star off for this one. Still a great pair of Jeans.Order these at your own risk. I love the fit and stitch. These are TIGHT around the crotch. I bought them for my father, but unfortunately when he tried them on he greatly resembled Steve The Boner from X Factor. Luckily we have the same waist size so I kept them for myself. Even though I like a slim fit I still won't dare washing them in warm water. If they get any tighter around the man parts then I won't be able to wear them comfortably. One thing that makes them so tight in that area is the fact that they are cut very low. The distance between my waist line and upper thigh is 5 and 7/8ths inches. If it was over 6 inches I couldn't wear these without them sagging below my waist line.",

The inseam cradles your package as expected and the lower waist line is comfortable. What I seriously dislike about these jeans is the fabric. The fabric could have had some elasticity added to it for a greater range of motion. These pants are stiff and have absolutely no give to them which makes them incredibly uncomfortable. Im certain that after a month or two of wearing them they may break in, but in the meantime you'll hate them.",
