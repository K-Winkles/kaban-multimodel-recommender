As a 42 year old guy (not overweight, athletic build), I guess you have to accept this if you want to look fashionable and wear something that isn't from the 80's. The pants look good, fit pretty well, but if I were to suggest anything, it would be to drop the length of the crotch about an inch or two to give you more room. We are not all emo high school kids wanting to wear skinny jeans! This is across the board with all brands and not a Lee problem. I still think Lee are some of the better fitting jeans out there.",

But be careful\u2026maybe different colors are made in different countries, IDK\u2026but I do know that sizing can vary enough to have to return/replace. My experience: light blue color one par the rise was an inch or more shorter, another pair the waist was an inch or more bigger. Had to do a second return (which necessitated a whole new order to get the third pair, which finally was right). But another color (dark blue) sizing was fine.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second pair of these and I really like that they seem well made and durable. I like the way they fit and this is mostly due to the stretch, such that they give where they need to (e.g. belly) and cling everywhere else so they somewhat form fit. I've bought other stretch jeans that clung too much and looked odd, but these seem perfect in this respect.These seem to be cut lower in the waist, which I like the look of compared to other higher rise jeans.One downside to stretch jeans is that the knees tend to stretch out and get a little baggy if you bend a lot in them, but washing them shrinks the stretch back to normal. My 'non-stretch' jeans could be worn for a few days in a row, but these get stretched out only after a day or two so they need more washing.",
