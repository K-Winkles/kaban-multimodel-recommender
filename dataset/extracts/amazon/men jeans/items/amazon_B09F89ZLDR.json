I bought a pair from a local store, which fit me perfectly but once I ordered the moonlight color here, they were too small so I returned it and ordered 36x32, which are now too big. Then upon further inspection I realized that the ones I actually need have a small label above the right back pocket that says \"sportflex - waistband stretches up to 1\". The pair that I returned didn't have that label, yet the 36x32 I just got has it, hence they're too big. I hate to return again but there's nothing I can do to get Amazon to ship me the right version of these pants.....",
