Waist-wise it fits perfectly, I don't have to worry about my tool belt pulling my pants down. It's a nice color, doesn't stain much and is thick enough to keep you warm without overheating you. They fit perfectly around my boots without being too tight. 9/10 would recommend grabbing a pair for this fall season.",

                "reviewText": "Having never work Dickies jeans I didn't know what to expect for size. I went off of my Levi 559 size. The waist was almost perfect, a little loose like it is a half size to big. I'm caught in the middle between 31 and 32. The length however was about 2 inches to long. Washing did not help so I hemmed them up. I like the heavier fabric compared to the paper thin Levis I have been getting. It's heavier but still soft. And the relaxed fit is nice but not baggy. Looks good in the waist and hips. I also don't like droopy crotches and Dickies pass this nicely. I will definitely be changing over to Dickies brand from now on. I'm 63, been wearing Levis since I was a yonker and have become increasingly disappointed with the quality. I also don't like pre stressed clothes or that dirty brown look. Looks like they were worn in the oil field and stains have set in. At times, that is all I can find in my size 32 x 34 at Levi outlet. I can no longer depend on 501's unwashed to fit consistently. Legs to tight, waste to big, fabric thickness varies. So sad to see Levi quality diminish over time. There was a time I could buy 10 pair of 501 unwashed and every pair fit like the next. Can't say that now. Dickies, keep building a good product and I will be faithful to the brand.",

                "reviewText": "I love these work pants. They fit as expected. They are a good mid-weight - not too heavy or rigid, but still tough and good for year round wear. Pretty darn durable as well. I bought my first pair of these on Amazon a little over a year ago. I wear them quite frequently for work, and they have held up great. Dickies are usually a great value, but I have had issues in the past finding the right size with some Dickies styles -which is incidentally my biggest complaint about Dickies, overall. There seems to be no consistency from style to style (or even sometimes with differing colors of the same style) regarding sizing and fit for Dickies pants. The styles of Dickies that Walmart carries seem to run about a size and a half too small. I typically wear 34x30, and I couldn't button the Wal-Mart Dickies in that size with a pair of vice grips. However, the 36x30 in the same style are way too baggy for me. I also had the same problem with the first pair of Dickies I tried from Amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/Dickies-Mens-Relaxed-Duck-34x30/dp/B000PSVEUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1490228952&sr=1-1&nodeID=7147441011&psd=1&keywords=Dickies%2BMen's%2BRelaxed%2BFit%2BDuck%2BJean%2C%2BMoss%2C%2B34x30&th=1&psc=1. Luckily, I found these that actually do fit, and I have been extremely pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Pant size is 38x34, relaxed fit carpenter duck jean. Straight leg. Rear pockets are huge. Tool loop as well. Too bad the trend doesn\u2019t continue.The front pockets are small, the opening is as well. With sweaty swollen hands, I work construction, this won\u2019t be very accessible. The side pocket is small as well. No, I don\u2019t want a cargo pant. I have a Iphone13 pro max, the case is a otterbox defender. Fitting isn\u2019t even close. Sure would be handy not to have to use a case holder appendage or put the phone in a bending area just to have it on me. So no, front or back pocket isn\u2019t a good spot while working, talking physical labor not walking around. I\u2019ve been using the side pocket on pants since cell phones. This isn\u2019t some new invention. Carhartt pants fit my phone snugly, no worries on the motorcycle. Otherwise the pants fit fine. Just don\u2019t expect big roomy front pockets or a cellphone holding side pocket. Bummer, I really liked these pants.",
