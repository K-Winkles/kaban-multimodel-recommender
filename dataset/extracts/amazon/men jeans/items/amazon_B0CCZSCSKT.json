After only wearing it for two weeks I realized that the fabric in the crotch and inner thigh area rubs against the skin and each other and only after two weeks of wearing, there is a hole where the fabric rubs. This is not my first athletic fit jeans, but the first one to not last this a few years. A few years would be a joke for these jeans, it did not even last a full month. I thought Levi's was a reputed company so tried an online purchase from them. Not buying jeans online anymore due to this experience",

                "reviewText": "These pants were a pretty good and well priced thing to get. Surprisingly these jeans feel pretty good. I have been needing a new pair of jeans for work. The one thing about this is that the fabric is really light and protective. You can easily move around in these and it is comfortable to be in all day. It is fairly breathable so you can walk around in them outside. If you happen to sweat though, this does stick to the skin. I would say it is pretty warm and be great for the winter but not so much for the summer. It also has a fly so you can easily go to the bathroom. The zipper is pretty strong so you should not have to worry about it breaking. The pants fit pretty well and do not agitate or irritate my skin (unless I am sweating and it stick to my skin). The pants fit as expected so I did not have much issue in wearing them. One thing I will note about this is that you should get a size up if you are the very edge of the measurement chart. I found that the one size up actually fit better. They do not sag or anything. This can be machine washed however I would recommend that they be washed under heavy duty and cold washed to keep the color from running and overall I think this pants are great. They are comfortable, flexible, and look great. I am able to wear these outside as well as be comfortable in them all day. I probably would wear them casually to hangs out and such. The color looks great and washing them is not too difficult.",

I have a shorter inseam even though I'm an average height guy and when I buy jeans in my waist, the length NEVER seams to work because almost every Big & Tall sized pair of jeans doesn't stop with a roomy thigh, they take that all the way to the cuff. The result is a pair of jeans that A. Make me feel twice as big as I am because there is so much fabric and B. Drags the ground even though the inseam is correct. They usually end up ripping because I'm constantly stepping on the oversized opening as if I accidentaly bought a pair of JNCO's.Problem solved, thank you SO MUCH! Now, lets look into providing more color options....though, The Blue Canyon is really nice.**update**I just purchased 2 more pairs and, like a few of the other comments mentioned, these feel much lower quality. They are lighter weight material and do not have the same feeling as the original pairs I purchased, which is saddening.They also are not as roomy in the thighs as the pairs I purchased in the past, I've lost about 20lbs and wear 4 sizes smaller than I was which could be a factor but I don't feel that should affect the material quality.***update***After having had the new pairs for a couple of weeks, I feel like its safe to say they wear like the others. The twill are just as comfortable as the denim and fit the same. I probably wont buy another brand of jeans unless Levis discontinues the B&T 541 Athletc.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so disappointed in these Levi's. I usually wear 514's so i knew the fit might be different, but I can't believe how thin the material is! I've been buying cheap Levi's Signature jeans locally for working and these are thinner than those and don't fit nearly as nice. It isn't just the stretch fabric...all my 514's are the stretch type and those are nice and thick. But the single worst thing about these for me is the tiny front pockets. I'm a slim guy with normal size hands and it's like the pockets were made for kids. I'm 54 and I've never seen a pair of men's jeans with such tiny pockets. Just getting a cell phone in and out is clunky. When I sit with the phone in my pocket it jambs the end straight into my leg so that's no good either. For me they're unwearable even as work jeans, but since I've already washed them and worn them for a day I won't send them back. I'll just take the loss and never buy 541's again.UPDATE: I've tried wearing these a couple times and just can't get used to them. As I said, the pockets are small and there isn't enough slack in the opening to get a hand into easily. What's really odd tho is that anything in the front pockets...keys, change, cell... ends up more to the side of your legs instead of hanging straight down. It's like they were sewn in the wrong position and it's really annoying. Maybe I just got a bad pair.",

Since I've known I wear 541, because I have muscular legs and I didn't put too much emphasis on color, but on the way I feel. fit, on the bottom and thighs. But the color of the jeans received is also beautiful even if, I repeat, it is completely different from the one in the picture. So, be careful, if you want exactly that shade, you don't risk ordering it online, but if you are more flexible in tastes you can order ... for sure, the jeans you will receive will be beautiful.The series of jeans received is exact (18181-0062) as the one on the site, so it is not the seller who is wrong.",
