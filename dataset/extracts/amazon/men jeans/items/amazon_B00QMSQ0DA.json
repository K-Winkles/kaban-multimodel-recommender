I had to go a size up in the waist for the thighs and crotch to fit better but overall nice fitting jeans. Only complaint is front pocket entrance could stand to be a bit wider. If you have a knife clipped into a pocket it can be difficult to get your hand into that pocket for anything else.",

They get holes in the thighs fast, just from keys or a phone in the pocket. I don\u2019t even use these for work jeans\u2026they just fall apart.
