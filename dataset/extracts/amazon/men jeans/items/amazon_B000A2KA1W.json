                "reviewText": "I've never owned a pair of Riggs before and I really like them. I was originally going to get the Ranger version but Carpenter were 25% off so I started here, but I wonder if it was worth it since I use cargo pockets often. The material is a bit stiff but it feels very strong. The back pockets are fully lined with Cordura, so no lip to hook onto wallets and full pocket durability. Cordura is just a woven nylon for heavy use, like a rough canvas. The brown leather tape measure clip is only a lip on the edge, not full double sided leather, with the backside being white pocket liner made from ripstop cotton. The front pockets are nice and deep, the back pockets are large enough, the front utility pocket is big but too tight, the tool pocket opening is too small for the hand so don't place screw bits or whatever in the pocket, and the hammer loop is normal. The pants are on the baggy side but the waist is a tight fit, maybe too tight but I can fit without a belt. I'm more of a 31\" than 30\" but I usually buy 30\" as it tends to fit better than 32\" do, so my size seems to vary by pant design. The button slot wasn't fully cut on my pants, but the button is now easier to get in and out now that I sliced the hole longer towards where the stitching is. The very bottom joint between the legs has an additional cut section in the design to prevent split tearing, similar to martial arts pants. Loden color is a dark subdued green color, which I thought would be like a pine green but it almost looks dark gray because the hue is so subtle, while the stitching is more of a pine green. Dark gray buttons and brown Cordura and leather go with the Loden green to create a nice mountain woods color palette. All of the stitching on the pants are very durable feeling, extra strong build. The main feature of the pants is the ripstop cotton fabric material itself, and the pants as a whole feel incredibly strong and durable. These pants feel like they will last a long time, but I'll have to wait and see as some reviews claim their pants tore quickly. Despite being made from a stiff and strong material, they feel very comfortable and natural on the skin. Machine wash cold with like colors, only non-chlorine bleach when needed, tumble dry low or line dry. I would avoid fabric softener to retain the strength but dryer sheets are probably fine. For $45.50, I think you're getting good quality pants but I would pay a few dollars more for the Ranger pants which come with cargo pockets and double knee material. My Carpenter pants were 25% off which made the price $33.90, and then I had a $10 off coupon for Amazon through some purchase or whatever, so for me these were more like half-off and paid with a birthday gift card. Now that I own a pair of Riggs Workwear, I can see paying in full for pants like these as I thought the price didn't look worth it at first but I see that they have much higher build quality and material than typical pants. All I can do now is just wait and see how well they truly hold up when taken outdoors.",

                "reviewText": "Having liked Wrangler jeans I've purchased in the past, I expected these to be an upgrade. While the material feels stronger and impossible to tear, it has worse abrasion resistance. After a few months, a small hole developed on the upper left thigh. The material feels thinner, offers less insulation, and isn't as soft. On a positive note, it seems to do a better job blocking moisture. 38x36 fit was perfect though; relaxed and comfortable, yet not baggy.I prefer the Wrangler Classic line.",
