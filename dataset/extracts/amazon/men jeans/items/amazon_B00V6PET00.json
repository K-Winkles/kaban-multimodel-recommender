                "reviewText": "My dad has short legs, like 27 inches, so it is always difficult to find jeans to fit his legs. He always needs to have them hemmed, so this is expected. Getting the waist and seat, and roominess of the legs themselves (not too tight or too baggy) to his liking is more important when ordering. Nowadays, however, with the style being more close-fitting, it is more of a challenge to find just the right look and feel for him, so when we find a brand and style choice that fits the bill, and for a reasonable price, we order several at a time and make sure to either keep the original tags and receipts somewhere safe for future ordering or else, keep it in our lists at whatever online store (Amazon, in this case) we bought them from. My dad really loves these pants and he will love them even more after we hem them just a bit. And, they look really good on him. He normally wears Wranglers, being an old rancher/cowboy who grew up with this brand, like myself and his dad, but with the special pricing of the Lee jeans when he ordered, he couldn't resist, at least, trying them. He says he will likely order again in the future.",

Bush administration. No joke. So I know very well how these used to be.Two MINOR problems with the current iteration...one, they have added some \"stretchy\" fiber to the blend, which unfortunately makes dog hairs cling to the fabric. Since I have a Lab mix who sheds his weight in body hair each year (probably not literally, but his production of dog hair is staggering--it collects in drifts on my floors), and he's white, this is not good for black jeans. My pants are now always covered with dog hairs. I still wear them, but I won't be buying more.Two, they seem awfully cheap/light for so-called \"Premium\" jeans. You used to get a sense that they were quite a bit more stout. These are not badly made, but they seem to be cutting as many corners as possible, right up to, but not over, the point at which it might become a problem. They're decently made, but I think the word \"Premium\" is, er, a stretch.Really on the fence about whether to give these three stars or two.",
