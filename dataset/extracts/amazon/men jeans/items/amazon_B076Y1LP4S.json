                "reviewText": "The pants win for style points and fit. They look good, feel comfy and loose in the thigh (if you work out a lot or just have big legs, this is a very comfortable pant). My only gripe with the pant however if the quality of the materials / fake leather patch on the back / stitching. The patch on the back of the pants has already worn through after a month of wear and the stitching is loose on the side of the pant seam. I would buy this pant again if it was closer to $50 instead of $100.",

                "reviewText": "I'm in the UK and had never heard of Silver jeans before (they're Canadian) until I was browsing on here one day on the lookout for a pair of bootcut jeans at a reasonable price, and knowing that prices for jeans on here can vary wildly depending on size & colour of each particular style. I have been on a bit of a binge jeans buying thing in recent months and have gotten too many really but when there's a good deal on, mainly in my case for really nice, well cut bootcut jeans, it's hard to resist the temptation to get another pair if they're bargain priced compared to regular prices! The first pair of Silvers I got was a women's style and I was so impressed I decided to keep an eye out for more from the brand if they were on offer as some of the prices are too high and head towards the \u00a3100 (sometimes over) mark. That's how I came across these men's ones and ordered a pair at a crazy cheap price, knowing full well that other jeans of this quality cost many times more, within this brand and other brands such as Levi, etc. These Craigs have totally fulfilled, even exceeded, my expectations and are lovely! I would say they're easily unisex and the cut is ideal for my shape, they have a little stretch and they fit so well everywhere with no bagginess around the hips, legs, etc. The first pair I got was the Marble Indigo ones and I'm so happy with those that when I found I could get a Vintage Indigo pair for around the same super cheap price in my size I ordered a pair of those too! I also have a couple of pairs of Ariat jeans that I got on here too, having also never heard of that brand before either but noticing that they're high end and often priced at over \u00a3100, and I'd liken my Silvers to Ariats in quality but generally the price of Silver jeans seems to be a little lower than Ariat ones. The one thing I would mention is that my Silver jeans, similarly to my Ariats, seem to run quite long and even though I have long legs some of the pairs I have are a tad too long but I kept them anyway because to go down a size in length would have meant paying many times more than the ones I have and I'm not prepared to pay so many times more and need to rein in my budget! So, I would possibly recommend being careful about what length to order and possibly going down a size in length would be the way to go! Other than that, these Craig jeans are perfect!",
