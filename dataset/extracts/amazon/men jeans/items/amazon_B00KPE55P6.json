                "reviewText": "I love the feel of this denim, it is soft and that 1% of spandex seems to help with just a bit of give. Another reviewer Ray said the length of a 34 is more like a 35 and he is spot on. I ordered a 34 length based on that suggestion and they fit like at 35, perfect for me. I cannot comment on the counterfeit issue some users seemed to have encountered as this is my first pair of Lucky jeans. I also didn't go to a department store to investigate. The denim, the stitching, the rivets, all appear to be great quality. Perhaps users feel that there is no way Amazon could sell these for $49.99 and they not be fake? If after some wear and washes they start falling apart then I will post an update to this review.",

                "reviewText": "You can probably tell by they yay part I'm not a man haha I bought these for my husband and to help others ORDER 1 SIZE down unless you have experience with this brand and already know your size. For reference my husband is 6'0\", 195lbs, wear L shirts, and usually is 36x32. My experience with lucky brand is the 361's are made larger at least the ones I've bought from Amazon. The first time around I ordered a 36x32 his normal size in Levi's. Big no no they were HUGE. We since ordered down and found they fit absolutely perfect. Now..What my husband likes:1.Loose in crotch ( and not like stupid mossimo jeans that have an elongated crotch these are cut just right without the extra material)2. Loose in thighs ( my husband has a hard time finding jeans due to his thick legs he has a natural athletic build and most jeans are tight)3. He said they felt good too.4. More of a low rise - he liked that they say lower and he didn't have to pull them up high so he could bend like other jeansOverall, he loves them! The only jeans he use to wear was Levi's because those were the only company not making it huggers as he calls em and accommodated him being able to squat or bend down...that is till we found the Lucky Brand 361's I highly recommend these if you like jeans to be a little looser fitting and more of a low rise verses way up. We also found success in the 367's too which we ordered down a size (36x32 the normal size but in Lycky brand again the 34x32 fit perfectly) Good job I will be back to try other styles when on sale \ud83d\ude0a",
