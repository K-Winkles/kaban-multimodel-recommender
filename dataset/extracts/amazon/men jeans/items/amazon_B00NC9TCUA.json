I had 181s that I bought at the Lucky store and the combination of losing weight and starting to wear out wanted to get replacements. I checked the Lucky site first and they were no longer offered there. Some reason checked here on Amazon and they had them, Lucky Me! So I've been buying these (ok more like mini-hoarding them) on Amazon to solidify my jeans collection. I have both 32\"x30\" and 30\"x30\" and will likely order a pair of 31\". Why? Sometimes need to tuck certain shirts in but also have times wear with t-shirt so not tucked, and by having multiple sizes I avoid either painful constriction or my pants falling down. My original Lucky jeans from 10+ years ago still kicking and I find that the sizing and fit is consistent. I'm slim/athletic but don't like the skinny cuts and also don't want to be too baggy so I find these are a happy medium. Not sure I would blindly order jeans online but happy that they are offered here. The Lucky You always makes me laugh. I do have Levis, but find that the sizing is not consistent and have to try on many different pairs before I find one that fits, and even then not sure how they are going to turn out until after the first wash.",

For a roughly 30% increase in price, I expect a 30% increase in quality.",

                "reviewText": "***Update*** 11/9/2015-- I ended up ordering some 33x30s to see what I'd get. I first ordered another color, and they were of very high quality and fit as they should. Huge (positive) difference in material as well. So I ordered two more pairs in this color. Initial impression is very good. Currently drying them and will add to this in a matter of hours. My initial thought is the 34x30s are knock offs and the 33x30s are not. I mean, think about it.... the amount of 34s sold vs. 33s must me 10-1. They ***Update*** 10/31/2015- My third pair of jeans arrived. I had kept the second pair to compare. The second pair seemed more authentic, good material, but the size was still way too big. Especially in length. Enter the third pair. They showed up and the first thing I did was wash and dry them. I then laid them out and measured the inseam. Compared to the second pair they were shorter, but not much. I then got out my last GOOD pair of 181s purchased right here on Amazon last year. They were shorter than the second and third pairs. Bottom line, even the third pair is not consistent and the inseam measures longer than 30\". They are also big in the waist and butt/thighs giving that sloppy 'these pants are too big' look. Not the 'loose fit' look that's supposed to be. I don't know what is going on here. Lucky? Amazon? Amazon resellers who ship to Amazon? I contacted Lucky again and they wanted me to jump through way too many hoops I just don't have time to do. I would steer clear of these. I mean, THREE pairs ALL DIFFERENT, yet all the labeled the same size and style. **UPDATE*** 10/20/2015 -- I emailed Lucky and they confirmed Amazon LLC is a licensed reseller of their products. They also thanked me for pointing out there were some knock offs being sold. I took a chance and ordered another pair, letting Amazon know I knew for sure the first pair were fakes. Sure enough I got the real deal. I would make sure you demand an Amazon LLC order, and if something seems off it probably is. CONTACT LUCKY, AMAZON, AND DO AN EXCHANGE IN THAT CASE**** Long time Lucky owner, even several 181s. These jeans not only showed up way off on the color ( I bought the exact same pair back in March) they were HUGE, and, felt like cardboard. These HAVE to be counterfeit. Not only are they HUGE, after one wash and dry cycle by themselves I washed and dried a second time with other like color jeans and they were bled all over by these jeans material. I've asked for an exchange to see what happens with the next pair. Very disappointing.",
