Industry-standard sewing machines couldn't handle our designs, so we broke them apart and rebuilt them to produce our one-of-a-kind vision. With its five-needle thread at two-stitch-per-inch process, our Super T stitch was instantly recognized for style that was unlike any other denim brand in the world. True Religion's designs soon caught the attention of the world's most iconic style leaders, and demand for our denim grew rapidly. Everything from there on out was committed to be bigger, better, and bolder than the rest. As our stitching evolved, True Religion became synonymous with quality craftsmanship and bold style designed to stand out. Our specialty denim fits, washes & treatments, were all designed with amplified details to grab attention at every turn. Our iconic horseshoe was born from the silhouette of a Buddha's smile, and our hardware was inspired by the romance of denim's 140-year history. We have always been fashion forward, even from behind. Our styles inherit the swagger of their given name. The Joey. The Ricky. The Halle. However, it's the Fearless Style Leaders who rock True Religion with a Be So Bold attitude that ignite the world with bold statements of creative self-expression. We became famous because we were like no one before us, and what began with a stitch now leads to a future of innovative fashion designed by the fearless, for the fearless.",

                "reviewText": "Cant go wrong with True Religions!They are Nice Jean's yet run a little larger as they are made with a bit of Stretch.Make sure to order \"Your Size\" or if u want them a bit smaller order a size Down.I am a size 28 in True Religion Jeans and I exchanged for a size 28 and they fit good and at the waistline they stretch some and enough that if they had size 27 I could of had an even better fit, maybe even a perfect fit, however there is no telling how these Jean's will shrink some when and if set in the dryer.. it's a Gamble.Note: I've came across the Top Review and the Reviewer explained that her brother says to order a Size Up and I Disagree as True Religion Jeans are all I wear and with these type of Ricky \"Stretch\" Jeans, they run a bit larger due to the Stretch Material. Dont make the mistake I have and order a size up because you read that False Review..Big Mistake!",
