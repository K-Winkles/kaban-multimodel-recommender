I bought a couple of \u201cperfect jeans\u201d before and they were alright. But these blow them out of the water. Wear them almost anytime I go out for a casual evening and they fit my body amazingly. I\u2019ve gotten more compliments from these jeans than I\u2019ve gotten on almost any other part of my wardrobe. Might take a few tries to find you size, but once you do, you will never look for another pair of jeans. With any other designer jeans I can\u2019t even bend down to put my boots on and I can barely even fit my wallet and cell phone in my pockets. Must try for guys with a muscular lower body.",
