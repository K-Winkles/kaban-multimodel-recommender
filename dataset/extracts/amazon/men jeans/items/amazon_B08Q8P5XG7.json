I love the fit, and they're super simple! Will definitely be purchasing more of the Slim/Ash line in different colors!",

                "reviewText": "My son ordered these jeans three times and had to return them each time. They look fantastic on, but the sizing is off, he is a slender 30-32 max waist and the 30s and 31s were incredibly small on him. He ordered the 32s and they were way too big. he is also tall, so we were surprised that the 34 lengths (the longest they had) fit him just fine. So it's a shame they didn't work out because the denim colors and the look of the jeans were great. However, the price was a turnoff for most of the pairs. They were all over the board with pricing which didn't make much sense. So if they fit those who try these jeans I'm sure you will love the look! They just didn't work out for us over here!",
