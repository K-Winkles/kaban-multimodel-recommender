I am 5 foot 8 inches, 145 pounds, and they fit my body perfectly. They fit the butt and thighs perfectly without being too tight and provide a nice amount of stretch when squating down. Great all around, they can be worn for a long workday, but are also nice enough to wear out on date nights. Very high value jeans! I highly recommend them.",

No, the Kenneth Cole jeans aren't as form fitting as the Mugsy jeans, but they aren't loose at all & quite light & stylish. I am 6'2\" & 180 lbs, ordered a 34x34 & they fit fine. I have zero idea if these will be long lasting like traditional jeans, but if durability & length of life of the jeans is your primary factor in buying these jeans, then don't, & stick with traditional jeans. However, if you want stylish & form fitting jeans that aren't bulky or heavy, & cost way less than top of the line brands like Mugsy, then give these a try.",
