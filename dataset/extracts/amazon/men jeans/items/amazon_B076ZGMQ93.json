Stretch comfort, straight fit. Identical. But the 2nd pair which arrived a few days later, had a tag reading:\"Slim fit in seat and thighs\"Instead of:\" Extra room in seat and thigh\".THANKS, seller for sending me the wrong product. It wastes an hour of my time doing the return, driving to/from.UPS store.You should be creating a seperate listing or selectable options, not sending a customer two different styles of the exact same item.It costs Amazon money, too.
