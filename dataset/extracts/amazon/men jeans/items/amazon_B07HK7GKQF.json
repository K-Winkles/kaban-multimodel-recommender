                "reviewText": "For starters, this review is NOT about quality or longevity. It is about my search looking for something that fit my size and style. My sole jeans brand for the last 15 years or so was JCP Arizona Classic Boot Cut, however over the past year, it has been impossible to find my size (29x32) and color anymore, which led me to looking for jeans online which I was reluctant of doing, considering the sizing. I started with purchasing the following all in 29x32. I am 5'8\" and 141 lbs with chicken legs that have never seen the gym and my true measured inseam is ~31\", granted I would never pull them up THAT high.Levi's 527 Slim Boot Cut - They sent the wrong size 32x29 which were waayyy too tight on the calves. I dont know how these are considered boot cut. I didnt bother to reorder the correct size as if the 32\" waist were too tight on my calves, the 29\" waist were not gonna be any better.Wrangler's Men's Cowboys Boot Cut - Liked the cut but not the stitch patter and was way too long. I think this may have been a true 32-33\" inseam but when wearing it, it came out to be way too long.Lee Men's Legendary Regular Boot Cut - Again, liked the cut, but was way too long. I think this may have been a true 32-33\" inseam but when wearing it, it came out to be way too long.Amazon Basics Slim-Fit Stretch Boot Cut - I liked it, the length was also perfect and I really like the washed black color. It is a bit more fitted in the thighs which I am not used to, however the \"stretch\" material does make it comfortable. Although it makes my legs look really skinny, I will end up keeping this pair, but I dont envision purchasing more of these. Top overlaid jeans in pictureAmazon Basics Straight Fit Boot Cut - I think I found my style. The length was perfect, just like the slim-fit version and the legs were not as tight. It actually is almost completely identical with Arizona Classic Boot Cut in sizing. Middle black overlaid jeans in picture. Color wise, washed grey (NOT pictured) is a bit light for my taste. I wish they had a washed black.Pictured from top (overlaid) down - On top Amazon Basics Slim-Fit Boot Cut (Washed Black) / Middle Amazon Basics Straight-Fit Boot Cut (Regular Black) / Bottom Arizona Original Boot Cut barely visible due to similar size (Blue)Edit: I found that going up a size (from 29x32 to 30x32) totally alleviated by issue with the jeans being overly snug in the thigh. Now I found exactly what I wanted. I do with the pockets were a little larger like standard jeans. These are a tad small. They still fit my phone, but causes them to be in an awkward location when I sit down.",

                "reviewText": "I'd like to start off by saying it's probably more accurate to give them 3.5 out of 5 stars. Chances are if you are reading the reviews, you are wondering how these compare to the more popular bootcut jeans(Levis 527, Arizona, Wrangler Retro, Cinch Ian, Ariat M5, etc.) An overwhelming majority are probably specifically wondering how they compare to the Levi's 527. Durability wise they seem to hold up well after about 5-6 months of owning them they seem to hold up pretty well doing light/moderate work, and going through about half a dozen wash cycles. The durability surpasses Arizona jeans by quite a bit, which would already have noticeable signs of wear and damage by this point. They seem to be holding up about as well as a pair of Levis 527 would, but it's worth mentioning they just don't feel quite as durable, despite Levi's starting to feel thinner over the years. As far as fit goes, these are definitely the slimmest fitting pair of jeans from anything I've mentioned above. They fit the tightest over a boot of any boot cut jean I've worn. They feel slimmer all over compared to any of the others, but not by much. The stretch material is definitely noticeable, but I would have preferred if they had a fit closer to Levi's to begin with instead of compensating with more flex in the material. I don't think I'd buy another pair, but these have proven to be durable enough and fit decent enough to keep. If you don't want to pay Levi's, Wrangler, Cinch, or Ariat prices, and dont mind them fitting a little slimmer, they are a pretty decent pair of jeans.",

With these amazon jeans I had to go down to a 28 waist which fit well and are very comfortable. Since they are almost 1/2 the price of my beloved wranglers I've now bought 4 pairs of these instead. The waist has a bit of stretch to them so don't be too concerned buying a size or 2 smaller than what you normally wear.",
