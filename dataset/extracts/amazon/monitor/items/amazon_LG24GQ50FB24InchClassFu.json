One issue though, right after the one month was up where i could return it, i noticed a dead pixel about in the middle of my screen, this isnt really a big issue but its just kinda annoying sometimes. Overall great monitor for any game you wanna play",

                "reviewText": "First, here's a tip. Sometimes when I turn it off, the backlight doesn't fully turn off. You'll have to turn it back on and then off again for it to fully turn off. It's not ALL the time but it does do it sometimes. Or unplug it and plug it back in. Otherwise these monitors are very nice but I don't like how hot the bottom right corner can get but apparently these are known for that and is fine. I have both my monitors on a mount and just put a small clamp desk fan on the mount facing the back of my monitor in case it gets too hot. You don't have to do that, but I do for peace of mind.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly \u2014 cant be upset, will need an upgrade but i was totally pleased with this monitor. Recently built my first PC, with an RTX 4070 and I5 12600k. Since I was new to this I didnt realize i needed a new monitor, so i went looking for something that was affordable and compatible. Got this for around 130 bucks when it was originally 175 so it was a pretty good deal considering my budget, however Ive noticed grainy images with my PC \u2014 but to be completely fair the RTX4070 is a 1440p GPU, not a 1080p. If I want to I can apply higher resolution settings, and they come out well with no graininess. Besides that, for games where reaction time can really matter like shooters, RTS games, and even racing games, Ive had a blast. The monitor is super fast (at something like 165hz for 130usd), cheap, not too big either. Being used to small computer screens, this was pretty new to me, and honestly a lot of fun, although as i said before i still need to upgrade because my GPU isnt meant for 1080p",

I\u2019ve had it a few months now and absolutely love it. I find LG has some of the best displays around and this monitor is no different. It\u2019s so vibrant! Gives off no heat even when on for hours! At first I expect a 27 to be rather small. Once I got it, I was happily surprised to see that the 27 is actually pretty big! Not bulky big though. The monitor itself is very well built and sleek. I love it and would absolutely recommend. 5/5",
