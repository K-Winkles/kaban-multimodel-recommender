                "reviewText": "So far this monitor has been better than expected. I have used it with my MacBook Pro with only USB-C, my MSI Katana 17 gaming laptop with only a USB-C and mirrored on my iPad Pro. All looked pretty good hooked up, and with only connected to USB-C makes this very mobile. It actually fits with my MSI laptop in my case together taking up hardly any additional space. The stand isn\u2019t ideal, but to make it truly a portable monitor, I will tolerate\u2026it\u2019s not horrible. The picture is really good at 1080p and pairs up so easily with either MacOS or Win11. If you are looking for an awesome extra monitor to take on the road, or at least reduce the amount of cables used, especially if you have USB-C or Thunderbolt, this is the monitor for you!",

                "reviewText": "I'm not one to leave reviews but I recently moved overseas and was allowed to keep working remotely for my company. I needed an easy, travel-friendly, lightweight option to use as an additional computer monitor for my laptop and was surprised by the quality, portability, and value of the HotYeah monitor. Despite never hearing of the HotYeah brand before, this has made working remote - whether from a home office, hotel lobby, or coffee shop - so much easier than flipping back and forth between screens on my laptop and it takes up virtually no space in my work bag. Very pleased with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "The picture quality isn't quite right on this, and the settings to adjust color are wonky and don't really give you what you need. I don't mind much because I just need this screen for coding and work but the aspect ratio of this screen is better suited for media, which I wouldn't recommend. If you don't mind the low picture quality, the resolution is fine and it gets to 60 FPS which makes it good for games. I didn't have a way to test latency however. Tested with ipad and macbook and it worked without hassles.",

I use a Microsoft Surface Pro and wanted some more real estate that was easy to pull out to use at the kitchen table or something without having to get out a big monitor with power cords. I am able to use only the USB C to connect and that's it. Nice image quality. The speakers on my Surface sound better, but I didn't buy this for speakers. Well worth the price.",
