This doesn't mean you can hook your pc through VGA and use the HDMI port for say a firestick. Hdmi port will take priority and need to unplug to have the VGA pc. Display playing. There's also no speakers so if you don't have the pc set in place on your desk already you'll need a pair with this TV if you plan to hear any sounds. The display itself is very clear crisp with no glare issues. Pivoting up & down to find the best view is easy just be sure to hold your base and push center of the top frame or bottom depending on direction of travel. Sturdy feeling base and weight of screen seems to be quality manufactured.",

                "reviewText": "This 27\" monitor has everything I need for a daily use and all for the right price. The picture quality is good for 1080P and what really helps is the 165 Hz refresh rate. It has to be adjusted in the monitor settings in the computer though, not on the monitor's OSD. Colors are great and response time is good - no blurriness.",
