When I plugged it in I was shocked with the picture quality and the colors. For the price the quality and viewing angles were amazing. It was also very simple to set up and it was ready to go in less than 5 minutes It was also nice that it came with a display cable, and instructions. Highly recommend for smaller budgets and even if you have more to spend.",
