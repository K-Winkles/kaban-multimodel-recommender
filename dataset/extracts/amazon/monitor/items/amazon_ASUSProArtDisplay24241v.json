                "reviewText": "I bought a pair of these to replace my old set and chose them because of a good balance of cost, versatility in connectivity and promise of color uniformity. I mounted them on hydraulic adjustable arms, but that's where I encountered one of my two issues I had. The VESA indentation was about 1/16\" too small for the old mounting plates, so I had to get new arms. The stands were not of poor quality, in fact they were attractive and worked well, I just need the extra desk space.Connection options were varied and I had several options to connect my personal PC and work MacBook. I ended up using HDMIs with a special hub to extend both displays on the Mac and initially the daisy-chained DisplayPorts for my PC - the Thunderport option worked very well for the Mac (to only one display). After about a week the daisy-chaining DP port failed and that display was returned & replaced. While waiting for the replacement, I used separate direct cables for the DP-to-PC connection and have just kept that in place with the new display.The displays themselves are crisp and clean, very easy on the eyes at 75Hz refresh. Settings and adjustments are easily accessed with the front buttons and directional control nub/joystick.One annoying thing I don't know how to fix - I have backlighting LEDs on the backs of both displays which plug into the USB ports, and they don't turn off with the monitors on computer shutdown no matter how long I wait and hope. lol I have to turn both displays off manually. I'm pretty sure the USB power should be cut off when the monitors are asleep, but that doesn't happen. Any suggestions to remedy that would be lovely.All in all though, I'm quite happy with these.",

                "reviewText": "Color is excellent straight out of the box. The first I've had in a very long time that did not need brightness or contrast or anything really adjusted just for normal desktop computer use. I am not a photo editor but I appreciate being able to see a fairly accurate, sharp picture. It's easy on my eyes as they are much weaker now that I'm older and sometimes have trouble reading the print on web pages with the old monitors. But this one, I can read it all easily.I do not have any ghosting, my background is solid black so I'd notice. No dead pixels, and no problems with compatibility since I run windows 10 and not a mac or something. I just plugged it in and it worked. Uses a standard power cable and not one of those things with a power converter box in the line. So plug in that, the DIsplayPort (or HDMI, I tried out both), and it just works.I like the buttons on front unlike those that complained about them. My last 2 monitors had buttons on the back that were terrible to use.My only dislike is that it has an audio chip. The sound chips on monitors are always terrible. And naturally the OS detects and wants to use it. NO. So I go in and disable that.Gamers might want to give this monitor a pass since it's 60fps. They'll need at least a 144fps monitor. I no longer play games that make 144 or higher essential. I do play but I play MMOs that are fine with 60fps. And this one has such a better picture than my 144 fps! So it's in a corner and should I need it, I'll plug it up but until then, I'll enjoy being able to read the text easily.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Beautifully colorful",
                "reviewText": "Coming from an older, 4K Dell Ultrasharp with a slightly wider than sRGB color gamut this monitor is a real treat for photo editing. Overall the appearance is nice although I would have preferred the buttons be on the bottom or back of the monitor rather than on the front. I have it mounted on an Ergotron arm so I can\u2019t speak to the quality of the base. The matte finish on the screen is quite good with minimal impact to resolution and no sparkle, unlike my Dell monitor. The on-screen menus are well laid out and easy to use. The USB C connection with my M2 Max MacBook Pro works flawlessly with both video and charging.On to the monitor performance\u2026 In a completely dark room with a black screen there is only the slightest amount of light leakage left of center on the screen, something which isn\u2019t noticed in regular usage and I\u2019m sure varies by monitor. A completely gray screen has an ever so slight no uniform red/green color cast which is just barely visible if you\u2019re critically observing the monitor. Again, this is highly unlikely to be noticed in regular usage. There is no DSE observed, white uniformity looks great, as does all the color uniformities I\u2019ve observed. Luminance uniformity was under 8% across the screen with a slight hot-spot in the center and excellent uniformity along the edges. Color calibration with the ColorChecker Display Plus yielded great results, an average delta E of 0.4 with a max delta E of 1.6. When running the ColorChecker software I found that trying to balance the RGB intensity and contrast yielded bizarre results and both are better left at their default levels. I keep the monitor dim (60 nits) to best match my prints and I\u2019m sure this somewhat impedes the full color gamut potential of this monitor but it was still pretty close to the 99% AdobeRGB and 99% DCI-P3 advertised.Compared to other wide gamut 27\u201d monitors I\u2019d say this is quite a good value. You can very easily pay much more money for monitor with equivalent or worse specs. Now this might not meet the needs of a professional photographer or graphic artist but for any hobbyist or enthusiast looking for a wide gamut at a reasonable price, this monitor should work quite well.",

Based on the description of the PA248CRV, I was hopeful it would fill the 319's boots. Yes, the ProArt does have nice colours, but edges seemed overly sharp to me. In particular when scrolling a page with large display fonts, edges that appear smooth when standing still would become jagged and ghost in the direction of scrolling. I haven't seen this behaviour before. After scrolling, with the image still again, the edges would go back to normal. If I switched the display into the HDR mode the scrolling problem would go away, but in HDR mode pages with a lot of white would be uncomfortably bright on my eyes. If this display were smoother on the eyes I would have kept it as the extra resolution was very nice. Despite its extra size, I was happy to return to my trusted 319.",
