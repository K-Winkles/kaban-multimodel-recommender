It was really affordable, really great quality. This is like a no frills monitor situation, But they're bright. They run well, no issues. Um. What else can I say? It's a good buy.

As a MacBook user, I found myself in need of a larger screen for various tasks, and this monitor has proven to be a fantastic addition to my workspace.The 22-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 is crisp and vibrant, delivering clear and sharp visuals. Whether I'm working on documents, writing and emails, the monitor's 75Hz refresh rate provides smooth and enjoyable performance. The size of the screen is perfect for my needs, offering a noticeable upgrade in screen real estate without taking up too much space on my desk.Connecting the MacBook Air to the monitor was a breeze, thanks to the HDMI and VGA ports. It has simplified my multitasking, allowing me to have multiple windows open side by side without straining my eyes. The VESA mount compatibility is a bonus, giving me the flexibility to position the monitor at the perfect angle for my comfort.However, the only downside I encountered with this monitor was the absence of an integrated camera. I hadn't realized this when making my purchase, and I missed having a built-in camera for video calls. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something to keep in mind if video conferencing is a significant part of your workflow. A separate webcam or using the MacBook's camera is a solution, but it would have been more convenient if the monitor included one.The PHILIPS 22 inch Class Thin Full HD Monitor has been a game-changer for my MacBook Air setup. It's a cost-effective solution for anyone looking to expand their screen real estate and improve productivity. The crisp display, ease of connection, and VESA compatibility make it a solid choice. Just be aware that it doesn't come with a built-in camera, and you may need to consider additional options if video conferencing is essential for your work.",
