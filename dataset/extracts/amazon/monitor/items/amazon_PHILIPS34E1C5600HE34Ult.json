                "reviewText": "The PHILIPS 328E1CA 32\u201d Curved Monitor is a game-changer for anyone involved in video editing, remote work, and even light gaming. Having purchased one and been so impressed, I didn\u2019t hesitate to buy a second for a dual monitor setup.The standout feature for me is the 4K UHD resolution. It brings an incredible level of detail and clarity that is essential for my video editing tasks. The color accuracy, with 120% sRGB, is phenomenal, ensuring that what I see is what I get, which is crucial for professional editing.The curved design is a major plus. It offers an immersive experience that is particularly noticeable when gaming, and more importantly, it\u2019s comfortable for those long hours of work. The curvature of the screen makes the extended use much easier on the eyes, which is a relief during those long editing sessions.Adaptive-Sync technology is another feature that has improved my experience. It ensures smooth visuals, eliminating the annoying screen tearing and stuttering, which is great both while editing and gaming.While the monitor comes with built-in speakers, I find them to be a convenient addition for everyday use, though I primarily rely on external speakers for professional editing.One aspect I don\u2019t use is the VESA mount, as the stand provided suits my setup perfectly. However, it\u2019s good to know that the option is there for those who might need it.The inclusion of a 4-year advance replacement warranty was the cherry on top, giving me peace of mind about the longevity and quality of the monitor.In summary, the PHILIPS 328E1CA is an excellent investment for professionals who need a high-quality display for editing, gaming, and remote work. Its performance and features have been so satisfying that adding a second one felt like a natural step. Highly recommended for its superior display quality and ergonomic design.",

                "reviewText": "I was initially concerned about buying a Philips monitor because I assumed the quality would not be on par with other well-known brands. The reasonable price, 4 year warranty, and good reviews are what led me to settle on this monitor.PANELThe screen itself is bright. I tend to keep the brightness level around 85-90.1. Text looks clear both in the middle and the sides2. Contrast is good3. Images look great4. Colors are quite accurate - I have not made any changes to customize the colors of the panel. Out of the box the colors looked good to me. I am not planning on using this monitor for editing photos. I have another monitor that is more geared towards creative work.AESTHETICSThe whole monitor looks great. Even the back has sort of a brushed look. I love it!CURVEI really enjoy the curve. I have heard some people say that the curve takes time to get used to, but getting used to it seemed easy to me. I don't think I would want a monitor wider than this. The size is perfect.Thankfully the monitor I received was in perfect condition. No dead pixels. Philips dead pixel policy is not clear at all. I hope that this will never be an issue. The 4 year warranty seems pretty awesome. Seems like Philips will stand behind their product.GAMESI have not yet tested any serious games on this monitor, but I will soon and post an update here. I did play some Roblox and the game filled the whole screen. Any content that fills the whole screen is really awesome.USB-CMy work laptop is a Lenovo ThinkPad. The USB-C port on the laptop where I plug the power adapter did nothing when I connected the monitor using the supplied USB-C cable. This is probably a misunderstanding on my part. There is a secondary USB-C port on the laptop that has an energy bolt next to it. When I plugged the monitor into that USB-C port, the laptop displayed on the monitor in 1440p, and the laptop was receiving a charge from the monitor. Pretty amazing.STANDThe stand is very sturdy. The screen can tilt up & down, twist left and right, and can raise up & down. Very happy with this.SPEAKERSThe speakers are great if you consider they are built-in speakers, not dedicated reference monitors. It's a very welcomed addition, and they do the job.PURPOSEPeople may settle on this monitor for different reasons. For me the biggest reason was work. Having this monitor for work is a total dream. I am an IT engineer, so being able to have Visual Studio Code, PowerShell, Outlook, and the Azure portal all open at the same time (I have a 2nd monitor) really helps with productivity.A creative professional may want to avoid the curve and go for a panel with even higher color accuracy. A gamer might want more than 100hz to keep gameplay as smooth as possible.If you are looking for more screen real estate and you want to be more productive, then this monitor is for you.Side note: Amazon's characteristics for this item don't make any sense.

I got the KVM version and the docking station works well with an a 5 year old IBM thinkpad running linux. I wish the KVM switching was a little easier, bit it is a better alternative than having a KVM and all the wires all over the place. The internal speakers are OK for meetings and such, as is the camera. I use it primarily for coding and i is nice to have space for an IDE and a browser or email side by side. I haven't used it for gaming so I have no idea how well it would perform in that capacity; but for a home office it works really well and is a good value.",

                "reviewText": "I researched widescreen monitors for many hours and I settled on the Philips widescreen because of the price point, and the few reviews I found on it were good. I use this screen for film editing, photoshop, and work flow. The colour range is excellent and I find the 34\" wide screen perfect. This screen is replacing my 38\" widescreen dell, which I found too big. The 34\" is perfect for opening multiple windows and unlike my old 38\" monitor, I don't have to constantly keep turning my head to see the edges - 34\" is the sweet spot! I also love the rich blacks and the colour is amazing. I am not a gamer so I can't give this an honest review for gaming, but for work flow I would not look anywhere else. I am using it with my 15\" MacBook Pro and it plugs into the usb-c on my laptop and keeps the battery perfectly charged. I tried the built in speakers and like any built in speakers in a monitor, they lack bass. I use computer speakers with a subwoofer and I would never use built in speakers on any screen so in my opion the speakers should not impact your decision to buy this screen. Thank you Philips for saving me about 800.00 on something equivalent! Amazing screen 10/10.",

                "reviewText": "Been using this monitor for 2-3 weeks for work, )ie: not to play games or watch movies) and it's great. It's my first time attaching a monitor to my Asus ZenBook so I can't compare but I think it's brilliant. I should have bought an auxiliary monitor years ago. Really transforms the way I work.Note the \"curve\" is minimal (see photo) but it suits me fine (and I can't compare to a more curved monitor), but if you are looking for a monitor with a serious curve, this is one is not for you.7 PROs:* GREAT ON THE EYES: First time attaching a large monitor to my laptop and the detail is great. Makes working much easier and enjoyable. Should have bought an external monitor years ago!* LOVE THE AUDIO: The audio on my laptop plays up sometimes making it difficult to hear, but this monitor's speakers (located at the base) are great. Amplify the sound.* PLUG AND PLAY: The only \"setting up\" is attaching the stand to the monitor. Easy. Then the power cord and then, and THIS IS IMPORTANT, the HDMI cable.* TIP no.1 : Monitor comes with a standard HDMI cable BUT to connect my laptop to the monitor I needed a MICRO HDMI (male) to HDMI (female) cable. I only realised after the monitor was delivered, so I had to order one ($14AUD for a 3m cable). It meant that I had to wait 3-4 days to use it, so if you need one, order it at the same time.* FRONT BUTTONS (bottom right) are: On / off (I prefer to turn monitor off rather than leave it on standby mode) , volume, input (VGA, HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort) and Smart image (FPS, Racing, RTS, Gamer 1, Gamer 2, Low Blue Mode). ...err, don't know what all these \"smart image\" functions do. But audio jack is at back (see \"cons\"). Also no idea what the \"lock icon\" at the back is for...but I guess I should read the manual for that!* IT TILTS: No idea if all monitors do this, but I discovered it's quite important. When I first set it up, the light from my back window was reflecting off the monitor. A minimal tilt downwards resolved the problem. If it couldn't tilt down it would have been a real problem and I'd probably not be as happy.* THE STAND: I like that it is a rectangular frame rather than either two \"claws\" or a \"filled\" rectangle. It means you can utilise that space for other things... handy. I was worried that the \"ring\" around the screw that connects the stand to the monitor was lopsided (see photo) but has had no detrimental effect...well, so far anyway... but I don't move the monitor around.* TIP no.2: You'll need a phillips head screw driver (ha, of course!) to connect the stand to the monitor.2 CONs:* The audio jack is at the back. Why? I'd have it under the monitor for easy access.* Was worried when I saw the bottom of the box had traces of \"wet\" and there were finger prints on the monitor that were not mine (see photos). But there has been no issue.",
