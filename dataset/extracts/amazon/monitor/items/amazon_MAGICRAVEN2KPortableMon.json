                "reviewText": "I try to write as many reviews as I can when I have the time but I had to write one immediately after using this screen for the first time. The screen itself looks amazing and there isn't one dead pixel anywhere. The case around the screen appears to be high quality and not cheap plastic.It also comes with a cover that doubles as a stand.All in all, I give this screen a 5/5. The only downside is that this screen is better than my laptop's main screen which leaves me wishing I could swap it out and replace it with this 4k screen.For the price, I would highly recommend purchasing this screen. In fact, I'll probably pick up another for our server room. This screen also looks like it would pair really nicely with a Raspberry device.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Monitor is dead after just 11 weeks of use. My computer sees the monitor, but the display is completely dark. DO NOT BUY.It's a decent monitor when offered at a reduced price. At full price, there are better options.First thing you need to know is the ports (USB-C and HDMI) are on the RIGHT side of the monitor. The pictures show them on the left. I really wanted the ports on the left, which is one of the reasons I ordered this monitor. But no, they are on the right. I made it work, but because of this, I almost returned the monitor immediately.Second, the \"case\" that comes with it is not very good. I have a smaller monitor, and the magnet in its case is superb. It almost doesn't feel as if there is a magnet in the case for this monitor. For a monitor that is supposed to be \"portable\", the case could be, and should be, better.Third, many of these monitors have a mini-HDMI port. This one has a full-size port. That's fine, but it's something you need to know.The screen is bright, clear, and a matte finish to avoid glare. There is no lighting flare around the edges. The bezel is reasonable thin, except for the bottom, which is expected.I decided to keep this because I lucked out and got it at an amazing price...compared to its contemporary. If I'd paid full price for this, I would have sent it back because of the port positioning and poor quality case. For what I need, it's good enough.",

Returned it after this.UPDATE:After writing this review, the company who sells this item contacted me and asked if I would like a replacement unit free of charge to see if I just got unlucky with the first unit. I accepted, and over the last month or so I have been using the free unit as a travel monitor for work. I haven't had a single issue with it since I've received it. I will be updating my review to reflect this.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: Leaving the original review for transparency. A few days after posting it, the seller reached out to me offering a replacement or refund. I'm bumping the stars from 1 to 3, as quick support does help alleviate issues like this, but I'd still recommend a different monitor if you need something for travel. However, if you're looking for something you can take to a coffee shop or library or whatever to have a second screen when working away from your desk locally, this would probably survive fine (although I'd still recommend a case to be on the safe side).Original review:Got this for travel, as I imagine plenty of people do. Worked fine when I tested it at home. Put it in my hard-sided carryon between my laptop (a 15\" MacBook Pro, against the screen side of the case) and a bunch of clothes (against the back of the case). Always had the suitcase with me so I know it didn't suffer any mishandling or whatnot. Upon arriving at my destination, turned on the monitor and it had somehow shattered from being in-between a flat soft surface and a flat aluminum sheet.To be fair, the picture quality was good when I tested it prior to travel, but if you're buying a PORTABLE monitor, it's probably not going to always sit safely on a desk. On occasion, it may actually need to move. If you happen to be looking for a super-thin monitor for use in something like a wall-mounted display, then this is a perfectly reasonable choice. If you're looking for something to actually use as a portable monitor, don't buy this.Complete waste of $190.",
