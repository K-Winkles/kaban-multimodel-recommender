                "reviewText": "This is an extremely nice monitor for the price! I was wary given the usual \"too good to be true\" since many other portable monitors are considerably more expensive, but this monitor is wonderful so I'll start from the beginning:First, its packaged very nicely. It comes in a very sturdy box with plenty of protective foam, and a protective sleeve on the monitor. It comes with a basic magnetic stand that is a little flimsy, but there was also an enclosed card for one free upgrades accessory, of which a better stand it one of them. It comes with a type c to type c cord and a type c to hdmi cord. I am using this with a Google Pixelbook and it works great. Just make sure you have the plug inserted all the way (its a little tight so you gotta make sure you give it a little extra push) otherwise the screen will go in and out.Setup was super easy. Literally just plug the cord into the monitor and your laptop and you're golden.The monitor itself is nice resolution. Is it \"omg this is the best picture ever!\" good? No, but its still really good and actually better than the regular ASUS monitors I have set up at my desk for wfh.Overall, this portable monitor is a fantastic value and I'd highly recommend you purchase.",

                "reviewText": "For under $80, this monitor is quite well built and is highly versatile! Especially for someone whose been mandated to return to an in-office presence, the added option of being able to go anywhere with a second screen is handy. While it won't curb the soul-crushing commute, this monitor has replicated at least a little bit of the void of my home setup. All in all, pretty fantastic for the price.Pros:Packaged well and the screen is very quick to setup. It has a solid IPS panel with pretty good colors and I really like that it can be powered through USB-C. It comes with an HDMI to mini-HDMI adapter as well as a traditional charger (also USB-C) based so there's really no shortage of necessary cables.Cons:The little screen cover/makeshift stand can be a little wonky, so make you plop it down on a surface with some grip. Monitor brightness also seems to default to 20 every time I power it through my laptop's USB-C port, so it's a little cumbersome to have to manually crank it every time.",

We often visit my in-laws for extended periods of time and this monitor is extremely lightweight and portable. Very easy to use and is the same size as my work laptop. It comes with a magnetic protective cover that also serves as a little stand to prop it up. I have even used this when I want to work from a different area of my house--I have two monitors in my office but sometimes need a change of scenery. The quality of the monitor is perfect for what I use it for. As far as I can tell it is quite durable as well; when I travel it often gets shoved in my backpack with various other items and I haven't had any issues. Overall I would recommend for anyone who works remotely and travels.",

You do need to remember to turn up the brightness every time you connect it as it defaults back to 10 (I assume this is to reduce power use when the computer is running on battery) . Has been a life saver. Light weight while still a good screen size.",

Instructions were clear, and customer service is wonderful. They added my 2 year warranty right away just hours after I sent them the email, and also responded right away to further inquiries about the offered premium accessories ( which unfortunately they can't ship to Canada, but instead gave me gift cards for Amazon to purchase the accessory myself, which worked out great.)Highly recommend this portable monitor to anyone needing a second monitor to make their work life/ school life easier.",
