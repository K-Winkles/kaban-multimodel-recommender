I can say, it's no IPS monitor, and the bottom bezel is a piece of plastic that sticks out about 0.25\" ... which I find really weird because every other monitor I've used like this just had a thin piece of plastic down there. Weird.Still, the picture quality is great! The viewing angles are.. not the greatest. There's quite a bit of color shifting compared to the 34\" IPS I'm used to at home. The UI on the monitor works well. The stand is very nice, although I'm curious why it has such skinny feet!Overall, I felt very pleased with this for the price, and since Amazon delivered it the next morning - when I needed it ASAP that was a life saver.I have seen some cheaper monitors since with the same size/resolution, they don't look as nice and don't have an adjustable stand... so I don't feel like I missed out. Very happy with this one!",

See photo.)Not actually 32\u201d viewable (31.5\u201d, measured diagonally from corner to corner)Not 4K but for the price, what do you expect.See picture for clarification on viewable screen area.Conclusion:Despite the cons I would still highly recommend this display to anyone for personal, office, or medium graphics gaming. (for high-end gaming I would fork out the cash for higher resolution and refresh rate)",

                "reviewText": "Working as expected. Perfect for budget 4k monitor. I have very diverse needs (business, photo, light video, medium gaming) so really nice that this monitor can handle all these reasonably. Took a bit of getting used to control on the back, but I actually like the joystick style now that I'm used to it. Could be a hassle if you have another monitor to the right of it. No dead pixels, no visible bleed. Solid color controls and options. Haven't really tested out HDR yet, so no opinions there yet.TLDR - exceeded my expectations for a budget 4k monitor.",
