                "reviewText": "Went from ASUS VG248QE 24\" 1080p to this ASUS VG27AQ3A 27\" 1440p. It was completely worth it and I am very happy. Great depth of color, very clear display, and doesn't feel \"cheap\". it's not too heavy and feels really sturdy, not made with cheap flimsy plastic. 1080p media(videos, games, pictures) looks perfectly fine, not blurry in the slightest or have any issues with pixels. Very easy to see the difference in image quality of 1440p compared to 1080p. Physical buttons are very easy to manipulate to change settings and no confusion as to what you are pressing. I don't bother using the HDR, it's more of a gimmick than a feature and doesn't look good in my opinion. Upgrade from 7yo 1080p to this 1440p is worth it. I run a 3 monitor setup and plan to swap out my other 2 for a couple more. So far I am completely satisfied! Do not recommend using with ASUS software(DisplayWidgetCenter), currently its more of a hassle and not worth the time. Also, I have it mounted on a 3 arm VESA 100x100 desk stand using M4 x 8mm screws, It went on easy with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Set it up using DP to my gaming PC, and HDMI to my work PC. The monitor bezel is thin, and fit well next to my alienware aw2710hf 240hz monitor. This monitor is bright, I had to turn it down to 60-70% for daily use. Although I wish there were a mode that had more access to all settings, I was still able to get the color settings to match my other monitor.The stand is wide, but only half as deep as my other monitor which is a good thing, I still might put this on a monitor arm long term.The IPS glow was normal, it was not more than I expected, it does not bother me. It is much better than my old dell u2715h ips monitor. In the dark with a black background you can see the back light bleed/ips glow but I didn't notice it under normal use especially in normal lighting situations. See image, left is aw2720hf, right vg27aql1a. You might see it watching a movie that has black bars on the top and bottom, not a deal killer for me.For work, it was great for excel and real time data. Good resolution and clear text.I would say the monitor is on par with reviews I've seen for the gigabyte aorus fi27q and pixio px7.Presets for websurfing is fine, racing and srgb are best. I had to tweak some settings to fix colors for photo work in photoshop all presets were a little warm and bright but were fixable and not entirely out of the ordinary. Also had to tweak the settings for movies to a modified version of the scenery or cinema preset. Will probably setup with a spyder for a better match.Motion is good, this monitor is fast. Played COD, fortnite, star wars, DBZ without any issues. No obvious ghosting or other issues. GSYNC worked well. I'll probably stick with my 240hz for fornite but will switch to this monitor for everything else that benefits more from higher resolutions.PC specs:Intel i7 8700k @ 5ghz32gb 3200Mhz ramASUS ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 TIUpdate: For gaming I had some brightness dimming/flickering at 170hz, changing it to 165hz fixed it. I also found a stuck pixel at the top of the screen, amazon replaced it quickly. The new monitor has no defects, no hot/dead pixels and I don't have flickering issues with 170hz anymore. Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Pro+Excellent picture once set up. I used my Spyder 5 pro with display cal.+IPS Panel @ 1080p with 144hz.+Contrast looks better than my Acer XB271huCons-1080 @ 27 inch is noticeable compared to 1440p @ 27 inches. But I play a lot of fast paced shooters so it helps having lower resolution. BF5 and Black Ops 4 for example still look very good though.-Horizontal lines with and without freesync on. Doesn't happen often while in game though.(Driver issue? I don't know have to wait and see.)-I was also experiencing system lock ups since using this monitor and latest nvidia drivers(Again driver issues?)-Also ELMB mode(similar to Nvidia's ULMB mode) is horrible. Too much ghosting. Almost looks like a double image and blurry. This is probably the biggest issue with this monitor because I was hoping to use this feature. It's also nice and bright with ELMB mode @ 120hz. But again ghosting is a big issue. Can this be fixed by Asus? Don't know but it definitely needs work for future monitors. Hopefully this could be addressed with firmware update without having to send back the monitor.Also seeing as how this is an IPS panel I was suprised to not have any Black light bleed or ips glow except for bottom right corner (luckily I use 20 brightness level which gets rid of it mostly) but honestly my Acer XB271hu has it worse than this monitor and the contrast level looks way better than the Acer.If you can avoid using ELMB mode or don't need it and also have patience with Nvidia drivers I would recommend this monitor. I would have loved to give this monitor 5 stars but the ELMB ghosting has to be addressed. I don't know if it's just this monitor but compared to Nvidia's ULMB mode it's terrible.UPDATEDecided to come back to this review and give 5 stars after giving this monitor another try.I sent back my first one because of the horizontal line issues and poor ELMB mode.My new monitor does not have these same issues so I guess the first one was just bad. This monitor is currently the best monitor to get @ 1080p if you're looking for 144hz and excellent colors. It actually beats my XB271HU after calibration with Displaycal software. The image looks better on this replacement monitor as well like more clearer.But one issue is IPS glow or Black light bleed in the lower right corner. I don't notice it much and is not that bad but it is there.I don't see any other monitor topping this one for a while @ 1080p if you're looking for good colors and high 144hz.Eventually they are coming out with 240hz IPS 1080p panels sometime this year but this monitor is the best 1080p monitor I've seen.",

                "reviewText": "Not a bad monitor and certainly has led to a sharper PC gaming experience. 2 frustrations: (1) the monitor stand is functional and although it has good tilt / pivot functionality the ability to change the screen height is limited; (2) lack of operating instructions within the box to understand how to change display settings.My first impression of the monitor wasn't the best. The default display settings look dreadful (in my opinion) and the monitor buttons have limited functionality and ability to change these. Without operating instructions I ended up searching online for a manual (which I found) but this still didn't help change the display settings. By chance I found an ASUS widget which I downloaded and this did the trick - enabling me to access the display settings and customise. My frustration is why didn't ASUS include some kind of link to this really important information in the box? It could have saved me a couple of really frustrating hours and certainly hasn't endeared me to the brand.",
