                "reviewText": "For a monitor of that price, it is really good. Great colors, sharpness. I really got it (and love it) for it's portrait mode (pivot) function, which it does really well. The stand has a nice flat base, a hole to thread the cables in, and lets you arrange the monitor with a good range of height, rotation, and pivot, and does so easily. Buttons are on the front so it's easy to use the on-screen menu.The ports in the back are pretty good: DVI, VGA, DisplayPort, 4 USBs. The biggest downside of the monitor I would say is the lack of HDMI. The 4 USB ports were a happy surprise to me. The cable provided means your monitor is also a USB hub, which is convenient, tho the ports aren't super accessible (except 1) since they're under the cover. The cover could be a bit better since it's not attached to the monitor itself, and detaches completely when you want to access the ports. If you're willing to accept a bit of tape on the back of the monitor, you could tape the cover so it doesn't fall down every time.Overall a great monitor for its price, and I'm very happy with it.",

And the price for refurbished is a great deal. It only came with a VGA cable and the power cable but I had to buy a thunderbolt to display port anyways for my Mac mini so that didn\u2019t bother me.No dead pixels, and the monitor is in great shape. The stand has a few very minor scratches that don't bother me. The cover for the inputs on the back of the monitor was missing but I have mine against a wall so it doesn't matter for me. Outstanding value for over half off the price of a new one!The picture is the monitor next to an iPad Air first generation 9.7 inch.",

The display is protected with tight fitting air packaging.Along with the monitor, it includes the previously mentioned stand preinstalled, a power cable, and VGA cable. Quite disappointing that it doesn't include any digital display cable like DVI and DisplayPort. It is also missing the rear I/O cover but I have my monitor setup against the wall anyway.Overall I'm still happy with my purchase. Just remember to buy the digital display cable you need.",

It has the \"ghosting effect\" or smeared/blurry look for text and pictures that can be bad on the eyes when reading. I attempted adjusting display settings and checking the graphics drive properties. This monitor does have multiple ports (display, USB, etc.) that allow for multiple device use. It also has great, flexibility with tilt ability. But the screen quality for picture and text overshadows the other features. The bells and whistles are nice, but I really need the monitor to display legible picture quality over anything else. The picture quality is subpar at best.",
