With that said, you won\u2019t get the most out of these speakers unless you understand that the speaker volume in the monitor settings (accessible ONLY via the buttons on the back right bottom corner) adjusts INDEPENDENTLY of your computer volume settings. Turn the volume all the way up in the volume settings for the monitor AND the computer AND the app or website generating the sound. Then you\u2019ll have volume you can at least hear, even if it\u2019s not satisfying volume and sound quality. Personally, I plug headphones into the mini stereo jack and use those (for which you STILL need the volume all the way up in the monitor volume settings).",

It is flimsy and top-heavy, toppling off the desk a few times in the two months I've had it. The picture quality is trash. The UX is puzzling. And it doesn't work. The first time it stopped working for a shift, my cat walked by it. Today, it just won't switch on after sitting by itself in a shut office for the weekend. Anything that touches the extremely inconveniently placed cables cuts the picture out for a few minutes -- if you can get a picture at all. Save your money. Buy elsewhere. UGH.",
