                "reviewText": "Out of the box the fit and finish and magnetic flap/stand all feel very high quality.Without reading the manual (which wouldn't have helped anyway), I figured out how to plug it in and get it up and running in Windows 11. Pretty intuitive and well integrated process.My 13 inch HP spectre has 2 USB-c ports. This monitor also has 2 USB-c ports. A single cable between them will work with any pair of ports. however in that case the brightness is limited at 50% due to power limitation. By connecting the laptop charger to the Koorui monitor, and with a single USB-c cable leading back to the laptop, there's no longer any power limitation and I can get 100% brightness and 100% volume. The pleasant surprise for me was the single display cable, also *back charges* the laptop, although at a low wattage. I can leave the laptop in high performance mode, and the battery drains only very very slowly and can last at least 2 days.I bought two of these Koorui's, the second one used HDMI to mini HDMI with Windows 10, on an eight year old laptop. That also worked flawlessly. However, a second USB-c power source was needed to turn on the monitor at all (which it would do at full power), because HDMI doesn't deliver power.These Koorui monitor feel more comfortable to read than either of my laptops (one of which is a high end 4k screen). It has a matte finish and nice looking black to white transitions, making photos look very natural. I really like the colors and reading experience.The only downside I found was the manual. It repeats hazard warning in six languages, but doesn't tell you you need to hold down the power button for a few seconds to turn it on, because the power button doubles as menu and select button. The entire monitor settings UI is handled with only 3 buttons. It work well once you figure it out, but the \"manual\" doesn't have a single mention of any of this. Nor does it discuss compatibility and power requirements. Why try so hard at making a great product, but remain at such an amateur level writing the manual? That's the thing that bugged me.For gaming you only get 60hz refresh, so I haven't tried it for gaming and don't plan to use it that way. For remote learning and remote meetings, a highly portable second screen is a really nice thing to have. Overall for the extremely friendly price, I really appreciate being able to purchase this product.",

The visuals are sharp and vibrant, making it a joy to watch movies or play games.Sleek and Modern Design:The monitor has a sleek and modern design that adds a touch of sophistication to my desk setup. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, which is a pleasant surprise given its affordable price.Smooth Performance:I've been using this monitor for a while now, and it has performed remarkably well.

I bought a refurb laptop and a refurb one of these and I am good to go! The case that protects is and stands it up is just like the one for my iPad- it is ideal. Its so convenient to whip out along side my laptop, I hook up the power cord and one cable- easy. It's quite light on it's own. I can actually carry both in my laptop and this in my work bag- yes work bag gets heavy, but not a problem for short walks.I use it for a lot of data work, and it has worked perfectly. Great value for me.",

Had to watch YouTube to see how to work.(YouTube channel from a different brand) this one does not have any YouTube channel. So you have to guess how to use. Does not come with the cord to need to hook up your phone. Doesn't even tell you what kind of cord to buy. Does not have battery so you have to be around a plug to even use. Bad product! I wouldn't recommend this product!",
