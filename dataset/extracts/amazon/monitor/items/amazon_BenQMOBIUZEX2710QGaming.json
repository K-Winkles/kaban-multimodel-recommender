                "reviewText": "Upgraded from a Samsung G5 144hz curved monitor, and just wow. This is the best monitor I've ever owned hands down, and I've only had it a day. Been playing all day and night, this has rejuvenated my gaming soul. The image, colors, darks/black, lights/whites.. everything pops! The high refresh rate combined with 1440 just makes everything so buttery smooth and cripy. Even the text is easier to read. Menu is very easy to navigate so you can set that part up pretty quick. MAKE SURE you update the monitors driver from the benQ site so you get full functionality. Will easily own this monitor for the next 4-5 years, well worth the value. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

                "reviewText": "Picked this up on a deal here because it checked most of my check list (Not much)- Did at least 120hz- 1080p+- BUILT-IN SPEAKERS.I love this screen, I was always told BenQ were supposed to be good products, and if this is where my expectations are set, I can only imagine how good of an experience a screen that's 2x the price is from them (Consoomer mindset)Picture quality is crisp and sharp @ 1440p. If you prefer or need to step down to 1080p, it does appear to not be very optimized for it, which I guess makes sense.Blacks look pretty good in most instances, when watching a Discord stream of a friend playing a dark scene in a game, the display seemed to struggle. But I don't fully consider that a fair test, First hand it will likely be dark enough and not too washed out.The screen wakes up fairly fast I'd say. My old monitor was an Asus VN247 which probably took 2-5 seconds longer to wake up than this (If you care about that)If you've looked up reviews for this on YouTube, I found a lot of them say \"iTs NoT bRiGhT eNoUgH\", yeah maybe if you're playing directly under the sun or something. It's plenty bright to me, I turned it down to 70%The HDRi button may be of use to some people, but I don't really feel much of a need to use it personally. Most cases it will make it very dark and hard to see, but in well lit environments, it can flex it's muscles a little bit if you're into it.The speakers are a godsend, my old screen had speakers as well, but were rear facing and hollow sounding. I got by like that for ~10 years. These are so much better. So much.. The 2 front facing speakers have good range and sound production for my environment and the subwoofer on the back adds a lot of depth to the sound. I use the \"Pop/Live\" setting and find it covers every listening situation for me.For what I paid here for it, I have no regrets. Im hoping this will cover me as long as my ol' Asus did.",

                "reviewText": "I play a great deal of FPS games, the twitchier the better a lot of them. The first monitor I purchased firsthand for myself, maybe 9 or so years ago now, was SCEPTRE branded. I had no idea who they were, but the monitor I got was great. After this I followed it up with an AOC monitor, which was simply put in two words; godawful terrible. It had issues, it was finicky, and it eventually died on me mid game. Next I eventually owned an Alienware monitor. This was good, until I found out that there were Dell branded monitors of the EXACT SAME QUALITY, but several hundred dollars cheaper. I tried Samsung, and Samsung has the absolute worst QA for their products I've ever experienced. Everything from an HDMI connection to just VESA mounting the things results in at least one breakage.Eventually I decided to cave. I got a BenQ monitor. And, wow, this thing is just simply better. The image quality, the lack of ghosting or smearing, the color accuracy, the adjustability. The thing even comes with a remote so you don't have to fidget with a physical interface, it's that honed in on what it offers. That said, the price tag speaks for itself. If you were going to spend this much money on a monitor, to be totally honest with you, you can do better. You can find something with better specs, you can find something bigger, something better looking. While this is a very premium monitor, this is a field of technology that has been rapidly changing for the last 25 years and will continue to do so.IF YOU WANT THIS, spend the money, but do so knowing that in 2-3 years you can spend the exact same amount of money again on something that's probably twice as good. This is the knowledge I had on my purchase, and I have been extremely satisfied. The only possible change I would make to it is a greater axis for rotating the monitor itself on a stand, but if I want that so badly I can always get a third party mount for it too.",

                "reviewText": "LONG REVIEW INCOMING:So far I have tried so many monitors to try and beat my LG 27gn750-b which it was almost perfect for my ps5 till I wanted to try to look for other monitors because the colors felt a little washed out and the blacks were ok but not terrible, as far as motion clarity it was perfect at \u2018FAST\u2019 mode. As far as resolution I stopped caring after trying so many 1440p monitors and none of them really stuck out to me because of \u201cmotion-clarity\u201d issues. Most of the monitors I have tried which are KTC H27T22, Sceptre (VA PANEL), ASUS TUF GAMING 1440p, and LG 27gp850 ( Favorite 1440p Ips I have tried btw) but each felt too slow for some reason, like it had a slower response time and high input lag. So I went back to looking for 1080p monitors that fit my budget.Till I Came across the BENQ MORBIUZ EX2510S!!Read/Watched reviews how this monitor was so dim and I would sayy.. that is false.. it is bright enough to wear my eyes don\u2019t bleed.Anyway response times are AMAZING! Both AMA 2 and 3 are amazing for 120hz gaming as well and I can only imagine PC 165hz!! Such low Input lag feels incredible. For a 1080p the picture quality felt better than almost all the 1440p monitors I have tried which is insane. The options this monitor such as Black equalizer and light tuners help so match to make my games look so good. 5/5 best monitor I have tried and that is coming for a competitive gamer.If ya\u2019ll don\u2019t want to spend so much for a premium monitor this is the one to get!! And I only got it for $230!!!",
