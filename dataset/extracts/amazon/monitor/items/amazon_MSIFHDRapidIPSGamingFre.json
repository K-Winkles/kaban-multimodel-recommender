                "reviewText": "First at all I already knew the description here on Amazon was incorrect but I checked the model (MSI G244F) on MSI's website and here are the details for the people who wants to buy this monitor:- Rapid IPS \u2013 Provides 1ms GTG fast response time, optimizes screen colors and brightness.- 170Hz Refresh Rate \u2013 Respond faster with smoother frames.- 1ms GTG Response Time \u2013 Eliminate screen tearing and choppy frame rates.- Wide Color Gamut \u2013 Game colors and details will look more realistic and refined.- AMD FreeSync Premium\u2122 Technology \u2013 Prevent screen tearing or stuttering, producing ultra-smooth lag-free gameplay.- Night Vision \u2013 Smart black tuner to brighten your day by bringing out the fine details in dark areas.- Frameless design \u2013 Enjoy the ultimate gaming experience with super narrow bezels.- Anti-Flicker and Less Blue Light \u2013 Game even longer and prevent eye strain and fatigue.- 178\u00b0 Wide Viewing Angle \u2013 Colors and details will stay sharp at more angles with a 178\u00b0 wide viewing angle.Great quality of bulding and image, it has vibrants colors, is Adobe RGB 94.4%% / DCI-P3 92.05% / sRGB122.88% that was what I was looking for because I work as an artist and needed good color gamut.It's 165hz out of the box, you need to enable an option to reach 170hz, not a problem. I had no issues with dead pixels so far. (I'll edit if I have any problems)This monitor is not G-sync, only AMD Freesync Premium.OSD panel is easy to use and navigate with the joystick and has multiple functions and color modes.If you want to use it with a monitor arm, it came with 4 standoff screws so you can attach to any 75x75 mm arm.Displayport cable included.Definitely I recomend this monitor.",

Colors are vivid and the screen is bright. OSD panel is also minimalist and easy to navigate, this monitor even includes crosshair overlays built in so you don't even need to use software! I definitely recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a great budget gaming monitor for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I grabbed these monitors on Black Friday, and wow, these are amazing monitors! The IPS panels displays the colors way better than my old VA panel. This high refresh rate and multiple display connectors is a plus. The only downside is that the monitors are advertised as 180, but only go to 165 or 170 with a setting enabled on the monitor. I also could not find a option to enable the HDR on the monitor, but there is a HDR \"look and feel\" mode but it isn't true HDR. I also have a issue where the monitor will \" turn on the backlight and not display anything with the computer off, but I'm not sure if that is an issue with the monitor or my GPU.Overall, the monitor is an excellent pick for anyone upgrading from 60 to a higher refresh rate monitor! Just remember to enable DP overclocking in the monitor settings.",
