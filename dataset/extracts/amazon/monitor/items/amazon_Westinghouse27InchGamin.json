                "reviewText": "I had a pretty specific featureset in mind (30-32\", 2-4k, VA, non-curved, non-ultra-wide, high refresh rate, understated looks, FreeSync, brand that I know and trust) and this was one of a handful that fit the bill. Sale price was appealing, so I went with it.I'm pleased with it so far. There aren't a ton of settings, but the presets are pleasant out of the box, not much I'd change.If you know VA vs IPS, it's expected that viewing angles aren't quite as good as IPS, but still reasonable. Colors are rich for the price class, seem reasonably neutral. Contrast is improved over IPS. Don't expect OLED black levels, but they're quite decent on this. A subtle backlight sheam/haze is visible in darker scenes especially off-axis, but not as distracting as most IPS panels.Stand is great. Nice quality and excellent adjustability. Looks nice, too. There are reasonably tasteful \"RGB\" lights on the back panel, but I haven't yet figured out if you can disable them or change the color (default to blue). Either way, not terribly distracting or overly tacky.All in all, I really like it. Good image for the price, good build quality, understated looks (totally suitable for an office environment), affordable. Unless you're looking for pristine image accuracy/adjustability (for which you'll have to spend significantly more), this is a great option.",

                "reviewText": "I was in the market for a white 1440p monitor that had a good refresh rate for a good price and this one delivered. I wouldn\u2019t buy this at its full price because you can definitely find comparable models from other brands for less money. But at 250 it was a steal and I had to jump on it.Picture looks great and color is very accurate. White color goes well with the recent trend of white PC builds. The stand that is included with the monitor is really wide so it\u2019d probably be best to make sure you have the space for it. My desk has a dedicated \u201cledge\u201d where you\u2019re supposed to put monitors but the stand was too wide to fit so I had to buy a dual monitor VESA mount for it and my older 1080p monitor.Took off one star due to the RGB strip on the back not working at all. Tried contacting Westinghouse support but they ultimately gave me the runaround and were less than helpful. The RGB strip not working isn\u2019t really a dealbreaker for me but it\u2019s annoying and frustrating that I can\u2019t get a reply back from someone who knows what they\u2019re talking about.Summary: Buy it if you can get it on sale like I did. At over 400 dollars for the regular price it\u2019s simply not worth it.Update: I bought another monitor so that I would have dual matching 1440p screens. After installing the second monitor I was able to get the RGB on both monitors to function as intended.I am keeping the review at 4 stars because the customer support is basically nonexistent as other reviews have stated. The monitors themselves work great though and I\u2019m very happy with the picture quality and performance. At their new price of 200 bucks it\u2019s well worth it for how little you pay.",

If it is I don't know, but everything about it feels high quality. Things that called my attention right away where:+ The box was huge and the monitor came well packed and protected.+ The monitor's base is heavy and sturdy.+ It's very easy to adjust height, tilt and swivel.+ The included Display Port cable is thick and well insulated (with added ferrite ring cores).+ Beautiful matte VA display with no dead pixels and no light bleed on the corners and edges of the screen.+ Installation was very easy (you must supply your own Philips screwdriver).After a few minutes playing with the color settings, I was watching YouTube 4K demo videos and streaming movies on Netflix. My laptop can only do up to 120Hz and the frame rate increase was immediately apparent as soon as I enabled the feature.If the monitor didn't have the \"Westinghouse\" logo I would have thought it was an LG. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this monitor.",

                "reviewText": "If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Nowhere in the product details are there any description on whether this monitor has an HDMI 2.0 or 1.0 connection. I combed over the manual and searched every place this information might be shared. I even called Westinghouse\u2019s customer support to ask, and when I did, they asked for the model number, which I gave them. It\u2019s right there on the box in big letters. I circled it in red in this photo. The customer support rep then kept telling me the model number didn\u2019t exist, insisting I wasn\u2019t giving her the right model number, which is why she can\u2019t answer my question. I even offered to send her a photo to confirm I was reading the correct number. Then, she said she would email me so I can send her the photo but never did. However, what scares me the most is if I had any warranty issues, they\u2019d most likely try not to honor it claiming my monitor model doesn\u2019t exist. I will never buy a product from Westinghouse again and will definitely buy a higher end brand that makes all its specs clear from the beginning. Higher end brands will at least keep track of what models they actually sell and exist.",
