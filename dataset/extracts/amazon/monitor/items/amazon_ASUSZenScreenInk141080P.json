                "reviewText": "I've come across a wide range of reviews regarding this product on Amazon - some on the harsher side, to say the least. However, I beg to differ and find myself truly enamored by the capabilities of the ASUS ZenScreen Ink 14\u201d 1080P Portable Touchscreen Monitor.This monitor sports a compact, sleek design that beautifully complements my ASUS ROG gaming laptop. Its glossy facade and smart features effortlessly elevate my workspace aesthetics and functionality. I sought a touchscreen feature, which my laptop lacks, and this product didn't disappoint. It's remarkably bright and responsive, delivering a smooth, intuitive user experience that I am enjoying.The inclusion of a pen with the monitor was a pleasant surprise and what's even more impressive, it worked straight out of the box! No cumbersome setups or frustrating tech hitches. This simplicity has indeed made my user experience more pleasant and exceeded my expectations.I must admit, I would have appreciated it if the price tag were a little friendlier. I probably should have waited until Prime Day, anticipating a potential price drop, but I needed a quick solution before delving into my studies. Despite the price, I do not harbor any regrets. The value that this monitor provides far outweighs the cost, and in retrospect, I wouldn't hesitate to make the same purchase.Overall, I can confidently affirm that the ASUS ZenScreen Ink 14\u201d 1080P Portable Touchscreen Monitor is a worthwhile investment, promising quality, and convenience.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I really like this thing",
                "reviewText": "Important distinction: this is for the USB-C ZenScreen. These three models should really be separate listings.With that out of the way, I picked this up to have a secondary screen while traveling for work and I've been really pleased with it so far. Worked instantly with both a 15\" MBP and two thunderbolt-3 equipped Windows machines. Just make sure your ports are compatible (look for the DisplayPort or Thunderbolt logo if you're unsure).The biggest benefit of this over the USB 3.0 (type-B) models is that this monitor will get driven by your machine's GPU, so it's perfect for playing games in a hotel or similar situations.Short conclusion: if you have a need for something like this, and your computer is compatible, definitely pick one up. If you want the longer breakdown, keep reading.Screen:I don't have any color accuracy or coverage information, but next to several other IPS monitors it looks above average. At 1080p on a 15.6\" screen it's not going to keep up with a high-end laptop these days, but games, pictures, movies, and text all look as good as you can ask for given the specs. It gets decently bright, but the surface is a bit more reflective than I'd have preferred.The different display modes are present, but the menus are clunky enough that once you find your preferred one, you'll generally want to stick with it.Design:The top and side bezels are small and not distracting. The bottom chin is a bit more visible, but since it houses the buttons and power connector, this is understandable. As a side effect, it also makes it so that the bottom of the actual screen is almost perfectly at the same height as a MacBook Pro, so that's arguably a plus.Weight is as good as you can expect given the screen size. If you're trying to minimize weight, you probably shouldn't be packing an extra monitor in the first place. But if you're already packing a 15\" laptop, the extra weight won't be a deal-breaker.In hand it feels really solid. If Asus made a 15\" tablet like this, it would get full marks from me on construction.The Stand:The smart cover is pretty good. Protects the screen and back from scratches in transport. When set up horizontally it has two different angles it can sit at, once you figure out how to fold the magnetized sections into place (the Amazon product image was helpful there). The pen and hole on the other hand, is pretty silly. There's no locking whatsoever, and it just takes one bump to topple it. But hey, free pen!Also a word of caution about USB-A mode: Rather than providing two separate cables, Asus instead includes an adapter with male USB-A on one end and a type-C port on the other. While this is probably fine for this specific device, do not use this adapter with other type-C devices or accessories. You could easily fry your laptop or phone. Better to just get a type-A to type C USB 3.0 cable, there's plenty of good and cheap ones available.",

                "reviewText": "These screen are great for expanding productivity. After years of coding on one screen, I bought first one and then a second one of these ZenScreens (MB16AC USB-C model). There are almost the same dimensions as the display on my MacBook Pro 15\" for a pleasing three-screen layout. Now I can have my notes, research, and issue lists on the left, coding on center, and website rendering on the right.They are durable metal construction, very lightweight (less than my iPad), and very portable. Because they get power and video from the same cable it's easy to set up at a cafe or cowork location. I did not need any special drivers. The color and brightness are good \u2014 not quite Mac good, but good. Brightness must be controlled manually from the OSC.I have only minor complaints. The cover/stand that ships with it is ineffective as a stand and kinda heavy for a cover. There's only one USB-C port on the device so cable routing is a bit ugly \u2014 I wish it has a rear or right-side port as well. I could flip one 180\u00b0 to have a right-side port but then the bezel will be at the top. I have a little light leakage at the bottom of one screen.If you don't want to use the included 6' cable and want to use a shorter cable it can be hard to find one that works. Most cheap cables will NOT work. It must be a USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 cable with PD and Alt Mode/DP (DisplayPort) support. It's sometimes easier to search for a USB-C Thunderbolt cable which is basically the same thing.I made my own stands from cardboard shipping spacers. I might make better ones out of plastic drain tube, bamboo, or wood.",

He le\u00eddo otras rese\u00f1as que mencionan que el producto deja de funcionar despu\u00e9s de varios meses, solo lo sabremos con el tiempo.Por el momento puedo decir que su exterior es de calidad, buen material. La publicaci\u00f3n menciona que cuenta con funda, en realidad es un protector de pantalla que funciona tambi\u00e9n como base de pantalla una vez plagado. Una de las razones por las que eleg\u00ed este producto es que solo utilizas un cable y no 2 como en otros equipos (uno para conexi\u00f3n y otro para alimentaci\u00f3n) en este caso solo cargo el cable de conexi\u00f3n lo cual es muy pr\u00e1ctico.En cuanto a la resoluci\u00f3n y brillo, no est\u00e1 mal pero tampoco es la mejor. En mi caso lo uso como monitor externo de una surface pro 9 para apoyarme en hojas de c\u00e1lculo o ventanas de internet. Funciona muy bien al reproducir videos, pero, si lo que buscas es usarlo para video juegos creo que hay mejores opciones.En general es muy buen equipo, pero sobre todo muy pr\u00e1ctico.

                "reviewText": "The design and touch/feel is great! I like the included kick-stand which works great both Landscape & Portrait mode. Overall, it's super as a portable monitor. Now onto something TRICKY that it took me some time to figure out. The USB-A mode DOES NOT WORK by default! For those who want to use this with a legacy USB-A laptop/PC, you may have a problem due to insufficient power output of the USB-A port. This will cause the monitor to keep rebooting despite having the driver installed.What you can try if USB-A port doesn't work (SHORT form):Method 1: Use a shorter / higher quality USB-C to A cableMethod 2: Try to use a device with USB-C to connect first, then turned down the brightness (try 50), then go back and try with your USB-A deviceLonger story:I bought 2 of the same products and eventually figured out how to get it work, and i'll explain it here:- Device I'm trying to work with: MS Surface Pro 6 (Only has a USB-A port)- The default USB-C to USB-A cable does not work by default. I bought 2 of the same monitors, behavior the same.- I happened to have my own USB-C to USB-A cable which is higher quality and shorter, and it works. So I figured it's a power-related issue, as USB-A port's power output is limited.- After successfully having the monitor work with a shorter cable, I change the brightness from the default 100 to 50. After that, I changed to the factory USB-C to USB-A cable, and now it works. So I figured the factory USB-C to A cable has less power delivery ability and didn't handle it. I haven't really tried between brightness 50-100, what brightness will be too much for it to work. But with brightness 50, it's already pretty bright for my use-case.I rarely write reviews, but I thought the above info would be useful for people who needs to use it with USB-A port. I also suggest ASUS to perhaps set the default brightness to a lower value and also include a better quality cable.",
