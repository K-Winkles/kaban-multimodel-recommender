                "reviewText": "I bought the cheaper version because it's the same monitor with a cheap stand; since I was mounting it on a flex arm the stand was not important. This is a very nice monitor for the money. It is a VA rather than IPS, so the colors are more vibrant, and the reduced viewing angle of VA monitors is not really noticeable unless you're going to use it as an off-center secondary monitor.PRO's- Very reasonably priced- A LOT of screen real estate, you can fit about 50 icons on your task bar.- High refresh rate, very smooth scrolling.- At a little over 12 lbs. it's light enough to work well with flex arms and the VESA mount was easy to attach by myself.- I find the joystick settings control easier to use than the usual pushbutton array.CON's- It does cut off the active application indicator bar on the task bar at the bottom of the screen; as you can see, my solution was to simply place the task bar on top. It took some getting used to, but it works.- If you're using it with 1080p monitors the Windows text is a little small. Still readable just smaller than the other monitors. If it's your only monitor you can always change the Windows settings- No G-Sync support, but I don't do a lot of gaming and the Nvidia studio drivers work great.- You might need a bigger mouse pad, it's long way from edge to edge :)BOTTOM LINEIf you've always wanted a widescreen but didn't want to spend over $500 this is the way to go. It's cheaper than the cost of two comparable 1080p monitors, has more screen space and with the curvature is an immersive pleasure to look at.",

I think this monitor is great quality (remember to turn on HDR) and I've been to MC to compare quality vs price and nothing touches this when it comes to price. I might upgrade one day, but it's already paid for itself in value.ONLY COMPLAINT: The stand it comes with sucks. It's not height adjustable, you can only adjust the tilt. The worst part is that the stand is too deep to fit on most monitor stands. I had to buy a monitor stand with desk mount to be able to have the monitor as close to the wall as possible, and at eyelevel.Other than that, I would recommend to anyone on a budget.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor replaces an Acer monitor with the same specifications except that the Acer monitor was an IPS panel. When I was looking for a replacement for the Acer monitor that my cat destroyed, I thought I would try a VA panel. When I first connected this monitor, the image was pretty dull. I really wasn\u2019t that happy but it was livable. One day shortly after getting this, I actually read the directions and it talked about going into settings in Windows 10 and turning on HDR mode. When I did that, this monitor came alive. The colors were better than the Acer monitor, and the blacks were darker. I really like this monitor and hope my cat doesn\u2019t destroy it. It doesn\u2019t have speakers, but it does have a headphone jack. One thing I do like about this monitor is the power supply is separate so the power cable running to the monitor is smaller than a standard power cord.",
