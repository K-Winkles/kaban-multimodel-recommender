                "reviewText": "When my Acer SB230 arrived it was hard for me to believe that there was actually a monitor inside the box. I'm so used to the big, heavy, clunky monitors of the past that it seemed far too light. It was well packaged and came protected by a clamshell foam insert which was inserted into a thick, form-fitting box. Everything that was supposed to be in the box was there. The only thing I wished they would have included is an HDMI cable. They did include a VGA cable but I wasn't about to spend money on a monitor and then not get the best picture possible by using the VGA input \u2014 so I purchased an HDMI cable locally.Assembly TimePutting the monitor together was simple and took less than 5-minutes. The hardest part was removing the clear coat protection tape that they used on the stand and bottom edge of the bezel.Pros:Lightweight, sleek, and ultra-modern looking \u2014 makes other monitors look fat.Outstanding image quality, everything is sharp and clear.The brightness of the monitor right out of the box is perfect. I didn't adjust a single thing.No dead pixels anywhere on the screen.Non-skid rubber feet do a great job of holding the monitor in place.The monitor, though extremely thin, is surprisingly strong and durable.The thin bezel frame that surrounds the screen is hardly noticeable and practically disappears in a darkened room.Has the ability to tilt backward 15 to 20 degrees \u2014 just be sure and grab the monitor at the top-center and bottom-center when you adjust it.Cons:A few minor ones.No DVI-D connection.No HDMI cable included.(They should have skipped the VGA and provided an HDMI cable.)It doesn't have the ability to adjust vertically.(The height though, seems to be perfect with 3-3/4\" of space under the monitor.)They have put the adjustment controls underneath the bottom right-hand side of the monitor.However, now that I have used it for a few days, I'm glad the controls are under the monitor. Sure, having them there isn't as convenient but the result is a much sleeker look. Which I think is what Acer wanted to accomplish. It's also a plus not to have the \"power on\" light constantly shining at me. By the way, it's barely visible under the monitor, and when lit is a nice dark shade of blue.**************My Decision ProcessI spent a lot of time reading hundreds of reviews by Amazon customers on what they thought of their purchase. And though I considered other brands and comparable models (HP, BenQ, ViewSonic, Sceptre, LG, Samsung, ASUS) each time I came back to Acer.In the end, my decision came down to either the Acer SB220Q or the Acer SB230. I chose the SB230 because it had a larger screen (23\" vs 21.5\") and faster access time (1 ms access time vs 4 ms for the SB220Q). I also wanted a slightly larger monitor because my vision, while okay, isn't great. At the same time, space on my desktop is at a premium and anything larger would have been unwieldy.All things considered, I am very happy with my choice.A Sad DayThe Acer SB230 replaced my dearly beloved ViewSonic VX2235wm - a 22-inch monitor that finally bit the dust after many years of faithful service. Dumping it in the trash today was a lot harder than I thought it would be. In its time, it was a great monitor. That's why I came oh so close to buying a Viewsonic.ADDED: 1/8/19I don't understand how anyone could give the SB230 a \"One-Star\" review. Either the other reviewer got a \"lemon\" or he is using the VGA cable to connect to the monitor. (Don't.) An HDMI cable and a decent video card will make a world of difference in the picture quality. I'm running an old Dell 980 Optiplex with an I7 quad-core processor, 16gb of ram, an Nvidia GT610 video card and the picture on my monitor is stunning! I just watched an NBA basketball game and I felt like I was sitting courtside. It doesn't get much better than that \u2014 unless you're at the game.UPDATE: 7/15/19It's now six months later and I can report that I still love this monitor as much as the day it arrived. I have encountered no problems with it at all. Every pixel on the screen is still perfect and the picture is still as stunning to me as the first time I turned it on. I have no regrets whatsoever and would buy this monitor again if I needed another.UPDATE: 10/10/20It's now almost two years later and I'm still very happy with this monitor. It has no dead pixels and still functions properly. In its price range, it's pretty tough to beat for value, quality, and durability.",

Overall, great for the price and would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I'm currently renovating my office and my desk setup and I knew I would need two 27\" IPS 1440p monitors to run vertically in portrait on each side of my main 34\" UW. I saw that these were on a great sale for $110, so I gave them a chance. Here are my thoughts:Firstly, for the price I paid these are excellent monitors and I would be dumb to return them. The size picture quality, thin bezels, and performance are all great. As a landscape monitor if you only need 100hz it would be perfect.However, for my specific use case of wanting portrait monitors, I would not always choose them among other options. The main reason for this is because of the VESA mounting position and attaching location.These DO have 75x75 VESA holes, let's clear that up.But the two holes towards the center of the monitor are on a curve, so the VESA bracket can kinda flex there.VESA is only 75, not 100.The VESA attachment location as at the BOTTOM of the monitor, not the center. This makes landscape orientation mounting awkward for mounts and rotation. It might make your mount rotate/twist, leaving the monitor angled rather than vertical. VIVO's steel arms couldn't counter this rotation force.The bottom few inches are THICK, so if you orient this monitor in portrait and you want the thin bezels nearest your other screens, you have a thick unsightly chonky boy visible (about 2 inches thick\".Inputs for power and HDMI/DP are also at the bottom edge, so if you orient this sideways, they stick straight out and are very visible. To combat this I bent the power cord as best as I can, and got HDMI angled adapters.Lastly, the VESA plate you use will stick out beyond the monitor. If you can't hide it, you'll have to cut like 1/4 inch off of the metal plate to hide it.For now, I've oriented these to have the base/bottom be on the inside rather than the outside, and slightly behind my main. This hides the cables and brackets. I'm swapping out the VIVO mounts for others that I have that can handle the rotation force.All of this considered I'm going to keep these since I was able to make all of this work for me and I got them at a great price. And - no dead pixels! =D",
