No issues with install; plug-and-play. My home PC requires both the C-type cord and the HDMI cord for power and picture. My work laptop has a Thunderbolt C-type, so I only need that one cord for both power and picture. I didn't have to make any adjustments at all. Menus are easy to operate. The sound was a bit low from the speakers, but I generally have headphones hooked up. All in all, I'm super pleased with this product.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as the cheapest portable monitor I could find on amazon. I wanted amazon customer support in case of defects, and my use case is primarily as a tool for troubleshooting other computers so my bar was low.To my surprise, the image is a sharp and warm color temp LCD. The while it only has the single backlight, the HDR effect does give the image a bit more pop so its pleasant to look at. It uses very low power, so it can be powered by a USB port on the pc itself, and if it has thunderbolt support you can just use the 1 c - c cable.No issues yet, and makes some of projects a bit easier as its way less cumbersome than a full desktop display.",
