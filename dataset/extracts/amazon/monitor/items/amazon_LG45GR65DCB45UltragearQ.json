The display is beautiful, and offers several different display settings to choose from. Colors are vibrant and bright, and response time is pretty flawless. Nice notch for cable management in the back of the monitor to hide all of the wires and cables. Everything is very adjustable and user friendly. I wouldn't want anything smaller, especially for gaming. This is a must and the price is pretty decent considering the quality. It's worth saving a little more for something of this quality.",

It does not support the VESA external mounting, however (not a problem for me, but you need to know that). I love the brightness, the curve, the size, and the resolution. I would not want a monitor any smaller with this many pixels on it. I was able to change out my matched, dual FHD (1920x1080) monitors for this one. Doing the math, this screen has more pixels than those in a smaller footprint (because it's a vertically taller resolution - 1440) and it's super at viewing very large Excel Spreadsheets without a screen-border divider in between. Note that I do not game so I cannot vouch for speed of the screen updating, etc., don't even know how to interpret those metrics, honestly. I highly recommend this monitor.",

I almost went with the big brother 45\", but heald back to reserve some desk space. Its not the best of the best but the picture looks great. I'm no expert in monitors by any means but MS Flight sim is beautiful on it. I was super nervous because i bought it \"used - Acceptable\" for a steal so i didn't know what to expect. When it showed up it was in the LG box and hadn't even been opened. Everything was still wrapped up. Win!! Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "This LG 45\" super ultrawide [part/model: 45GR(65/75)DC-B] with a 32:9 aspect ratio has proven to be the best work-and-play monitor I have ever owned. I primarily bought this monitor for my remote job, which requires me to work long hours and split tabs into windows of different sizes to work efficiently. Previously, I had a 49\" Samsung Neo G9 (2021 version) with a 120Hz refresh rate, which turned out to be a game-changer. With that monitor, I can easily fit all the windows I need for work without any hassle, but I found it too overwhelming and couldn't tolerate such a large screen for gaming purposes.I have previously owned several 34-inch 21:9 3440x1440p monitors, which were the perfect size for both productivity and gaming. However, I was wrong... I found it challenging to fit all the windows I needed on one screen. So, the solution would be to try a single 32-inch 4K monitor, which would be perfect for work because it would scale the programs, user interface, and other miscellaneous windows. However, after a week of using it, I realized that the text size, scaling of my browser/program windows, and sharpness were not suitable for my needs. In more detail, I had to lean over closer to the monitor to see everything clearly, which caused neck pain, but that would be the end user's fault (me) because I would forget to zoom back in on the text. Again, I only had it set up that way because I was trying to fit as many windows as possible.Initially, I was considering going back to the 49-inch monitor. However, I stumbled upon a newly released 45-inch monitor with a 32:9 aspect ratio and 1440p resolution. Since I already knew what the 49-inch monitor was like, I decided to try this one. After checking out the dimensions, I had a genuinely good feeling about it and decided to invest in it. I am incredibly pleased with this purchase and will never give it up... for now. I freakin' love this thing! I don't typically write product reviews, but I just had to get the word out on this beast. Definitely the best bang for the buck!",

                "reviewText": "Had this monitor for a few days now and expected to use it for work and gaming. To my surprise it excels at gaming but not so great for work. Most important work consideration is if you have any trouble at all making out small text, this is probably not the monitor for you. The pixel density is great, until you need to read anything, especially in an environment where text doesn't scale with system text, which is my case.The HDR is surprisingly nice in games, though I disabled the dimming zones as they don't really add much and are distracting at times. Frame rate is great, and overall a very good monitor and a nice size compromise to some of the larger 32:9 offerings out there.",

                "reviewText": "I did quite a bit of research on Ultrawides before buying this one. Even the samsungs and asus 49s had absolutly horrible reviews. Many friends also has issues with dead pixels and monitors just deciding to give up just outside of warrenty.Well so far this LG is great. I always enjoyed LG and have quite a few of their products. Personally I tried a bunch of different games on this monitor along with different font sizes on texts or pdfs. I freaking love this thing, glad I sold off my three 27\" samsungs to get this one. Has been worth every penny thus far.I have also been tinkering around with the LG app \"On Screen Control\" to take advantage of the \"split screen\" options seeing as how I was replacing three screens for an ultrawide for this main reason. It works great. I love how simple it is, however I had some trouble finding the app on the LG site. After talking to a rep, it was determined that it was not available on the site for this model, so they promptly linked me for another model (the app is the same for all the LG ultragears) and it worked no problem.I also love the feature of being able to plug the mouse and keyboard into the monitor, and it just transfers my mousee & keyboard to whatever I plug the screen into. Even works while using Samsung DEX on my phone.There is also a way to get two PCs to work split screen on this screen, haven't played around with that yet, but will get to it soon. I will update as soon as I get a chance to do that. (I do a lot of repair for freinds/family, and the feature sounds like it would be VERY helpful. One mouse, keyboard & screen for any PC I plug)I played around with the color/brightness settings till I got it where I liked it and saved the profile for my main PC. Personally the image is b-e-a-u-tiful. After Sony; LG has always been one of my favorites for TV. Well now they just might be my favorite for monitors.Unless you have an absolute monster for a graphics card... you're not gonna be running at 200 hz while gaming. I am running a 2070 SUPER and I average around 120 on medium settings on most games. Only time I hit the 200 is when on desktop. I am running a IVANKY 1.4 DISPLAY PORT cable for this.It has only been two days since I received it, so time will tell. I have high hopes for this monitor and I hope it meets those expectations. I will keep this posted, because I am sure I am not the only one afraid to pay over 1000$ for a screen while all the other ultrawides let go just after warrenty.10/10 so far.",

                "reviewText": "Great display overall. I use Windows for Gaming and a Macbook for work from home. The monitor comes with two HDMI ports and one Display Port. You can easily switch displays, which means you can switch from Windows to Macbook, or to Steam Deck in a press of a button. The monitor also has built in speaker, which I was not aware of when I purchased it, which is a plus. I owned a lot of 34\" ultrawide monitors and I could tell you this is better than Samsung 34\" Odyssey. But if you have extra budget, I would settle for Dell 34 Ultrawide - S3422DWG. If you are buying this for your work from home setup, make sure you use a software such as \"Region to Share (Windows)\" when you screen share, as the display would appear really small for other users who has 27\" monitors or below.",
