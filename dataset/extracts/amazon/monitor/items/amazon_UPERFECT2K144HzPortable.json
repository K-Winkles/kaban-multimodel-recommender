                "reviewText": "I purchased this monitor to use specifically with our Xbox One S. I plan on purchasing a new Xbox for Christmas to play on the TV but still want to use the old Xbox so that we can all play together. I also purchased a Mini HDMI Male to HDMI Female Adapter so that I could connect this monitor to my Xbox with the included HDMI cable. This monitor is 17.3\" 2K with 2560 x 1440p high resolution and 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is very slim and lightweight. It really is plug-and-play, very easy to set up and use. As you can see from my picture, we do have to sit relatively close to the Xbox due to the length of the HDMI cord.In the pictures, you can see the portable monitor on the left connected to my gaming laptop on the right. You will notice that the colors are warmer on the monitor as I have enabled the blue light filter to minimize eye strain. I love that it has that option. You can also see the matte screen and how it reduces the glare from the flash on my camera. The image is very clear, there is no delay when plugged into my gaming laptop. I've also noticed that when plugged into our old Xbox that it loads in faster to games than my gaming computer. Very impressed with this monitor so far.I don't care for the magnetic case that doubles as a stand. I found it to be flimsy and the magnet is very weak for a monitor of this size. When used as a stand, it will gradually slide down and fall so that is annoying but if you were traveling with this device, I feel like the case would provide decent protection for the screen. I did contact UPERFECT about the stand issue. This company has amazing customer service! They respond very quickly and go out of their way to make sure that any issue you have is addressed. They sent me a new stand, which you can see in the pictures. The UPERFECT stand works great with this monitor as it has a 360\u00b0 rotatable base, and it also allows you to adjust the monitor to a comfortable viewing angle. I couldn't be happier with the customer service I received and I know if I have any other issues with this monitor, they will take care of me. (Thanks UPERFECT!)Overall, I definitely recommend this portable monitor. The image quality is very nice, easy to set up with plug and play. Includes Freesync and 144 Hz refresh rate. Amazing customer service support! The speakers are okay for this price point and being a portable device. The cover/stand needs improvement, a stronger magnet is needed. Other than that, the button on the side to adjust screen settings is not super user-friendly and could be made easier if it had a remote or was touch screen.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've been using the Uperfect 4K monitor for a little while now, and it's been nothing short of spectacular. The clarity of the display is something you have to see to believe. Every image is razor-sharp, making everything from browsing the web to watching movies a real pleasure. The colors are another highlight \u2013 so vibrant and true-to-life.

The smoothness and responsiveness are top-notch, with no screen tearing or stuttering. It\u2019s like it\u2019s made for gamers. And when it comes to work, the ultra-clear display really helps reduce eye strain, especially when I\u2019m reading small text or focusing on details in spreadsheets.I appreciate the sleek design too. It's not just another piece of tech; it's a stylish addition that complements my workspace. The all-aluminum body gives it a premium feel, and the ultra-slim, lightweight design means I can easily take it with me if I need to. Setting it up was a breeze - just plug and play. And the variety of ports means I can connect almost any device without any hassle.The added flexibility of the VESA mount and the smart cover that doubles as a stand is the icing on the cake. It shows that Uperfect really thought about versatility and user convenience. Whether I\u2019m working, gaming, or just chilling with a movie, this monitor has been a game changer for me. For anyone looking to upgrade their monitor, I can't recommend the Uperfect 4K monitor enough. It's a solid performer that ticks all the boxes for both work and play.",

I bought it as a second monitor for home and mobile use when travelling. It has been a good purchase for both of these use cases. Colour and brightness are surprisingly good with some tweaking of settings. I don't use it outdoors, so I can't comment on that, but for indoor use, even in a well-lit room, it is great.After a few months, my monitor had an issue. I contacted the supplier (Uperfect) through Amazon to report this. The response I received was fast and pretty incredible. A service representative asked for some information, which I supplied. Uperfect took a decision quickly (the next day), which I appreciated. Shortly thereafter, I received a new unit. Exemplary customer service, not much else I can say.",

                "reviewText": "In der modernen Arbeitswelt, in der Mobilit\u00e4t eine immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle spielt, sind tragbare Monitore zu einem unverzichtbaren Begleiter geworden. Nachdem ich mehrere Modelle getestet habe, m\u00f6chte ich meine Erfahrungen mit dem UPERFECT Portable Monitor teilen:Verarbeitung & Funktionen: Dieser Monitor sticht im Vergleich zu anderen tragbaren Modellen hervor. Die Qualit\u00e4t der Verarbeitung und die gebotenen Funktionen erf\u00fcllen sowohl die Anforderungen beim Arbeiten als auch beim Spielen.Stromversorgung: Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass f\u00fcr den Betrieb immer ein USB-C Ladekabel ben\u00f6tigt wird. W\u00e4hrend ein solches Kabel im Lieferumfang enthalten ist, w\u00e4re eine direkte Strom- und Bildversorgung \u00fcber USB-C ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Komfort. Dennoch, wenn alle Kabel korrekt angeschlossen sind, funktioniert der Monitor einwandfrei.Bildqualit\u00e4t: An sonnigen Tagen k\u00f6nnte der Monitor etwas heller sein. Trotzdem ist die Sichtbarkeit ausreichend. W\u00e4hrend er mit einem Standardmonitor nicht mithalten kann, bietet er dennoch eine solide Leistung. Bei Office-Arbeiten und beim Spielen mit der PS5 war das Delay minimal und akzeptabel f\u00fcr den Preis. Die Full-HD-Aufl\u00f6sung auf einem 15-Zoll-Monitor ist mehr als ausreichend. Ein teureres 2K-Modell zeigte kaum erkennbare Unterschiede.Zus\u00e4tzliche Funktionen: Der Monitor bietet viele Anschlussm\u00f6glichkeiten, was das Arbeiten mit verschiedenen Ger\u00e4ten erleichtert. Das integrierte Cover dient zudem als praktischer Laptopst\u00e4nder.Fazit:Der UPERFECT Portable Monitor bietet eine beeindruckende Kombination aus Mobilit\u00e4t und Funktionalit\u00e4t. F\u00fcr Nutzer, die einen zuverl\u00e4ssigen Begleiter f\u00fcr einfache bis mittelanspruchsvolle Arbeiten suchen, ist dieser Monitor eine hervorragende Wahl. Ich empfehle jedem, der in Erw\u00e4gung zieht, einen tragbaren Monitor anzuschaffen, sich dieses Modell genauer anzusehen und sich selbst ein Bild zu machen!",
