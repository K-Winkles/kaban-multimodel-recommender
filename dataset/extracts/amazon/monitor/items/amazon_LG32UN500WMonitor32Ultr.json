The black level seems great to me. Very consistent black and fairly dark. AMD FreeSync seems to work okay after a bit of fidgeting in some games (below 60 FPS, sometimes necessitating adjusting vertical sync, etc.). I disabled the HDR on PC because HDR generally doesn't do much with VA monitors like these, but it introduced quirks with software that isn't particularly HDR compatible. Issues with the HDR mode are not the fault of the monitor.",

                "reviewText": "This is my third LG monitor or TV product. I like other brands too but LG continues to make decent quality available for a reasonable price. The others are great (Samsung, Dell, HP) but they tend to be higher too. And you can see where LG cuts a few corners to save the money on the price. The monitor stands tend not to be the best and their power cables are terrible (see below).But if you want a good panel, this one is pretty nice. I've only had it for a few days so I can't comment on its longevity yet, but for the price it is a huge upgrade over my old 23 inch screen. I think in terms of image quality where it might not be good enough is for professional graphics people; they will need to stick with Apple or other higher end monitors that have better color reproduction.For me, I mainly wanted a monitor for better productivity during work-from-home, and some TV/movie watching and a little gaming. This screen has excellent text quality. I really appreciate the nice text, especially with my failing eyes. You can also fit a lot more on the screen, so I can have a main app, a browser, and a streaming TV app all open at the same time. If I need to work with a big spreadsheet, I can dedicate the whole thing to the screen and see so much more than the old FHD 1080 monitor showed.Is it right for you? I think for most people this is great. The professional illustrators or graphics people will probably turn their noses up at it.Pros:- 4K with HDR for a good price- Excellent text display- VESA mounting support- Has 2 HDMI and 1 DisplayPort inputs- Includes an HDMI cable- Supports AMD FreeSync, though I haven't used it myself yet- Plug and Play with Windows 10. I didn't have to install anything. It ran fine the first time.- I didn't have any issue with broken pixels out of the box- Relatively thin bezelsCons:- Color reproduction probably not good enough for professionals. Without HDR or one of the other enhanced modes on, it looks faded or washed out. With HDR on the colors pop a lot more, but as I'm not an expert I really can't say how it compares to other options.- Lacks extras like USB hub support- Pretty basic stand (but if you're using VESA mounting then this doesn't matter)- Power cable has a big plug. This is my second LG monitor that does this...why, LG, why!? It will hog up multiple spots on your power strip or outlet.Misc:- This is a VA panel, not IPS. It's one of the ways to get the cost down. I haven't used IPS, but I understand it provides for better viewing angles. I don't care about that for this monitor so this was a plus for me.- Integrated speakers. I'm never going to rate monitor speakers as a plus, but it's not a negative either. I use different external speakers but if you have limited desk space this could be handy.",

                "reviewText": "Update: After 6 months of constant use I\u2019m still happy with the monitor and it\u2019s picture performance. Watching YouTube videos in 4K is still awesome. I don\u2019t have a 4K TV so this is my 4K entertainment screen atm. I did make one change to my setup which was to install a $20 Koopman 4K HDMI auto-switcher between the monitor and my sources. Using the physical button to switch sources just got old. LG should just build this feature into the monitor imho. I have gamed with this screen and I can\u2019t tell any difference. If you need 120hz and a serious gamer then buy the better screen from LG. For a home office warrior, this model is fine.From my perspective, this monitor ticks the following boxes:- 4k resolution- VA panel over TN- Lower cost than IPS- Narrow bezels- 2020 Model- 16:9 format- Good brightness, contrast, viewing angles- VESA mounting- Brand name with good reputation- Right mix of inputsAfter using it for a month with a mix of laptop and desktop inputs and different content, I'm happy with my choice. I use it mostly for office productivity apps, casual gaming, and streaming Youtube, Netflix, and Xfinity. The 32\" screen is a great size to see multiple windows and have lots of desktop space. I don't have to turn my head to see the corners of the screen. I don't notice any flicker nor are my eyes tired after using it all day. Colors, sharpness, and brightness are all perfectly acceptable for my needs. The on-screen menu has enough options to tweak to your preference but is not so overwhelming that you leave everything at default. With 3 inputs, I can plug in my desktop, laptop, and possibly a streaming stick or Apple TV down the road. The monitor sits in my home office so can also double as a TV when the family is using the main television. I sit 6 feet away and watch football comfortably. My only gripe so far is that switching inputs takes 4 clicks of the menu joystick. I wish there was a physical input button. Also it only came with 1 HDMI to HDMI cable.",

                "reviewText": "I've collected a decent amount of horror and scifi movies in blu ray, 4K and HDR. This monitor is replacing an LG 29UM59a which has served its purpose well.I installed my own known great cable and had no issues. My GPU detected the new monitor and I set it for native resolution. I also set the monitor for the mode Cinema.See pics of my hardware specs because this will definitely impact your own results.My first test was finding YouTube videos in 4K HDR which are plentiful.Holy moly quacamole! The blacks are deep with a great contrast. The colors are fantastic. It's crystal clear.I don't play games so I'm not certain that 60 Hz refresh will be enough but for watching movies and general researching and writing this is perfect. All this for about $325.No dead pixels, no weird artifacts, no color bleeding - just a great picture from bezel to bezel.",
