                "reviewText": "I recently became supervisor of my shop and now I need to work from home using my work laptop. The laptop is a 15 inch Dell and is decent. At work I have dual 24 inch monitors, so it is really hard to use only a 15 inch screen while working at home. I went on to Amazon looking for a USB C monitor (not sure about the size at the time). I was hoping to find something under $100, but not sure what size I could get for $100. I found this 15 inch monitor looking around and it got good reviews. When buying tech on Amazon, I learned to look up the company and see if they have a website I can visit. I saw they had an actual website. So I was a little more at ease with a purchase. Anyway, it was $100 with a $10 \u201ccoupon\u201d and I pulled the trigger. It took three days to get here (which is really fast for Hawaii). The monitor came in a really nice box and was packed in the box really well. It had all the cables you might need to use the monitor (I only use the USB C cable to my work laptop and it works perfectly!). I also use the included case/stand. The only thing I upgraded after a month of use was a longer (6 foot) USB C cable. It came with a 3 foot and I had a hard time working with that cable. It took me a few tries (3 to be exact) to find the correct cable, but the one that worked was the Cable Matters 201323-BLK-2m. I actually had to contact InnoView to ask for assistance. They responded quickly and told me that I needed a full-function USB C cable. The Cable Matters USB C cable is actually higher rated than just \"full-feature\". On a side note, I like to keep the digital version of the owner\u2019s manual and InnoView gladly sent me the digital version.",

                "reviewText": "My Laptop's screen began to come loose & lose it's sheen but the Laptop itself still great in all other aspects. I was getting ready to buy a new one, then stumbled upon this and WOW!Hooked this up to my Laptop as the (new) Primary Screen and I've got a whole new computer, it looks even better than the original screen on the day I bought the laptop. This has saved me hundreds of dollars and it's not just as a save, there's more ...Started goofing around with this and figured out I can plug a Firestick, Roku Stick, Tivo or Chromecast into it and I have a TV! Bought a Firestick specifically for it, packed them both up and took them on a business trip with me. Set it up in the hotel, plugged in the stick and it was just like I was watching from my living room. So I've decided to buy a second one, specifically for business trips. As a bonus, this monitor works well with most tablet stands.The photos don't do it justice, it looks so much better in real life, even the packaging is beautiful. It also seems a lot flatter than the photos appear, I mean this thing is very thin and very light. And for what I paid & what I got? NO BRAINER, buy one of these today!...",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In my home-office, I have two main systems - a Mac and a Windows box, both with dual large 4K monitors, mostly 28s with a beautiful curved 32\" 4K also. So travel, using just a 13\" or so laptop screen, is painful.I travel also with two computers - a MacBook Pro and a Microsoft Surface Pro. So I wanted a portable additional screen that would work well with both.This is that screen.You do need power or strong USB current. It does work off of my J-Go Tanker (which supports the Surface Pro directly also!), or any USB plug, with its USB to USB-C cable. Another USB-C to USB-C works flawlessless with the MacBook. And with my LG V30 phone. They also provided an HDMI to Mini-HDMI, which works with my \"plugable\" (that's the brand, purchased right here on Amazon) active mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I bought years ago for the Surface. Yeah, you'll need something like that; they're around $12 for passive, which is all you really need for this 1080p display. I have active because I often use those 4K monitors.Anyhow, yeah, everything is just plug-and-play. Image is good, scaling is good, don't even notice the 1080p drop from my 4Ks (perhaps because 15\" is a lot less than 32\".)Three things that would have been nice:1. Ability to have it \"rotate\" into portrait mode, meaning register as a tall screen, for Android compaitibility (not much does this, but my full sized 4K monitors do.)2. Inclusion of DisplayPort input or a dongle for that, but it is just a $12 part you need anyhow for that.3. No travel pouch is included, and nothing folds over to protect the display. This would have been a great addition.But I am wowed by this monitor. The things it does well, easily, rock.",
