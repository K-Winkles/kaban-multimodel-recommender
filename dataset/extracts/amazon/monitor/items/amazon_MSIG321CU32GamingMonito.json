                "reviewText": "Looks great so far, and no dead pixels - my biggest fear when buying a monitor.I notice that this monitor is a bit dim because I have to set the brightness and contrast to 70, compared to other monitors where I set to 40 and 70 would be too bright. But, since I am still able to find a brightness level that works for me, I like it.Picture quality looks good so far, but given that I am coming from a 27\" 1440 144hz monitor, it should look better.The included stand does not lift - it only tilts. On first usage it is somewhat awkward because the taskbar is much lower than I am used to (on 27\" monitor). The top of the monitor is at a good height so for me tilt only is not a big demerit.",

I purchased a 4090 earlier this year and have a fully built PC. A 4k 144Hz monitor is the last thing I was waiting on, but I was not going to spend the average market of $600+. I just kept waiting and this monitor delivers. The only negative thing I will say is that the stand allows for no adjustment at all, so if there are any bousie people that just have to have that, then they may want to get another stand. Of course.... that negates the whole point of being a good priced monitor.",

A lot of this can probably be chalked up to this being my first 4K, but it\u2019s a massive improvement from my 2k. It is a lot, but there\u2019s not many monitors that are curved, 4K, and have a higher-than-60htz. A bit expensive, but it\u2019s worth it, especially for the QLED",

I\u2019ve tried resetting the monitor, changing HDMI cables, changing ports in both the monitor and GPU, plugged it in to the outlet by itself and nothing seems to fix it. I\u2019ll try reaching out to MSI, and go from there\u2026",
