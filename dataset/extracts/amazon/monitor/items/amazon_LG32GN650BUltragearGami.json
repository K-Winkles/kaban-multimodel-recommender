                "reviewText": "I was reading into the bottleneck issue on the ps5 graphics capabilities and monitor/screen selection. I really wasn\u2019t sure because I know the ps5 is hdmi 2.1 compatible as well. So I was torn between this screen and perhaps a more expensive one with 2.1 hdmi capabilities vs hdmi 2.0. I\u2019ll be Frank, the screen is amazing. 2k is giving me amazing frame rates on all the major games and the clarity, frame rate is night and day difference. I am playing modern warfare 2- war zone on ps5 with superb vision and responsiveness. Along with a lot of other demanding games. I have no complaints for this price point and really recommend it as honestly with 4K on a ps5 the best you\u2019re gonna get is 60 hz and that juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze. My days of building pc gaming rigs are long behind me and I really don\u2019t feel like spending a grand alone at minimum to get a fast graphics card and paying the costs to get something worth while in the pc gaming world. I work on computers anyways all day ripping away at Salesforce and there really has to be something said about the simplicity of a vanilla console that gets such performance for the price. This screen does work great with the ps5 just make sure you get a good hdmi 2.0 cable for it and enjoy. You\u2019re really not gonna be disappointed with this screen from LG. They really do make some amazing products sometimes. Sure not all. I have noticed specifically in my experience their screens have been great for the price and always tended to punch above their lower price point vs others. If you are on a console you really don\u2019t need anything else.",

                "reviewText": "I will start off by letting you all know this was my very first monitor purchase ever. I have played on PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5. I have also played on the original Xbox, Xbox 360, and now the Xbox X.I do own both systems currently. I owned the PS5 for about a year and recently have purchased the Xbox X.I greatly enjoy the Xbox X over the PS5.Here are my takes after playing 2 hours worth of Call of Duty MW3 (2023) for the first time on this monitor. (Again, I\u2019ve never owned one before.)PROS - LightweightGreat packingGood quality feeling productEasy Set upGreat picture qualityAdjustableCONS-No remote to control settings (has a little button which would be fine but see the next con)Absolutely no instruction manual for operating the monitorAnd that\u2019s it.I played 7 games of COD. One game of TD and 6 games of SnD.I went positive 6-7 games.1st game (TD) 19-192nd game (SnD) 10-43rd game (SnD) 5-64th game (SnD) 15-55th game (SnD) 8-46th game (SnD) 7-77th game (SnD) 10-5I\u2019m just showing you these because normally it\u2019s hard for me to do on the 75 in LG tv. This LG monitor has improved my gameplay like crazy and I will only be playing on it from now on. :)UPDATE: It\u2019s still going strong and still really enjoy it. It was definitely one of my best purchases in 2023. My k/d is now over 2.0 and I\u2019m have a blast playing CDL on it. Again, don\u2019t hesitate on switching to a monitor it\u2019s well worth it.",

                "reviewText": "A lot of research went into this purchase. I had a 43\" LG 4K tv (43UJ6300) that served me well for several years. It was a smart TV that I purchased in 2017. It developed several problems recently (wifi quit, constant disconnects from internet with lan cable, and color problems in the panel recently. I decided to replace this with a monitor to use with my gaming pc, Xbox Series X and Playstation 5. After using the TV I realized that 43\" is just too big to use at an office desk. In the interim I had access to a Asus ROG PG279. This is an excellent monitor that has built in g-sync tech. I was using this exclusively for my PC until recently. It only had one HDMI port and limited my console use until I bought a small avedio 4K hdmi switch (3 port auto switching). I realized that 1440p is a perfect resolution to use with my msi 1080ti DUKE and 32\" is a great size for my desk.Let me just say that I have loved this new monitor so far. I have my Xbox, PS5, and PS3 hooked to my hdmi switch as well as my PC hooked to this new monitor via Display Port. Just letting everyone know that the xbox series x, playstation 5 both output 4K and downscale to 1440p with absolutely no problems and the image is great (very satisfying). The free sync is working flawlessly with my pc and msi1080ti. I love the fact that I can just turn on each device and the monitor comes on and works flawlessly. The colors and brightness of this panel are great. I love the 32\" size also. I read so many conflicting reviews about what this monitor will and will not do. It does everything that I need excellently. I decided on LG again due to image quality and price. I got this monitor for $336. I have also seen it on slick deals for $297 recently. I am impressed with the HDR also. It is my first real experience with a screen that represents HDR well. I know that you can spend much more and get better HDR but I decided against that. My other considerations were a better Asus ROG and a Samsung G7. I am very impressed so far. Feel free to ask questions about this LG Ultagear. I'll do my best to help.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent 2K 144 Hz gaming monitor. Let me explain: I say 144 Hz and not the specified 165 Hz because, although it is certainly capable, trying to game at 165 Hz introduces horrible blur and increases latency for some weird reason; but it works well at 144 Hz, which is all you really need (ergo, good, not great). The 2K picture looks crisp, and my gaming experience coming from 22 inch 1080p has improved significantly. However there is a horrible (and I really mean horrible!) shadow on the vertical edges, specially annoying when trying to use the vertical scroll bar, to the point it deforms the image and gives you a headache, so once again good, not great. I guess for the money it is OK, but I was expecting more from LG. A bit disappointed to be completely honest.",
