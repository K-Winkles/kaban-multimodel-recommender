Only negative is that it has only 1 HDMI input: That is a bit odd.SETUP:1) Disable and delete all the audio drivers associated with the monitor. In Windows 11 you can do this easily through Device Manager. They are easy to spot because they are marked \"LG\".2) Go to the LG website and download the \"On Screen Control\" App. Be careful to download the Windows version. Once you download and install, go into the App's settings and unselect \"Start at Windows Startup\" or words to that effect. There is absolutely NO NEED for the LG On Screen Control to start with Windows. When you want to make adjustments to the monitor, simple click the onscreen App and you're off an running.",

The monitor itself feels very high quality and has a nice menu to adjust the brightness and color settings. One small thing is that 32 inches may be too big for 1080p for some folks, at a couple feet from the monitor the pixels become noticeably visible, but if you have distance from the monitor it looks fine. Overall great monitor and quality, especially for the price.",

This is difficult if you want to connect multiple devices (PC and laptop; Switch and PC; etc.).",

No issues with the first one when I set it up Monday morning. Setup the second one on Monday late afternoon. I noticed issues with the display on the left and right side. Then saw same issue on the top left side. See pics. I requested a replacement and hope the new one does not have the same problem.",

                "reviewText": "The monitors are okay as far as the picture goes. However, the design of the monitors is rather poor.1. The power is supplied by a VERY non-standard source. A crazy-looking plug goes in the wall, and if you use this with a power strip, you can expect that the plug will use one outlet, but cover up THREE more outlets. I have a three monitor setup, and I had to devote TWELVE plugs to these things. It's crazy.2. The monitors are not height-adjustable, just an FYI. And with my three-monitor setup, one monitor is lower than the other two. I'm going to have to find some cardboard or something to place the other monitor on to raise it up 1/4 inch or so.3. The power/adjustment button is a joystick on the back of the monitor, on near the bottom right. This is fine, except that if you have multiple monitors next to each other, then you have to move them out of the way of each other to reach that button.4. There are TWO HDMI ports on the back of the monitor, and one RGB port. I don't know of a reason to have two HDMI ports on a monitor. However I DO see the need for an HDMI and a Display Port. However, this monitor has no Display Port. There is also a headphone jack. On the monitor. Buried way in the back. I would wager this will never be used.Obviously this monitor was not actually field tested by anyone that designed it.I don't think that the quality of the picture is any better than any other monitor you can find on Amazon, and the design flaws are much more annoying than the picture quality is superior. I would not recommend buying these.",
