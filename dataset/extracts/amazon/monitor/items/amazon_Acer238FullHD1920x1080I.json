Stand does not allow for up and down height adjustments, only tilting3. 1080p/60hz is not good for gaming, nor did I buy it for gaming. Try to go with 1440P, 144hz if you want a monitor for gaming and your computer can drive it.4. Only one mode where you can adjust your settings and the brightness is difficult to adjust from there. Too many steps and the buttons are annoying to use. Not a problem if you don't really need to change your brightness.",
