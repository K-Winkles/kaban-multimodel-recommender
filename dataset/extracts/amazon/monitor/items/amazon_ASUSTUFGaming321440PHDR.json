                "reviewText": "This Monitor is absolutely incredible. The build quality, picture quality, refresh rate, etc. are amazing. Going from 60hz to 120hz feels unreal. It is very smooth and so much more responsive. To be honest, I did not expect this Monitor to be this big, and I was very surprised when it arrived. The only thing that is bad about this Monitor is the built in speakers. They sound very like muffled and bad. But, they are good enough for me. Also, the fact that it is not height adjustable does bother me a little bit, since the Monitor is pretty high, but I can easily just adjust my chair. Overall, I give this Monitor a 9/10. Incredible Experience. Highly Recommend.",

The blacks are deep, the clarity of the picture is what has me hooked. I spend hours in front of the computer, and eye strain is a real issue. These monitors have resolved that for me. I bought 3 other brands of monitors before keeping these. I bought the Corsair 32\" monitor, but it is misleading. It does not have 3 USB ports. It has two, and one USB-C port that is an input port. This monitor has 3 full USB ports. The 180hz refresh is really something.You will not regret buying these monitors.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor is awesome. I got the 1440p 27inch curved variant.Picture/screen: Before this I had a basic 1080p 24inch Asus monitor, and let me tell you the upgrade was very much worth it. The color on this screen just pops. WAY more color coverage then my old monitor. I hadn't realized just how many colors I was missing until now. That being said I did try the HDR because it does advertise it, but I would say that its just not quite there. The screen is brighter , yes, but I would say that you lose at least 20% color coverage if not more. Frankly HDR is bland. I wouldn't recommend it at all if that's a big sale point for you. I also have a decent amount of back light leak, so blacks aren't as dark as they could be (part of the reason HDR isn't that great on this unit). For those 2 reasons I knocked of a star.Gaming: This is the main reason I bought the monitor. Playing on here has been a dream. I mostly play Apex and again the color coverage is out of this world. The contrast is RICH, like batman rich. It's easy to overdo to the point where you cant see people in dark areas. Although some fiddling around in the settings fixed that right up. On that point factory setting are okay but ounce you calibrate it, its twice as good. The curve and upgrade in size and resolution took me some getting used to but once I got used to it again, gaming has been nothing but spectacular. I have had no screen tearing, practically no motion blur and input lag is non existent. That being said I stay consistently around 100-110 FPS, so I haven't maxed it out.Ergonomics: This is where I can't really say to much. I didn't even unwrap the stand, instead I immediately mounted it to my own desk top stand (VESA 100mm x 100mm). I did this because the factory stand seems to be a pretty basic one. No height or swivel adjustment, just tilt.In conclusion Picture good. HDR bad, gaming fun. Stand doodoo.",
