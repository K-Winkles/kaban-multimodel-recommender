                "reviewText": "The monitor itself is fine, but dramatically overpriced for the picture quality. The primary purpose for buying this monitor is that it **supposedly** supports MST in DP 1.2. However, it absolutely does not, and unfortunately, I trusted Dell to 'stick to their word' and bought 2 of these monitors thinking they would support the dual monitor setup using MST. Upon trying for several days to get MST to work, I looked up online with a specific focus on MST support via DP1.2, and found that Dell basically lied and is blowing off all their customers who complain about it.Bottom line - if you're buying this monitor to use by itself or in a standard multi-monitor setup, then it's fine, albeit a bit overpriced. Picture quality is ok, the display controls are ok, the ports and connectivity options would be great (if they all worked). However, if you're buying it specifically to use with another MST-compatible monitor to get DP 1.2 pass-thru/daisy-chaining, you will be 100% disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I love these Dell UltraSharp monitors. I have two on my sit/stand desk (a VariDesk Pro 30), and they are light enough to work well with the stand mechanism. Brightness, contrast, and resolution are excellent. I particularly appreciate that the monitor stands are fully flexible out of the box - you can get good ergonomics without having to purchase special stands. The screens can lower to 1.5\" from the desktop, and raise to nearly 7\". There is ample forward and backward tilt, as well as up to 90 degree rotation, all built in.I also really appreciate the built-in USB hubs, which enable me to greatly reduce the clutter of cables and devices on my desktop.Overall, these monitors are an excellent value. I was able to get them as refurbished. One had a flaw and I exchanged it without any issues. The replacement is perfect. I would definitely buy them again.",
