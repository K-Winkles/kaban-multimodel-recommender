They plug into the bottom and hang straight down. I am a neat and picky person, and like to have all cords routed, dressed, and out of sight if possible. The way these are placed, they hang down from the bottom of the monitor, so it is impossible to get them out of sight. As I said, that is a personal peeve.The speakers are really bad, so just go ahead and buy some external speakers for it if you will use audio.",

                "reviewText": "They are bright enough and fairly light so they work with the monitor stand. They came with all the necessary parts and wires. My complaint is that they have those unnecessarily large plugs. You know, the ones that extend a bit too far in any direction so as to make any nearby outlets useless. I'm not a farmer. I shouldn't have to leave every other outlet fallow and rotate plugs every season. The wires are also 3 feet long. This is fine but considering I bought 2 monitors and plugging them in took some creative wiring, it was a second hassle.Another complaint I have is that the back of the monitor has places for 2 screws if you are hanging them on a stand. It works but I would rather have 4 holes so I could use all the screws and they looked more secure. Not really an issue but still not something I am happy about.Overall, they look and work fine although I don't know about audio. To be honest, when there is an input (I turn my computer on), there seems to be a 30 second delay before both monitors are on. Otherwise, they operate as expected with few interruptions or issues.Plus, inexpensive as hell. If they weren't, this would be 3 stars for the large plugs alone, but it's another case of getting what you pay for.",

It\u2019s a budget monitor, which is why $64 is still a great deal for people getting into gaming. If you\u2019re upgrading from your current 1080p60hz monitor, I would fork up the extra $20-40 it\u2019ll cost you for something with a bit more bells and whistles like HDR, higher refresh rate, and a larger screen since this one is surprisingly small. It would be great for a small office space with a bit of recreational time to watch movies/videos.",

                "reviewText": "This may not be the product for you if you care about a super high refresh rate or crisp image quality, but this monitor is great if you're looking for something cheap to use as a secondary monitor. I use this as a second monitor for working from home or for having youtube/discord open while gaming and it works great for that purpose. One thing to note though is that while this monitor is VESA mount compatible, it only has two spots for the screws. Not a problem when you're mounting horizontally, but I mounted this monitor vertically using a different stand than the one provided and this was definitely a surprise. Luckily, this isn't really a problem since the monitor is so lightweight, I'm not worried about it tipping over. Also, the color balance is a little off compared to my main monitor. It leans slightly pinkish almost. Again not really something that bothers me but something to note if you are a graphic designer or someone who cares a lot about that sort of thing.",

Sleek design is modern and beautiful.My new computer as new usb-c type port and that\u2019s the first time I can try it with a monitor. This option works very well and cable were included in the box along with a HDMI cable. The quality of the frame is surprisingly very good with thin border. The 100hz makes a great difference on my games and they are more fluid and sharp than my previous monitor. The colors rendering is just amazing. 24\u2019\u2019 inch is also a perfect size for me and maybe I will add a second monitor for multitasking in the future. This monitor doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all and for the price it\u2019s an amazing value compare to big other brand. Another great feature is the built in speaker, great when I change room to play with my brothers. Those are small speakers so don\u2019t expect to get home theater sound but sound is ok. Im my room I still prefer my detach speaker with subwoofer. I do some homework too with 3d software and with the vibrant color I see a big difference in texture. For now I used the provided stand on my desk but when I will buy another monitor I will use a duplex stand and this monitor is compatible with VESA mount, so no problem on using another mounting stand or fixing on wall. I\u2019m not an expert at gaming, average user and part time homework user too and I can go wrong with this monitor, i\u2019m very please with it.Plus :Great ValueNew usb type-C portBrightnessQualityThinLightweight100hzCons :None so far for my use",

The on-screen menu is fairly simple but limited in options. Quite pleased with the video quality, and the speakers are adequate. Vesa mounting holes are only two. That's a bone headed decision from the designers. My after-market stand expects 4 holes and so do I. Over all this is pretty good value purchase.PS. cables shipped were C and HDMI. Had to buy my own DP cable for my Lenovo tower which has only VGA and PD.",
