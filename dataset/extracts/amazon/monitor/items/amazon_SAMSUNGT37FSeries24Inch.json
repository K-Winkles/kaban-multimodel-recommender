                "reviewText": "I needed a monitor to view my security system cams and access its menu system. I bought this Samsung T37F on Prime Day for $140..I decided to go with a dual monitor setup on my PC and use an HDMI switch to move between an extended PC screen and the security system. The screen is essentially the same size as my HP All-In-One Desktop, though I did have to raise the PC by just under an inch to get the screens to match vertically, (I simply used some wood blocks)..The color/brightness is slightly better on this new monitor and I had to adjust the settings to try and get the best match to the desktop. The new monitor is a whiter white (and I can't adjust the PC whiteness!), but it's close enough for me. The black bezel thickness is slightly less than my PC at just 6mm/1/4\".No issues at all with the connection. No dead pixels. No dirty screen effects. No wake-up issues..The joystick switch at the backside bottom right corner is fine for my setup with the new monitor to the right side. I can imagine if two monitors were positioned side-by-side, the left one would be a pain to access the joystick. Somewhat like the ON/OFF button for the PC, which is also on the backside bottom right corner!.It is of course all plastic, but when in position on the desk, it is very stable. The stand is a little large in its footprint, but it does work for my setup..I am impressed with this monitor. It comes with a 3 Yr warranty and out-of-the-box, it works flawlessly. I can certainly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got this monitor to use as my secondary monitor. I need 2 screens while working, and this one seemed up for the task.This monitor uses an IPS panel which means it is great for color and has great viewing angles, so if you look at it from below, above or the sides, everything stays legible and a consistent color, that is very important for me as I have this mounted above my primary monitor so I look up at it a bit.The monitor has VESA mounting holes on back, so you can easily mount it to an arm if needed, which is what I did. The weakness to this monitor is the stand it comes with, that is the only flaw I see in it so far and why I did not rate it a perfect score. The stand it comes with has no height adjustment, no swivel, no movement at all and is a light, plastic stand. It was no problem for me since I am using an arm to mount it, but if it is to be your main monitor, that stand may not be up to par for you.The menu system is great on this monitor. It has a little joystick on the back which allows you to get into the settings and make tons of adjustments. You can enable gamer modes, blue light filtering modes, adjust colors and much more.This is a great monitor for work and everyday tasks like web browsing and watching videos, but it is also sufficient for casual gamers too. It has 75Hz refresh rate which is a little above the average non-gaming monitor which normally only have 60Hz models. This monitor also has Freesync built in which when you enable that, you will not get any screen tearing when you are in a game that has fast motion on the screen. So with the game modes enabled, this will perform well for you if you are a casual gamer. If you are a FPS gamer that wants the best performance, it may not be sufficient however.I really like the slim bezels on the top and sides, gives the monitor a nice look. IT can also be nice if you use 2 of these side by side, you would not have too big of a border where they would meet in the middle.You get a Displayport and also HDMI on the back, so it can hook up to any computer, It includes an HDMI cable only though, that should suit most users. I am using the HDMI cable and works great with that. But, if you wanted to use displayport, you will need to buy that cable.I am very happy with this monitor and highly recommend it to anybody for most tasks. Great colors, great viewing angles and nice features. This monitor has left me with very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor checked all my initial requirements for my home office. The positive is it comes with HDMI, DP, VESA Mount, 3 year warranty and Samsung brand had been exceptional in the past for quality.The power cable design is poor for the angle and the cable is too short. Doing an Dead Pixel test, I notice the defects or detritus that the other person mention in their review. On my first monitor it was in the lower right corner and it look like a scratch or hair between the screen layers. I return that monitor and received an second one with a defect like a blotch in the top left corner of the screen. Always I return both of them, and move on to an LG monitor.It was an huge disappointment, much wasted time buying this monitor. Amazon's Customer Service and Return policy was exceptional and I do appreciate their help.",
