                "reviewText": "Was it bit skeptical on purchasing this monitor but the flash discount on it was too good to pass up on. I'm glad I bought it.It's a lot larger than I expected. Unit came in an extremely large box and packaging. I really liked how the instructions were printed on the box as you open it. Colors were bright and had no dead pixels on arrival - I left the settings on default. I really don't game as much - I mostly watch video content and do server scripting for a friend - so I can't really give a review on AAA gaming experience.The stand is greatly designed - it can rotating sideways and tilt about 45 angle both ways. It's height adjustable as well.My only con about the monitor is how the plastic rear shroud seems kind of loose. May be it's how the unit is designed but my old LG Ultrawide rear shroud seemed more sturdy.Overall, I'd highly recommend this monitor for consumers since the price is affordable. The quality is good and unit so far performs flawlessly.",

I bought them as an upgrade to an older AOC 2476wm and a Vizio 720p HDTV that I was using as a secondary monitor. The colours are crisp and vibrant. A great deal if your looking to upgrade to dual monitors. The only downside it they DO NOT have the \"4 USB\" ports. kind of a bummer Pros: Price, quality, design, 2 HDMI ports and aux out Cons: No USB ports",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing monitor for my Mac mini m1 (34 inch IPS AOC U34G3X).First it comes with both a HDMI and DP cable. I used the HDMI cable to hook to my m1 mini and it goes up to 100hz refresh rate which is great, I tried 3 others cables to see if it was possible to get to any higher and none of them worked higher than 100hz. If you are going to use this with HDMI just stick with the included cable or one you already have.I also bought a USB-C to DisplayPort cable that gets me to 144hz just fine. Not ideal having to take one thunderbolt port away doing this, but the included usb-c connectors on the monitor partially make up for this.I love the fact that it has 4 USB ports, 2 are labeled as quick charge. I found that I could plug in two unpowered USB hubs into the quick charge ports and they work fine for low power devices like my keyboard, mouse, webcam, security keys etc.. haven\u2019t tried something like a hard drive plugged into them.The two additional ports seem to be faster than the quick charge ones, I ended up plugging in my 1TB SSD drive that goes to around 9XX MB/s read and write when connected via USB-C to my thunderbolt. When plugged in the monitor it gets around 38X MB/s read and write which is respectable though not as fast as the thunderbolt. When I tried the quick charge ports for the SSD it\u2019s so slow not to be useable so I\u2019ll stick to using those for devices that don\u2019t require speed. My other ports on my computer are all occupied and at best I could plug it into a USB hub plugged into a USB-A port but that makes the drive about 250 MB/s write and 200 read, so plugging it in the monitor was the best choice. Even removing the hub as a test and plugging the drive directly to a Mac USB-A gets the same speed, so oddly enough through my monitor makes is run faster compared to the Mac USB-A.The stand is amazing the amount of degrees of freedom it allows to move the monitor and switched to using it despite having an arm that works with this monitor.The picture quality is amazing though colors in certain situations with HDR mode on look off, but in general I appreciate how this mode colors everything compared to normal. I use an app called BetterDisplay to tweak the monitor settings further than MacOS X allows including custom HIDPI modes that scale everything to an ideal size that isn\u2019t too small or too big.It also comes with monitor quality speakers which as usual are of low quality, but at least are loud enough to not worry about being too quiet.",

I can say after almost a year of owning this it is by far the best monitor I have owned. The bezels on this are phenomenal and the overall build quality is great. As for the display quality, in comparison to similar Asus and Samsung monitors I own, this one easily outperforms them for Gaming and daily activities. The Samsung UWHD monitors are still better for movies and digital production work, but the price point is almost double in comparison to this one.No dead pixels, ghosting, LED bleeding, etc. after almost a year. Don't sleep on this monitor, if you are on the fence, buy it.",

Los 165 Hz s\u00ed los da, nada m\u00e1s es de configurar tu pc en ajustes avanzados de pantalla. En la caja trae el monitor, cable de corriente, cable HDMI, cable Displayport y base para el monitor. Cuenta con Game Mode desde los ajustes del monitor (FPS, Carreras y uno para juegos de estrategia), tambi\u00e9n tiene una funci\u00f3n HDR, aunque en los ajustes de la pantalla de la pc no detecte que el monitor es HDR; creo que utiliza un sistema de parpadeo de p\u00edxeles para generar colores que no tiene (activar eso desactiva el game mode si lo tienes activado). Tambi\u00e9n tiene modo eco y un filtro azul para cuidar la vista. Yo recomiendo descargar el software de AOC que se llama G-Menu, desde ah\u00ed puedes activar el game mode, el hdr, el filtro azul y la resoluci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como 165 Hz sin meterte a la configuraci\u00f3n de la pantalla de la pc. Sinceramente estoy muy contento con el monitor. Otro punto a destacar es que los bordes son delgados y se ve muy limpia la imagen.",
