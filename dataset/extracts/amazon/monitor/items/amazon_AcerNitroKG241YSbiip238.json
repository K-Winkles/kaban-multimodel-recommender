                "reviewText": "I get eye strain and blurry vision from using IPS monitors, and decided to go back to VA monitors as I didn't have eye strain issues when using VA monitors from the past. This VA monitor is excellent with 240hz refresh rate. There is no ghosting at all. Excellent color and viewing angle. It has all the benefits of IPS but without the eye strain issue. You can't tell if this is a VA monitor. I tried several other VA monitors, including many that claim to have eye health features for eye strain but most of them are just marketing gimmick. If you get eye strain from IPS monitor, give this a monitor a try.",

                "reviewText": "For 120$ this is a pretty solid monitor, 180hz, 1ms response time, decent build quality, etc. But it has TERRIBLE factory settings (brightness way too low, awful ghosting) you can fix it in the osd by turning up the black boost to 10 (this will result in slightly worse colors but i think its worth it) and turning on freesync (if you have an amd card) or turning the pixel drive to extreme if you have a nivida card. Overall i have little complaints other then that and its a pretty budget friendly monitor but i would recommend getting the ips version of this monitor (last time i checked it was cheaper then this one with the same specs) if you can't stand semi noticeable ghosting.",

I'll add a new update after I receive the replacement!5/26/23 I am so disappointed it arrived today and I was so excited to set it up, I needed this monitor ASAP for school and now because there are clearly damaged pixels or something I'm going to need to return this. However, the return process is such a headache as it will not just give me an option to return the monitor and simply have a replacement sent, I need to drive 30 miles to the nearest return location and then wait till they receive it, test it apparently, wait till my bank issues the funds back to me and then order it over again and wait for them to mail a new one and hope that it's not also defective. I would just put up with the weird shadows but I'm concerned that the rest of the screen will go because of whatever damage caused this. If not for the screen I believe I would be happy with this purchase, but considering it doesn't have speakers or anything BUT a screen that's kinda a crucial feature.",

De noche los negros permanecen en negros por lo que si buscas un monitor para jugar con la luz apagada este es una buena opci\u00f3n, el rango de visi\u00f3n es muy bueno. El tama\u00f1o no es un problema para mi porque mi escritorio es grande, pero si tienes un escritorio peque\u00f1o tal vez te cueste acostumbrarte al tama\u00f1o, sobre todo si tenias anteriormente algo por debajo del tama\u00f1o de este. En cuanto al rendimiento no he notado problemas, llevo us\u00e1ndolo casi 3 meses y no me ha fallado nada.
