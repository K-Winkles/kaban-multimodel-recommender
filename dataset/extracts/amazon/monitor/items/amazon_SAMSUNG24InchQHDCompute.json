                "reviewText": "I've used iMacs for years and this year Apple stopped making the 27-inch iMac - of course, right when I had to replace mine. I bought the Mac Studio which needs a monitor vs the all-in-one of the iMac. I couldn't afford the Apple monitor so I researched what models/brands would be a good substitute. I don't think this is quite as good as the Apple monitor but it's close enough for me (there are some Samsung monitors that supposedly are as good or better than the Apple one). I've had trouble buying monitors for Mac computers in the past - they never were as crisp and clear as the iMac. This one is VERY crisp and clear. And works flawlessly with the computer. I do wish it had built in speakers but I can live with having external ones. The USB ports on the back are also super handy since the Mac Studio seems to think you only need two. I definitely recommend this monitor!",

                "reviewText": "With the pandemic, we had to set up a small office in our living room. We don't have a big desk, so any larger monitor would be too big. This one has the perfect size to work up close, and having the notebook monitor as auxiliary for when you are in a call.The USB-C hub helped a lot reduce the cables -- it charges the notebook and provides the connection for the dongle of a wireless keyboard/mouse combo. I wish the hub was a bit more powerful, as it takes a long time to charge the computer when everything is on. That's fine if you keep it connected the whole time, but if you are disconnecting and using your laptop often, you may find yourself out of charge.The resolution is great, and it's not easy to find a large resolution for this size of monitor at this price point. It's really cool to fit multiple windows in the screen and still have a large enough font to read the contents.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Great monitor with one pretty large flaw.",
                "reviewText": "This is a great monitor and works very well with my M1 MacBook Pro. The stand it is on is very heavy and sturdy and allows a great range angles in all directions. The problem I have with this monitor is its use as a USB-C Dock, in that respect it is pretty terrible, at least with a M1 MacBook Pro. If the MacBook is on and awake when you plug it into the monitor via USB-C the monitor will wake up and everything works great, including the USB-C Dock with all its ports. Very nice. But, if you plug in your M1 MacBook Pro via USB-C while the laptop is either off, or asleep, the monitor wakes up for about a min, and then goes back to sleep. If the MacBook is connected and working (awake) but then you walk away and it is configured to go to sleep, the monitor when it sees the laptop go to sleep also goes to sleep. The problem is that when the monitor goes to sleep it puts the USB-C port to sleep as well, and it stops charging the laptop. The only way to keep charging the laptop is to not ever let the laptop go to sleep or shut down. As soon as the laptop either shuts down or goes to sleep, the monitor turns off the USB-C port and stops charging the laptop. So if you are off using the laptop on battery, get back home, and plug it into the USB-C port, it won't charge overnight unless you turn the laptop on manually and set it to never sleep. I opened a ticket with Samsung because I consider this to be \"broken\", but they insist that it is designed to work that way and hence nothing is wrong. As a monitor, they are correct. As a USB-C hub, that is fundamentally broken. Hence as a monitor this thing should get all 5 stars, but as a USB-C hub, it should get 1 as it is basically worthless as a USB-C hub. I suspect that Samsung could fix this problem with a software patch to the monitor, but of course they won't fix it because they insist it is not broken, making my customer experience with Samsung pretty bad too. All in all, if you do not care about the USB-C hub this is a great monitor, but if you care about the USB-C hub aspect, look elsewhere. Samsung, if you see this post, please consider fixing this bug in the software of your monitor. If you do, I will gladly update this review.",

But when I set it up, the DP out was not consistent. It may be to do with the laptop I was using. Anyways, the biggest problem is the sharpness and picture quality. I have an HP 24 HD monitor, even that was much better than this Samsung. And then, I have a Dell Ultrasharp with same resolution, and there was not even a question on which one was better. I couldn't really believe Samsung made such a low quality product. So I ended up returning it and bought a used Dell Ultrasharp for similar price. More than happy about it.",
