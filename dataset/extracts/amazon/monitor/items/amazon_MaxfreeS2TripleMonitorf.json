With the provided cords, getting one of the two extended displays wasn\u2019t a problem. Needing the USB-C was clear, but there\u2019s I figured there was no harm in finding out if there was a workaround.I emailed the company and got an immediate response. After a few emails back and forth (because of me), they helped me get this to work on my personal laptop without USB-C ports.

At one point, I realized that for my specific setup, I needed a duplicate cord from them (their specific HDMI to USBC is proprietary or something) as they only send one.The customer service rep LISTENED to me and TOOK ME AT MY WORD. Trusting my competence, they rush shipped a cord all the way from China, arriving only in a few days. They sent the confirmation and tracking number. As you can see in the picture, it worked!! Also, as you can see my setup is fairly simple. They have a customer for life.Downside: hdmi to usbc is a special cord you can't buy anywhereUpside: they were willing to make it right, no matter what",

                "reviewText": "It's great when it works! The displays are nice and a good size.But that's about it. It ONLY works with the supplied cables. I tried other known working cables and nothing else works. It will cycle on and say no signal then turn back off. So if the cables get damaged or lost your left with a $250 paper weight.Only way it will function is HDMI/USB-C or USB-C/USB-C. So if your usb-c can't supply enough power for these they will constantly cycle on and off. Using the supplied power cords will take up yet another slot and still will cause cycling if not enough power is being pushed to the screen.Overall:Nice concept but terrible implementation. WHY!!! Does anyone make proprietary hardware anymore? Customers should be able to just purchase another cable of any brand and use the product. Frankly making customers require coming back to you for a cable is really dirty business.If/when it works it's great but unless you have a very new laptop chances are this is going to be a headache and you may end up having to plug it into phone chargers to supply these with enough power.",

Only problem was when I flew I had to purchase 2 monitors locally, then return the monitors I needed to the tech store. I purchased two of these units and am extremely satisfied. The items came with traveling cases, instructions and the cables. My laptops only provide video via the HDMI outputs consequently I needed 2 additional cables. I emailed the manufacturer and requested 4 additional cables. They were sent to me immediately free of charge. I now travel with no encumbrances with my equipment relative to traveling by ground or air. I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy it again.",

After emailing the manufacturer who just happens to be in mainland China, several times, several back and forth it was determined that my USBC port is not a full function port and I would now need extra hardware in order to get it to work. So I ordered a usb-c to HDMI hub which should allow note screens to work( which it does) however they still do not work at the same time due to the fact that the system only comes with 1 HDMI to USB-c cable. I am unable to use an aftermarket cable as the one for this system is proprietary and I have to wait on one to be shipped all the way from CHINA. I have had this product for 2 weeks and I am STILL unsure if it will even work as needed. BTW the part is supposedly on the way, according to potential delivery dates I may be waiting another 2 months for delivery.",

This product is HEAVY, it weighs way more than you think. I've had to take it on business trips with me and you can definitely tell when it is in your bag. It is easy to clip onto your laptop, but again you need a very heavy-duty laptop to handle the overall weight of monitors. It has great quality and brightness on each screen. The screens are stiff once you place them on your monitor-you can't adjust them different directions at all. Overall a decent product, but definitely not worth the price.",

It's also been great for live streaming so I can have my streaming software open on one window and the programs I need to bring into the stream on the others. Cannot recommend high enough. The screens themselves are a standout feature. They are bright, clear, and offer a high-quality visual experience, enhancing my productivity on the go",

I get audio out of the portable monitor but no video.And of course Customer Service can't help. I'll try calling again tomorrow. Maybe I can change this review later.(Update after Maxfree customer Service reached out and were VERY GOOD)Wow. Kay. So I'm now fully impressed. After my review went online and my issues with contacting cust. svc they reached out personally regarding my F1 Product. We went back and forth to troubleshoot. All the while the first thing promised was if we weren't able to fix the problem they would offer a full refund. They even offered a 50% refund if they COULD get it working for the initial inconvenience. This is truly representative of Maxfree caring about it's customers. I'd like to thank them for reaching out and it seems that my experience with the hardware makes me very much an outlier. Looks like the majority of customers have great hardware so chalk this up to bad luck.Basically the product was a 1* (cause it didn't work) but the Customer service was a 5/5*. Andy was incredible. I averaged that to 3*.As I'm still in the market for a portable screen and will look at maxfree again for sure based on the customer service alone!So they did fully refund me and didn't force me to return the F1 screen. I'm gonna keep on working with Maxfree to see I can get it working properly anyways but the refund goes a long way to my customer satisfaction.Feel free to buy Maxfree knowing that if you're just an unlucky customer like me they'll be willing to work with you to keep you happy.Great Post-Purchase experience.",
