                "reviewText": "I've been using this monitor for a month now and I'm really happy with it. The picture quality is excellent, with vivid colors and sharp images. What I like most is that it has a feature that allows me to connect both my Macbook and PC at the same time, using a USB-C cable for the MacBook and a display port for the PC. It also has a KVM switch built in, which means I can use the same keyboard, mouse and headphones for both computers without needing an external switch.For Mac users, I recommend installing BetterDisplay to improve the text quality as the MacBook's PPI is higher compared to the monitor. It's a free download, so no need to worry about any extra costs.The only thing I wish they had was this monitor in black, but overall, I don't have any other complaints. It's a great monitor that I'd recommend to anyone.",
