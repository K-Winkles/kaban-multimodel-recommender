                "reviewText": "I recently acquired a 24-inch monitor, and it has significantly improved my computing experience. The display offers crisp, vibrant colors, making it perfect for both work and entertainment. With full HD resolution, the image quality is sharp, providing an immersive experience whether I\u2019m editing documents, watching videos, or gaming.The monitor\u2019s slim design is sleek and modern, easily fitting into my workspace. The adjustable stand is a great feature, allowing me to find the perfect viewing angle. Additionally, the monitor boasts eye comfort technology, which reduces eye strain during long hours of use.In terms of connectivity, the monitor has multiple ports including HDMI and VGA, making it versatile for various setups. The response time is quick, eliminating any lag or ghosting, which is particularly noticeable when playing fast-paced games.One minor downside is the built-in speakers. While convenient, they don\u2019t offer the best sound quality, but this is easily remedied with external speakers or headphones.Overall, this 24-inch monitor offers great value. Its combination of excellent display quality, ergonomic design, and reasonable price makes it a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their visual experience.",

I have it mounted on a Huanuo dual mounting bracket on my desk. I use the monitor vertically. I do a lot of reading off this monitor while working on the other. It's light. It was super simple to mount.",

                "reviewText": "I grabbed this monitor for my father a couple of months ago when I bought him a new NUC style PC. He was still using a 4:3 aspect ratio, 22\u2019ish inch monitor. The difference between that monitor and this one is night and day.The little PC box I got him mounted to the VESA mount of the monitor, so that was convenient. I didn\u2019t even check if this had mounting capability when I purchased it. An affordable 1080p monitor with a VESA mount was just what I needed.I personally use two Dell 27\u201d 4K monitors with a Mac Studio at home. My father doesn\u2019t need anywhere near that kind of capability. The 1080p monitor (at 200 or 250% magnification in Windows) was perfect for him. I wouldn\u2019t use this for hardcore gaming due to the refresh rate, but I am sure it could get by with older games or emulators. That said, it was perfect for my father\u2019s needs.",

They are for my Ham radio shack and are going on a 4 arm stand in the shack to display information in the shack and they are replacing to ASUS monitors that were old and had failed. One surprise was that they are 12V which is great in a Ham Shack. One monitor arrived with out the Power supply. After talking with Amazon and finding my only option was to send it back. I called MSI. It took a bit to get the right person but everyone I talked with at MSI worked to get me to the right person. Once contacted, I received an e-mail to obtain the reciept which was easily obtained from my Amazon order page. With this information, MSI, within a couple of days, sent me the missing power supply. They were great to work with. Highly recommend these monitors and if you do have issues, they will stand behind them.",
