None the less, these seem to be well made and work flawlessly. I can't immagine they be real great for gaming but for many other uses they seem to work well. I now own three of these and I find uses for them all the time.Examples:I have a headless server and rather than RDP, KVM, or a full screen and keyboard to debug, I just have a wireless keyboard dongle and HDMI cable always in the server. When I need, I just grab one of these little screens and the wireless keyboard and go to work.I also use one of these for a set of Raspberry Pis that are always on. Handy as a test monitor as well. They are kind of rugged for not having a real case around them. Don't push it too far though. I guess what I'm trying to get across is that they aren't really fragile.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Worth it For the Price (Instructions for Setting up With Nvidia GPUs)",
                "reviewText": "This display is good but the stand is not excellent. The monitor itself comes as a bare PCB (powered by micro USB) with no case or anything, the stand is just a plastic V-shaped phone holder designed to hold the screen at varying degrees of tilt. It gets the job done and is somewhat clear IF set up correctly (see below).The displays resolution is 800 by 480, but the driver for the display does not display that, so when plugged in almost everything will detect it as being 800 by 600. This will usually fill in the entire screen area with no black space, BUT you'll see the screen is horizontally stretched quite a bit and somewhat blurry.To fix this, you must be familiar with whatever devices graphics driver you are plugging this screen into and set a custom resolution.For NVIDIA GPU Users:1) Right click the desktop2) Go to change resolution3) Find the monitor labeled \"HETECH\" and click \"Customize\" under Resolution4) Click Create Custom Resolution5) Under Display Mode, set Horizontal Pixels to 800 and Vertical Lines to 4806) Under Timing, set to \"CVT Reduced Blank\"7) Hit Test, then Keep these settings8) Go back under resolutions and choose the top option now which should be your custom resolutionIt should be somewhat similar for AMD GPUs but I do not know the exact steps.For computers that do not have a GPU, you can also set up custom resolutions through Intel Settings or AMD Radeon Graphics settings (both should be accessible by right clicking on the desktop).I can also confirm that this display DOES NOT WORK WITH HULU, NETFLIX, ETC as others have mentioned. Tested this and the screen displayed something akin to TV static, even though I was watching the content on another screen. After closing the tab displaying the content, the screen immediately went back to normal.TL;DRThis monitor does have vibrant enough colors, it is crisp enough, and honestly an excellent value for the price (I purchased two of these for $30 a piece, so hold out for a deal). You just have to know what to expect of the included stand and of setting up custom resolutions correctly in your operating system.",

                "reviewText": "A superb value under 40 dollars. You get the display, micro USB cables, and a reasonable sized hdmi cable in a well organized and protected package... The cable itself is worth a few bucks. The image quality is superb and can serve very well as a media player or secondary display. I use it as a way to view Kodi off a raspberry pi. I ended up 3d printing a clear case as it it is very fragile without one.... Once mounted it looks like an upscale project, that will call attention to itself.... Lots of ohhs and ahhs were heard. The image is clear has adequate brightness and no dead pixels, and great viewing angles. It is not full 1080p HD, but at 7 inches from a few feet away are you really going to tell?.. This is a great addon of makers who want to add a clear display to their project. For a display 7 inch is the largest I would go for portability sake. What I didn't like is that it has no audio passthrough, runs off a micro USB, and without proper care can break very soon... I recommend anyone buy, or fabricate a case for it immediately. Pretty impressed with it's value.",

                "reviewText": "This HMTECH 7 inch HDMI portable monitor is definitely worth the money. The device functions properly, provided the Raspberry PI video output is properly configured. I'm using the monitor for diagnostic purposes. It allows me to interact (in conjunction with keyboard and mouse) with my Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi4) easily and efficiently. I had to get a standard to micro HDMI adapter, set the RP4 video output settings appropriately (forcing/enabling HDMI output to enabled and output level) using a terminal/command line prompt, followed by a reboot of the device, before the monitor would display any video. Although small, the monitor adequately satisfies it's role as a diagnostic and direct input/output troubleshooting and commanding. This monitor really isn't adequate for use with gaming applications; it's way too small for that role. The biggest issue with this monitor is the fact that it is not enclosed. There are exposed electrical components on the back of the monitor, and I'm concerned that these exposed components might pose an electrocution risk or make the monitor too susceptible to inadvertent/incidental damage. The fact of exposed components should be disclosed/evident in the description of the product (it isn't obvious/clearly disclosed). Additionally, the monitor doesn't sit/fit securely into the base of the included stand.",
