The added screen size and features is exactly what I was looking for(they provided all the needed connecting cords and adapters), the resolution of the screen is great, quality is beyond my expectations, with this setup I could work much more efficiently. Would definitely recommend to others who are in a similar situation as my use case.",

Setting it up with my 14'' laptop was a breeze \u2013 just plug and play with HDMI, USB-A, or Type-C. The triple monitor display is fantastic for multitasking, whether I'm working on Windows, Chrome, Mac, or even my Nintendo Switch.
