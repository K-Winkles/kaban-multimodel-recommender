                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great! Perfect add on for a laptop.",
                "reviewText": "Good:- Maximum real estate for productivity on a desk. Easy to snap 2-3 windows to see at once.- Great color, brightness, contrast.- Speakers! Pretty good ones too.- Picture in picture mode. Adds a spot to put a music player or chat over your workspace.- Dual Control functions as a virtual KVM switch.- Easy setup, sturdy stand. Sleek and modern looking.- Good connectivity w/ 2 HDMI, 1 Display, 1 Mic/Phones out.- Nice 3 trim bezels on three sides.- Plays well with a laptop dock.- Able to be vesa mounted.- Options Menus are easy to access and navigate.Bad:- Stand only has tilt. No height or rotate.- No built-in cable management.- Headphone jack is on back, kind of hard to access.- Decent specs for casual gaming. Serious gamers might not be impressed.- Doesn't have the PBP (Picture by Picture) mode for splitting the screen between two computers.- I can't figure out how to get Night Light (blue light reduction) to work on this as a 2nd monitor.Summary: Don't judge the monitor by my crappy phone photos. They don't come close to doing this justice. This is a great monitor.I've only had this monitor for a day but so far I'm in love with it. I was torn between a couple of 24\" or 27\" and this was the perfect solution. The color / brightness / saturation is all great, overkill in some ways. I had to tone the brightness and saturation down a bit to be able to comfortably view windows with a bright background. The FPS color profile setting works best for me. Viewing angles are terrific.The SPEAKERS!! It's been ages since I've had a monitor with built in speakers and although these aren't top of the line three-way they are stereo and quite loud and clear. It won't replace your home stereo with a subwoofer but these are more than good enough quality for casual listening and I consider myself picky in regards to sound quality. It's just so nice not to have to putz with speaker cables, bluetooth connections, yadda yadda. Just turn it on and it works. They are down-firing so if you wanted to get nerdy and put a deflector underneath them you'd get a cleaner, more direct sound. I don't think I'll bother. They're easily 3x better than my laptop speakers.For office - fantastic! So much real estate you can multitask with ease. Keep email, spreadsheets, Spotify, Slack, Zoom, whatever up and running at the same time so you don't have to keep minimizing and missing things. Easily break the screen up into 3-4 parts. Plays nice with my laptop dock. Picture in Picture mode is a game changer, adds even more ways to split up the real estate. The Dual Control function is pretty amazing too. I have my main PC as a laptop, second PC as a Mac and I can easily use Dual Control and switch between them, same keyboard, same mouse. All I have to do is change the input to HDMI 2 and hit CTRL, Rt Arrow to use the mouse and keyboard on the Mac. Can even copy files up to 2gb from PC to Mac without messing with shares or network permissions. Too Easy.For gaming - eh you'll get what you pay for with this one. It's an IPS panel so great color but not the fastest response times and it only goes up to 75mhz so won't win any refresh races. It would be fun for casual gaming. Beware that some games won't operate full screen widescreen and you may get black bars on the sides. For those that do widescreen though - fun!For photo editing - this is a dream. It's high enough res to see plenty of detail and you get tons of real estate for menus, toolbars, etc. Color reproduction is fantastic. Super easy to see side-by-sides for color matching. No messing around trying to get two monitors calibrated to look the same. It is only an 8bit display so not super-duper pro quality but definitely 16 million colors will be enough for most uses.So far the good heavily outweigh the bad - the bad are not really bad just meh. If you're looking for a way to maximize your screen real estate and don't want to break the bank this is a great option.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I love this monitor!",
                "reviewText": "This 1080p UltraWide has outstanding picture quality and color reproduction. HDR10 really makes a difference for me with this monitor too. Many games just pop with HDR on and graphic setting tuned to tastes. This monitor sits at the ideal price point of getting the best you can get at 1080p minus the ultra high refresh rate of dedicated gaming monitors.The only problem is now that I have gone ultra wide my next monitor purchase (hopefully well into the future) will have to be a 1440 or 4k at Ultra wide . Yup hopefully this will be years away when/if they come down to a reasonable price. The extra screen real estate of Ultra Wide made a lot of difference for me in my 3D productivity applications. It was a bit scary how quickly I became used to this wider form factor after so many years of using 1080p standard format monitors.Games are so much more enveloping for me with the wide screen as they now almost fill my entire field of view. As a real world diver playing Subnautica on this monitor I sometimes felt myself breathing through my mouth expecting to feel the bubble rising. The experience was that immersive!What amazed me was how many older games support this resolution! I have to thank a YouTube reviewer who pointed this out as it was a big worry for me. Fallout 4 gave me a bit of an issue as it wouldn't even play in 1080p...saying my video card a 40 series wasn't supported. This may have been a video card related issue more than a monitor/resolution issue but I didn't feel like switching monitors to test on my standard 1080p. However a quick check in the NVidia control panel showed a problem with the game and a fix button and once I clicked it I was back in Fallout at full wide screen glory. Interestingly there was no driver update or any change to any settings that I hadn't tried manually since I fought with the manual setting for an hour or so trying to get it to work before I thought to look at the NVidia control panel. There must have been some esoteric setting I missed somewhere.The pixel pitch on this monitor is almost the same as a sub 27 Inch 1080p monitor. This means you loose NOTHING for the added screen real estate. You can go right up to the monitor at a usable distance and you will not notice pixelation etc. Freesynch works on the Displayport cable which is what I am using to connect to the monitor.A fine note to graphic connoisseurs such as myself. I don't necessarily want to play a game at 100+ fps. I want to play a game that looks the best it cam look at 60fps, ideally with the same 0.1% and 1% lows and I am fine with that. This monitor can refresh at 100Hz so \"true\" 100fps gaming with the right system is easy as pie. However graphic quality is always my first choice when purchasing a monitor. This monitor doesn't disappoint in that regard. Older game titles (1080p max titles usually) tended to use scaling tricks to upscale 1080p to 1080p wide...those extra ~ 600 x 1080 pixels is small as image scaling goes and not noticeable from a standard 1080p image. There is no distortion if the game support the wide screen format. HOWEVER if you are playing a game that uses higher resolution textures (newer games) the game engine sometimes down samples 1440p or even 4k textures to use that extra real estate and the effects are immediately noticeable as a much more pleasing experience! A prime example is Subnautica in my configuration.The graphics hijinx described above is tied to graphic settings used by the developers during game development, optimizations they have implemented, hardware capabilities, driver capabilities and the engine used so don't expect the bonus graphic bump in all games. However when it does occur I am grateful for it. If you have ever uniformally scaled down an image in a graphics program and appreciated the enhanced detail and quality you will better understand the bonus graphic boost that is possible with these monitors.As a developer myself I am anxious to experiment with this feature on my own titles and see if I can replicate these effects in a game/simulation setting. A final note, you will need a tiny bit more horsepower to push those extra pixels rather than standard 1080p. The difference is probably around 5%. With modern hardware and optimizations this difference will probably be lost in the noise.",

The monitor is easy to set up and has built-in speakers with MaxxAudio, which sound great for movies and games. The monitor also supports FreeSync, which eliminates screen tearing and stuttering. The ultra wide aspect ratio is perfect for multitasking, as I can have multiple windows open at the same time without losing any detail. The monitor also has a sleek design and a white color that matches my desk. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a high-quality, affordable and versatile ultra wide monitor.",

                "reviewText": "I bought LG Ultrawide monitor. Day before yesterday it came along with a stand. I opened this and connected to Satechi HDMI port. Turned my Macbook Pro on and monitor is showing no signal. Yesterday I went and bought another HDMI cable to check if it is wrong with cable but didnt help. Macbook Pro has detected the monitor and it shows LG Ultrawide in Displays, but monitor does not detect laptop. I bought this with so much expectation. Then I ordered for HDMI to USB connector and directly connected to Macbook Pro and yes it is working. Iam so happy to see it. Really effective. It is good if you have more tabs and windows. For me I used to have a lot of tabs and windows and I used to manage it with a bit difficulty. Now I have the best monitor and it is economical compared to other monitors.",
