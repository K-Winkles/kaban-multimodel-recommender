                "reviewText": "we really really wanted to love this monitor and if all you did was connect a streamer to it and turn it into a smart TV (HD version of Chromecast w Google TV is nice as it \"upgrades\" your monitor w a remote for power & volume!) - you're likely to do just fine!The first quality issue was just attaching the stand to the panel. it's metal (which is good) but it nearly sliced my thumb open trying to push it in (thankfully my thumb only got an internal blood clot & the doctor said it is fine). Even though it didn't go all the way in, it was snug enough that we decided to use it anyways.The next annoyance are the controls - I can't blame Sansui but after spending 20 more bucks on an LG, OMG - a joystick control is infinitely more intuitive (even better than a Samsung rubber crosspad one) - this was worth the price of admission by itself. Now to be fair, because this unit was intended to set it once and leave it - we didn't think it mattered and at the end of the day, it's nice to know you can adjust the color without this internal resistance to battling the menus.The unit does have speakers. We learned the hard way that manufacturers (even good ones like Dell) cut corners & don't include any decent speakers of value (they figure you're likely to connect external speakers so it's a probability game) - so why include them at all? why not put the money towards a better screen (or better menu UI!) so that's exactly what we did with the LG I mentioned above - no speakers - all the quality goes into the screen & menu interface & overall polish of the exterior. A $10 BT speaker w AUX in sounds better (I'm not exaggerating - this is what we got though I'd recommend budgeting $20-30 if you want more fullness in sound)I was impressed it came with *both* a USB-C and HDMI cables - while we didn't need them, we knew they were worth 15 bucks or so (so factor this in)They use a power brick on this monitor - which is easy to just leave on the floor (contrast this to a HUGE LG 3-prong adapter that is expected to plug into the wall!) - so this was a plus for the Sansui.The VA panel is bright. the contrast & brightness were only at 50% & it looked just as bright as the LG we got at 80%. SANSUI claims it has a 3000:1 ratio. I dunno if it's really this high but it's high (and VA panels are known for this over IPS)This is basically the cheapest USB-C monitor you can get - I'd say good bang for the buck. you'll get power delivery (PD) to a device like an iPadPro w USB-C.Unfortunately, we've been spoiled by Apple Retina displays so 4k monitors are the only way to go for us & we need to spend the extra money - it's impossible to go back. We would only use this screen as a TV viewed from at least 10 feet away - it is personal preference as to whether 1080p is good enough for you as a desktop monitor!",

I am happy with this monitor however, my main complaint isn't with this brand or model, but more holistic. When running a large 27\" monitor that is only 1080p, the text will suffer when sitting close to it as a computer monitor. I'd assume if using as a TV and sitting farther away, it wouldn't be as noticeable. For the price, it is great but my next monitor at this size will be 4k. I give full stars because monitor is exactly as described, and it is my fault for not buying a 4k monitor at twice the price.",
