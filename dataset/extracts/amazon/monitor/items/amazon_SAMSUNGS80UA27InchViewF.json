I don't understand how the Samsung brand would sell such displays.I\u2019m using the USB-C for both data and power. But the monitor randomly turns off and on while not in use, and in doing so it somehow pulls so much power through the USB that my Mac\u2019s short circuit protection kicks in with a warning saying that the USB accessory is disabled due to high power usage. The monitor was supposed to provide power over USB, so I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s doing and if it damaged my Mac.",
