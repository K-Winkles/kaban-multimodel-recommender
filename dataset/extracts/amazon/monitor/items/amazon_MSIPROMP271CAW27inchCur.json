First of all, im bad at math and I\u2019ve been lied to many times before in my life so I thought this was going to be the a normal sized computer monitor. I was wrong.This thing is HUGE and its is so beautiful and sleek. Assembly was so easy. I have also noticed a difference in my eyes while using this screen, normally my eyes get buggy and hurt after too long staring at a screen but i don\u2019t have that problem with this monitor.The only draw back is the speakers on it aren\u2019t great but I know most people are buying separate speakers. I have a JBL that i connect using bluetooth and that solved the problem.Overall I LOVE it and would buy it again (and i might just to have dual screens)",
