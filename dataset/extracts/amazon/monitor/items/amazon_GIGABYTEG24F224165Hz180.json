                "reviewText": "I'm not going to go in-depth as there are already 'professional' reviews out there that one can go and read if they want full coverage. Some info:Screen / Display quality: It's great, I got no dead pixels as far as I can tell and the backlight bleed for me isn't bad at all. The picture quality for this price range is probably among the best if not the best out of the box. I don't think I've had to tweak any of the display settings other than brightness because of how good it looks as is. It's plenty bright to use on sunny days by the way, and this coming from a Californian.Gaming: Of course it won't compete with good 200hz+ and 300+ hz monitors but it doesn't need to. For being able to find this monitor as cheap as $130 when it goes on sale, it blows everything out of the water that it's supposed to compete with. Do not use Aim Stabilizer or Super Resolution and set OD to either Smart OD or Picture Quality for the best anti-ghosting, Balance will start to introduce notable ghosting but it's nothing terrible.Features: I haven't used the OSD sidekick software because I figured out which settings I wanted to use early on and the hardware controller was more than good enough to use for that. It has everything you *need* in a gaming monitor (and more than most in this price range too). All the ports are easily accessible and I didn't know this at first but the stand has an opening that is supposed to help with cable management.Build Quality: I suppose this is more for the stand than the display but it's good. It doesn't wobble and doesn't feel particularly cheap. It's nice that it's height adjustable and it tilts, however it cannot be used vertically for anyone that wants it setup that way.So yeah, an unbeatable monitor for $130 and still a great deal for $160.",

                "reviewText": "First things first, this is an amazing monitor for the prize I bought it for. I've never experienced a refresh rate over 75hz on a monitor, so that was amazing itself and I def can NOT go back to 75hz or god forbid 60hz.EDIT: The monitor has lines all over the screen now. I can\u2019t see anything. Will never buy a Gigabyte monitor again. This thing didn\u2019t even last a year before it failed.The colors are great, brightness is great, overall it's much superior to my Dell SE2717 which is also 1080p IPS but the refresh rate is 75hz, and that I've had since 2018. That (Dell) monitor is now my secondary monitor.Now the one problem that is making me rate this 4 outta 5 stars. I have 1 single stuck pixel. After analyzing the screen up close, I found it, and for me it's in an unfortunate place, almost in the middle of the screen. Once I found it, I could not stop noticing it and thinking about it.Thing is, being from outside mainland U.S., this monitor took almost a month to arrive. I am not gonna return and ask for a replacement just to wait AGAIN for another 3 weeks for a new monitor to arrive. I'm just gonna have to deal with that one stuck pixel *sigh* it's not really that big of a deal but mildly infuriating.After much research, apparently stuck pixels will go away on their own after some time has passed, so I guess I'll just wait it out.",

This is the best monitor I\u2019ve owned\u2026 the picture, colours, and image quality is the best I\u2019ve seen and I have other $300-$600 monitors. Congrats Gigabyte on packing a punch in this one. You\u2019ve earned a new customer moving forward.",

I love that I can plug my speakers into the monitor and it's one less thing to switch from one setup to the other. Definitely worth a closer look if you are looking for a display upgrade.",
