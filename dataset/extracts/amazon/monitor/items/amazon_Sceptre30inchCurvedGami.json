                "reviewText": "I got this monitor because my desk space wouldn't properly fit two 1080p 24\" monitors, and it's easier to stay focused when everything is all on one screen. I was surprised and skeptical when I found this monitor because it's a 30\" ultrawide with good reviews, but a lesser known brand. I had a Sceptre monitor back in the CRT display era, so I decided to give it a shot, since the monitor I had back then worked perfectly fine throughout its use.Pros:- Surprisingly bright, I had to turn it down to 50% for white background windows/browser pages.- Very clear for colors and detail, it seems noticeably better than the monitors I had previously. I can't speak to professional color schemes, since I primarily use it for programming work and gaming.- Buttery smooth. I didn't think I would notice much difference between 144hz and 200hz, but it does seem even smoother. Competitive games like CS:GO will definitely show a difference.- PIP and PBP capability, which is fantastic for when I actually need two monitors. I can use the same source (main PC HDMI and DP) for both monitors also.- 4 ports allows me to have two setups with dual monitors, one for work laptop and one for main PC.- Supports standard 1920x1080p resolution, although the desktop will stretch and games/applications might have the \"black bar\" effect, which doesn't really bother me much.- 1 DP and 3 HDMI (the DP can support up to 200hz, HDMI 1 can support up to 165hz, and HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 can support up to 85hz)- OSD is extremely intuitive, and the buttons at the bottom make sense. I didn't even need the manual.- Costs the same as two budget 24\" 1080p monitors.- I appreciate the blue light reduction settings, makes it easy on the eyes.- Has speakers and doesn't require headphones to use them. They have pretty decent quality for a monitor.- The screen is about as tall as a standard 1080p 24\" monitor (which is what I'm used to), the screen size itself is 27.8\"W x 16.1\"H (30\" diagonally)Cons:- PBP for dual monitors stretches the displays to fit, making both look compressed, kind of annoying but not much can be done without changing both desktop resolutions. PIP mode can work well for fixing this too if you don't mind sacrificing part of your main screen.- \"Black bar\" effect on applications that don't support 2560x1080p, expected with an ultrawide monitor though.- The stand that comes with it is kind of short, raising the screen maybe 6\" above the desk. Tilt works to fix this a bit.- Backlight is dim and only glows red, but it can be turned off.- FreeSync works, but I've had some trouble getting it to work properly (never had much luck with FreeSync anything though).I will update if I encounter any problems, but I'm very impressed so far.Updates after a few days of use:- The monitor is VESA mountable with an included bracket (75x75 pattern) designed to go on the back of the monitor (in place of the stand). The monitor is about 12.15lbs, fairly light for a monitor of this size, so it should fit most VESA mounts. If you have a VESA mount larger than 100x100, you might want to consider using longer screws and standoffs, since there is a small overhang on the back of the monitor that might block larger VESA mounts from laying flush when screwing into the included bracket.- Some of my previous monitors had about 1ms response time, and this monitor has 5ms response time. I don't think it is hugely noticeable, but in fast paced competitive games, you might see mild ghosting if you're used to faster response times. Like most curved monitors, it's a VA panel, so the slower response times are somewhat expected.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant to buy this monitor (a few weeks, to be exact) due to the \"too good to be true\" price, but the mostly positive reviews and better overall feedback compared to similar monitors forced me to give in and tap that Place Order button.I must say, it fit my needs like a glove. No dead pixels or defects, and the brightness levels (which many have mentioned as being too low) worked well with the low brightness levels of the room it now occupies. The screen itself has a matte finish which is great for reducing/eliminating unwanted reflections. The stand feels sturdy; however, as others have mentioned, it does not have height adjustment. This is not a big problem for me, as the height and position of both the desk and chair allow for a nearly perfect ergonomic position for me (experiences may vary, consider yourself warned). Also, the speakers aren't very good, but if you use a headset like me or plan on using a separate speaker system, this won't be a problem.The colors seem ok to me, and backlight bleed during pitch black moments is minimal. As someone who's never used an IPS or TN monitor, and only owned a TV or a laptop since the days of CRT monitors and processing speeds being measured in MHz instead of GHz, this is a major upgrade for me. My graphics card is a EVGA GTX 1660 Ti SC Ultra, and it seems to pair up nicely with this monitor. Just remember, you have to manually activate FreeSync from the menu (which only took a minute to get used to), and it works fine with Nvidia G-Sync. No tearing, ghosting, or artifacts that I can see. I have my display output settings on my PC set to 144Hz. I may bump it up to 200 and see how it goes, though according to most people they don't notice much of a difference between 144 and 200 on any monitor. However, it is nice to have the option if I want it.Overall this monitor gives me everything I need, and a few things I don't need but really wanted. If you have a GTX 1060, 1660, or 2060 graphics card and want to jump into an ultrawide monitor, the 30\" screen size and 2560x1080 resolution create the perfect Goldilocks zone where pixel density and immersion sing in harmony without having to push the graphics card beyond its limits (there is a 3440x1440 version of this monitor--the C35, I think--but you'll probably want a 1070, 1070 Ti, or 2070 for that resolution). At a sub-$300 price point, I don't think you can get a better curved ultrawide monitor than this one.",
