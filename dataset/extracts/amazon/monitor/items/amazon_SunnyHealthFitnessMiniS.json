                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent little stepper for the price point",
                "reviewText": "This stepper is exactly what I wanted--a small machine with simple mechanics at a value price. It fits under my bed for easy storage and weighs about 15 pounds, so it's easy to move around. It has a simple counter that keeps track of your steps (and has a few other modes, like calories, etc. but nothing too in depth). It came preassembled, and the only assembly you have to do is make sure the pulley line is on the wheel underneath the machine, then tighten the tension knob to the desired resistance (which is easy to adjust anytime you want to change it) and attaching the arm resistance bands to the frame.In reference to some common questions/complaints I've seen, here is an FYI about the this machine.1. It is a STEPPER, not an elliptical--meaning you step up and down, not glide back and forth.2. It does require you to maintain your own balance while using it (unlike an elliptical). It is actually better for your muscle tone and core muscles to keep your own balance while exercising. However, if you have a medical issue that impairs your balance, this might not be a good machine for you.3. You MUST use it standing up. Because you put your full weight on the pedals to pump them up and down, this machine would not work for someone sitting at a desk or in a chair.4. The arm resistance bands are optional and do not effect the function of the stepper pedals. They are mounted to the frame of the machine and the length is adjustable. They are simple rubber type stretchy resistance bands, similar to bungee cords.5. The step counter has been accurate for me, but I consider the other modes (calories, etc.) to be estimates. If you need more in depth exercise tracking, I would suggest a personal device (Fitbit, etc.) or looking for another machine at a higher price point to include the bells and whistles.6. There is no way to adjust the incline of the pedals, or increase the step height (how far up and down the pedals go) beyond the 8\" or so in the machines range of motion. Again, if this is important, you should probably look at a higher price point. Personally I find the incline and step height works well for me.7. The machine seems durable to me, and I use it about 5x a week, for 20-30 minutes. If you work out much more than that, you may want to invest in a more expensive, bigger machine.8. The weight limit for the machine is 220 lb, per the instruction manual.9. The instruction manual is well written and clear instructions are given for assembly and maintenance. Instructions are given for parts to oil if the machine begins to squeak.10. The machine is very quiet. You do hear air pushing from the cylinders as you step up and down, but it's not loud. I use the machine while my baby naps with no problem.11. The pedals are 11 1/4\" long from inside the toe guard to the edge of the pedal. I wear women's size 9 and have plenty of room.12. Despite its simple design, this machine does give you quite a work out (similar to climbing stairs). It's definitely cardiovascular exercise, and you definitely feel it in your calves, thighs and gluts. Maintaining balance also gives my core muscles a work out, and you can use the arm bands too if you want. Like any exercise, it depends on the amount of effort you put in.I would highly recommend this stepper for anyone like myself, who wants an affordable machine with a small footprint to get some easy exercise at home. I'm a 30-something mother with small children, so going to the gym isn't convenient for me. I'm not a fitness guru, my goals are to get more cardio and shed a few pounds. For around $50, you can't beat the price for the amount of exercise you can get from this little stepper.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Convenient Fitness Gear!",
                "reviewText": "So, getting older in life, and still have a very sedentary desk job and the effects are starting to show on my health. Not good! So, a bit of research has told me that getting active in any form adds up over the day, and, while I started clocking myself to get up and move around throughout the day, I wanted to do more than just do a few stretches. Began looking online for options, and found this gem!I now have it in my office, and, I also purchased a Garmin Vivofit 4, to keep track of my steps and activity throughout my days, to get a sense of how much I'm doing, or not doing, and when I need to be more active to reach my goals. This handy stair stepper is exactly what I wanted -- something small that easily fits in my office space, that is rigorous enough to get my heart pumping, but not so extreme that I need to take a shower afterwards or swap out my work attire for gym clothes.This is most basic -- two pedals, and a cord that goes around a tension wheel, just stand on it, and start stepping. Also has two light resistance fitness bands, so you can work out your arms in any way you choose. I was so out of shape that I had to back off the tension entirely, and just stepping while using the bands, for half a minute got me breathing hard! Sad, I know! It does have a little computer on it that keeps track of things, but, since it is rather limited and is down on the floor with the stepper, and not really so practical, I just use my fitness tracker to show my progress during use.Happy to say I have started dieting as well, plus using my Bowflex at home for something other than a clothes rack, and, with this device at work, I've already lost a few pounds in just a few weeks, so life is going in a better direction! And, already have ratcheted up the tension setting, from when I started, so I'm getting in slightly better shape already, after just a few weeks. Small gains, but good gains.With the amount of time I work, and the amount of work I need to get through, I really needed something I could fit into my existing life, and that's what I love about this. I don't have the time or funds to go get a gym membership or suddenly take up running or biking or something, so I needed a machine that I could integrate into my current schedule, and this is it!My Vivofit 4 has an activity alarm, so, when I've been at the desk too long, my wrist device beeps at me, and I get up, get on my stepper, and start stepping, doing my first half with the resistance bands, and then the next half without, since I'm still too out of shape to do justice to this device, but I take it as a good sign that it gets my heart pumping and my legs get a good burn. In other words, it is an effective little workout machine. When I've been active long enough, my Vivofit beeps again, telling me I've been a good boy and burned some calories, and I see my step count for the day has risen, and so I can go back to work again.While my sad state of fitness was shocking, in how quickly I was winded, the good news is that, a few weeks into use, my times on it are getting longer, so it is definitely building endurance, and, while I am not managing to also take a needed walk around my neighborhood every day after work, I find that, when I do, my uphill stints are already becoming easier. So, in other words, I'm seeing progress!To me, many fitness endeavors fail because they are not maintained -- often because the goal just does not fit into reality. This stepper, however, is easy to use, easy to remember to use, stares at me every day, gives me a sense of progress and is making me feel better, so it is a fitness tool that works for me, which means I will use it. The best fitness regime on earth is useless, after all, if we are not doing it. I needed something I could use, every day, starting small and working forward. I've even scaled back my Bowflex goals to, again, be realistic in what I will do, rather than make great plans about what I wind up not doing, so this has helped me to just get on a better track, overall, in terms of my health.This seems well built, and I have no reason to think it won't last. And, at fifty bucks, even if it broke down in a year, I'd buy another. Very affordable versus the cost of poor health!If, like me, it's hard to work a grand fitness scheme into your life, or you're just getting started on a fitness plan, I think this is an ideal tool. I look forward to the day when I can step for much longer periods than a few minutes at a time, but the great thing is that, over the course of a day, this is helping me build some real health betterment into my life.The most recent studies are showing that periodic fitness adds up to being as effective as dedicated periods of exercise, so this really is a terrific answer for me. Life is not interrupted, and my health is being addressed, which has given me a routine I like, and that I can maintain. Plus, with seeing real progress in losing weight, no, it's not an overnight sensation, but, again, over time, I am getting healthier, and a few pounds every few weeks adds up over time, to the goal of getting off these extra twenty pounds that are loading me down and impacting my health.For me, this is literally a life saver!Very thankful for this purchase. Highly recommend!",

Unless I missed something, there is only one type of tension.",
