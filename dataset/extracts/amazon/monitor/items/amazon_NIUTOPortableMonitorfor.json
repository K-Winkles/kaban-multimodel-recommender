                "reviewText": "This monitor does everything that they say it does.The image is extremely sharp with multiple adjustments to suit your needs. It is very sleek and well designed with multiple input options and speakers that actually sound good - not tinny.Setup if very easy and simple. I have the monitor connected with a USB-C cable that came with the monitor to my laptop, which is used to power the monitor. It is a great value for the money and rugged enough to withstand a home office environment for a full week at a time.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the monitor for use as an external display with an amateur radio. I have discovered that the USB-C adapter which came with the monitor was generation a large amount of RFI. I don't know if the adapter became defective after some time but I just want buyers to be aware of this possible issue. The monitor itself works wonderfully as the external display.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- \u201cIt just works\u201d for everything I\u2019ve plugged it into- Perfect size for 1080P- very lightweight- just one cable for 90% of my use cases- Built-in speaker- Elegant and soft case- one of the cheapest options for fully portable monitors (that are higher than 720P)- analog headphone jack- decent viewing angles- included all needed cables AND cables were of decent length and quality- If you ignore the glare and low brightness the screen is crisp and clear with no noticeable dead pixels or \u201cbad spots\u201dCons:- The screen seems to attract more glare and fingerprints than any monitor i\u2019ve had in years- Brightness isn\u2019t high enough to compensate for the heavy-glare- Low brightness in general makes it less usable in sunny/fluorescently lit places- The included stand fell apart after the 3rd use so I have a rubber band keeping it together now (seems to be holding)- speaker volume is VERY low (so I end up using bluetooth or the headphone jack)- the included case is great for protecting the screen itself with cables but the stand causes it to be overly bulky in my bag- included stand seems like an afterthought compared with the rest of my he unit- It is so lightweight it feels like I could easily damage the unitOther observations:For $80 I don\u2019t feel like this was a bad purchase - but just be aware that you will \u201cfeel\u201d the cheapness due to the terrible screen glare and very low brightness. If you use it in a dark corner of a coffee shop or somewhere at night while traveling then you won\u2019t have any issues.Tested with a Nintendo Switch, Onn Google TV Streaming Box, Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, and Dell Latitude 5440 and had no issues with any of these devices.The little plastic stand is pretty bad and I will probably need to find another way to prop it up eventually - would have preferred a built in kickstand of some sort.Lastly - This screen would have been so much more usable had they went with a matte display instead of this glossy super-glare screen. The meh brightness wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue either had they went with a matte screen.",

The package arrived within 3 days and the packaging was great. The monitor was well protected in the original box and Amazon box. This is perfect for watching TV shows, gaming, reading, and traveling. I only wish it came in a bigger size. It is pretty lightweight and easy to set up. If you need a monitor, this will probably do.",
