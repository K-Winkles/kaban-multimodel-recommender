                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this portable monitor for my home office and I am extremely impressed with its performance and versatility. The monitor is sleek and lightweight, making it easy to take with me on the go. I can simply fold it up and toss it in my bag when I need to work from a coffee shop or a friend's house.The picture quality is fantastic, with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. I can easily connect it to my laptop via HDMI and get to work right away. The monitor also has built-in speakers, which is a great feature for when I need to watch a video or give a presentation.One of the things I appreciate most about this portable monitor is its multi-functionality. It can be used as a second screen for my laptop, a gaming monitor, or even as a TV. I can connect it to my gaming console and enjoy a larger screen for my games, or I can connect it to my streaming device and watch my favorite shows on a bigger screen.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of this portable monitor. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of picture quality, versatility, and portability. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a portable monitor for work or entertainment.",

It hooks up easily and works as advertised. This means I'm more productive in front of a screen when traveling as I'm not limited in what I can do. It already went on a few trips with me and it has made such a great difference in the time it took me to complete tasks.The colors are great, and the screen stays propped up without issues.",

                "reviewText": "Very compact and almost the size of my laptop screen. I do a lot of writing in my current classes and having a second screen for my sources to read as I write it helps a lot. I like that it only takes on cable to make it work, usb C, and the cover that it has bends and turns into a stand. It is bright and with a good resolution but I wish It can save the brightness setting once turned off. It even has speakers that have a decent volume but I prefer the ones on my laptop. It's pretty thin and fits in my laptop case but I don't take it to go often. It came with a few other type of connections for laptops and PCs that do not have a USB C, but with other type of connection, hdmi for example, it also need to be connected to a power cable. USB C makes is easier, and the cable included is quite long. I didn't notice no delays in response time or any other connection difficulties so far and it has improved the productivity of the time I use for my school work.",

You are better off using your laptop speakers, and or setup a bluetooth speaker to get quality sound. The speakers were one of the reasons why I got this specific monitor but they are not what I expected.The rest of the features are great. It even comes with a plug in for headphones.

Just plug and play- It\u2019s big enough for an extra screen and small enough for me to carry outdoor.- I like that it has speakers- The screen color is OK- AffordableCons:- The screen color is a bit faded- Speakers are too low even on it\u2019s max setting (Which is fine as I don\u2019t expect myself to use that feature often)",
