                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of these to work side by side, and they work as advertised. The screens fold down to make it easier to draw or write items. The response on these is exactly what you hope it would be. These are not as \"fine\" as my surface laptop screen when I draw - these do not have that same preciseness that I have on my Surface and Lenovo Thinkpad. These ViewSonics are good for touch buttons and some rougher drawing (draw larger boxes in OneNote, etc...).I chose Viewsonic TD2455 over the Dell and the Lenovo monitorss because the Viewsonic came with the pens to draw on the screen (you can find these easily on Amazon), and these also came with all the cables necessary to connect (Display Port and USB cables). Additionally, these monitors support daisy chaining the Display Port cables (helps a bit in the cable management category). These monitors also have USB ports on the left side of each monitor, which is helpful if you need to charge something or connect something quickly.If you have 2 of these, you have to tell Windows 11 which monitor is which for the touchscreen, so that the touch applies to the right monitor. Control Panel (view by category) --> Hardware and Sound --> Tablet PC Settings --> Setup. That took me a while to figure out.Additionally, there is a Calibrate color section, and another calibrate for where edges of the screen are located. I did not find it necessary but did these at the behest of Tech Support. What I learned is that these came configured well, right out of the box. In windows 11, the calibrate is not where the tech support people were telling me it is. It was actually in Control Panel (view by category) --> Hardware & Sound --> Tablet PC Settings --> Calibrate (select the correct monitor).As a big note: I was going to send these monitors back after 1 day because the touchscreens were only enabled ~50% of the time after booting up. I had to unplug and replug in the display to get the touchscreen to work after each bootup. This happened on both touchscreens, so it was not a screen or cable issue. After a month of emailing with US Tech Support people we found the solution is to use the older USB 2.0 ports, and not the newer USB 3.2 ports. After switching both monitors to USB to USB 2.0 ports, the touchscreens work 100% of the time. This is on a brand new Dell XPS 8950. Also to note is most of the 1-month delay was me not being at the monitor each day to try out the scenarios - mostly due to my own delays and not ViewSonic tech support.All in all, this is working just as we hoped and glad we purchased this!Now, I am going to tap the [submit] button using the touchscreen :)",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I bought a quality level and discovered the monitor IS level. Surrounding items caused a visual illusion of tilt. So, I'll update my grade for this monitor from B+ to A-. I'm still not happy with no pivot capability and may return this. Pivot is a good feature. But this is still an excellent monitor.-----This is an excellent monitor. My go-to has been ASUS for years, however, I am not satisfied with what they have to offer recently. I wanted a touch screen and struggled to find one that can be used like a standard monitor and not just like a tablet. Color and image quality on the ViewSonic is excellent without having to make any adjustments. And that is rare.There is one issue though. These new style stands. Yes, I understand the value of tilt and lying flat, as this is a touch screen. However, what I've noticed is this type of stand (none of them that I have looked at) can pivot. At least 10 degrees of pivot left and right would be useful. Why? Not every surface is level, and pivot can be useful for leveling and not just for turning the screen to the vertical position. This stand and others like it cannot pivot. Swivel and tilt, yes. But no ability to adjust left-right leveling. I ran into an annoying issue where the monitor appeared to be leaning to the right. Less than one degree, though this is noticeable if you are picky about having your monitors level like I am. I've had difficulty determining whether the issue is the monitor, my desk, or the floor. I bought a roll of 1/16-inch rubber shim and cut one piece to put under the front right foot of the monitor, and two pieces (stacked) under the back right foot. I think it is level now. However, this would not even be an issue if it could tilt left and right. This is a design oversight with these types of monitors. And it is one thing that ASUS definitely gets right that I have appreciated: ability to swivel, tilt, pivot 90 degrees, and ample vertical adjustment. Speaking of vertical adjustment, this relies on the V-shaped arm, and as a result there is not much vertical adjustment. I am using the ViewSonic as my main monitor in between two ASUS monitors to the left and right. Both are on monitor stands. With that arrangement I've been able to get maximum vertical adjustment. However, I had to purchase a new stand for the ViewSonic that allows more vertical adjustment than the other two stands. I needed to raise the monitor 3.75 inches vertically to level it with my other monitors. I am satisfied with that arrangement.However, the lack of pivot is still a consideration. I'll give it a chance and see. But I may return this for a monitor that can pivot. It is not easy to find a touch screen monitor that also pivots. It seems that touch screen computer monitors may be less common now. I know Apple used to to make a desktop touch screen but discontinued it. I think some of the thinking here is that it does take some physical exertion to hold one's arm up to touch the screen. But, for me, having the option of using either the mouse or touch screen is such a cool improvement. I WOULD consider replacing my other two monitors with ViewSonic TD2455 monitors -- if it were not for the lack of pivot.With that said, here are some definite positives. The touch screen feature works well. The stylus that comes with it works well. The thin bevel around the screen is very nice, and I still am able to clip my webcam on the top of the monitor without an issue.I do recommend this monitor. But consider the pros and cons I've mentioned. My grade for this monitor is B+. I want to give a higher grade, but I just don't get this new V-shape stand. I'm hoping that alternatives will be created that have the capability of pivot capability.",

                "reviewText": "The Good: The image is very sharp. Buttons to turn on/control are on front of monitor and NOT underneath, so easy to find/push. Touch works very well and is intuitive. The angle and position can be adjusted easily with the heavy duty stand. Note to whomever had this unit and returned it to Amazon (without the manual) - I'm sure you forgot to plug in the USB-B connector which actually allows the touchscreen features. So you need 3 cords in the back (minimum) - power, a video (HDMI/etc.), and the USB-B to make the screen work like a mouse. This necessary cable was still fully wrapped up so I know the prior person returned this as \"not working.\" It works great!The slightly BAD: The touchscreen goes to within a quarter inch of the monitor edges. This is cool and a good use of space. However, when you hook a webcam on the top of the monitor, its clip hands a little in front of the monitor. It is not registering as a figer tap, but isn't ideal.Overall - VERY NICE MONITOR!",
