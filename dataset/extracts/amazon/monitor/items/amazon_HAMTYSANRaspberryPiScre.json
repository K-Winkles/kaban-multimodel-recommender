(Drone) it has a HD Zero video system in it and wanted a small screen capable of the HD video feed for letting others see the video at the same time I am. It works really well for this and as it can be powered from a power brick it is a much easier solution than my 12v dc 19\u201d monitor as well as being easier to pack up and move. I will have to build a case for it as there is exposed components on the back but, it works great. I could also see this as a great monitor to turn a PlayStation or XBox into a portable system.",

There is also a little stand that enables you to stand the screen up. The unit has an open back, however, exposing the internals. This is not suitable to hold while using, or for kids. It\u2019s not like an iPad or tablet that is enclosed. It\u2019s designed to be propped up in its stand, or perhaps installed in another object (car seat headrest?).",
