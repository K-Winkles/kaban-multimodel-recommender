                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my home office setup with the Acer SB220Q bi 21.5-inch Full HD monitor, and I am ecstatic with the choice. The first thing that caught my eye was the ultra-slim design and the Zero Frame, which not only looks modern and sleek but also maximizes the screen space, providing more viewing area.The display quality is crisp and clear with vibrant colors, thanks to the Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) and IPS technology. The images and texts appear sharp, making it a joy to work on documents, browse the web, or even enjoy videos and casual gaming during breaks.The monitor tilts from -5\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, allowing me to find a comfortable viewing angle. It's a small but important feature that has made my workspace ergonomically friendly.The setup was a breeze. The monitor was easy to assemble and connect to my computer. I also appreciate the HDMI and VGA ports which provide flexibility in connections.One feature that stands out is the AMD Radeon FreeSync technology. It has significantly reduced screen tearing and stuttering, which is a big plus when I switch to gaming mode.The 75Hz refresh rate is a nice step up from the standard 60Hz, providing smoother motion on screen. It's not a gaming-centric monitor, but it handles casual gaming quite well.Moreover, the Acer SB220Q bi is gentle on the eyes with its flicker-free technology and blue light filter, which are essential features for someone like me who spends long hours in front of the screen.In a nutshell, the Acer SB220Q bi 21.5-inch monitor is a fantastic value for the price. It offers a stylish design, excellent display quality, and essential features that enhance usability and comfort. It's a great addition to my home office and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, good-looking monitor without breaking the bank",

Now I am working with two monitors of the same size and quality in my office. The picture is sharp and clear, and the speakers on this \"ultra-thin\" monitor are adequate. With an adjustable height, the stand tilts to meet your needs. The frame is barely perceptible, and the picture extends to nearly every edge around. Setup was very easy. There are no drivers. This is a plug-and-play device with VGA and HDMI options. This monitor is very, very nice, and it is very reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant. At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved. Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I\u2019ll never understand why that is), but Acer\u2019s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking. Here are some of the most noticeable Pros & Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:PROS:- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard. Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage. This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit\u2019s reproduction may vary). The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.- This montior\u2019s \u201c100,000,000:1\u201d Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H) that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively. However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn\u2019t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.~ A quick side note about that \u201c100,000,000:1\u201d DCR number: there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff. But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI. Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison. This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen\u2019s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (\u201cblack boost\u201d) levels while also providing a \u2018blue light\u2019, \u2018adaptive constrast\u2019 (ACM), and a \u2018Super Sharpness\u2019 on/off switch.- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive optionsCONS:- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud\u2019ve liked (they\u2019re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).- The Picture Menu\u2019s \u2018Super Sharpness\u2019 option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart. It\u2019s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it. This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or \u201cnear perfect\u201d white temp.- It only has a paltry 15\u00b0 degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30\u00b0 degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice. If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you\u2019ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.",

It won't tilt forward tho but that's not a problem for me. However, it is listed as having built in speakers which it does not. Great value for the money!",

It isn't kidding when they say it is thin. It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much. The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything. But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower. With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image. With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!! It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it. The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness). It has a ton of settings for the monitor. The refresh rate of 75 is nice. I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice. I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work). Well worth the money by far!",
