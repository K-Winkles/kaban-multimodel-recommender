                "reviewText": "Out of the box: SIZE This is a BIG TV! 85\" and every bit of the 91lbs listed as advertised. I upgraded from the Samsung 65\" 4K 3D Curve TV. Don't worry, I still have it, just moved to another room! If you're shy or concerned about the weight have this professionally installed! I mounted this on my wall. I have 9' ceilings and the wall length is 17' 3/4\". I can still say, this is a BIG TV!SETUP One of the easiest setups I've havd. I 4 Samsung TV's, and 2 other smart TV's. This was the easiest to setup by far! The intuitive interface of the TV is sophisticated and yet friendly if you're willing to slow your excitement to watch your favorite movie on such a large screen. Take the time to \"dial in\" your picture. Follow the prompts and don't hesitate to click on \"advanced\" in the display menu. Here, you can really fine tune your picture! Why should you do this? This is not a QLED or an OLED TV. Don't let that fool you! This \"Crystal\" TV can bring you an incredible picture, able to display 1 Billion colors! You owe it to yourself to spend time in the \"Display\" menu and really make the adjustments to your liking! After all, this is 4K UHD TV!Before I purchased this TV, I read ever single negative review. I am convinced of a few things: This Is 2023 technology and you should really take the time to research this TV at you local store. Simple things like a \"Solar Remote\" and not liking the sound quality, are just a few things people complained about. I have a big room, and a big wall. Sound straight from this TV surprised me! As a studio engineer, I didn't have any expectation of \"Awesome Sound\". (That's why you purchase a surround sound system or a sound bar) What sound this TV delivers is quite pleasant and fills my room. If you want movie quality sound, don't blame the TV! The technology is built into the TV! Take advantage and purchase a good system and your movie experience will be complete!FINALLY This 85\" 4K UHD Crystal TV is worth the money! The smart features are PLENTY! The quality of picture is incredible. Sure you could pay $3-4K more for a smaller QLED or OLED. At 85\", the price point comparison simply didn't make any sense! I've already watched everything from network television to Sci-fi, and sports. I'm very picky and not easily pleased. However, this TV checked ALL the boxes. One thing to mention that I didn't post earlier: I do have home network and Hi-speed internet! 100+Meg where the TV is hooked up and it shares the connection with my Xbox X. The 120hz refresh rate is REAL and noticeable! I have a Chromecast, and Firestick also attached. I am able to say even though the reviews talk about lagging, I have experienced NONE, and with my setup, I would have experienced it for sure bu now!I highly recommend purchasing this Television if you are looking for more than just, \"bang for the buck\" and want to feel like you got a fantastic upgrade from your old setup!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful TV, Bedroom Streaming Paradise",
                "reviewText": "I bought this 43\" TV to replace a TCL Roku TV. I\u2019ve had this TV now for a month. What a difference! It was delivered on time and the box was carefully handled by the carrier. This is my 3rd Amazon TV purchase that has gone oh so well. It is highly compatible, simple to install, and simple to use.OUT OF THE BOX: Right out of the box, everything assembled perfectly. I love that these TV feet have two options for height. The feet seem sturdier than most thin profile \u201cA frame\u201d feet. The feet have two height options and the highest option pulled the TV right up over my sound bar so the remote could reach the TV sensor. JOY. My last TV I had to put the sound bar behind and it muted some of the sound. I read on the Samsung site that you can purchase a pedestal stand that sits on the floor. That would free up dresser space. I don't have a very flashy or large sound bar but it installed easily and I found the correct location to plug in the back. I did buy gold plated HDMI cord for the sound bar. My one gripe is that all the \"labels\" for the ports are just raised black plastic letters. I thought about labeling them for later, but did not. They need to be better defined, painted, peel off label, something different. It was hard to see those port names. This is not a deal breaker because once the sound bar was set up, I won't be accessing those much in the future. I tried also attaching a blue tooth small speaker just to test the blue tooth and it worked! I really felt like an expert at this point. The TV sound without a sound bar is adequate and not bad and there are several sound presets and settings. I had it set up within 20 minutes and did have some help getting it out of the box and up on my dresser. We did not wall mount, but it is so thin it would be excellent as a wall mounted TV. The TV updated with the latest firmware once it was turned on and running.ANTENNA DEVICE: I attached a separate local antenna. I had a bit of a hard time finding the antenna scanner options, but with some setting exploration the TV scanned 30+ channels and now I have some local that I can search for weather and news. It will take a bit of time to find the settings in the beginning, but you will get used to them.ROKU DEVICE: I attached a Roku Ultra to this TV. Though this TV had an app for Roku, I did not activate that one. The Roku also attached beautifully and I do not need to use my Roku remote, the Samsung remote worked so well for the Roku too!APPS and STREAMING: All APPS easy to log in, set up and go as you would expect from a Smart TV. You can customize your APP layout. Make sure you set up your Samsung account. You get Samsung TV+ straight out of the box. All streaming apps are available and with the Roku attachment, even more! There is a gaming hub also, my daughter is going to try it out soon and there is three months free. We have minimal lag sometimes but it could be our internet. The APP icons are a little smaller than I would have loved, but not a problem. I\u2019m streaming via WIFI and not Ethernet. No problems streaming. My router is across the house from this TV. The SmartThings app helps to also integrate this TV with many other devices throughout the living space.REMOTE: On to the remote which seems to be the nemesis of those that don\u2019t adapt well to change. A couple weeks in, I was all about this remote! Yes it is very small, but once you get used to it, you can maneuver all over the TV. Voice access works well though sometimes not as \u201csmart\u201d as my Roku remote voice commands. It uses Bixby and Alexa. The remote charges with solar to room light OR you can charge with a USB plugin type C. Give the remote a chance, it was a little challenging at first but now I love it! Samsung remote operates the sound bar perfectly for volume and on/off. I am not sure that other features of the sound bar work with Samsung remote like the sound bar preset sounds. If I want to change those I just use the sound bar remote. You can check the remote battery level in settings. I\u2019ve not had to plug it in to charge yet but I did to test and it works fine.SUGGESTED SETTINGS: As stated in another review: The default picture mode looks like you are looking through a window. You can change that if you don\u2019t like it by switching to dynamic mode. Additionally the Gama setting may be too high for you and you can change to the minimum. Do play around with the settings for the best picture quality. It is also suggested to change the \u201cMotion Xcelerator\u201d by moving the slider called \u201cJudder Reduction. Default is 10 which is maximum. Try setting it to 1 or 2 to get the best fast action scenes with no ghosting or artifacts. Great for sports action! I\u2019m still learning some settings.CONTRASTS: Contrasts are fantastic and the black seems to be very deep and rich. I notice some back lighting but ONLY on the default screen saver..BRIGHTNESS: I\u2019m truly not understanding anyone complaining about the brightness, but they are. My bedroom faces the South and has two large windows which brings in maximum sunlight during the day. There is no problem with the TV being bright enough at all when watching in the daytime.with fully opened blinds and curtains.COLORS and PICTURE: Crystal clear and vibrant, with no blurriness/ High resolution and dramatic display. Everything to love! Beautiful projection on the display from any seating position in the room.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for a much bigger TV to go on our wall in our family room. I was really kind of set on an LG, when I came across this TV. As I read the reviews really carefully I was worried about the remote but the TV sounded great. The TV is absolutely fantastic! I have to say that I like the remote. It is quite small but it's nice that it will do a solar charge or you can hook it into a USB as well. You do want to keep track of the remote because it is small but I think it's really easy to use. The TV is super clear. Some people say that they don't think it's very bright but I think it's more than adequate. They also mentioned some settings that were a problem for them. Specifically an artifact setting for sports. I watch a lot of sports and I was worried about it but when I went into the detailed menu from the good gentleman who wrote about that in his review, my settings were already set to a 2. And that's what he had suggested as well. So basically we hung it on the wall. It took about 5 minutes to set up and we were streaming happily minutes later. I couldn't be more happy with this TV.",
