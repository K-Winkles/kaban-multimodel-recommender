                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic monitor to carry along with your laptop if you have need to have a second screen, especially if you are working while on the road. Like many, I am spoiled while in the office with a docking station and dual monitor setup. When I'm on the road, however, having only a single screen on the laptop seems so limiting, and lugging along a second, traditional 15\" LCD monitor would be too cumbersome.Enter the Cocopar Portable Monitor! It's no more bulky than your typical iPad, but adds the ability to carry an extra screen right inside the same backpack where you carry your laptop. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how solid this little unit feels; it is not overly flexible nor does it feel \"cheap.\" The included cover/stand solidly closes with a magnet and should do an excellent job of protecting the screen on its travels.On my Windows 11 based laptop with a USB-C connector, setup was super-simple. I simply plugged the included USB-C to USB-C cable into the monitor and laptop and, within seconds, the monitor was identified and operating as a second screen. The build in cover/stand was flexible enough that I could adjust the angle and the picture was excellent. It supported the same native resolution as my laptop's screen (1920 x 1080 ), so I didn't have any unusual artifacting or weird resizing issues when I would drag windows between the two screens. For those who may not have USB-C connectors on their computers, the Cocopar also comes with additional cables; one USB-A and one HDMI cable, along with the traditional power adapter that converts the USB-A cable to a standard electrical plug so you can use normal wall current to power the device. When using the USB-C to USB-C cable and a laptop with a powered USB-C port, you only need to plug in the one cable for both image and power.All in all, this is a handy little extra monitor that slips easily inside my laptop bag alongside the laptop itself and comes with me everywhere I go! I can now sit at a remote location, like a hotel, and have the same two monitor setup while remote as I do when in the office.Highly recommended!",

It worked perfectly right out of the box, and provides a clear, sharp picture.Pros: good size, clear picture, lightweight and portable, comes with a cover that doubles as a monitor stand, great price.Cons: it's turned itself off a couple of times, switch on the side didn't seem to do anything, but disconnecting and reconnecting the USB-C cable turned the monitor back on. To be fair, I haven't checked the manual yet to see if this behavior is by design.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the cocopar 15.6\" full HD portable display for my flight simulation system. I have three large monitors driven by 2 PCs that display the view out the cockpit windows. I added the portable display to show the key cockpit instruments so I don't have to pan the main cockpit window display during takeoff and landing.The cocopar display arrived in packaging that is almost in the Apple class for quality. The box was sturdy and really protected the display and additional components. All the cables needed were provided. The User Manual was complete, well written and easy to understand. I had the monitor connected to my system, configured and operational in 15 minutes. The one concern I had with such a small monitor was my ability to easily read the instruments with just a glance given that my eyes were farther away than might be normal. Not a problem at all during a live flight - screen is clear, bright with vivid colors.I didn't connect the monitor to my iPhone or laptop and I didn't use the internal speakers so I can't comment on those features.Bottom line - this is a terrific monitor and suits my needs perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Cocopar Portable Monitor and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I needed a portable monitor for my work while traveling, and this monitor has proven to be the perfect solution.Firstly, I want to mention the fast delivery. I received the monitor the day after I purchased it. The package arrived in perfect condition.Setting up the monitor was a breeze. It comes with everything you need, including cables and a protective cover. I simply connected the monitor to my laptop using the USB-C cable and it was ready to use. No additional drivers or software installation was required.The monitor is light and compact. It is incredibly portable and easy to carry around. The design is sleek and modern, and it looks great on my desk. The build quality is solid, giving me confidence that it will withstand the rigors of traveling.The display quality is outstanding. The 15.6-inch screen produces vivid and crisp visuals. The colors are vibrant and the details are sharp. Whether I am working on different documents, editing images, or watching videos, the display is amazing.Another feature that I appreciate is the multiple connectivity options. The monitor can be connected to my laptop using the USB-C cable, but it also has HDMI and mini DisplayPort options. This versatility allows me to use the monitor with different devices, such as my gaming console or even my iPone.I am seriously considering purchasing another one so that instead of using it as an extended view to my laptop, I use two monitors with my standard keyboard (without the laptop). This will greatly enhance my productivity, especially when working on multiple files etc.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Cocopar Portable Monitor. It offers everything I need for my work while traveling \u2013 fast delivery, easy setup, amazing display quality, and portability. I highly recommend it!",
