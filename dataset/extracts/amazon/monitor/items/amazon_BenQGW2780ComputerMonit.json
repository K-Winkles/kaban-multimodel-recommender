I totally agree with other reviewers on the built speakers being weak, not just volume output lower than expected, the sound is very tinny, but functional. The good news, is I didn't buy it for the sound, since the animator has real reference speakers at each end of her desk. Initially was worried when I saw it was shipped with no outer carton, but everything was arrived OK. Would really like to see BenQ include a real printed manual vs include a CDROM with PDFs on it. I guess someone still uses CDROM? If nothing else, put a QR code on the double fold sheet to the URL for the PDF. I would but it again, it will be interesting to hear the feedback from the user once she uses it for 60-80hrs in a week. included HDMI cable is about 1m (3feet) long. Would be nice if it was 2m in length, and included 4 x VESA 10mm screws. It is a good quality mid range monitor that is easy on the eyes out of the box for a decent price.",

                "reviewText": "Although I hadn't heard of this brand, I selected this monitor for the description and the affordable price. It wasn't hard for this VERY non-techie senior to hook up. Actually, I got more help by reading the first review than I did from the Quick Start Guide. I was confused as to why a cable with a blue plug (sub-D?) was provided, when there is no place to plug it into my computer, instead of a hdml cable. Otherwise it was easy to do and everything fits neatly without a mess of visible cables. The stand is sturdy. The picture quality and color is lovely. I haven't tried any games yet but I'm looking forward to that. Hopefully it provides the eye care as claimed.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor is great, and it's great as a secondary monitor. It doesn't look bad next to an expensive screen.If you're looking for an additional screen under 27\" good luck. Retailers are full of 22-24\" 1080p monitors which look the same as the ones that came with an HP/Dell desktop in 2007. Most have huge bezels. Most have a single HDMI plug. Most have a power brick. And many of them don't even have HDCP so you can't watch Netflix on them.This monitor has a 100 mm VESA bolt pattern so you can put it on any arm. It takes a regular power plug \u2014 no power brick. It has HDCP. It's a good IPS panel. Black looks dark. There's slightly less light bleed than my more expensive LG screens. It has slightly smaller bezels than my other screens. And it has two HDMI inputs, so it's easy for me to use as an additional monitor for both my home machine and work laptop.The menus are easy to use and you can even setup shortcuts to put your three most-used adjustments on the first menu level. The speakers are worse than most \u2014 which is quite the feat when you think of how bad built-in monitor speakers are \u2014 but I don't care about that. The only slight annoyance I have is that you can't dim the light on the power button. But it's on the bottom edge of the screen, so it's easy to put a little piece of black tape over it. Of course that partially blocks those awesome speakers LOL.This monitor is a 21.5\" 1920x1080 panel, so that's 102.5 dpi/ppi (pixels per inch). The bigger you go the worse it'll look next to a monitor with higher resolution.My other two monitors are a 38\" 3840x1600 LG ultrawide (109.5 dpi) and a 25\" 2560x1080 LG ultrawide (111.1 dpi).21.5\" BenQ GW2283 \u2014 sqrt(1920^2 + 1080^2) / 21.5 = 102.5 dpi25\" LG 25UM58 \u2014 sqrt(2560^2 + 1080^2) / 25 = 111.1 dpi38\" LG 38WN75C \u2014 sqrt(3840^2 + 1600^2) / 38 = 109.5 dpiThe 25\" LG 25UM58 is also a good deal. It currently costs 50% more than the BenQ for 33% more resolution. It's 75 hz, but I think the BenQ might actually have a better response time if you're gaming on it. And the 25\" LG has a 75 mm VESA bolt pattern and a power brick.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased 2 BenQ GW2780 Computer Monitors and overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase. The monitor offers excellent value for its price point and boasts some impressive features.One of the standout features is the Eye-Care Technology, which significantly reduces eye strain during extended periods of use. As a software developer, I spend countless hours staring at screens, and this feature has made a noticeable difference in reducing eye fatigue.The monitor's display quality is crisp and vibrant, providing a comfortable workspace for coding and design tasks. The size is also perfect for multitasking, allowing me to have multiple windows open simultaneously.However, there is one area where the monitor falls short \u2013 the built-in speakers. Unfortunately, they sound noticeably worse than my laptop speakers. For someone who occasionally enjoys watching videos or having conference calls without headphones, this could be a drawback.In conclusion, the BenQ GW2780 offers an impressive display, value for its price, and eye-care technology that is a significant benefit for those long coding sessions. While the built-in speakers may not meet everyone's audio expectations, this can easily be remedied with external speakers or headphones. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this monitor to fellow software developers looking for an affordable and eye-friendly display option.",

I wish they used the rear joystick control like on their gaming monitor, as it's easier to use, but not that often that I use those controls. The speakers are a bit anemic and I think it's more due to the enclosure than the electronic design as they sound a bit muddy, even after trying a few different variants of this model. Overall, a very likeable monitor and I'm happy with the performance thus far.",

Aunque, en cuanto a los materiales, el Benq es el mejor.Muy buena su funci\u00f3n de ajuste de brillo. S\u00faper c\u00f3modo pues no tienes que andar ajustando el brillo a lo largo del d\u00eda si tienes ventana donde entra luz.El brillo es bueno, la calidad de imagen aceptable. La fluidez es buena, solo lo uso para trabajar pero se siente muy agradable.Tiene bocinas que obviamente no son espectaculares pero al menos tiene bocinas (los otros por el mismo precio no tienen).Una cosa m\u00e1s, armarlo tambi\u00e9n es muy f\u00e1cil. Desarmarlo tambi\u00e9n! Muy buen ensamble (Lo digo porque una vez romp\u00ed uno por lo dif\u00edcil de desarmar!!)Muy feliz con mi compra.

It's very sturdy and heavy, much heavier than my last monitor which had a bigger screen (27\" VS 24\") - The quality feels and looks far superior. Speakers are good, just remember to go to settings and turn up the max volume to 100%, you can adjust the volume after doing that on your computer or phone - The max volume was low until I figured that out. Picture quality looks great to me, for my needs, even at 1080p.I'm using it for DEX with my Samsung phone - it came with a USB-C cable and DEX came to life as soon as I attached the cable, my chromebook worked too. It charges my devices with the supplied USB-C cable.The only con I can think of is the power cable length, it's about 5FT, should have been at least 6ft . Saying that, I've only had the monitor for a day, so I can't comment on longevity.Also, when the display is not tilted and pushed down to the lowest position on the stand, the distance from my desk to the bottom of the display is 2\". I had trouble finding this info and I wanted a monitor that was close to my desk - I thought this info may help others.",
