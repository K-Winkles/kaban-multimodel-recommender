                "reviewText": "This screen extender comes very well packaged for transport and includes a carrying case to make it safe to travel with it. Each external monitor is in HD resolution (1920x1080) and seems to be plenty bright and crisp. I am using this for extended work area (not gaming), so the refresh rate is not important to me. The unit sits behind the laptop. Note that if you have ports behind your laptop in use, it will \"push back\" the monitor a little to make room for them, though the wires can go through the area that \"extends\" (which allows you to adjust the sizing to the size of your laptop). This is why, on my setup, the monitors are a bit behind my main screen instead of exactly flush with the center screen. My power supply and headphones are both connected via ports in the back.The unit has a built-in stand, and you need to open the screens up almost all the way (versus having the monitors angled toward you like a \"curved monitor\" experience) for it to be balanced properly, or it wants to fall forward. When properly opened up, the monitors are very stable.The setup was easy except for one part. When I first tried to get it to work, I couldn't get more than one monitor to connect, no matter how I tried. I am using a Lenovo Legion gaming laptop that has 3 USB-C ports and an HDMI port. I tried 2 USB-C connections, one to each monitor (the preferred method), and also one USB-C (monitor one) and an HDMI+USB for the second monitor. I also tried supplemental power, as suggested in the manual. Finally, I did some research on connecting two external monitors (in general) to a Lenovo Legion laptop, and found other people had issues when their laptop was set to use ONLY the discrete graphics card (dGPU mode which only uses my NVIDIA card for gaming performance.) Once I switched to Hybrid mode (which allows both the onboard AMD Radeon graphics AND the NVIDIA discrete card to be used) then it worked perfectly. I mention this as it can be frustrating to figure out why your setup is not working, but in this case it had nothing whatsoever to do with this unit, but rather the capabilities and configuration of my laptop. I highly recommend looking up how to support a three monitor setup on your laptop before purchasing, to make sure it will work for you.All in all, this setup works fantastic! I like that it is fully powered directly from my laptop, so I don't need to plug in an extra power supply. I love that it comes with a carrying case and folds up compactly, so it can fit in my rolling laptop case. This solves my problem of wanting extra screen real estate while I'm travelling.",

                "reviewText": "Stretch to place behind your laptop (or Chromebook....) screen; \"screen extender\" (=additional display) is to your right. I appreciate the kickstand but don't need it. With my ThinkPad (with built-in 15.6\" 1920x1080 display), the additional screen is a bit smaller and higher. I thought resolution would be 1920x1080, but the unit I received has 1920x1200, even better, with quick response time and high contrast. (The user guide shows both resolutions as options.) Windows recommends 150% scale, but I set it to 125% and am quite pleased. 3 cables are included to accommodate use where the host's video USB-C port doesn't offer enough power or the extender needs to plug into HDMI instead of USB-C, but this laptop's USB-C ports support video AND offer enough power, so I only need the one cable; fortunately it's more than long enough to stretch from the back of the new screen to the left of the laptop (where the ports are). Clear, bright IPS display. You can also use it with your smartphone or tablet, but the mounting method won't help you with either. The single knob at the top right of the new display handily controls screen brightness and speaker volume. User guide clearly explains connection options and Windows and MacOS display settings. They also offer a 2-screen version (extend laptop screen to both left and right). Room for improvement: (1) From the speaker I only hear the right channel with normal settings; I need to change Windows settings to mono-only to hear everything. Fortunately this doesn't affect me because I use headphones. (2) The case is open-top, so though you can slip the monitor in, if the case rotates, the monitor can fall out. On the plus side, it has canvas carrying handles and an outside pouch (also open-top) for the cables, but I'd feel much better with a zippable case with a zippable cable compartment.",

                "reviewText": "This is heavy. A LOT heavier than most laptops, especially newer ones without a CD drive and that have a solid state hard drive, so they can be so thin and light. It comes with a nice custom carrying case, but if you're traveling and putting this into a computer backpack, it's going to feel like you have a cinder block on your back. It expands to accept your laptop, but it doesn't quite fit my 17\" LG Gram. Not a problem though, as it is wide enough that you can still see both screens. You don't HAVE to insert your laptop all the way into that middle section. This is pricey, but sometimes you just have to pay for quality. This exudes quality. From the carrying case to the plethora of cables it comes with, many of which you won't need, to the fit and finish of the screens themselves. They fold up nicely into each other to resemble another laptop, and slide into the carrying case which also has room for the cables you DO need. Once installed, which was painless, the screen was almost as nice as my LG Gram. Crisp and clear with vivid colors. With something at this price point you would expect a well written Quick Start guide and good clear instructions. This did not disappoint there either. You can almost buy a low end basic laptop for less than this costs these days, but again, if you want quality you often have to pay for it. I recommend this. and give it five stars.",
