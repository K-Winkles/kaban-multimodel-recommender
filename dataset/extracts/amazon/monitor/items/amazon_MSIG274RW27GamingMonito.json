                "reviewText": "I bought this MSI monitor about 6 months ago and I have had absolutely 0 issues with it.It looks stunning.27 inches is a lot bigger than you think.High refresh rate at 165 Hz is just amazing for gaming but also for productivity work.IPS panel that accurately displays colors, although you may need to tweak some display settings until you\u2019re happy. I just calibrated it to my iPhone\u2019s screen.The joystick that brings up the menu is amazing and has custom quick actions like if you wanted to bring up the monitor\u2019s crosshair which is rendered by the monitor itself not your PC.The stand is heavy duty (emphasis on heavy) and has a decently low profile base. The stand also features height adjustment, tilt, and you can spin the monitor 90 degrees if you\u2019re into that. If you\u2019re not into stands, this monitor also supports VESA mounting for wall mounting or a monitor arm.Furthermore you get a stunning back panel with programmable RGB. Although, the RGB only has presets and can\u2019t be customized beyond that. I have mine set to white static leds and it\u2019s very nice.The only thing that I noticed that I didn\u2019t like so much but quickly got used to is that the pixels are pretty visible. As in, you can count the pixels on the monitor because of how large they are. I just chalk this up to being a side effect of having a 27 inch 1080p monitor. I\u2019m sure the 1440p mode doesn\u2019t have this issue.Conclusion: If you\u2019re on the fence about getting this monitor, just get it. You won\u2019t regret it. I myself plan to get 2 more in the future to have all 3 monitors be the same.",

                "reviewText": "I was for sure going for the white aesthetic, and I was between buying 2 of the MSI for a dual monitor setup, or paying almost the same price for the ASUS. So glad that I got the dual MSI, the quality surpassed my expectations. You can tell they didn't cheap out on the stand, amazing range of motion, goes up and down, left and right, tilts the screen up and down, and fully turns sideways (landscape to portrait, and back again).There are lights on the back but not bright enough to see them unless you were looking at them, this wasn't a priority to me though. I went from Xbox to PC gaming, and I can tell a positive performance change from when I played on Xbox (2.8x the fps).10/10 recommend! Aesthetically pleasing, functionally- more than just gets the job done, exceeded my expectations",
