                "reviewText": "Bought this for WFH and casual gaming with an Xbox Series S. I was surprised to have receive the IPS version. I actually prefer IPS but some people do not so heads up. I have divided the review between WFH and casual gaming:OFFICE USEPros:- Wide viewing angles- Consistent accurate looking colors- HDMI allowing for easy connection to laptops- VESA- High resolution allows for 'more' on the screen at once- Adjustable screen with fliters etcCons:- unsure what panel you may receive (<- big one)- no speakers- dummy thicc bezels- non adjustable standWhile I consider some of these cons, I will not take stars off as I knew this prior to buying the monitor. They need to sort out what panel they are shipping. Overall for office and WFH it is a great monitor.GamingPros- Freesync compatible (48 - 75) over hdmi- FPS counter built into monitor- low input latency- low pixel response time- 1440pCon- Only 75hz- No HDRPerfect fit for Xbox Series S. Was surprised to see this monitor has freesync as well as an FPS counter. Tested on Xbox One and Series S and it worked perfectly. While it does not compare to my 144Hz LG gaming monitor, this is good enough to get some wins ;) Low latency compared to some TVs and the pixel response is good enough to not completely blur the image (IPS panel). As with the WFH section, while I put items in the con section, they are to be expected so no stars off.TLDRIt's a good monitor for work as the resolution allows for windows/programs to be visible at one time and the IPS provides good viewing angles and colors. Good for casual PC/Xbox Series S gaming as the 1440p screen is high resolution for how far you will be sitting and the refresh rate fits these devices well (especially the Series S). Low pixel blur and low input latency as well. Overall good work/play monitor for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 2 monitor set up that I use and switch between my personal and work computers. My other monitor has a KVM, so that makes it super convenient. Anyway, about this monitor.I was skeptical of this monitor at first because it is a VA panel. Turns out the picture quality is great. If there are any pixels burnt out, I couldn\u2019t tell you as they are too small for me to see. This is my first curved monitor, and I have to say, I think I personally prefer curved monitors now. Especially whenever monitors start going above 27\u201d. It just makes everything easier to see, for me. I\u2019ve watched 4k videos/movies on this monitor and it\u2019s flawless, with vibrant colors. I didn\u2019t need anything super fancy or expensive for my secondary monitor, just something that works. 60Hz suits my needs.I did a lot of research between the VA panels and the IPS panels. The IPS monitors cost a lot more money, and for my primary use, which is office productivity, this is fine. If your primary use case is gaming or something with high accuracy color reproduction, then you might want to look at other monitors. I\u2019ve played WoW on this monitor, and it worked fine, but I prefer my other monitor, which was made for gaming and higher FPS.After a year of owning this one, I am very pleased with it.Update: I have an M1 Mac Mini and running dark mode causes this screen to flicker, quite a lot. I have to run it in light mode, which I'm not a fan of, but this is not a problem of this monitor. The M1 Mac Mini, for some reason, doesn't support dark mode when running through HDMI. I haven't tried running this through USBC, so that may solve the issue, as I stated in my earlier review, this is my secondary monitor. I just wanted to provide that update in case you happen to have an M1 Mac, I can't speak to models other than the Mini, that you may experience this issue and it is your computer, not the monitor. My rating does not change as this monitor continues to be a great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I definitely like the picture quality. I bought it for editing in Lightroom, Photoshop and some video work in Premier.The colors seem pretty accurate.There is definitely more detail than the Dell Ultrasharp 24 it replaced. It's clearly got more definition.Based on my first 2 days of ownership, I'd say this is a great monitor at a good price.The only negatives are that it just feels and looks a bit cheaply made overall. The menu is operated with a tiny joystick on the back. The menus look extremely simplistic. The bezel feels like cheap plastic... it's not 'bad' it's just not \"well made\" like the Dell it replaced.I've read a lot of comments here that the monitor was great for up to a year then it started having problems.. I'm hoping that doesn't happen.. but for a sub-300 monitor that looks this good, I think there has to be compromises... and longevity might be one of them. But, we'll see. I've had it 2 days and so far I'm very happy. Everything is crisp and the colors look amazing. I'm still amazed at the detail.",
