I average about 60-80 frames per second on Cyberpunk 2077 and this monitor can support up to 144hz - so picture quality is absolutely fine and smooth. Colors looked great out of the box and I've literally done nothing to adjust brightness or hue. The V-shaped monitor stand feels like it was angling the monitor to a down-angle and since I'm a tall guy I had to use little rubber block-erasers to prop and lean the monitor to a cozy angle for me. Highly satisfied for the price I paid, and so far no issues. Lets see how it holds up after a year or two.tl;drPaid a great price for a high refresh rate monitor. Works great with video gaming or watching movies. Easy to set up and only mild adjustments for monitor-stand. 5/5.",

I had no idea what I was looking for, but with all the info this listing gives, it was a no brainer. The monitor itself is so clean looking, and the display is perfect. It also blocks blue light which I love - especially when I\u2019m watching my boyfriend playing two inches away from the screen! He plugged his Xbox directly to the monitor and uses his headset - he\u2019s obsessed with it. Highly recommend for gamers out there!",

                "reviewText": "KOORUI seem to be masters at knowing what people really care about in a monitor, stripping the spec down to that, and delivering at an incredible price.It's a VA panel, which is known for having a higher contrast ratio than the more common IP, but lower picture quality in general. This can be a problem and you must be careful buying VA' panels as some have very poor color, unclear images, and terrible viewing angle.This unit is VA but will full sRGB gamut color, a viewing angle that (to my eyes) is on a par with any IP that's in front of you on a desk, and respectable accuracy right out of the box. It sits right next to my BenQ and I can't really spot a difference in the color in most images.The most accurate color temperature, kind of surprisingly, seemed to come by setting the color to \"custom\", rather than the warm setting which is often the D65 target on consumer displays.A grayscale sweep showed about a max 4.5 dE error in the gray scales. That's not bad at all off the shelf, and typical for monitors not sold on reference color accuracy. Unfortunately it can't seem to be improved much by simply adjusting the RGB sliders which don't seem to give a very linear response. You need a calibration if you want to perfect it. Using DisplayCal I generated a gamma ramp which fixed the tone curve and grayscale errors. However, the color saturation appears a tad high, (which most people will LOVE).Bottom line is that you're getting an image typical of any decent consumer IP panel, maybe better that many of them in gamut coverage, which wouldn't be saying much - except it's VA. After calibration, (which tends to reduce contrast ratio), I have up towards 4000:1 contrast ratio. (IP panels are native ~1000:1 and usually calibrated lower).To be clear, most people using a monitor will enjoy a high contrast ratio more than any other attribute of the picture quality. (This has actually been demonstrated).It has a joystick for adjusting the settings which I find easier and more intuitive to use than the external puck on a BenQ. As a bonus it's not flopping around on my desk.It seems cheap in that it's light weight. Unless that means it's going to break, then it's only a bonus at this point since it makes it easier to setup and move around.I have no comment on any of the gaming or HDR features as I haven't explored those yet. But it's too late for anything to convince me I will ever see a better monitor for the price.EDIT: At review I had not noticed it had an sRGB mode. This brings the color gamut much closer to standard, (except red which is still a bit saturated).",

                "reviewText": "Great for my personal needs.If you are getting a monitor like this, high refresh rate and higher than FHD don't forget to double check your settings. I've seen a couple reviews that I think could have been solved by double checking this.But on to the monitor itself. It's great! Bought it at ~$170 USD. Played games at double the quoted refresh rate and also at 30 fps. I haven't seen any ghosting, though this can happen apparently I may have just been very lucky so far. Refresh rates are great, playing Valorant, CSGO, and Apex hasn't been an issue. Losing gun fights in any of those games have been my own fault and not having hardware lag behind and my reactions not being able to quickly adjust.If you aren't playing competitive games and are more looking for a media consumption tool or prioritize picture quality and color accuracy this probably won't be the panel for you. There are better options out there for that specific purpose but if you like to game and consume content this is a great bang for the buck monitor.1 small gripe I would have, but I understand for the price point it can't really be helped is that the monitor stand that comes with it isn't height adjustable.Not a big deal if you are planning on Vesa mounting it but something worth noting.Also if you are planning on using this monitor and having sound out there are no on board speakers. Not an issue if you are planning on using headphones or have desk speakers but I have seen other reviews saying they were disappointed at the lack of them. So i figure I'd point that out if you were expecting them.Overall for I'd recommend this monitor to anyone who needs a great budget gaming monitor. Like I said just make sure to double check your settings, on the monitor and on your PC, when you first plug it in.",
