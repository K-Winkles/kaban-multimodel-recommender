                "reviewText": "I bought a pair of these for a work from home scenario to replace a hodgepodge mix of two different, smaller monitors. First the good; I love the form factor and slim bezel, I have them mounted on a dual arm monitor mount and they look fabulous. To the person who said the base was removeable but you are left with the stem, that is untrue, you can remove the stem by removing the little clip on cover and unscrewing four screws, easy-peasy.I have these running through an \"Unpluggable\" dual monitor docking station and all is well with that. They are running in full HD through HDMI cables however, and this is the part where I say be careful and read the description carefully. I thought I was getting 75Hz monitors but if you read, it says it only supports 75Hz with AMD Free-Sync/Adaptive-Sync technology, My work laptop does not have an AMD Graphics card and I won't be using these for gaming so I don't mind so much. However if you are buying these for gaming (and I'm not sure why you would) make sure your graphics card supports the AMD Free-Sync/Adaptive-Sync technology or, like me, you will only be getting 60Hz. I got these for a good deal so I am not complaining too much, I could always return them if I felt strongly about it. Otherwise they are a good fit for my situation and I have no other issues. I think the display is very nice, it could stand to have a little more brightness range but, again, for the price, I am not complaining.",

                "reviewText": "For a $150 1080p 27\" monitor, this gets a lot of things right. Just be aware that the motion sync feature can cause major eyestrain.Pros:Good color qualitySleek design with very thin bezelsMatte coating that reduces reflectionsHDMI cable includedLots of OSD options (with configurable profiles)Freesync (reduces tearing in games)Motion sync backlight strobing. This is usually reserved for 144Hz+ gaming monitors, but it is here, albeit gimped.Cons:Non height-adjustable stand (passable for price)OSD can be clunky to switch profiles. For some reason, ASUS includes two \"shortcut\" buttons (default is brightness and blue light filter), but does not let you use those shortcuts to switch profiles. You can however use it to switch from different presets (with splendid), but not saved profiles. This seems like an oversight to me, because instead of just two clicks to change profiles, you have to do much closer to 4 clicks. I think ASUS should have at least given the option to use the shortcuts to switch profiles.Motion Sync is a nice addition, but not as good as actual 144Hz panel (as it should be), and it can cause eyestrain. I have attatched some images of (approximately) what it looks like when it is enabled, but note that the double images get worse near the top and bottom of the screen. The double images are pretty bad, but in games, I didn't notice it that much. However, I did get eyestrain after about 15 minutes of gaming with the mode enabled because of the inherent strobing, even after having the monitor for a few days and trying to adjust to the strobing. Overall, I'm happy that ASUS included the option at all, but just know that the \"1MS MPRT\" marketing point is only valid with motion sync on which has all the aforementioned problems. The lowered brightness of the mode doesn't bother me nearly as much as the eyestrain and double images though. If you want a gaming monitor with hardware that can drive it (next gen console, gaming computer), I highly recommend just spending a little more for a 144Hz monitor, as this is priced at $150.Conclusion:This monitor is great for normal use. It's okay for gaming, but at a $150 MSRP, I'd recommend spending a bit more for a proper gaming monitor with actual 1MS response times and 144Hz refresh rates.",
