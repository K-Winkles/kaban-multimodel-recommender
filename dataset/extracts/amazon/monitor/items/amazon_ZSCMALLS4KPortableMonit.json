                "reviewText": "I was looking for a portable monitor to use as an extended display for my macbook pro when traveling and working remotely. I wanted something simple, easy to use, lightweight and travel friendly. It looked like this monitor would work, so gave it a try. Here are my thoughts after some use:+ Easy to use with Macbook Pro. The USB-C to USB-C connection made it super easy to use with one cable for my purposes. If you have a full function USB-C port available on your laptop, this is a perfect choice for you. Because this monitor needs power, if you don't have a USB-C connection that can supply power, you'll need to use the included external power supply.+ Screen Quality is very good. While it wasn't the brightest out of the box, you can turn the backlight up to make it brighter. I turned it all the way up and it was plenty bright. I eventually turned it back down to the 50% default and that's what I normally use. Note - the \"+\" button on the monitor is a shortcut to the backlight setting, so it's super easy to adjust - that's a nice feature to avoid going through the menu.+ Image Quality is great. The resolution seems to be really good. It's not Retina, but I don't notice much difference between my laptop screen and this monitor. Text is sharp and clear for work purposes, and video is sharp and motion is smooth. No issues at all. Backlight looks even across the monitor and no flickering or anything to speak of.+ Speakers are OK. I wasn't looking for good sound from the monitor and don't plan on using them. They are OK, but not something I would rely on for great sound. I would be OK if the monitor didn't even have the speakers.+ Ports. Two USB-C ports (one for power and data, and one that is DP compatible). One mini-HDMI port, to use with included HDMI to mini-HDMI for sources with HDMI output. One micro USB for accessories. Everything I was looking for and all ports seem to work great+ Cover / Stand. Integrated portfolio cover and stand is a great simple design. I really like it for its simple design and little leather flaps for 3 different positioning angles. I find they work better than indentions / grooves that other covers have.+ Pen-Hole Stand. Love the ability to use a pencil or pen as a stand to use in either rotation. An easy travel alternative for a stand.All-in-all, a great monitor for the price. I'm very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on sale with a $10 coupon, so until $70 (US).Size/Portability:The screen folds up into a thin, built-in case which protects the display, and also serves as a multi-position stand.This screen will easily fit in my laptop bag along with my laptop.Ports: * HDMI-mini * USB-C x 2 * USB-C \"OTG\" (for pass-through peripherals)I am using it right now on my laptop, through the USB-C/Thunderbolt port. Both the power and video go through USB-C, so a single cable and no additional power are required.For HDMI, you'd need to supply power through one of the two USB-C ports using the included AC adaptor and cable.Accessories included:* Built in protective case / kickstand* USB-C to USB-C cable* USB-A to USB-C (mostly for external power, when needed* HDMI-standard to HDMI-mini.* 5v/3A USB-A power adaptorOther features:* Built-in speakers are fine for a quiet room.* Surface buttons: Menu, +/-, Power/Back button for navigating built in menus* Menus allow adjustment of numerous video and audio settings, or switching between different inputs. It functions like any modern-day LCD monitor with all the same features.I highly recommend this for someone who needs a small, lightweight, portable external monitor. The price is right. Quality seems quite good.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic video quality, great for laptops or Switch, but lacks audio output, has awful interface.",
                "reviewText": "For the price, this thing is unbeatable. Good physical design, fantastic picture quality for the price, a lot of options (including HDR), and legit portability. It's particularly good if you plan on using it with a Nintendo Switch. Overall, it checks almost all the right boxes, but with a few notable caveats.The picture quality is surprisingly good. Once properly adjusted, the monitor is bright with good contrast, and doesn't look washed out. It also has a surprisingly broad viewing angle It's not going to win any awards, but it easily beats many full-sized monitors in the same price range.The HDR is surprisingly decent: it's pretty hard to get good HDR on ANY monitors in this price range, but this one somehow pulls it off. Again, it's not going to win any awards, but the fact that it has it at all is pretty cool. If the picture quality doesn't immediately meet your expectations, there are plenty of options tweak to your hearts content. However, those options are where its biggest problems lie, which I'll get into shortly.In terms of design, the portfolio-style cover/stand is a handsome dark granite grey with contrasting stitching, which looks great. However, unlike most portable monitors, it lacks any sort of magnet, clip, or elastic band to keep the portfolio closed when not in use. Not a deal-breaker, but noticeable if this isn't your first portable monitor. That said, the monitor and portfolio are very thin, which makes it easy to slip this into a small backpack, or anywhere else a thin 15.6\" laptop would fit.The monitor can powered with its included power cable or via USB, which means it can be powered by your laptop, game console, or Nintendo Switch dock. It can display video through both HDMI or USB-C sources. For Switch users, you can plug the monitor directly into the USB-C port on the bottom of the console to simultaneously display video and charge the Switch, which is a nice perk (you'll still need a power source for the monitor itself, obviously). In terms of being a portable monitor, it does everything it's supposed to, and thensome.The back panel of the monitor itself is a cool brushed metal, while the rest of the monitor is cased in the usual plastic. The built-in speakers are decent for what they are; not very loud and obviously lacks anything but treble, but relatively clear and not as tinny as most portable monitor speakers.Unfortunately, this is where its first problem shows up: there's no 3.5mm RCA output. Most monitor makers are aware that their built-in speakers are budget-bin quality and used as a last resort, so they give you a 3.5mm jack to output to speakers with more oomph, but this monitor lacks that. For Switch and PC users, this might not be a problem, but for PS4 users, this is something to note, as the PS4 console only outputs audio through either HDMI or Optical SPDIF (its even refuses to connect to Bluetooth speakers). If you were planning to use an analog 2.1 speaker set with this, you'll need to plug it into your controller, which is awkward. Not a deal-breaker for most people, but definitely a problem for me. Considering that cheaper portable monitors have 3.5mm audio jacks, this omission is odd.Finally, we reach the big problem that'll affect nearly everyone: the menu interface. This is possibly the worst I've used. The menu controls boil down to just three buttons: a Menu button that doubles as an \"enter\" button, a Left button, and a Right button that doubles as an \"exit\" button. The first problem: the Left and Right buttons are REVERSED. This means if you want to go left, you press the Right button; to go right, you press the Left button. Considering that all menus and adjustments are arranged horizontally, this makes menu navigation and adjustment more confusing than it needs to be.Second, to back out from menus, you long-press the Right button, which becomes problematic when adjusting settings. You can hold down the Left button to quickly adjust settings in that direction, but holding down the Right button will kick you out of the menu and CANCEL your adjustments, forcing you to start over. Imagine trying to adjust the volume on your TV. Here, you're capable of increasing the volume very quickly by holding the up button, but to lower the volume, you can only tap the down button repeatedly, and if you accidentally hold it too long, it'll kick you out of the Volume menu and then RESET the volume. Now imagine having to do that for dozens of menus and submenus. Once again, it's needlessly wonky.One last problem is the coloring of the menu options. In cases where you only have two options, the options are identified with contrasting colors, but which color is \"on\" and which is \"off?\" It's not immediately apparent. You'd have to find another menu that has multiple options to figure out what you should be looking for, which isn't fun when your lefts and rights are reversed and accidentally holding a button kicks you out of the menus entirely.All that said, you'd (ideally) only really need to adjust the settings once, and the lack of a 3.5mm RCA jack isn't going to keep most people up at night, so those problems are somewhat superfluous in comparison to its positives. For a compact, well-built portable monitor with excellent picture quality and solid synergy with laptops and Nintendo Switches, this is hard to top.",

It works right out of the box with minimum setup, just plug and play by simply connecting my laptop to the portable monitor with the provided usb-c to usb-c cable. In addition, it also comes with all other types of cables for other device connection. More importantly, the display is anti glare matte which it is perfect for using it outside. The colour is crispy with multiple colour profiles. I use it as a second screen for news, market watch and movies while my younger siblings also use it as a monitor for their Nintendo switch devices. The audio is what you can expect: clear and loud. Lastly, it has a good chassis as it feels pretty durable when I walk around with it. But more importantly, it comes with a pretty sleek protector to protect my portable monitor as well.",
