        "description": "You're being watched. Former University of Alberta lecturer Randy Craig is now working part-time at Edmonton's Grant MacEwan College, and struggling to make ends meet. That is, until she takes an evening job monitoring a chat room called Babel for an employer she knows only as Chatgod. Between shutting down an online bookie and patrolling for porn, Randy begins to suspect a connection between a Texas woman having an online affair through Babel, and surfacing reports of man killed at his computer in the same state.Soon, Randy realizes that a killer is brokering hits through Babel and may be operating in Edmonton. The police are skeptical, as is Chatgod, and it seems that Randy's only ally is Alchemist, a fellow monitor who is as mysterious as Chatgod. Randy doesn't know whom she can trust, but the killer is on to her, and now she must figure out who, and where the psychopath is, all the while staying one IP address ahead of becoming the next victim.",

I want a good story, in an interesting place, with characters who have enough depth that not only do I care what happens to them, I want to know more about them.Janice MacDonald delivers all that in a whodunit with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering right up until the end just how it's all going to turn out. In the meantime, it's fun to run around Edmonton with Randy Craig, whose friends I'd kinda like to have for my own, and whose enemies I'm genuinely glad I don't have to deal with!",

As one who has been a denizen of several online communities as well as having worked as a moderator, the details of the story ring true and make it easy to become immersed in the story as Randy tries to deal with the probablity that someone she \"knows\" is a a killer. Fun, fast and an overall good read!",
