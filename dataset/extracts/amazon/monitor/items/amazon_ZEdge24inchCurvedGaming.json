But I don't move it that much so it's no big deal for me. Looks good, I use external speakers so the speaker quality is of no importance to me.Update: I bought a $25 mounting bracket on Amazon and it is perfect. I purchased this monitor and an AOC monitor but the AOC wouldn't show up with my MacBook. This monitor is a great value and perfect for my needs. (Light gaming, looking at Twitter, watching things, editing videos, making music.) I would definitely recommend this monitor.",

It has a good quality image, 1080 with a decent refresh rate. The stand is minimalistic and doesn't take much desk space, personally I will end up wall-mounting it or using a monitor arm like I did for my other screens. Looks like it is Vesa mount compatible which will give me more flexibility since the stand offers a limited movement like most stands. Has a hdmi input, audio jack and a couple of respectable built-in speakers.happy with this monitor since I purchased it as used",
