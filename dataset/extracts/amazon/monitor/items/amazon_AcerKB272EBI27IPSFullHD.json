                "reviewText": "Please keep the price in mind when you read this review. With that in mind:This is a remarkably good monitor. It has in its favor:1. The picture is very sharp. I have bad vision and I can read it without my glasses!2. The picture is more than bright enough, even in a well lit room.3. The blacks and contrast are wonderful.4. The color is beautuful. Maybe if I was doing PROFESSIONAL photofinishing or video production I might quibble, but then again maybe not.5. It is excellent even for my style of gaming (Quake2, Alien Arena, Super Tux Cart, etc.) so the drop to 100 Hz from 144 Hz really isn't very noticable.6. Even though I have the VA panel version, I have not been bothered by \"ghosting\" at all, even at 100 Hz.7. Although I would have liked a metal stand, the plastic with some metal stand that comes with it is quite sturdy. And its easily wall mountable. (In fact, I now have it VESA mounted on a desktop stand that rotates it between landscape and portrait orientation.)Against it:1. If I really try I can tell a slight difference between it's 100 Hz and my Nitro 5's built in 144 Hz, but only using the type of really intense games that I do not generally play. And even then I can still play them.2. I have no need for a VGA port, and it has only 1 HDMI port. But, an external HDMI switch can be quite inexpensive, even with remote control, especially considering the low cost of the monitor. I got a 3-1 switch so I could connect my computer, a TV tuner and an Amazon Fire stick.All in all, for me, this is a really great monitor. I will almost certainly end up with one or two more in the series. I have to say that Acer really outdid itself with this one as to value for $$$. Well done Acer!Addendum. I should have mentioned this. This monitor has no speakers/sound, To use the HDMI switch and use this to watch TV I had to put a HDMI audio extractor between the switch and the monitor and connect the audio output to a small external amplifier. Ended up with very good sound. Much better than any computer monitor I've ever had.",

I can't really give any feedback on gaming though because I'm not into that. Pictures, movies, videos, color and everyday office work has been an upgrade compared to my old old system.

                "reviewText": "These reviews are mixed together; I have the 27\" IPS 100hz version. I use the HDMI (digital) port for connection, but it's nice that this monitor also has a VGA (analog) input option as VGA is a past standard for older computers. To my eyes the brightness and colors are great right out of the box, and the picture is very clear. I don't play fast-action video games, so I can't comment on how well it works for those. But for text, spreadsheets, and normal web browsing (including YouTube) this works very well.Positives:IPS (for me) is preferable to VA type monitors. It's a small difference but if you are picky, here's IPS.The border is very thin, thus you've got maximum usable screen space with almost no waste.The price was incredible at $120. I see that it's now $160 and I think still a good value there.Great picture right out of the box.VESA wall (or arm) mountable.Choice of HDMI or VGA input.Looks good with the power on or off.Potential negatives (for some people):Provided base is very wide at the bottom, and possibly difficult to attach to monitor. I tried briefly to attach the screen to the base, instructions say something about turning it to attach securely - I couldn't figure out how to attach it securely. This didn't matter to me because I planned to use a \"monitor arm\" (I have one from MOUNTUP) and that works great on my computer desk which is about 1\" thick. But if you want to use the included base, I'm not sure how to attach it securely, and I might ding it a star for that.The AC to DC power convertor (aka power supply) is inside the monitor, which gives it an elegant look vs. a separate power supply. However, if the power supply dies, good luck replacing it. At the price paid this is ok, and might even be preferable for some people.The power cord and connections to the computer (HDMI or VGA) attach upward from the bottom, rather than straight into the back. Again this looks more elegant but I would prefer straight into the back, as that is easier to attach. You might need to do some fumbling around before you get it all connected.The monitor is adjustable for brightness, colors, on/off etc. from the back of the unit on the right side. These are easily reached by \"feel\" once you know where they are, and which is which. One of the switches starts an on-screen \"menu\" that you can navigate. I made it appear but haven't tried to adjust it. This is probably how all monitors adjust now, but I preferred the old days when monitors had 5 or so physical switches on the front or bottom edge, so you could change brightness, color hue, etc. Of course those monitors were also much more expensive than today's monitors, for a smaller picture that wasn't as good as today's. Just saying that if you want to change the settings, it may take some fumbling to get the hang of it.It doesn't have the pixel density of more expensive monitors, but for my use I don't need it the higher density. To me the picture and text looks really good from where I sit, which is about 2 feet away.Overall this is fantastic for my uses as a VESA-mounted non-gaming monitor, and incredible at the price I paid. The only frustration I can imagine is if you use the included base/stand and can't figure out how to secure it to the screen (there must be a way, I would think, but I didn't try very hard since I was going to use an external \"arm\" mount anyway). Or if you do fast-action gaming, maybe it's not as good as some, but I have no idea about that.",

                "reviewText": "If you have a monitor arm this gets 5 stars.Good image, easy to navigate controls. great price.If you have to use the included stand, drop that by a star. It's pretty lousy.I am buying a 2nd one (my 2nd monitor at my desk is an ancient 24\" one - maybe 15 years old) - both of those are on monitor arms so the stand is a non issue. The other is for my computer in our conference room and I wince whenever I adjust it - just flimsy.",
