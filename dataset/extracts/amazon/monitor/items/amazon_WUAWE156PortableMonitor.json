I use it with myLaptop for work since I need 2-3 monitors and it\u2019s a nice space saving option but also easy to move around if I need to take work with me. Lightweight, doesn\u2019t weight down my monitor mount/holder. Don\u2019t let the lower price scare you it\u2019s definitely a great product and an awesome price point!",

I purposely have not used this tablet for any other purposes to keep the memory clear of unnecessary garbage.
