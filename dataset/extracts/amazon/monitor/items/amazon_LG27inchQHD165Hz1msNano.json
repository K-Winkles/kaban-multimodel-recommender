                "reviewText": "Upgraded my PC and decided it should have an upgraded monitor to go with it.This is a great display for both gaming and other less graphically intensive activities. Perfect size for my setup and 2K resolution that I typically run in my games. Was looking at 4K monitors but realized I didn't want to shell out the additional cost for the PC components to run 4K resolution while gaming.I really appreciate the adaptive refresh rate abilities of this monitor, as it keeps what's on screen smooth with no flickers or tearing. I don't notice any eye fatigue during long game or work sessions.Colors are good. White is white. Black is about as black as you can get with this type of display panel. Numerous options in the on-screen menus to adjust different color settings if desired, or just use one of a few presets.The built-in USB hub was a feature I was specifically looking for in a gaming monitor. Was happy to find it in a model that didn't require a huge price premium as many others did.I also appreciate the ability to rotate between landscape and portrait orientation. There are times portrait orientation is a big help in my work.",

                "reviewText": "I recently decided it was finally time to upgrade to the realm of high resolution gaming. I looked around on Amazon and found this LG Ultragear for on sale from around $446. It came a day early and once I plugged it in, setup the resolution and HDR, booted up a game, and I admit, I did not really see the difference between 1080P and 1440P, but after testing it on a different game, I slowly came around.ProsResolution:The detail to the game was much more intense and after doing a back to back from my old monitor to my new one, I can say for certain that there\u2019s a bit of blur from the 1080P monitor compared to 1440P.Monitor features:I\u2019ve never thought the idea of using an LG brand monitor as I just never associated them with PC gaming as I had only ever gotten 1 LG TV throughout my life and I\u2019m honestly glad I decided to go with LG. The monitor easily installed into the stand and makes it easy to install other third party stands that are compatible. The menu design is pretty simplistic and easy to use. G-Sync has 3 settings within the monitor menu; off, basic, and extended. I\u2019ve yet to figure out what extended is for but I have mine on basic and it works great, much better than my old monitor which use to flicker which was very annoying..the monitor has an refresh rate overlock setting within the menu settings which was surprising as I assumed I would overlock through Nvidia control panel. I\u2019ve not touched that yet as I\u2019m perfectly happy with the refresh rate at 165Hz compared to my old monitor at 144Hz. Now one of the main reasons I decided to go with this LG brand the fast response time. I\u2019ve never had a monitor with a 1ms response time and with this monitor you can set between off, normal, faster, and fastest. I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly if I see a difference so far in the response time, but I am glad to have a monitor that as that specific feature built in along with the settings in the menu to adjust. The last two main settings is the the black stabilizer and the crosshair. I haven\u2019t had a need to change the stabilizer nor have I really tried out the crosshair feature yet, but I may play with it if I get on an FPS in the future.ConsNow, the only main problem I have with this monitor and the only reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 star instead of 5 out of 5 is the dang monitor stand! The monitor stand is huge! I do not like how big it is and wish they had designed something better as the stand bumps up against my computer which sits on the back of my desk and barely gives me room to set the keyboard in front. I do understand that this monitor is a bit on the heavier side, but they should have designed it in a much more compact design. The very back of the stand like awkwardly sticks out and just wasn\u2019t a very good design in my opinion. The only other thing that I\u2019d have to not like about it is my old monitor was a curved monitor and now coming back to a solid flat screen makes me really wish this was also a curved monitor.Now, this is bar far the best monitors I\u2019ve ever had but I am just coming from a 1080P monitor so their could be a much better monitor out there, but I think with this monitor on sale it was beyond worth it. I have always appreciated LG for their TV\u2019s and now I can honestly say I can appreciate them for their computer monitors as well. The only thing that is in dear need of improvement is the stand. If it had not been for the stand, this would have been the most perfect monitor and I\u2019d be completely in love with it. Other than that it is a beautiful monitor and works perfectly as I need it for. I\u2019d recommend getting this while it\u2019s on sale and also think about getting a different monitor stand to replace the default one. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I have spent almost 8 months searching for a gaming monitor 144hz and above, 1440p IPS. I've been in local PC stores to check out a few like the Dell S2721DGF and Gigabyte G27 among other MSI and ASUS TIF ones in this price range. This LG 27GP850-B was a bit more expensive even while on sale BUT worst every single penny. I went ahead and purchased two of them for dual monitor setup.This monitor can get a little too bright, there is ZERO ghosting that I've seen, no backlight bleed (yes.. NONE) and the 165hz or 180hz OC is noticeable. This nano IPS technology is awesome. IThe only thing I don't like about this monitor is how heavy and bulky the stand is and there are better stands out there but I purchased a monitor arm to mount both onto it and it's perfect. Also when powering down the monitor in a multi-monitor setup, sometimes the windows get pushed into 1 monitor when you turn them back on but can be resolved via the NVIDIA control panel although I do not have this issue happen often.This monitor is GREAT for TV Shows/Movies and Office work, which another main reason I wanted a 1440p.Do NOT hesitate to purchase this.. trust me I have gone through countless reviews and I'm glad I went with an LF panel compared to an AU Optronics or Sharp.",

I did a quick side by side, I have an older i7-4790k paired with a 980ssc GPU, and two identical newer PCs running 5600x's and 3070's and the image quality at the same settings for Elden Ring was mind boggling.Played faster frame FPS games and it was comparable to my BenQ 144hz.In the end, high frames, not a bad price, image quality is fantastic.The only negative is that I use the monitor usb pass through for my wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.Whenever I use the usb cable to charge my keyboard, it shorts the usb slot on the monitor.Had to get LG customer service to help me remedy the issue, by turning off the monitor and cycling it by unplugging the monitor from the surge protector.That's been the only negative so far.",
