                "reviewText": "This monitor was an upgrade to a 24\" flat panel I have been using for work for years, after having occasional difficulty focusing (progressive age-related far-sightedness). I had moved up to 2.0 readers and still sometimes found myself leaning in or squinting.I chose a curved monitor since the increased viewing angle out toward the edge of a wide flat screen can cause dimming. That was never a problem with the smaller monitor but I was concerned it might be with this one.It has taken me about a week to get used to the curved screen - it's a little weird if you have not used one before. However, I have grown to appreciate it - it reduces the change in viewing distance from middle to edge, which may reduce eyestrain since your eye is not having to refocus as much. The larger size has completely resolved the sharpness issue. I have been able to scale back to 1.75 readers and still have zero issues with reading text. I have even been able to reduce font size in some applications, yet still see more sharply than before.I cannot speak to its value as a gaming monitor but I suspect it would be wonderful. The view is more immersive than with a flat panel.With my work laptop I run it at 1920x1080 resolution, which is the best the laptop GPU will do.Assembly and connections were completely straightforward. The only caveat is that the screen is a bit heavy and the weight is centered somewhat forward of the hinge where the stand attaches to the back of the monitor. The screen seemed to want to \"droop\" forward after setting it up, but after moving the hinge through its full range a few times, it has been stable.The monitor comes with an HDMI cable which was too short to be of use in my installation (though the laptop sits right next to the monitor). However, I suspect most people (as I did) already have longer cables to hand that will work.",

Base is constructed in a way that leaves desktop space under the monitor for other items like cell phone and office supplies. Highly recommended for this purpose.One thing I don't like is lack of easy buttons to brightness modes. My old monitor had an easy eco mode / normal / video / custom mode controlled by a simple button along the bottom edge. This monitor has a toggle joystick on the back that's harder to use and has only \"normal\" and \"eye saver\" modes on the front page of menu. The eye save mode is useless to me due to the awful color temperature.",

                "reviewText": "Positive: The monitor\u2019s packaging has many protective features. The result was no dead, faded-colored, or dim pixels. The screen has a matte film over the screen, which significantly decreases eye strain due to prolonged uses. I have not slowly played back footage of the screen. This being said, I have not been able to observe any screen tearing. (Screen tearing is when a portion of the screen has not update in sync with the other portion. This results in the screen showing a different image for a split second.) With that being said, I believe the refresh rate is fast enough for this monitor.The 1080p resolution works well with this size monitor. (4K has much less of an effect on small screens.)The sleek stand has a relatively small footprint, yet is very sturdy. The bezel around the edges is very slim. Easy access for power cord and HDMI port. The digital menu can be easily navigated. The menu is operated through a joystick which is depressible. Overall clean design, easy menu flow, and quality image.Negative: I wish there was a quicker way to turn the monitor off. One must press the joy-stick down and scroll through a menu to the toggle off. There is not much more (for me) to comment on.(Personal opinion):The silver tone bezel adds a nice touch. As a gamer this has a fast enough refresh rate, and rgb range to handle any games/interfaces I have used.Conclusion:I would highly recommend this monitor. It works great for gaming as well as an everyday computer monitor.",

But the monitor was sooo nice and looked fancy! I liked the curve a lot and I miss this monitor already. My partner accidentally broke it so I\u2019m not using a larger 4K monitor from Samsung too, but it\u2019s flat and you really notice the difference in comfort when editing and viewing it over a long period of time.",
