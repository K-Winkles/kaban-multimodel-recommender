                "reviewText": "I researched which size would be best for having a split screen, as I needed way more screen than my work laptop was affording, and this did the trick! I now have my laptop screen to the right to monitor emails, and have the new large screen on my left, connected by HDMI, split in two screens with a browser on each side for working within my programs. It is easy to close my laptop to turn the screen black, and opening my laptop turns it back on. I did adjust the brightness to maximum, but it would be fine normal, too. This was the right price point, on the lower end for the size, and had decent reviews. It was packaged very well and meticulously. You might want help initially to unpack it since you have to slide the base on and the screen is heavy, just in case. The base is ok, kind of large, but it's supporting a large heavy screen. I usually just stick my keyboard on top when I need more space and am not using it. Glad I ended up getting this one after my research. \ud83d\udc4c",

The refresh rate is lower at the highest resolution but it is super responsive and doesn't strain my middle-aged eyes at all. I use the monitor all day for work. Not used for gaming but it seems like it would do fine, videos are great. I have it connected to a Macbook Pro. When connected through a dongle adapter there was a lag, but connected directly to the computer the response is immediate, the delay was in the dongle and not the monitor itself. I would recommend.",

I just upgraded to a 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro and wanted to get my desk set up with a dual monitor scheme using the laptop as the smaller, secondary screen and a larger 4K monitor as my main workspace.Though I'm an Apple guy and don't really like most of Dell's offerings, their monitors are great, well reviewed and of high quality. This one is 32\" and 4K.I initially had some issues getting the monitor and the laptop to recognize each other but when I unplugged the 8K HDMI 2.1 cable and re-plugged it into the Dell Monitor, everything worked perfectly.A note to Mac Users/Designers. I did a bunch of messing around with the settings on both the Dell monitor and within System Preferences>Displays on the macOS (Sonoma) and found the settings in the second photo to work the best, both for color accuracy and consistency between the Dell screen and the MacBook Pro screen to the left of it in the first photo. Definitely select \"Apple RGB\" in the color profile for the Dell Monitor.",

For my previous wide-screen monitor, I had to fumble with monitor buttons - not anymore!The software didn't work with a docking station though, needs a straight computer - HDMI/DP cable.Also, I don't think the Dell Display Manager hotkeys don't work unless logged in.",

It was the size of the TV I was using previously for a second monitor off to the side but this one really is big and if you are up close to it, may not be the right size for you. If you have some distance, you should be good to go.My initial unit came with issues and would turn off and on. Going on sites that used 4K like Netflix would cause it to turn off until I switched it off and then the picture would come back. I had to do this each time...until it stopped working altogether, all within a span of a week. Rather than returning it, I wanted to get a replacement since I was able to get it at as a Black Friday discount and didn't want a refund and have to repurchase it, so I went through Dell who had great support and quickly sent me a new one and a return label for the old one to be sent back. Now I have no issues at all.Really great quality video. Great if you are into watching 4K videos or just for gaming. Each person that stopped by over the holidays wanted to check out the 4k quality and were amazed with it. I had a friend who decided to buy it based on what he saw.It is a great monitor. I am using it with DisplayPort and it is perfect.Dell monitors are still some of the best and longest lasting I have used and my last one was a 24\" LED that is about 10+ years old and still going without issues. I just wanted something I could use for workouts, watching tv, gaming, school, etc on.I recommend it.",
