Great if you work with a lot of data and need a second screen to avoid going back and forth between documents.The sad part is that it does not connect with all laptops and phones. Check your output capability on your phone and laptop before even getting a second screen. If it works, this is a great screen. I do see some spots on the screen when it is about to turn off but that hasn't affected my work. Customer service was top notch too! The screen wasn't working with my phone. I got help right away. They checked with their tech team and helped me check my phone output. Sadly my phone doesn't have the output capability. Would suggest this to a friend or anyone looking for a phone.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good overall portable monitor",
                "reviewText": "This is a preliminary review, but as long as it doesn't fail or wow me in any other ways, I won't add anything more.Use: I needed a portable monitor to pair with my 2021 Asus Zephyrus G15 for work. I'm an IT Engineer and use multi-monitors everywhere I go. I find being limited to my laptop's monitor very confining.Initial appearance: The monitor is clean without any tacky logos. That's a real plus. The monitor doesn't appear to flex much, and ships with a cover / stand which is necessary for travel. Thin bezels on all sides look attractive. The 3 levels of tilt from the cover are good. I prefer the middle level.Build quality: It doesn't seem fully metal like the description, but build quality seems good. The monitor and frame look good and are assembled without noticeable issues. The cover is plastic material that seems a little thin, but should stand up to stains well. It has a magnetic clasp for holding it shut. The controls on the right side feel wimpy, so I'll be careful with them. The clickwheel, while easy to use, feels especially weak.Picture quality: Good, not sure if it's fully color accurate, but it seems close. It's an IPS display that's listed as 400 nits brightness, but I'd estimate it is closer to 300nits at top backlight level, similar to my G15's ~335 max, but not as bright. I'd recommend avoiding UltraHDR mode. It doesn't appear to work over a singular USB-C cable. Resolution is 1920x1080, 60hz. It supports slower hertz settings, but I wouldn't recommend it. Text is crisp and easy to read. I immediately maxed out the backlight to 10/10.Connectivity: You have the choice of micro HDMI to HDMI or USB-C to USB-C via displayport. If your laptop has a DP logo on the port, it should work, and if it provides enough power over USB-C, it should all work on one cable. That's a major plus for me. There's also another USB-C port for the power brick and a micro USB I'm assuming for power as well, but no included cable. Powering the monitor off my laptop forces it to use the built-in GPU, a 3070 mobile, which causes the whole setup to drain power much faster than it would otherwise. I'd recommend using your power brick or a charger with your laptop, otherwise you'll have half as much battery as you'd normally be used to.Overall: I like it. It's disappointing that it's only ~300 nits brightness since it was advertised at 400, but I can live with it. The USB-C to DP connection can be a little squirrelly and might take some repeated unplugging to fix, but it seems to work well enough. I like the build quality, the picture quality and the weight. It's not a great choice for gamers with only 60hz, but it's a good fit for professionals on the go who need a second monitor.What's in the box?1x portable monitor1x micro HDMI to HDMI cable, ~4 foot (for display only)1x USB-C to USB-C cable, ~4 foot (for power and display)1x USB-C to USB-A cable, ~4 foot (for power only)1x power brick, meant to be used with the USB-C to USB-A cable if using the HDMI cable or your laptop's USB power doesn't provide enough power1x instruction manual, simple but generally useful",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this monitor on sale and I am very happy with the features and performance that you get for the price. I tried connecting the monitor via HDMI and via USB-C to USB-C cable. Everything worked well. Initially it took me awhile to get the monitor working as a second display via USB-C, but that was because I used my own USB-C to USB-C cable instead of the one that comes with the monitor. Once I used the provided USB-C to USB-C cable everything worked like clockwork. I used the monitor with a Samsung Galaxy S21+, and iPad Pro and two different Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Tablet (one of them is an older Gen 1). The screen was flicker free and I used it at the full 1920x1080 resolution. Be aware, that If there is no data connection (via HDMI or USB-C) the monitor just cycles through different colors and you can't get the set-up menu of the monitor. but once you get a monitor picture you can bring-up the settings menu. The picture is sharp, but the colors are not quite as vivid and bright as in a high-end monitor. However, for the price, I think you get great value. I also like that you can plug your USB-C [laptop] power supply into one of the two USB-C ports of the monitor and then connect & power your laptop / phone / tablet via the second USB-C port using the USB-C to USB-C cable. That keeps your desk nice and clutter free from too many cables. Be aware that this model does not have a touchscreen. If you want one, then you have to go with a model that's a quite a bit pricier.",

                "reviewText": "The big thing I was concerned about was it power passthrough supported laptops. This is critical if you want to charge your laptop while using the monitor and only have one USB C port free. The documentation only talks about using it to power your phone.Yes! You can plug your laptop power adapter into the power-in and it will charge your laptop. You can also use a USB C power bank to get extended life with no mains power.On top of that, this monitor far exceeds the documentation. The monitor supports HDR, DCR and a wide variety of adjustments and has quite acceptable colour quality. The saturation is a little low for my taste but very much on par with most laptops and consumer monitors.The documentation is weak, and I have found no on-line sources for more thorough documentation such as advanced settings a connection options (including power passthrough). It comes with a screen protector with no instructions or tools to install. After a couple of attempts, it ended in the recycling.This monitor is so thin and light that the laptop AND the monitor in it's protective cover fits nicely in my laptop sleeve. This was a great purchase to allow me to do serious work when travelling.",

Display and power in one convenient cable.It comes with all the cables you'll need (if you can't do the above)Really affordableBuilt in speakersCons:Picture looks washed out I tried to adjust it but that comes to my second conOn screen control buttons are horrible.If you go into the screen menu and try to adjust brightness, good luck. It seems to be locked out by some other setting and I have yet to find that setting. Plainly speaking the instructions and screen menu controls are hot trash. All they had to do was include one more button with the other three and they could have greatly simplified setting the monitor up in the controls. As it is now you have to press the \"menu\" button and then press and hold it to get into a menu...or is that press it a second time. In any case, it's a foolish way of doing things and an addition button for \"enter\" would have made things so much easier.So I'll keep on trying to figure out how to reduce that washed out look on the screen, I guess.As an added bonus it has built in speakers but they are only what I would call adequate. But if your laptop speakers are nonfunctional it would do the trick for you.Overall though it's a really good screen for what it costs and, if you want a secondary monitor for your laptop, it does the trick.",
