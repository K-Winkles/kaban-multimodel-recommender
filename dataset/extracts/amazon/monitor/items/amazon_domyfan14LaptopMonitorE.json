I have a 17\u201d HP laptop and this portable monitor snaps on seamlessly to my laptop. It is very secure and does not slide off during use. The screen also rotates inwards and outwards. The clarity of the screen is actually clearer than my laptop screen (sub par work issued laptop). You can also adjust the brightness and can receive sound as well. Set up took only 5 minutes, quick plug and play. The product comes with three types of wires that you can choose from based on the ports you have on your current device. There is no need to purchase anything in addition to the product as everything you need is included. The bonus is the very cute travel bag that it comes with, I have been using it for a few weeks now and have had no issues. Solid product with a great price point.",

It came with 2 different power adapters so you can use with a USB-C or HDMI connection. It fits in my laptop bag easily and came with a very nice case. It was very easy to attach to my laptop and the display is great! I don't think you could go wrong with this choice !",

                "reviewText": "I work from home full time. I ordered the portable monitor to use when I travel so I can work with ease. The monitor comes with a carrying bag and 3 cords that you can choose from to connect to your laptop depending on what ports you have available. The weight of the product is good. Not too heavy but also not light where you question the quality. The image quality is great. The value for money is very good. It isn\u2019t overpriced like the other options out there. It is stable when you attach it to your laptop and there is no lag in performance. It\u2019s just like having a traditional second monitor. If you are looking for a portable monitor this is the one to buy.",

It is definitely plug-and-play, and the screen looks nice. Even with the extra folding piece it is slim enough to fit in the laptop sleeve of a book bag. It fit snuggly onto a laptop as a second monitor, but the kickstand also allows it to be used as a single monitor (with a bit of privacy to boot). My only selfish wish is that the laptop mounting side was detachable and the kickstand was on the monitor side for versatility of usage. Otherwise, it has been well worth the money so far.",
