The menu is really nice and has a lot of options to adjust the coloring and the look so it\u2019s flexible for your needs. The speakers have a pretty good sound nothing too fancy but not bad. I was glad to see this monitor actually had speakers because for some reason I couldn\u2019t find many that you didn\u2019t have to buy speakers for. All in all I believe it\u2019s worth the price, especially if it\u2019s for your kid I think it\u2019s definitely enjoyable.",

In no shape or form are these gaming monitors nor do they have the sound quality of any decent speaker, but when it came to simply fulfilling my need for multiple screens at a budget price and a clean quality display. These have worked for four years.",

                "reviewText": "For how affordable this thing is, it does exactly the job I need it to do and honestly beyond. I need my monitor at eye height because of neck strain but my keyboard at hip level for the same reason (posture) and instead of becoming a contortionist I just figured it'd be easier to get another monitor to hook up to via HDMI. My slightly more expensive -- but still on the cheaper side -- gaming monitor didn't come with internal speakers and it's been a colossal pain to hook up my external speakers to it in order to get sound, so my mission this time was to find an AFFORDABLE yet-not-crap monitor for writing that would also allow me to listen to music through my laptop. No fuss, no extra wires.I love this little guy so much. Conveniently placed buttons on the side, all the hookups you'll need, and it looks exactly like my computer monitor: no more, no less, which again is exactly what I wanted. I won't pretend that the sound isn't compressed, the speakers ARE small, so don't expect your bass to shake the roof off your house. But in terms of functionality, personality, affordability? This thing is AWESOME. Super easy on the wallet, cute, and does the job. Love it love it love it. <3",
