                "reviewText": "This monitor looks great, decent colors, it's nice and big, the monitor menu controls are great, and the refresh rate is nice as smooth in combination with Freesync Premium. However.. Coming from an IPS panel this is quite the jarring experience. This monitor is VA and with that in mind, it has an insane amount of blur, I would go so far as to say it isn't even blur, it smears. PUBG is absolutely impossible to play with how bad it is, but most other games it isn't absolutely terrible and you don't notice it. The major redeeming quality is getting a 32\" panel with Freesync Premium at just a hair over $200. I'm still happy with my purchase and I'm sure I'll get used to it over time. But beware if you have an IPS panel, because this will be extremely noticeable.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Samsung delivered with this monitor, if you can get it for MSRP.I couldn't find a single review (literally) for this monitor when I bought it (July 2022), so I was basing my expectations on older G32A reviews, which were somewhat neutral or even negative.Pros:- the menu is accessible through a single button/joystick located just underneath the display, which is standard now in 2022 for Samsung G series, and once you use the interface you'll understand why people love it.- G-SYNC capable if you connect via DisplayPort. This monitor came with \"Freesync Premium\" already enabled, and in the Nvidia control panel you can adjust G-Sync settings (see picture). Officially, this monitor is not validated or certified as G-Sync compatible, but I've experienced no issues, no flickering, no image degradation, etc.- it's a VA (vertical Alignment LED) panel, with really good response time. Ghosting is very minimal with blur busters testing (see video).- Colors are crisp and accurate across the display.- Contrast is quite good for (what is now in 2022) old-school non-HDR technology, with very little light bleed and no color blending/creeping that I can perceive.- It's not curved.Cons:- a bit pricey for a 1080p display that hasn't been G-Sync verified.- Not G-Sync capable through HDMI that I'm aware of, but that's normal- Speakers are crap or don't exist (probably the latter), however this monitor does has a headphone jack to pass through audio from DP/HDMI. I don't see this as a con really since I never use built-in speakers, but windows does still detect the display's audio and will need to be disabled if that becomes a nuisance.Summary:I was looking for a larger, non-curved 1080p display with a relatively high variable refresh rate, that was also capable of G-Sync (even if unofficially and unverified), and had solid color, contrast and response time. I got pretty much what I was looking for, despite not knowing what to expect with a newer model that didn't have any real reviews that I could find.I also appreciate that it isn't curved. Curved displays have high tension at the corners of the screen, and will honeycomb and crack if you so much as sneeze the wrong way at them. It's a cool gimmick, but for 16:9 aspect ratio it's a waste. Curved displays make sense for ultrawide 21:9 monitors, but not for 16:9. Good job keeping it simple with this display, Samsung.",
