The Full HD 1080P screen displays crystal clear and bright images perfect for both work and recreational use. 75Hz refresh rate ensures smooth transitions especially during gaming and video playing while VESA compatibility provides a range of mounting options. The built-in speakers that have rather good audio quality mean no need for external sound equipment. The sleek black appearance not only brings sophistication to my workspace but also fits perfectly with the monitor\u2019s thin frame helping conserve space. Due to its cost-effectiveness, this monitor is one of the top picks in terms of functionality and price. I can definitely recommend this monitor to those looking for a reliable monitor display.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, the image quality and brightness are remarkable. The built-in USB hub keeps me from having to plug in all my peripherals separately. The speakers are good enough for basic listening intelligibility, but not what I would want to use to listen to music.I bought this monitor to replace an aging 20 inch unit. The AmazonBasics monitor with AOC technology is considerably brighter and clearer than my old one. I used AOC monitors exclusively in the past so I expected good image quality and performance. This model did not disappoint.The buit-in speakers work reasonably well for sounds related to system notifications or spoken words. If you want to listen to music you will need an additional speaker. Thankfully there is an audio out and a headset port built into the monitor.My desk setup has the AmazonBasics monitor and another connected via hdmi to an Anker 553 USB-C hub. The AmazonBasics monitor is also connected to the Anker hub via the monitor\u2019s USB B port. This allows me to leave my webcam, keyboard, and mouse plugged into the AmazonBasics monitor for a permanent desk setup. When I am ready to work I simply connect the single USB C cable from the Anker hub to my laptop. This single connection gives me access to everything I need thanks to the monitor\u2019s built-in USB hub.When I purchased it in early 2023 it was $150. It is a great monitor at a great price.",

The inclusion of built-in speakers is a convenient addition for those looking to avoid external audio setups.

                "reviewText": "I needed a basic monitor for a remote office setup with infrequent use. I got tired of lugging a monitor back and forth for those rare occasions when I needed to sit down in front of something there. For the price, this monitor was perfect. Good size and good full HD picture quality. The inputs were just what I needed too since I have a variety of HDMI, DisplayPort and even an old system with VGA. All of those work fine and it means I could keep different ones connected and use the menu to switch to the input I need based on what computer I'm working on. I finally got to ditch my old DP to HDMI adapter I had been using with my old monitor which lacked DisplayPort.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a 27\" monitor to use as a Roku video base. I needed this size and a center support. Traditional TVs jump from 24\" to 32\" and virtually all have wide legs. So, I looked for a monitor with built in speakers and lots of input options. This seemed to fit the bill. I plugged in a Roku stick and then learned a few things. First, i can't control the monitor volume or turn the unit on/off with the Roku remote. OK, I can work around that. Second, I can't turn the Roku on/off with the remote either since I am getting power from the monitor USB. Third, and probably most important, the sound quality of this monitor is atrociously bad. I will probably put this monitor into service as my new mac monitor and go buy a 24\" Roku TV. Oh well, I tried!",
