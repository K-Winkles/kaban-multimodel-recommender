                "reviewText": "The feature that had me looking hard at this model was the picture-beside-picture mode. I have a macbook for personal use and a windows laptop for work. Both of them have USB-C ports.IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT USB-C: if you buy a second cable, search for \"thunderbolt\". Many USB-C cables support the same power capacity, but are limited to the USB 2.0 speed, which is insufficient for the huge data rate of high-resolution video. Also, if you want to use the power supplied by the monitor, make sure the cable is rated for the wattage your device uses. It is *really* nice having just one slim cable going to my laptop, and no hub or docking station needed.Switching from one device to side-by-side was easy, and both the mac and windows machine recognized the changed dimensions and adapted quickly. There's an option to choose which device gets to use the built-in speakers.I don't do a lot of gaming, but I fired up my favorite flight sim program, and it looked great (although my machine is not powerful enough to get high frame rates at full resolution). Did not notice any glitching that I have seen on older LCD panels.Physically, this monitor is perfect for me. I wanted it to be more or less towards the corner of my desk, and the curved design makes it fit nicely and not take up as much room as a flat panel would have. The bezel is black and, honestly, there's so much monitor, I don't even notice it. The bottom bezel is a matt silver/grey, and blends in with the rest of the room.It came with one USB-C cable, and one HDMI cable (oddly, the USB cable is black, while the HDMI cable is white - a better match for the back of the monitor.)My work involves sometimes having a lot of windows open with text - console connections to network equipment. With this monitor, I can have nine windows at least, probably 12, at a font setting big enough to be comfortably readable from almost four feet away.The speakers are okay for watching TV or having some soft music in the background, but they have a limited range. They are better than even the best laptop speakers (with possible exception of the new 16\" macbook pro) but even a modest pair of desktop speakers will give much better sound.There is a plate that covers all of the inputs and outputs, which means that even with two laptops, the back can look neat and finished - not the typical spaghetti on so many monitors. A big plus if the back of the display is visible to others.Overall, the monitor does everything I wanted to do, does it simply, and has a picture that's absolutely fantastic.",

I don't need microsecond response or (inevitably second-rate) speakers or extra connectivity, etc. I just need a first-class display and lots of resolution without wasting money.This is one, and the newest, of 4 monitors that I run in the studio. It configured effortlessly, performs wonderfully, and has lots of tweaks available that I don't really need. It squanders no space on a big frame or deep profile and weighs less than any of my other large monitors (which saves money on the mounting arms).And that checks every box I had. As a general purpose, quality monitor at a great price, I recommend this one highly.",

I went from dual 22\" monitors to this Ultra-wide AND I CAN NEVER GO BACK! My Mac is a Macbook Air M2. I run both my Dell work PC and my personal Mac in clam-shell mode and swap after work.Monitor Pro's - Great picture quality out of the box. Very sharp for work. - Screen real-estate for work has improved my productivity. I have 3 apps displayed at once. - Refresh rate has been very good for my needs. I don't notice any lags but I am not a hard core gamer. I have played COD3 on it and it looks/plays very well. - The Hub is a great feature. One USB-C cable does it all. - I can easily swap my Mac and PC and the monitor works perfectly for both - Speakers are pretty solid for my uses...they work well.Con's - The USB hub only has 2 ports. I bought a small USB hub to extend this for my mouse, cam, mic, etc.. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F2J2DN7?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1 - No built in camera. I like to use a USB cam anyway, so not a big deal for me. - no built in mic. I bought an external mic that works very well. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GPPQH9B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsNote: I found they eye saver mode was a little too dim and the default mode a little on the bright side.
