It is a marvelous piece of tech at a decent price and I highly recommend. Numerous inputs, fairly easy switching between inputs, lots of clear options. My only complaint would be the build quality of the chassis, which feels a touch flimsy.",

Not saying the Predator is bad (it is great on a budget), but this monitor just blew away my expectations and is just an upgrade all around. Sound quality is great, picture is amazing, lag is not an issue, the eye strain reduction is already noticeable after a few weeks. Packaging was very well done, shipped fast, great construction, easy for follow set up instructions, BEAUTIFUL design, and the backlight is just icing on the cake. I would highly recommend anyone looking to get a great start or upgrade from another monitor to get this one. Bonus-it just flat out looks amazing.",

Got it used for like 200$ cheaper and in great condition. Colors are vibrant as hell and image clarity is perfect. Makes the graphics in game look crispier than my previous monitor odyssey g7 32 in. Although that was VA and this is IPS I will say contrast is lacking but to be expected and tbh I was regretting getting IPS and almost changed for a VA ultrawide but take some time and let your eyes get used to it and you will appreciate it for what it is trust me! This monitor is exceptional I'd say!",

I am not moniter and color geek but I am decently picky about colors!Side note this monitors whites\u2026 are SUPER WHITE Bright. Dark rooms beware! I have to use night light to turn it slightly yellow at night otherwise my poor eyeballs will burn.A 5/5 in my book for $370 after tax if I wanted to splurge I would go for the Samsung G7 27in 1440p to prevent the bleed in but I don\u2019t mind it that much",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that when it arrived, I immediately noticed 1 dead/stuck pixel. Normally this would not be a huge deal, but this monitor isn\u2019t cheap and it was very noticeable. Amazon did have me call Asus while they were on the phone with me. They said 3 pixel minimum to be considered defective. I was really upset and asked the Amazon worker what to do. Amazon worker was caring and said she was shipping me a new one and I just had to drop the other one off at ups store. The next one arrived the very next day and works perfect. Props to Amazon for taking care of this.The new monitor has zero dead pixels. I absolutely love it! It matches the rest of my white ROG setup perfectly. I don\u2019t use the overclock feature, I keep it at 144. I run my games at the highest settings and it looks amazing on this thing.The \u201cV\u201d shaped mount is rather large and could get in the way if you have a smaller desk. The way you can raise and lower this thing just using two fingers is great! You can set it really low on the desk!",

                "reviewText": "Quiero hacer una aclaracion para aquellos que tengan dudas sobre comprar este monitor.La primera impresion que quiero aclarar es que jamas habia tenido un monitor gamer arriba de 60 fps y no conocia los cables displayport y sus diferentes versiones 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 y 1.4 o 1.4a.Quiero se\u00f1alar que tengo una rog strix rtx 3070ti y sus puertos dp son 1.4 nativos. Al conectar este monitor me hacia un parpadeo horrible y unicamente lo pude configurar despues de medio de dia de pruebas a 100 hz con la resolucion 3440 x 1444p y realmente no soportaba 120, 144 y ni mucho menos 180 hz. Realmente estaba frustrado, pero buscando y buscando considere la opcion que el cable que trae de fabrica podria ser version DP 1.1 o 1.2 o simplemente un cable chino de baja calidad con el logo de ROG. Para mi suerte me acaba de llegar un cable \"UGREEN Displayport Cable 1.4, 8k DisplayPort a DisplayPort Cable Nylon trenzado DP a DP (8K @ 60Hz, 4K @ 144Hz y 1080P @ 240Hz) Soporte 32.4Gbps HDR H\" de 2 mts que compre aqui en amazon y walaaaa, tengo la resolucion a tope y a 180 hz. Les comparto mi experiencia por si tienen la misma situacion que yo.Edit. El cable que trae este monitor trabaja a 120 hz con resolucion a 2048 x 1080. 144 hz ya no soporta y por ende si le subes la resolucion a 3440 x 1444p no te va dar mas que 100 hz. Tengan cuidado.",
