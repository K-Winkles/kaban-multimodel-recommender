                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best mid-priced alternative to Apple 5K display",
                "reviewText": "I performed weeks of research before committing to the 27UQ850-W. While no monitor is perfect, this is likely the best Apple 5K replacement under the $800 price point. I use Apple machines for just about everything except gaming: productivity, software development, creative workflows like photo editing and recording audio, and watching videos. I have a 2019 Macbook Pro 16 i9 (Intel) and another 2021 Macbook Pro 16 M1 Max. Both machines are working great with this monitor.Connectivity---------------DisplayPort and USB-C ports work fine. I can't tell any quality difference between them. My regular setup uses the DP port connected to CalDigit TS4 dock. Cables provided by LG are long enough to reach the TS4, but users with a machine farther away might need slightly longer cables. I haven't tried the HDMI port because a lot of people report Apple issues with HDMI on M1-based machines.This monitor does not support daisy chaining or Thunderbolt.Resolution and Overall Visual Experience------------------------------------------------My biggest concern was how Apple-native 2560 x 1440 (\"WQHD\") output would look when rendered on a 4K display. I write a ton of code and need text to look really sharp. I read all I could find about this subject and took a field trip to the Apple Store to evaluate the 5K display where the situation is perfectly ideal: 2560 x 1440 logical pixels get rendered onto a 5120 x 2880 display yielding an exact 2X scale factor in each axis. The results are super sharp text and smooth visuals for both content and UI elements -- part of the Retina brand.Here's the thing some readers may wish to know. On a 27\" display WQHD output does in fact look best from a text size and UI perspective, at least on Mac. Changing to resolutions other than 2560 x 1440 result in an experience that is less satisfactory. Imagine my surprise when, for WQHD output, text looked 85-90% as crisp as the Apple 5K. I sit between 26\" and 32\" away from this monitor. At this viewing distance I don't struggle to read anything. Everything is clear. I am confident WQHD output on WQHD-native displays will look much worse despite a perfect 1:1 pixel mapping. I also think WQHD content will look better on a 27\" 4K than a 32\" 4K due to higher PPI on the smaller display.As to the alleged performance hit Mac machines take while downscaling to non-native resolutions like WQHD, here is my experience. Macbook Pro M1 Max doesn't even blink. There is no observable difference in terms of heat, CPU, or anything else. By contrast the 2019 Intel Macbook Pro i9 runs hotter by 10-15 deg C. The fans run constantly above 2500 rpm. One Youtube user reported slowdowns on Apple hardware while connected to a 4K monitor and rendering scenes in Blender. I can see where this might be an issue for specific Apple machines and/or apps, but I suspect they are edge cases the average user won't run into.This monitor has nice saturation and overall color balance. I'm no colorist but the display just looks really, really good. I tried toggling HDR in Apple settings under display but couldn't discern any observable difference.Interoperability With USB-C Docks----------------------------------------I have accessories like monitor and audio interface connected through a CalDigit TS4 dock. This LG has no problems through it either. Both Macbook Pro machines remember display arrangements and resolutions that were previously selected. I haven't observed power management related snafus as some people report, but I disabled power management while on A/C power.Brightness-------------Going back to the priority for text legibility, I traditionally used extra brightness to enhance contrast and make reading easier on my eyes. I leave this monitor at 100% brightness, but I could probably go down to 85% before it would start to feel dim. Brightly lit rooms probably afford many fewer options unless one agrees to pay the Apple tax for the ultra-bright 5K.Build quality---------------Build quality is okay. It looks like the cheap plastic that it is, though I like the narrow bezel all the way around the front. I haven't tried out audio because I use studio monitors instead.The monitor does not include a camera.In closing I think this is a fantastic monitor -- probably the best I've bought. Gamers and ultra discriminating users who need the very best probably won't be happy with it. For the rest of us it's a nice offering from LG that shows how far IPS panel technology has progressed in recent years.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a multi-use monitor to be used as a productivity machine using a windows machine, minor gaming (wii switch), and also for color accurate photography work using a Mac. I did look into getting the Mac studio display, if you have seen one then you'll know how crispy that 5K panel is and how well it is built, so it was tempting, however the studio display is quite limited as it takes only a single I/O.... not sure how they can justify a $1,600 panel that takes one input only. This display is not 5K but looks good enough connected with a mac even if it does need to be scaled a bit. The screen accuracy with the included calibrator is a great feature at this price point. I do wish that a monitor of this size allowed the user to display multiple inputs at a single time with a split screen feature. Probably a feature that does not get talked about enough is the power delivery from the USB cable which can help eliminate some extra cords depending on the requirements of your computer. Something LG always does well with is their mounting arms, as most of them including this one allows for tilt, height adjustment, and even swiveling to make vertical. Some of these features other companies charge an extra arm and a leg for...This is my 3rd LG monitor and all have had no issues with durability, hopefully I have the same kind of luck with this one.",

                "reviewText": "I bought four of these for a new workstation (replacing four 27\" 4K 60Hz LG monitors).These are much better.+ No dead pixels. I know that's not so much of a thing now, but nice to see over four monitors.+ Very repeatable color, contrast and brightness. My previous monitors all had very different settings and I could never get them all exactly the same - these monitors are all the same settings and they look identical.+ 144Hz is visibly better than 60Hz even for a non-gamer (moving/rotating 3-D models). You will need high quality HDMI/D-PORT cables (without extension connectors) to make them work @ 4K/144Hz if the short cables that come with the monitor aren't long enough. I don't know what spec. of GPU you need to get four monitors at 144Hz/4K.+ USB-C input option for future proofing or use with a modern laptop/tablet.+ The stand is pretty flexible (see note below).+ Decent enough sound for a monitor - as far as that goes.- Of the four monitors, none had the same maximum height for stand adjustment (there was nearly 2\" between the shortest and tallest).- I know that 19VDC is getting to be pretty universal for power supplies, but I'd have thought there was room in this monitor to include the power so one could just plug it in to 100-240V which would have made my workspace neater.",

                "reviewText": "Writing a review for LG UltraFine 27UN850-W. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. Before this model, I bought LG 27U650-W which was the same price in BestBuy as 27UN850-W here, and when I found out i returned it back because it's double more the price in BestBuy. LG 27UN850-W is a very good monitor. It produces nice colors. The 4K resolution is great, it produces crisp fonts, good visibility of icons and overall accurate images. The brightness is very good, up to 350 nits when the brightness is 100%. HDR is not good it produces very sharp edges which do not look good. Contrast is 1000:1 which is ok but it's not the best. This monitor cannot compare to 4K or 5K Apple monitors, however it is very close to them. More expensive monitors about $800-$1000 would probably output same image and contrast quality as Apple stuio monitors. I found for me the best image and contrast quality for this monitor on Vivid settings with brightness of 85%. Overall, this monitor is very good for office work, it is also good for photo/video design and I am sure it is very good for gaming which I didn't try yet.",
