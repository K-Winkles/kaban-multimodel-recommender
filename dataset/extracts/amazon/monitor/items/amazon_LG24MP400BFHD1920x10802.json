                "reviewText": "I work a part-time remote sales job, and I'd been using a 22\" tv as my second monitor. While it wasn't ideal, it got the job done. However, I needed something with a little better picture quality, response time, and brightness, and this monitor solved all of those problems. I also play video games from time to time, and the monitor works perfectly for that as well. My only complaint is that the base it comes with causes the monitor to have a natural downward tilt, but I was able to use a small book to prop it up & offset that with ease. It's a very well-built product, and I would recommend to anyone who plays video games or does any computer work from home!",

I think that the screen looks good, no complaints with that.My computer pretty much stays on all the time, but when I first set it up and was trying to turn it on, I thought it was broken. I could not get the thing to turn on. I have no clue how it eventually came on.As you can see in the picture, when I go to use it now, there\u2019s this box that pops up, and I have to wait for that to go away, but I keep moving the mouse to let it know that I\u2019m active on it. Eventually, the box goes away and then I can keep my password. It\u2019s just a little weird.",
