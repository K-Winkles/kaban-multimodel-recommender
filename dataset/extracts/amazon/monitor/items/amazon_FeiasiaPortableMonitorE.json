Advantages :Price, response speed, thinness, looks bigger than expecteddisadvantage :Sound: High notes are okay, but there is no grand feeling (you can't expect great sound in this price range)The monitor I am currently using has a slow response time for fighting games like Tekken, so I needed a second monitor. Fighting games usually only support up to 60fps, so anything above 60hz is meaningless, so I didn't experience much inconvenience with this product. However, due to the nature of fighting games, it is advantageous to have no input lag, but I did not feel that at all while using this monitor. However, I don't know what it will be like for FPS games such as Overwatch, Battlegrounds, and Fort Nite.Other than that, there are a few things that are a bit disappointing, but considering the price, I'm quite satisfied. So I will repurchase this product or recommend it to my friends.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor seems like a really, really good deal. I can't confirm its longevity yet because I've only had it for 2 days but so far it's been great. 1080p, USB power passthrough for device charging, multiple ports, and gets bright enough for indoor use. The folio cover is really, really bad. It doesn't hold up the tablet at all unless you sit it basically straight up but that's alright. I use it at that angle for school and I keep my bluetooth keyboard in front of it to hold it up anyway. The fact that it even supports AMD freesync, for whatever reason, it's kinda neat too.***WORD OF WARNING***If you are wanting to use this with a tablet such as an iPad Pro or, in my case, a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+, just know that both tablets aren't capable of outputting enough power through the USB-C port to keep the monitor on so you will want to power the monitor first and then connect your screen. Obviously this isn't the screen manufacturer's fault but it's still something of note. If you see your iPad or Galaxy Tab flickering or failing to launch certain tasks, power the monitor first. Works great after that. I have no problems with this setup as I always have my tablet plugged in for long study sessions anyway. I'm sure on a regular laptop it might work better. Haven't tested any Surface Pro's yet to see if they can manage it.UPDATE: After about 2 months the magnets on the folio cover have given up. The folio cover no longer holds the monitor up most of the time. I can prop it up using the friction of the cover but it falls over eventually. Going to see if they can send me a replacement folio and may update my score depending on what they say.UPDATE 2: They sent me another folio and it works great. Magnets are much stronger than the original one ever was when, even when it was brand new. I'm going to give them 4 out of 5 stars because the folio is clearly a quality problem that many others in the reviews have complained about but it's not nearly enough for me to not like this monitor. It's fantastic, especially for the price. Just really don't like the folio.",
