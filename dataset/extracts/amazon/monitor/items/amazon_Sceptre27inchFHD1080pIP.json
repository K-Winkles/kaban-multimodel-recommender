                "reviewText": "An excellent budget gaming monitor due to the current GPU shortage and the insane prices I'm stuck with a GTX 1080 for the foreseeable future, as a result I didn't want to go beyond a1080P Monitor, but wanted to replace my old 24\" 75 Hertz panel in my dual monitor setup which died with something that had a bit more oomf.Installation was extremely simple no need to even open the manual which came with the panel, it also came with a Phillip's head screw driver to install the four screws which I considered to be a nice little touch.One caveat the monitor comes with a Display Port cable and no HDMI cable, this wasn't a problem for me because it was always my intention to install it via DP and I have a plethora of HDMI cables lying around but those seeking to utilize this through HDMI should be aware.This Panel itself exceeded my expectations, the picture quality is great, colors pop without being too over saturated or washed out, for best results I recommend fine tuning the settings, but you have the option to use one of the suggested presets, This is also my first free sync panel which works with Nvidia's Gsync software after enabling the option in the Monitor's options menu which allows for very smooth gameplay.Speaking of the Options Menu, the buttons to open and navigate it are located behind the monitor on the right hand side, it's a little fiddly because facing the front of the monitor you have no indicators or labels for the buttons and it will take some getting used to in order to navigate the settings.The monitor also has no vertical adjustment and can only be angled up or down which is to be expected for a budget monitor and is hardly worth complaining about.Beyond the minor gripes I've been very satisfied with my purchase.",

This is not something for everyone but it is for the gamers in your life. Havent had any issues and it plays at 165Hz like a walk in the park. Hopefully not too many people find this review because these things will disappear faster than we could imagine. Overall great monitor for computer gaming!",

Screen itself is very very thin. This doesn't have a USB port. The speakers arejt the best quality, but has 3.5mm audio out if you wish to expand. The hardware included is very very delicate. Easy to strip out screws with provided screw driver. Over all satisfied with purchase, and would recommend to anyone on a budget.",

Noting bad I can think of since performance has been good and neat. I won\u2019t lie installing for me took a bit longer since I didn\u2019t want to damage the screen in anyway but was easy once I understood it. I wish I was able to adjust the monitor screen to go up and down like a rear view mirror in a car. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some out there that do. But as I said it\u2019s my first monitor so it\u2019s amazing and I love it. Will I buy again in a scenario of it dying or breaking. Will update once I get pictures",
