(My laptop is a pre-Retina display.) And it draws its power from the laptop, meaning you don't need to have a power outlet somewhere to use the setup.I use it as a second screen when developing software, and the display is lightweight enough to pack and travel with when I want to get out of the house but still be able to get work done. The display can be made bright enough to work in a shaded outdoor environment--though when the brightness is turned all the way up and you're running intensive processes on the MacBook Pro, you can eat through the battery in just about three hours.It's perfect, and allows me to enjoy my back deck during the spring.",

                "reviewText": "I got this screen to have an extra display when working off my laptop for you. I had first ordered a different version by the same company. However, I was not a fan of how small the screen was. I defiantly underestimated the scale of a 12-inch screen. So, I went and returned that one and then ordered this one. It was defiantly the better choice. The biggest down fall is the touch screen. Now the touch screen dose work well. It is just that being that it is not a Windows Surface or an Apple Tablet the computer gets confused some time. Those previously mentioned tablets are program to accept things like stylist pens and understand that when your pam in on the screen to ignore it and pay attention to the stylist. Now I do not know if this is an add on or a software update, they can make to the display. Like maybe if there is an option to select to only acknowledge a stylist pen and ignore other commands. However, if you do not plan to use a stylist pen then yes, the touch screen works perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Just received the non-touchscreen monitor today. My conputer has a Display Link connection, so I purchased a Display Link to HDMI adapter in advance. Since my USB-C port was not a display port, I had to connect the monitor to the computer via the adapter I bought and also plug in the USB-C to power the monitor. It connected instantly. Love that I can adjust the brightness and sharpness of the screen. Also like that it has volume. After making minor adjustments to the brightness and sharpness, I was all set to start using the monitor. The only complaint I have is that there is nothing to protect the screen. I have a slim, padded laptop case that I am putting it in for travel purposes since I plan to use this for work. Hence, there is a high probability that the screen can become damaged in transporting the monitor around. As such, I would recommend that SideTrack add some type of protective cover in the future. Until then, I reocmmend some type of protection plan or investing in a good carrying case. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase so far.",

                "reviewText": "I was really looking forward to using these SideTrak touchscreen monitors to support my online training needs. Pricing was good, delivery was timely, packaging was neat \u2013 but I was not prepared for the technical difficulties and the lack of customer service support.Experienced no issues with the initial setup as side monitors using Dell laptop. Only have one USB-C port, so on one monitor, I am using the USB-C to USB-C cable (left), and a USB-C to USB-A PLUS Mini HDMI to HDMI cable for the other monitor (right). Installation instructions were easy to follow for the initial setup as side monitors.All aspects of these extended monitors are excellent (clarity, brightness, etc.) EXCEPT for the touch capability and audio... which is why I spent the extra money! When only one monitor is plugged in, the touchscreen works, but only after closing the large-tab Windows search icon. However, when plugging in a second monitor, BOTH monitors lose the touchscreen functionality, and all touchscreen activity reverts back to the main monitor. For example, when performing a screen highlight on the left or right monitor using a stylus, you can see the same area being highlighted on the pc monitor, not on either the left/right touchscreen monitor. In addition, when both monitors are attached, all audio playing from a video on one monitor plays to speakers on the opposite monitor (not to the PC).Nowhere (websites, support, etc.) does it indicate that only one Sidetrack will work at a time. There are only 3 troubleshooting questions answered on their website, none address these technical issues. I've verified and met technical requirements, tried various cabling combinations, read up on everything I could find on the Q&A, etc..There must be an easy fix, but I can\u2019t seem to get a hold of SideTrak customer support. There is no Chat functionality for technical support. I\u2019ve called 9 times during their normal business hours \u2013 after waiting 5 minutes each, receive a \u201ccall back during business hours\u201d message. Submitted a form online to call me \u2013 and the response is that they are having technical issues with their phone system\u2026 still waiting for someone, anyone, to call me back.Do I really want to keep a product when not one person in technical support has a working phone that can return a call to resolve a technical issue during normal business hours?I\u2019m rating this a \u201c1\u201d not based on the product itself, but on its Product Support (or lack thereof).",
