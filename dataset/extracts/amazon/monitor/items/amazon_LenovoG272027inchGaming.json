Let's start with its 27-inch 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel display that delivers startlingly life-like lighting effects to gameplay in a luminous 400 cd/m2, thanks to HDR decoding on-the-fly. This computer gaming monitor never misses a beat, even in the most intense moments, because its speedy 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms MPRT response time, coupled with AMD Radeon FreeSync\u2122 Premium*, remove image stutter, break, tear and streak from the experience, leaving a smooth, fluid unspoiled session. This 3-side NearEdgeless monitor is also NVIDIA\u00ae G-SYNC\u00ae Compatible*, so you're ready to win with either graphics card. Besides, the 99% sRGB color gamut display featuring true 8-bit color will make your gameplay impressive for sure.As bright as this display is, you'll watch and game comfortably because T\u00dcV Rheinland Low Blue Light and T\u00dcV Rheinland Flicker Free technology can help protect your eyes from blue light harm on a sliding scale, as well as cut out screen flicker. Plus, with an anti-glare display, you'll enhance your viewing pleasure with a vastly reduced chance of eye fatigue. Aside from eye comfort, the G27-20 gaming monitor's new future-cool form factor helps comfortable sitting, too. Its upgraded Vector V base with modern blue accent lifts the screen head a full 130 mm and tilts between -5\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 to always be in the most ergonomic position for endless hours of comfortable E-Sports or binge-watching a show that just dropped. Lenovo Artery software (for Windows 10) gives gamers the chance to seamlessly tweak screen performance to optimize their gameplay experience directly on screen through their PC. Save time with zero distractions.* AMD Radeon FreeSync\u2122 can only work with an AMD Radeon\u2122 series graphics card. NVIDIA\u00ae G-SYNC\u00ae Compatible works only with Compatible NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae graphics card",

                "reviewText": "Bought this used in \"good condition\" from Amazon and the product received was indeed in good condition.Pros:- The picture is bright, colorful, and vibrant. The bezels around the sides and top are about .25 in and the bottom one is about .75 in.- Refresh rate is as high as advertised and the features/osd menu allow for overclocking and motion blur compensation of some sort but I don't have a need to use those.- Enabling sRGB prevents adjusting brightness which is annoying but not uncommon especially in budget monitors.Cons:- Height adjustment of the stand isn't working, again I purchased this used so I expected something to be amiss and this isn't a dealbreaker I contacted Amazon support who ended up forwarding me to Lenovo support but I had to deduct a star from the product.- The On Screen Display (OSD) is accessed from the buttons on the back side of the monitor and are pressed with your right hand looking at it. The menu is not intuitive at all, even with the manual open it's hard to accomplish anything with ease. I would deduct a point here if I didn't already for the stand but at the end of the day I ideally set the monitor up once and then I'm done so I very rarely go through the headache of having to fight the menu. If someone from Lenovo reads this do better product testing because there's no way anyone used this and thought it was good.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this monitor, I have it mounted on a double arm mount, and looks great. I mostly play siege and the 1ms response time is great, very smooth and love the 144hz. It is a bit pricey for 1080p monitors, maybe a year or 2 ago the price would be acceptable, but you can get a premium (asus, acer lg etc) for the same price.It isn't a deal breaker, but if this was lowered to the 200 mark, it would definitely be a top seller.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box this monitor is thin and reasonably light-weight but feels sturdy at the same time with no flimsy parts. The height-adjustable stand allows for many different viewing angles and positions.And the actual display during game-play is bright and sharp.. Images on screen really pop and look very smooth. And 27-inch is just right for my needs. A solid and great performing gaming monitor at a decent price too from Lenovo.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars It's not special enough at $280",
                "reviewText": "There's plenty of other monitors you can get with these same specs for $50 less easily, so this one would have to be extra special to be worth it, and I really don't think it is.I've been using this primarily in conjunction with a 360Hz laptop and despite the large difference, it's still an extremely smooth display. The colors are fine out of the box, but they had better be because the entire OSD menu is bugged (at least on my unit) so there is no way to change anything other than the brightness, the other menus simply don't let me in.For gaming, it works surprisingly well. I have a 32\" 1440p monitor that feels like it has more visible pixels than this 27\" 1080p monitor. I generally would not recommend 1080p at any screen size above 24\" but I can't take off any stars for that here since some people still want it. The back light bleed is minimal and I didn't have any other issues with the display.The stand is cheap and doesn't give any adjustability aside from some tilt, so again, I don't see any reason for the price premium of this monitor.I feel like this could very easily be worth 5 stars if they fixed the OSD and decreased the price, but as of now it looks like you're paying for more and getting less than the competition, especially when you can get a 1440p 144hz monitor at the same size for the same price.",
