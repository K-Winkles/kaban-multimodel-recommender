                "reviewText": "For office applications, this UHD monitor performs well. If value is important to you, you likely won't be disappointed.tl;drWhen the work you do daily requires a full-time commitment to being in front of a screen to do your job, then the characteristics of that screen can have a substantial impact on your productivity, health, etc. Having used a \"standard\" HD monitor for quite some time at work, I was starting to find it to be too constraining and difficult to work on. I felt it was time for an upgrade to a UHD/4k monitor.After some research, I settled upon this model, as it scored well on use in an office environment (according to rtings.com), it had consistently high reviews, and it was priced attractively here on Amazon. It also included speakers and a versatile stand, which were nice additional perks that I thought could come in handy. I took the plunge and have not been disappointed.This monitor has met or exceeded all of my expectations for office applications. The picture is clear. I have ample ability to control brightness, contrast, etc. And the refresh rate remains at 60Hz as long as the attached device can support it. The stand allows for all the control that I could ask for in positioning the display, but I've since attached it to a desk-mounted monitor arm which I also really like. I should also mention that having 2 input channels has been very convenient, as it has allowed me to use it as a shared display between different computers. In a pinch, I've even used the speakers on a few occasions; they're not very good, but then again I don't expect them to be. Also, I have used it once as a monitor for a video game console, and I was quite pleased with it. Again, the audio was sub-par, but the picture (including refresh rate) was excellent.For the value, I've been really pleased with this monitor so far. Since I use it primarily for office applications, I can definitely recommend it for that. And as a general-purpose display, it seems to perform well and should not disappoint much. But if you want something that will perform optimally for gaming (especially with high refresh rates), then you will probably not be considering this to begin with. Also, if you want something that has great built-in speakers, I recommend using a TV instead.",

                "reviewText": "Very good quality monitor from Dell that I ended up purchasing for my home office set-up after using a different model from Dell at my office. The curved screen reduces peripheral vision strain while working / surfing on the computer for prolonged hours. The resolution of this monitor is excellent, completely flicker free... Its extremely easy to set up (a one-person job really, unless you are looking to mount it on a monitor arm like me - then, you will need a second pair of hands), comes with 3 cables: a USB-C to USB-C cable which I have been using to connect to both my work laptop (windows OS) and my personal laptop (MacBook Pro) without any issues (one at a time), the second cable is to power up the monitor and the third one is a USB-B to USB-A cable to connect the monitor to a CPU I suppose... The instructions are very simple to follow - 1-page with pictures and clear labels for the assembly. The speakers of this monitor is not the best out there but certainly much better than what i had expected... I can run multiple windows of work files and/or surf the internet simultaneously... The 34 inch curved ergonomics allow for minimal footprint at home - which matters, especially in smaller configuration apartments like mine - you dont need to have two monitors side by side anymore, along with all the wires that come with that setup! Lastly, its equally good for streaming video content.. you can say goodbye to your second TV!! I am very happy with my purchase - it arrived the next day, in perfect packaging!",

                "reviewText": "This monitor has been one of the best buys i've made in the last several years. The box arrived in perfect condition, and it is perfect, not a single faulty pixel. I had been using a 24\"1920x1200 Dell Ultrasharp monitor I bought in 2012, it had zero issues and was 100 reliable for over 11 years. The Ultrasharp served me well, but it was time for a 4k monitor. This monitor is an incredible value, it went on sale for two fifty, at that price I couldn't pass it up. It does not cause me any eye strain, the picture is very sharp and clear, 27\" 4k is a huge upgrade form a 1080p display. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the blacks / contrast ratio is very good. I used the rtings icc calibration profile they have for this monitor and it improved the accuracy very noticeably, color accuracy is spot on now. For most users, it will be a great choice, if you are a gamer wanting high refresh rate, or you want a monitor that is meant for HDR content, you might want to look at a bit higher end. For me, I use it with my main PC and mostly for browsing and media consumption, reading & working. I spend many long hours daily staring at a monitor, so it's important that it has no PWM backlighting / is flicker free. This monitor does not cause me any eyestrain. It's been great for casual gaming, movies, editing, etc.. can't beat it for the price imo! It might not be the latest and greatest, but I think this is the best value 4k monitor available atm. Dell has a very good track record of reliable monitors so I am confident it will last me a long time.",

Ovviamente non sar\u00e0 mai preciso e brillante come un Apple Cinema 5K ma ci va molto vicino. Una persona non esperta non si accorge della differenza. La noto solo io che faccio il grafico professionista, ed \u00e8 davvero trascurabile dato che lo uso come monitor secondario. In generale la valutazione \u00e8 molto buona. Il piantone \u00e8 abbastanza alto (la linea bassa dello schermo non scende sotto i 18cm, cio\u00e8 qualche mm pi\u00f9 in alto della stesssa linea sull'iMac). Per il resto \u00e8 fantastico.",
