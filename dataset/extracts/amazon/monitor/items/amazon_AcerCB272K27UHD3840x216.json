                "reviewText": "I bought two of these monitors to replace my old 27\" 60hz BenQ panels that I've had for years, because they didn't mesh well with my newer LG 34UM69G-B ultrawide. I game on these monitors, and I needed something that matched the same specs: IPS, 1ms response, FreeSync, Display Port, 75hz (mixing refresh rates can cause some weird things with Windows, like if you're watching a video on one monitor while gaming on another, it can cause the game to stutter and lose FPS regularly) as my ultrawide. The price is also a huge plus. Swapping to these has resolved my issues. Games on the ultrawide no longer stutter and drop FPS while watching a stream or YT video on another monitor, and the games that I span across all monitors are now fluid on all monitors with no weird hitching.Height adjustable stand was also a must. My setup has different uses, normal gaming, and sim racing. I needed to be able to lower and raise all my monitors depending on what I'm doing at the time. I previously used a triple monitor VESA stand to hold all of my monitors, but it was bolted to it's height, and in order to change it I had to remove the monitors, unbolt it, adjust it, bolt it back together, put the monitors back on. That was just too much work, so in order to simplify things I decided having each monitor on it's own stand that they could easily be moved. These raise and lower very easily, and hold their height with no issue.I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the screen door effect. That's something you're going to get with this resolution at this size. The individual pixels are larger than a 1440p or 4k panel, so if you look close enough you can see those individual pixels. I personally don't have a problem with this, sure I can see it if I get close enough to the monitor, but at a foot away or more, it disappears. If you're using your monitor that close, you may want to change how you do things.Calibrating the monitors to match my ultrawide did take some work, out of the box the settings were pretty bad. I used a combination of getting it as close as I could with the monitor settings, then fine-tuned it in the Nvidia Control Panel. This would be easier to dial in with a screen calibration tool, but I was able to match them all pretty close just by eyeballing it. Both monitors match at the same settings, so that was nice, being able to adjust one and simply copying the settings to the other. No fussing around trying to fine-tune them individually.The settings I settled on:Brightness - 100Contrast - 50Black Boost - 0Blue Light - OffACM - OffSuper Sharpness - OffGamma - 2.4Color Temp - UserR Gain - 55G Gain - 50B Gain - 80 (I prefer a cooler, whiter image)All Bias - 50I have FreeSync enabled on all monitors, and it's working fine with a 2070 Super. I'm also using Display Port on all monitors.Nvidia Color Settings:Use Nvidia Settings - EnabledSettings were done under All Channels, I didn't have the need to fine tune individual channels.Brightness - 62%Contrast - 0%Gamma - 0.80Digital Vibrance - 75%Conclusion: These monitors are a steal for the price. It has great specs, and once you tune it, a pretty good picture (I can't speak for professional work, but if that's your goal you're probably looking for something more high-end than this with better color accuracy). Add to it that you get a good height adjustable stand, with the ability to go portrait, and this is a real winner. For a gaming/general use/media consumption monitor, you can't really go wrong with this one.",

                "reviewText": "For the price of $150, this is a great monitor for working from home! Currently bought two so that one of the monitor can be in portrait mode (FYI: monitor can only rotate clockwise 90 degrees) and the other in landscape. Definitely can confirm that pixels are noticeable when having a 1080p on 27 inch. However, if you always been using a 1080p monitor and your eyes are not 6 inches away from the screen, you barely will notice the \"low resolution\" due to the less PPI (pixel per inch).Not a gamer so I cannot really state whether or not the 1080p will impact performance during a competitive game but I can confirm, that it works just fine for casual gaming. Watched plenty of streams on this and the quality was fine. However, I do admit that the video image is not as sharp as it would be on a 21 inch 1080p monitor. Since this monitor is mostly for work purpose for handling documentation, coding, and creating prototypes through Figma, these monitors do plenty for productivity work.Currently, using these monitors with a MacBook Pro M1 connecting through a Display Adapter like \"Wavlink\".",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to leave a comment because when I was shopping for a monitor, I read so many comments and hopefully this will help others. I chose this monitor for the size and it fit my budget. I needed a 2nd monitor to work at home and I use it with a Lenovo thinkpad (this laptop has the detachable keyboard and has NO outputs except a displayport output). I use a male displayport female HDMI adapter to connect this Acer monitor as a 2nd monitor. The first one did NOT work so I returned it for a replacement. I read this in many reviews but hoped it was just a bad batch and I guess I got one from that batch. The replacement turned on (there are buttons on the right side back of monitor if the monitor is facing you and the top one is the power button so make sure you click on that button after you plug it in). I love the size of the monitor but the sound is very low. The laptop sound is much louder than the monitor sound but the laptop sound doesn't play when hooked up with the 2nd monitor. I bought some bluetooth speakers and they give me the sound when I need it. Sometimes the information on the screen enlarges and snaps back to the original size. It happens when I check my emails. It wouldn't stop me from buying the monitor but it's noticable but fast when it happens. The size works great for me because I need to look at spreadsheets with alot of columns and date so this monitor is great for that reason. If you need sound, be prepared to buy external speakers.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use as my third monitor. I have a Gigabyte G27Q and an LG 24GL600F-B already, the latter of which is a TN monitor.I won't compare it to the G27Q - that's a monitor in a different price class, but this IPS panel somehow has worse colors than LG's TN panel. I think the picture looks closest to my other monitors when the brightness and saturation are both set to maximum, but then very light and very dark scenes in games and videos look very washed out. The peak brightness and contrast of this monitor is very poor. I find this completely unacceptable for me personally, but do note that if this is your only monitor and you don't have any good monitors to compare it to side by side, it probably isn't so bad.75 Hz is nice, definitely an improvement over 60, but I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere if you want to game. 1080p at 27\" makes for very visible pixels, but that doesn't bother everyone, and it was my own fault for not going for 1440p, so I wouldn't count this as a strike against them.The stand is a highlight of this monitor, it allows for height adjust, tilt, rotation, and unlimited swivel. Even far more expensive monitors lack such a good stand. However, even so, a good stand doesn't make up for a poor display. Plus, the little clip that appears to be intended for cable management on the base of the stand was broken when it arrived. The entire stand requires no tools to assemble and attach to the monitor.Design wise, the monitor itself has a kind of \"double bezel\", where there's an outer plastic trim, but that's not the whole bezel - the actual display doesn't stretch as close to the corners as you'd think if you just saw the monitor in its off state. The bezel isn't that big, even so, but it does seem a bit bigger than the product pictures show.Some other reviews complained about this monitor only coming with a VGA cable, not HDMI or DisplayPort, but they seem to have gotten confused about the listing since it clearly stated that only a VGA cable is listed, and HDMI and DisplayPort are both only mentioned as available ports, not included cables. I do wish that they included an HDMI or DisplayPort cable, but considering the non-gaming target customer of this monitor, this is understandable.Overall, I think this monitor is good as a home office monitor, as it is advertised, so I won't be too harsh on it for being unsuitable for my specific purpose. However, I will be returning it and getting something more suitable elsewhere.",
