                "reviewText": "This monitor replaced an Asus monitor that constantly cut out intermittently. It is very bright and the volume can be easily adjusted to a loud setting. This does not cut out or even flicker. The sound is not stereo or high quality, but it is easily heard. There are numerous settings that can be adjust for everything--pic, sound, color, etc. And for the price ($150), I am very happy with this.A main critique from other users is the flimsy stand. It is flimsy and wobbles each time you touch the monitor or access the menu, but it does not move during normal use. And by no means does it appear that it will fall apart. But the stand does have a great tilt feature that only adds to its appeal.So great monitor, much better than my previous Asus.",

Screen is bright and I've been slowly reducing the brightness and contrast to adjust for my eye comfort. Fonts are sharp for a 27\" 1080p, there is a sharpness adjustment that works well. I think a 27 inch is the biggest I would go with this type of resolution. Colors are nice and bright. I've read reviews where there is lots of movement on the panel and it will move (sort of springy) if touched but when placed on a solid or semi solid surface there's nothing to worry about. It is not frame-less but I don't even notice the frame when looking at the screen. In a world of PC's and monitors that most seem to be \"game\" oriented, this is a very nice basic monitor and for the money, even better.",
