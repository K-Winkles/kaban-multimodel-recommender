After all, time is money. After spending much time researching for a portable monitor, decided to buy the UPerfect 15.6\" 1080P portable monitor to use along side my 15.6\" work laptop after reading the reviews from others who have purchased this product. The reviews from previous customers were correct. I needed another screen to be more productive while I travel for work and for use at home while working at my kitchen dining table. I wanted a good quality portable monitor, with crisp text/images and a standard HDMI port, that was not too expensive. The text and image quality of this screen is excellent and the price was right. One of the best features is the new updated feature of a standard HDMI port on the side of the portable monitor. As you will research, most portable monitors have a mini-HDMI port. I'm now able to use any standard HDMI cable when using this monitor. Save time, stop researching and give this product a try. I already recommended this product to some of my co-workers, who like my monitor and have asked me where they can get one too for home and travel work. Thanks for a great, quality product, UPerfect!!",

                "reviewText": "I will try to be as objective as possible throughout this review. I have owned this screen for 2 months and I purposely waited this long to test durability (I will update at 6 months). I received the monitor in excellent state and I was surprised that they include a variety of cables to ensure connectivity to virtually every device (USBc, Charging cable, HDMI, miniUSB, USB). Additionally, they do give you a protector for the monitor which is a little difficult to place if you don't have much experience but it is a nice feature that will protect your purchase. The case feels somewhat unstable but it is surprisingly strong and it has a great \"carbon fiber-like\" look when use it to transport the screen. When I received the monitor I had a couple issues at first connecting it to my Mac. However, I got in contact with customer support which was almost immediately responsive with guidance on how to troubleshoot the monitor. I asked if it was possible to connect to an iPad and they offer to send me the cable that will ensure I was going to be able to use it with the iPad. I was pleased that my issue resolved and I was able to use the screen properly. I do need to point out that I try to use it with a hub extension (on Mac) and it didn't work. It only worked when connected directly to the computer. However, I am unsure if this is due to the hub that I was using. When I plugged it into my windows laptop it worked with no problems using all the ports. I had no issues using it with also with my phone either (Android). The screen itself is pretty slim and light which allows me to just take it on my Backpack comfortably. The picture is good and the resolution aligns with your computer. I tried it out by playing videos as well as video games (not to graphically demanding) and the picture is pretty decent. It is a nice feature that it has decent speakers (volume wise) built in. The picture is very customizable and it comes with pre-determined profiles to quickly adjust brightness. This is nice feature since you can change not only the brightness of the screen but the \"blue-light\" emitted if you work at night. One thing that is being pointed out in other reviews is that, unfortunately it does not store your settings so if you adjust it to the perfect settings you need to do it every time you turn it back on which can be annoying and I just ended up opting for the default profiles. In theory this screen can be used vertically or horizontally (manually configured). However, I think it would be difficult since the configuration and volume buttons are in one edge and the ports in the other edge. I have not tried but I imagine there will be some issues there. For remote working, it is a great option since it does not use much space and it doesn't require yet another plug to be used. I even have used it to have my kid watching a movie in it while I work in the main monitor of my computer which is great as well. If you are a hard core gamer this monitor probably will not do the trick since the max resolution is 1080p (I would try the 4k option of the same brand) but it is decent screen if you look for a decently multi-purpose performing screen for a good value. I do have the concern that I have seen from other reviews that it hasn't lasted for 1 year but I will update if something happens at 6 months and 1 year...or if it keeps performing as well as new. But, I believe that there is an option to include an extra 1 year guarantee which is peace of mind.",

                "reviewText": "Bought for travel since I need dual monitors for work. Monitor was packaged well, is well made and comes with everything needed to use right away. It comes with 3 different cables (hdmi, usb c, usb) and a cover to protect it. I love the large clear screen which has a vivid picture. Note, I am not a gamer. The size, approximately 15.5 inches coordinates well with my laptop. The power and settings buttons are easy to access on side. The settings buttons were a bit confusing to navigate changes but not unlike other monitor settings buttons. Connected immediately to laptop without issue. Waiting on a lightening-hdmi cable to connect to iPhone, which was not included. The monitor has the Vespa holes to connect to wall or stand. The included case/cover also works as a stand, like an iPad case. So far very pleased with this monitor. I pack it in my laptop bag and go.",

This monitor is sleek and lightweight that i was able to mount it on phone holder, this monitor can also be mounted on VESA mount. Being able to mount it on a phone holder is a big advantage for me. Picture quality is good for my needs as i use it as an extension to lookup items from the web.Iam not able to connect this monitor to usb-c phone yet, probably iam missing something here but i had not luck connect to a phone, there was no cable provide for connecting to iphone, contacted support and they have agreed to send me iphone adapter.Overall monitor response time, image quality meets my needs for the price paid. This monitor is absolutely worth the money paid. After sales support is very responsive to queries.Update: I was able to connect usb-c android phone to the monitor successfully using the cable which came along with the monitor.",
