Tilts and moves up and down. Your choice of HDMI or Display Port. I really appreciate to be able to get a monitor without bells/whistles. No need for USB ports or speakers, just really good screens for a really good price.I got two of these to extend the desktop of a laptop that plugs into a USB-C dock. It connects without hassle and provides a crystal clear picture. Very happy with this one",

It was difficult even to know in what came first, second, etc. Numbers could have told us that! It was exceedinly unclear that you fasten the stand post to the body first, in portrait orientation, then rotate it and attach the base. It wasn't clear until I looked at least three times that the power button also has other functions when tipped to right, left, etc. Important in installation. I could go on. Find on line and use the full user's manual!! Not very good, but better.The monitor itself, thus far, appears to be excellent. Non-glare, good color, sturdy, other features that often cost much more. We got it for a sale price but may buy another at full price.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of those few 22\" class monitors that have 2 HDMI ports, plus a DP port, but, like other reviewers have stated, my panel has some dead pixels too. My brand new monitor appears to have 2 or 3 dead (i.e. black) pixels, located roughly an inch from the top. I've read somewhere that the industry considers up to 5 dead pixels to be acceptable. However, this is my first Samsung computer monitor and I have never encountered this issue with other brands such as LG and Dell. That said, the monitor otherwise looks good; the image is bright, nice and crisp. Furthermore, Samsung included a DP cable and a HDMI cable, in addition to the power cable. And I like the adjustable stand. It's just a shame that the panel isn't perfect.",
