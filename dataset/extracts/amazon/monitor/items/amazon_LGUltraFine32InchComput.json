                "reviewText": "I replaced a similarly sized 1080P (2K) monitor with the LG 4K monitor to view multiple security system Network Video Recorders selected by a 4K HDMI switch.The presentation was better than 1080P but not overwhelmingly so. This somewhat disappointing improvement from 2K to 4K would be the same for any new 4K monitor so this is not a knock on the LG just on the expectation for wonderous video improvement from 2K to 4K. I've had the same opinion going from a 65\" 1080P to a 65\" 4K OLED TV. Basically put each monitor in a different room and walk between rooms and you would not be overwhelmed that there was a marked improvement.What the LG did really well: -- GREAT PICTURE: Yes the picture is great. Good honest colors and tight resolution. -- EASY ASSEMBLY: The stand just snaps right in and the bottom slides in and is held by a finger tightened screws. Takes all of 5 minutes to unbox and have up and running. -- DISPLAY TILT ADJUST: I was happily surprised to see that I could tilt the display oh about 20 degrees for my most comfortable viewing angle. There is no height or side to side adjustment. -- VERY WIDE VIEWING ANGLE: For all practicality, I would never have more than a 90-degree view angle change and I saw no change in the picture at the extremes. -- GOOD AUTO RESOLUTION SELECT: The display correctly selected the resolution for the input provided. As I said I was using a 4K HDMI switch to select between sources providing, 1080P (1920x1080), 2560x1440, and 4K (UHD) 3840x2160. The monitor automatically selected the correct resolution without any operator involvement. -- EASY MENU: There is a joystick located bottom center and provides a simple and fast method to access and select all the configurations available from the on-board menu to include picture adjustments (see pictures). -- GOOD SOUND: I chose a particular model for the cost and that it had internal speakers. I just wanted to hear any sound coming from the security cameras. It works very well and was loud enough I turned the volume down. -- GREAT VALUE: I shopped quite a bit and this was the best value 32\" 4K monitor. Easily in the bottom 5% of costs for similar performing monitors.Conclusion: Great picture, great automatic resolution selection, super easy menu user interface, integrated speakers, and a great price! You can't go wrong!",

                "reviewText": "For those with M1 MacBook Pro's. I've seen reviews in general about external monitors not working well with the M1 Macs. It worked for me on the first go. I'm colorblind so I can't speak to the colors, but the picture quality otherwise seemed great when streaming a 4k x 60Hz video on YouTube, e.g. the details are crisp and the blacks are very black. I am thrilled I just paid $240 for this one as opposed to way more for other models that I'd barely have noticed a difference with. In case it helps, here are the details:1. 13-inch M1 2020 MacBook.2. OS: Sonoma 14.2.13. Price paid: $240 via Amazon Prime to Los Angeles (tested / purchased on 12/24/2023)4. Connector: 6ft USB-C to DisplayPort (brand: Insignia) rated for 4k, purchased from Best Buy for about $255. Set the LG as my primary display and my MacBook to mirror it, but it seemed to also work fine when it was briefly (for like 2 mins) set up to extend my desktop space.6. Used only for a few hours today. Will update if it stops working.Cons:- stand height is not adjustable",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great 4K monitor!",
                "reviewText": "A great 4K monitor. The front bezel measures 33 inches diagonally. Viewing screen measures 31.5 inches diagonally. The front bezel is 0.50 inches in width (top, bottom and sides). The back of the monitor is all white but the front of the monitor (bezel) is black. The front bezel is also black on it's side approximately 0.50 inches in depth...you don't see the white back at all from the front of the monitor. I like that all the parameters can be set by using a mini-joy-stick under the lower side of the front bezel (center-position under the bezel). Click up (in) to start the monitor or select items. Left, right, forward or back. The menu items appear on the monitor. The monitor is anti-glare but I think I would have preferred clear and not anti-glare because image is a bit fuzzy...still checking this out. Text is very clear but some of my videos are a bit fuzzy. Photos are very clear too. I think I've got to work on my video camera settings. There are stereo speakers that are reasonably loud. When I first turned on the monitor I thought there were no speakers at all! Panic started to set in, but I discovered that the initial volume was set low. I added external powered-speakers to the headphone jack. The internal speakers turn off with headphones (and of course with external speakers) connected. There is no SPDIF or USB connectors. There are 2 HDMI connectors. I enjoy this monitor. It is my first 4K monitor. I eventually intend to use it for video editing. The price was great. There is no USB C connector. I'm driving this monitor with a Aorus 2080 Super Graphics Card. The monitor also has smart start, so it powers up when I turn on my computer. I use this monitor in a bright sunny room positioned 90 degrees from a large window (64\" wide x 49\" high). Brightness is set to 46 out of 100 full-scale.",

                "reviewText": "The one I got has no bad pixels. The color display is accurate, it can be adjusted to the same as my MacBook built-in, you just need time to play with settings. The display control menu is pretty advanced. Under 4K input, this monitor didn't have any problem that I can complain about.Some small downside: Built-in speaker is so-so. OnScreen control function for this monitor only support Windows!!! No Mac compatible software on the official website. I got the macOS version application but it said my monitor doesn't support adjustment... For Mac user, the OnScreen control software can only help you divide screen to multiple sections, which is pretty awesome feature if you'd like to display several windows at a time.Anyway I'd rate it 80 out of 100 at this price!",
