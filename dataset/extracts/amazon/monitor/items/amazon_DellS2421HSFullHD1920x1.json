The installation took 7 minutes, and I could use it with four (4) other monitors attached to my laptop. The screen quality is excellent, with no blur or flickering. The visuals are clear and refreshable as quickly as my eyes can see them. The price point is not too high or low. It is within the $150 to $300 range. I was searching for a monitor that is high-quality and inexpensive. I looked at average customer reviews, and I also looked at best sellers.

                "reviewText": "The system that I had built in 2011 is still going strong. However, the Dell 23.5\" LCD monitor that I bought at the same time to go with it recently gave up the ghost. So I bought this monitor. It is spectacular ! I purposely got a 27\" in the same resolution as the 23.5\" (1920x1080) in the hopes that things would be bigger for my old eyes, and it worked - things are noticeably larger and easier to read and see. It's kind of like having new glasses.The other thing that I wanted to accomplish was to get the huge, ugly speakers off my tiny desk, which is why I picked a monitor with built-in speakers. And here is where I hit trouble - they don't work. According to Dell Tech Support, this is not the fault of the monitor, but rather it is due to the fact that I am still running Windows 7 (cold, dead hands, et al) and OG Win 7 does not have built in support for HDMI sound. They say I need an updated Win 7 HDMI driver. I have not yet solved this problem, but have every confidence that I will. In the meantime I am continuing to use my old speakers and enjoying the gorgeous display on this monitor.",

                "reviewText": "2/7/2024: For several years I was using a 25\" HP monitor. The HP monitor had a lot of glare. I was thinking of replacing it when we had several power outages within about a 4 day period.After the last power outage was over, the monitor wouldn't turn on. I don't know if the power outages had anything to do with the monitor no longer working. The outages might have caused surges, but I was running the monitor through a UPS (battery backup) which had built-in surge protection.Anyway, the monitor no longer worked. Fortunately, I had an older HP backup monitor that I was able to use while I ordered this Dell monitor being reviewed here.When I got the Dell monitor, my first impression was that it looks a little cheap, like it's made of cheap plastic with a cheap design. However, the monitor works OK and I no longer have a glare problem. The no-glare aspect of this monitor really seems to work.My NVIDIA video card has two DVI output ports and the Dell monitor has 2 HDMI input ports. I solved this by buying a CableCreation HDMI to DVI Short Cable. This worked fine.The picture quality is OK on this Dell monitor and it's probably as good as the picture quality was on the HP monitor that I was using previously. The picture might seem a little strange if you are used to a monitor with glare. That was true in my case, but the picture quality is really plenty good on this Dell monitor, as far as I can tell. Overall, I'm happy with it so far.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this 2nd unit only two weeks after getting the 1st unit. Conducted month-long research prior to deciding since there are so many options out there. Too many units with massive screen size when all I need is 23.8 for work/leisure. Unsure why anyone would need a huge screen as it makes me vomit, like sitting in the 1st row of a movie theater watching high-motion action. This unit feels solidly built, but the final deciding factor was the adjustabe height/rotation which offers excellent flexibility. My other surprise was the easy assembly - less than 2 minutes.",

IPS screen is another plus. The hardware is very solid and it looks good. I did have to buy a display port cable. Packaging was more than adequate. Setup took less than 10 minutes. There is no power supply brick. Have had the monitor for a couple of months and my wife has not had any problems. Would most definitely purchase again.I can\u2019t imagine why this is being pitched as a gaming monitor although it would probably perform fairly well in that context as well. The only online game I play is chess.",
