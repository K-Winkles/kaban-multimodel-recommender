                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent replacement for two 32\" 4K monitors",
                "reviewText": "**purchased for $1900 with my own money** (maybe a double flash sale, $2000 on sale for December, additional $100 off for a few hours one day)So I've used this monitor for about a week, 12-16 hours a day (work during the day and online MBA school at night). Here are my initial thoughts.1. HDMI was very buggy. When the monitor went to sleep, it would try a few times to wake up. Then, it eventually crashed (rebooted) my M2 Ultra Mac Studio (a great machine).Switching to a DisplayPort from the USB-C port (back of Mac) has been flawless. (I was hoping to get that port back by using the HDMI, but my previous setup took two USB-C ports, so it's still a net win of one port for me.The screen itself is bright and clear (what you would expect) no dead pixels, artifacts, or flaws of any kind. For work and school, 120Hz is more than good enough, as I didn't see a difference when I switched to 240hz.2. The curve works great about two feet from my face. Since it's on a desk against the wall, it goes out a little further than the previous setup, it was doable, and I got back some desk space undernead having one base instead of two previously. The \"wrap\" around my field of view is definitely worth the extra space but see the next point.3. The rear lighting and futuristic design were useless since they were against the wall. There's some extra bulk back there that could have been saved (and money) and made the profile slimmer had they not built all that.4. I don't play games much, but Angry Birds was great. Getting the whole screen to show the entire landscape without having to scroll around horizontally was nice. Any side-scrolling games would benefit, assuming they programmed the game to use the extra space.5. I would have liked them to integrate booming loudspeakers (like the other Samsung gaming monitors) so I don't have to use external speakers.6. Also, for this price range, I would have liked to have a high-quality built-in 4K WebCam (even snap-on in the back, but still included) and mic for Zoom calls as well so I can work with two fewer peripherals on the desk.7. Using the Mac Spaces feature, I can have three windows per space and one space per activity (work, school, reading, file management, photos, etc. It's a game-changer, for sure. All without a fat bezel in between the middle of the screen. (If Mac fixed the full-screen function to allow for three full-screen apps instead of two, that would be even better) Multi-page docs or wide spreadsheets are a huge benefactor of this super wide screen.Overall, this was a great purchase for me. I last bought monitors when the Dell 4K ultrashare UP3216Q came out (8 years ago, and they still work great, BTW) and spent $2000 each, so paying $1900 for this monitor was a great deal.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Eventually it died slightly over week before the return window so now I'm stuck with Samsung's warranty which I hear an massive hassle. Power on and no OSD, the USB hub works but everything else is dead. There's nothing one can do to reset, wasted 2 hours trying to resolve.What a shame. It's a great monitor dimensionally and came well-packaged and easy to setup. It's connected to a Sapphire Nitro 7900XTX using a Cable Matters DP 2.1 VESA certified 6 foot cable. Cable is rated at 8K60Hz and 4K240Hz but this monitor is 2x4K240Hz. It still works and is the most stable configuration I've had with no issues. Only issues I have are at 120Hz DP 1.4 or 2.1 it randomly flickers. When a second 4K monitor is connected to the video card via HDMI or DP no matter what refresh-rate, it seems like the video card cannot maintain 240Hz and so it drops to 120Hz for the G9. I'm happy with 120Hz and all hardware is well within specs but this G9 develops a flicker from time to time and needs a power-cycle.Pros:Excellent form factor and size.Smooth gaming and scrolling with low latency.Excellent colors and contrast etc.dual USB hub to connect to two PCsCons:1) It flickers and artifacts randomly at 120Hz2) Firmware update process is a MASSIVE FAIL. It basically does not work and rejects all USB storage devices connected to the 'Service' USB port. I used three different Samsung flash-drives formatted regularly and via Rufus and tried everything to no avail. Normally one shouldn't even be bothered with this but given the bugs and issues out-of-box, Samsung could have at least made it easier.3) No USB-C or Thunderbolt and only has two USB type-A so a keyboard and mouse is all you get, forget about a webcam, mic or anything else standard.4) The LED function is useless and pointless",

                "reviewText": "Pros: This screen is breathtaking. I've never seen anything like it. The size, resolution, refresh rate, peak brightness, contrast ratio, etc. are all top-of-the-line. It's a joy to look at. If you can afford it, your computer can drive it, and your desk can fit it then you won't be disappointed.Cons:- Quality control is apparently an issue with this and related models. Luckily my panel seems to be free of defects so far, but many owners have reported issues.- The massive resolution demands a powerful GPU with lots of VRAM to do any kind of gaming.- The footprint of the stand is massive and currently there aren't any alternatives available for mounting on an arm (hopefully soon).- It gets hot and heats up the room it's in.- Cables need to be short due to the extreme video bandwidth needed at full resolution.",

                "reviewText": "So first off, if you have someone to help you unbox and set this up, it will be MUCH easier. I didn't, and I was sore the next day. This monitor is massive; it literally goes from one end of my desk to the other. I wasn't even sure I was going to have enough room. For the first half hour, I actually hated it. Then I realized that Windows 11 has some very nice window snapping options and one of them is set up to have a larger middle window with a smaller window on either side and that works so well for me.The picture quality is very crips at full resolution. Brightness can get SUPER bright though I keep the picture setting on Eco as it's easier on my eyes. Gaming on this is a whole new experience (just using it in general was a new experience for me). I've played both Destiny 2 and Final Fantasy XIV and both games support the ultra wide screen and look amazing. To really take advantage of it in Destiny, I'll have to upgrade my graphics card... my 3080 forces me to use lower rendering resolutions to maintain a usable FPS.The menu system is easy to navigate and has lots of settings. The core sync is certainly lacking because the RGB lighting on the back of the monitor is VERY dim. Dim enough that I don't even see it on the wall right now while sitting in front of it. That's disappointing because that really does add to an immersive experience when watching movies or playing games.Overall, I'm super happy with. My only regret is for when it stops working because I'll have to choose between replacing it (costing a small fortune) or living without it (not sure I could go back now).",

                "reviewTitle": "A Game-Changer for Work and Play (For a small fortune)",
                "reviewText": "When it comes to this monitor, it's hard not to be enamored. With a few minor quirks that don't overshadow its overall excellence, this screen delivers for both work and play. My integrated Intel graphics on my work laptop handle the full resolution at 60Hz with ease, while my gaming rig equipped with an Nvidia 4080 cruises at 120Hz without breaking a sweat.Gaming Performance (5/5): Gaming on the 4080 at max resolution is a treat. Titles like Forza Horizon 5 effortlessly lock at 60 fps, and even demanding games like Final Fantasy XIV vary between 60 to 85 fps, typically hovering around 80Hz. The ultrawide display support in compatible games adds an immersive edge, enhancing the overall gaming experience.Visual Brilliance (4/5): The screen's quality is a standout feature, with deep blacks and minimal halo effects. Color reproduction impresses, and the screen's brightness can be blinding if not dialed down, usually set around 15 out of 50. Text appears razor-sharp, making it a visual delight for work and entertainment alike.Productivity Boost (5/5): For work, the extra screen real estate is a game-changer. Moving from three 27\" monitors to this single setup eliminates the bezel breaks, allowing windows to be arranged freely. This benefit becomes apparent when working with large datasets or sprawling spreadsheets, where everything fits seamlessly on the screen.Issues (3/5): On the downside, the included 3-foot DisplayPort cable feels inadequate, especially considering the cable management involved, leaving just about 18 inches of play. Additionally, having only one DisplayPort on the monitor feels limiting, although HDMI works well. The firmware could also use some improvement, as it doesn't automatically wake the monitor from standby when the computer does unless the Auto Source Switch+ is enabled, which isn't always convenient.Size Matters (4/5): Setting up this behemoth is no small feat, and having some assistance during unboxing and installation is highly recommended. The monitor's sheer size can be intimidating but is ultimately rewarding, especially with Windows 11's window snapping options that maximize its potential.Picture and Gaming (5/5): The picture quality is undeniably crisp at full resolution, and while the brightness can be blinding, adjusting to an \"Eco\" setting makes for a more comfortable viewing experience. Gaming on this monitor is a revelation, with games like Destiny 2 and Final Fantasy XIV fully utilizing the ultrawide screen, providing an incredible visual spectacle.RGB Dimness (3/5): Unfortunately, the RGB lighting on the back of the monitor falls short in terms of brightness, barely noticeable while in use. This is disappointing, as it could have added to the immersive experience during movies and games.Overall Satisfaction (4/5): Despite some minor shortcomings, I'm thrilled with this monitor. My only concern is what happens when it eventually needs replacement, as the cost is steep. But, having experienced its capabilities, I'm not sure I can go back to a standard monitor.",
