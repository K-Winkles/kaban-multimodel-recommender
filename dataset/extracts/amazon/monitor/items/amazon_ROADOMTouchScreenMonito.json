I have a 27W supply.This device has a nice industrial design and just feels solid.My Pi 5 has a heavy-duty GeekWorm heatsink with passive cooling and two fans. This would not mount in the prescribed way since it is designed for a bare board. For now, I used double-sided sticky tape. I am also waiting for my M2 board and drive. I will have to look for a more permanent solution then.I am tempted to get the 10\" version, since this is so nice. But I like the current small size.Audio volume could be a little higher, too.But a great product surpassing my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "As some other reviewers have said the colors are a little washed out especially for an IPS (7\"), but it looks better than some other tablets with supposed IPS screens so maybe it\u2019s just the luck of the silicon. I didn\u2019t have the best of luck with the touch features: even after calibration it will still register every other touch so if it wasn\u2019t mission critical this could be a good solution. I really liked having the built-in speakers and the stand which made this a nice little standalone solution for my Pi and as a secondary monitor for a laptop. I noticed some pretty serious ghosting when just playing Solitaire though so probably more of a static display than a portable gaming powerhouse.",

                "reviewText": "Great little monitor. Works with my raspberry pi and as a second monitor for my Mac.Packaging was good. Everything is protected during shipping. Comes with a bunch of connector cables. The little stand needs to be slid into a slot in the back. It's a very snug fit.Use as a secondary monitor: Yes it works just fine, although 7 inches might be a little small for most use cases, the screen was perfectly viewable and detailed. I watched a short video on it to test. Audio through the speakers was decent. I connected a external headset and that worked fine too. There was some low level noise, but that might have been from my headphones. No popping noises or anything like that. My Mac mini had no problem detecting and connecting to it through the provided HDMI cable. The hdmi cable was a tight fit to connect to the monitor - and that's a bit of a theme for this product in general. Everything is an almost too tight a fit.Raspberry Pi usage: Yes. First, I LOVE that it came with a screwdriver and 5 screws (1 extra in case you lose one) to attach your raspberry pi. This product was good at providing all the little extra accessories that you need. I hit a slight hiccup in getting the HDMI and touch screen cables connected. The cables are very short and there is very little space between the raspberry pi and the stand that connects to the monitor. Easy enough to work around, you remove the stand, connect the power and HDMI cables, and then reattach the monitor to the stand. I did NOT try powering the raspberry pi with the 3 wire GPIO cable they provided, for the simple reason that I would need to verify the connections independently. I know there are two red wires and a black one, and I just didn't want to double check this when the other cables were already provided. AND touch screen functionality works just fine.automatically. I also really like that the raspberry pi mounts on on the back of the monitor.User guide: Okay-ish. The weakest part of the product is that the provided paper instruction guide only shows connecting the raspberry pi with the 5V gpio cable and the 4-wire touch cable. Arguably, that's the only connection method that you really-really need a picture of, but I would have liked it if the manual included the connection images that you see in the Amazon sales page.Summary: I've tried out a few small different monitors for raspberry pi over the years, and this is probably my favorite so far. Easy to setup, does all the basics and then some. Going in, I was a little suspicious about the touch screen part working without any setup, but it works just fine. I didn't need to do anything to get that working. Just how I like it. I would recommend to anyone you is in the market for a small monitor for their raspberry pi, or any other time you need a small monitor.",
