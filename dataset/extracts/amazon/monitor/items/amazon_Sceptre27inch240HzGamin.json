Personally not a fan of the rgb ambience lighting, but everything else has been pretty great! I have a single dead pixel that showed up a few days ago (Dec 30 2022), but everything else has been fine quality wise. Only huge con was the mounting system, as Sceptre has an insanely weird method when it comes to the mounting plate. They don't even supply you with enough screws/materials for you to install the mounting plate, so I ended up just using the default stand.",
