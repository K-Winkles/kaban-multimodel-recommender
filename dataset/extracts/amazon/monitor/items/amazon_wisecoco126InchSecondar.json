                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews but felt the need with this one. Monitor is well worth the price especially with the $10 coupon.Picture: I'm using this as a secondary monitor on my PC, PC monitor being an 55\" LG C1 OLED. Using this secondary as a discord/steam solution while a game is full screen. Being that my main is OLED, this monitor obviously doesn't get as deep of blacks but the brightness and color is impressive for the price. Being 1920x515 at 12.6\" means the DPI is fairly high so you can get detail on this small screen.Touch: The touch on this monitor is very precise and responsive. I was really impressed with the touch capabilities. I would put it on par with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. One thing you will need to do if using this as a secondary monitor though. The touch will register on your main monitor by default but just run \"Calibrate touch screen\" in Windows 10. It will allow you to switch which monitor is touch.Setup: The listing says that the monitor needs a 12v2A power supply which isn't necessary. As long as you have a USB port that is capable of passing 2A you should be good to go. I am using a USB 3.1 powered hub and it powers the monitor just fine as well as carrying touch data to the PC. If you enjoy a clean setup I do suggest buying a \"180 degree up\" micro USB cable as well as a \"180 degree up\" Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter so the wires wrap cleanly around the monitor.Mounting: Finding a suitable mount isn't easy for such a small monitor. The mount on the monitor is 75mmX75mm. I just purchased one from amazon that folds flat (easy to find) but had to modify it by cutting the mounting plate almost in half. I ended up only using 2 of the 4 mounting holes so the monitor hides all of what's left of the mounting plate. I also had to loosen the pivot points of the mount because it's obviously intended for a heavier monitor. I ended up with a very clean install that sits between my monitor and keyboard.Overall, I am happy with the purchase as this monitor fit exactly what I was going for and worked right away without any downsides. I only wish Wisecoco sold a larger version that is 3840 wide assembled in an enclosure like this one. I would buy it.",

Functions well with a mac, I just don't use the touch feature as that doesn't work great. It doesn't like to run through my docking station for some reason so I have to run it directly to the computer (Macbook Pro 14\" M1 Chip). I tried several docks, cable types, etc. and ended up running a the mini hmdi to usb c back to the computer.",

Really makes everything look so much better. I have attached a video, if you are on the fence, don't be; it is worth the cost of admission.Extremely easy to install, but be aware that you will need a mini HDMI to either HDMI or DisplayPort (depending on your use case). There will also be a need to run a MicroUSB out to power the panel. The panel even has a speaker, it is sharp and bright enough to see through the tinted window of my case (see video).All in all, I am beyond happy with this purchase, I dit NOT dream that it would come out this amazing. Simply love it!",
