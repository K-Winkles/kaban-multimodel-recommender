                "reviewText": "This screen in it's protective case reminds me a lot of a tablet in a case. It's just as portable and easy to set up. If you connect to your computer with a USB C cable, it doesn't require any additional cables. If you connect with an HDMI you will need to also connect a second cable to provide power. There is no built in battery which might be desireable in some cases. It will depend on how you plan to use it. For me, a battery is just additional weight and something else to go bad.I have a mini PC that I ordered for occasional home use. I don't have a dedicated place for that computer so it will be stored and then brought out to the kitchen table when I need it. This screen works great for that. Of course it can also be used as a second monitor for a notebook computer. I just don't have one anymore. I typically use an iPad at home for almost everything.The resolution on this screen is 1366 X 768 and it is a 60Hz refresh rate. The brightness is rated at 300 nits. In my opinion the screen brightness is average and nothing to brag about. I'm using the screen set at 100% brightness. I ran a bunch of monitor calibration tests on it. The results were not terrible but again nothing to brag about. The colors seemed even and true but the contrast and gamma test results were a little less than idea. Sitting here now looking at the screen there is nothing glaring or annoying about it. It is more than adequate. For the price, it's seems pretty good.The monitor came with a complete set of cables but no external power supply. It only needs 5V, 1A so literally an iphone charger is more than enough. I'm using just the USB C cable now. The quality of the cable seems good. The monitor end of the cable has a right angle plug so the cable turns down neatly. The case has the ability to support the monitor in landscape or portrait orientation. I like the idea of being able to use it in portrait mode. I can imagine using this as a second monitor with a long list displayed vertically. I'm honestly very happy with this monitor.",

                "reviewText": "Technologically, this laptop screen extender works great. The major problem is that the cover is used to prop the screen up and it doesn't work at all. It will bend into place but once the screen is leaning against the cover, it falls every time. I have to put something behind it. When powering up and using, my laptop will not power and display from the same cord, which is fine. The screen works excellently and is a great addition to a home office or study set up.",

                "reviewText": "This portable monitor is lightweight and small enough to easily tuck into a laptop bag with the rest of your gear. I like it because I can instantly have a second monitor with my laptop for when I'm programming on the go. I need to remain portable for my work on-set and sometimes a single screen isn't enough. The build quality is decent but not as rugged as others I've seen; it's somewhat plasticky. The screen has good color fidelity but can be a little washy off angle but you won't find a better screen for the price of this one. The full HD resolution means it'll work well with DVD/Blu-ray players if you like to use those on the go. It's not a monitor I'd choose for gaming or anything that requires gorgeous images but it's great if you're just looking for something to extend your monitor options on the go.",

                "reviewText": "Is it the best display ever? No. Does it work flawlessly and come with everything you need right out of the box? Absolutely. For the price (Under $65 at the time of this review) this is a no brainer if you need to increase your productivity while working on the go. This external screen takes up hardly any space, about the same as an ipad, and comes with the 3 cables you need to connect to just about anything. There's an HDMI cable for connecting to a Switch or Laptop, a USB C to USB C cable for connecting to newer laptops or Android phones, and a USB A to USB C to supply power from a laptop. If you use the HDMI cable, it still needs to receive external power, either from a wall plug, or a USB port on your laptop.So far I have tried it with my Windows laptop, and my Samsung phone, and both worked perfectly without any additional configuration. When connecting to a Windows laptop, it works like any other external display, you can duplicate your screen, although not sure why you'd want to, or extend to the second display to give you double the screen real estate. You can also change the orientation from Landscape to Portrait if desired through Window's display settings. I couldn't figure out how to get it to display in portrait mode on my phone, but maybe there is a setting somewhere I'm overlooking. Note, it does not auto-rotate when you reposition the display.The case/cover it comes with is very thin, but it does the job and turns into the stand for portrait mode, or there's another built in kickstand for landscape. The picture quality isn't great for watching videos but its not bad either. For email or spreadsheets its perfectly adequate. It does have built in speakers, but in my experience its better to just use the speakers from the device you are connecting.Overall, really impressed with this product, especially for the price. It is a welcome addition to my laptop bag!",
