                "reviewText": "Fantastic monitor for the price. The imaging on fast motion games and sports is amazing especially when using the 100hz refresh rate. The monitor has excellent visibility when you are looking at it from the side and not direct on as well, no image fading or color distortions etc. That being said, there are a few things to consider with this monitor. The first is the included stand. Its huge and heavy, made from steel. The monitor itself is feather light. If you are not using a multi-monitor or some sort of monitor stand framework, then you need to have some space for the included stand as its bigger than any other 27 inch monitor I have ever worked with. The second thing to consider it that this monitor uses and external custom power supply, something that might be difficult to repair or replace in the future. I prefer monitors with a standard ac power cord that goes straight to the monitor. Not a deal killer but something to take note of. Also the monitor imaging controls are located on the bottom of the monitor and a bit difficult to work with and program. If you are going to use this is a multi monitor config, be aware the the bezels are thin, BUT there is about a quarter inch of black space on the screen when you actually fire up the monitor.. so you end up with a large gap of screen space when you frame to monitors next to one another. Serious bummer.Bottom line, awesome for the price, much better than I expected from a monitor of this price. I would definitely buy this again, but sadly not for multi monitor configs. Look at the photo. Thin bezels are deceiving. Really hope the come out with a curved version and/or a 4k version of the same monitor, priced right that would a hard deal to pass up. Look forward to see what comes from Sansui in the future.",

There were lines showing up on my screen that were blue Or black but i fixed it by leaving my monitor unplugged for a bit and it fixed. But a couple days ago. My monitor Started to glitch out. Sometimes it's normal and other times there is lines appearing making the image distorted. So I no longer see the screen well It is a good monitor for gaming But after time It starts to wear down But besides that, it was a fantastic monitor It would run my game smoothly. Without any delay Just know that it might Stop working after a couple months",

                "reviewTitle": "Excellent for ordinary useage",
                "reviewText": "My old monitor was dying after 13 years of strenuous usage, and I got this Sansui as a short-notice replacement even though I knew nothing about the manufacturer. So far the monitor is proving to be a good choice. I have to give this monitor five stars because the display is excellent and for once a plug and play device actually is plug and play. For me that counts.I especially like that there are both VGA and HDMI connection plugs. That makes this a monitor well-designed for the conversion worldwide of computer monitors from VGA (the connection standard of the past) to HDMI (the connection standard of the future). Knowing how the computer hardware business has been over the years they won't be making these transition monitors for long, so anyone needing a monitor to bridge this VGA to HDMI conversion needs to seriously consider this monitor sooner rather than later, especially since the price is right. That said I just got this monitor in the past month so I don't know what its lifespan might be. FWIW a good monitor should last several years. This monitor will be best for ordinary usage such as websurfing, email, and modest image/video work. While gamers need to look elsewhere, YouTubers will be OK with this one.This manufacturer also sell fancier models with speakers (for a higher price of course). But my computer is already well looked after with its existing audio deployment, so I saved a bit by getting the non-audio monitor. If you already have good computer sound capability save a few $$ and get the soundless monitor.It happens I'm quite particular about how a monitor displays anything, so I had to fiddle about for many hours with the Windows display properties and the NVIDIA control panel to get the visual presentation I wanted, but in the end the results were satisfactory. Anyone as fussy as I am better be prepared to spend a bit of time messing with all their computer's display adjustments. I skipped the factory adjustments in the manual, which doesn't explain them clearly in any event.Do remember that the bright crisp display of a new monitor does not have any impact on the age of the computer that runs the monitor. It's easy to be fooled by that one. If your ageing VGA computer is going to require an HDMI replacement, this monitor should be on your monitor shortlist as you transition from an old to a new machine.",

The problem is actually the sound. The speakers do not function well. My nephew and I ordered the same monitor on the same day. But what he received was exactly the same as the advertised image then and what I received was different. The stand of my monitor was bulkier, and the buttons and connections were in different positions. When I checked my order, it would give me an image different from that of my nephew's order although we made our orders the same time exactly and of the same monitor.The seller contacted me and we exchanged a few emails in which I told the seller that I was willing to send the monitor for repair upon which the seller told me that a repair facility was not avalable in my area and offered to send a new monitor within seven days, which they did. I received the new monitor a few days ago and it works fine. The seller was responsive and helpful which is why I have changed my overall rating to five stars.",
