                "reviewText": "I mainly use my 13\" MacBook Pro for music production, programming, and then some general web browsing, writing, and real casual general computer work. I'm not a gamer so I don't need 120Hz refresh rates. All I needed was something that would be easy on my eyes, look good in my space, and have a nice crisp display.This monitor is simple to set up. It's got 3 screws. You can move it side to side but there's only 20 degrees of vertical movement. That's fine if you want to look at your monitor head-on or angled slightly up at you but if you need something that tilts downward you'll have to get a VESA mount that either clamps to your desk or mounts to your wall.22 inches is plenty big with an HD screen and just what I needed when in a dual or triple monitor situation (occasionally I use my work-provided monitor in a 3 monitor setup).For music production it doesn't strain your eyes to be staring at it for hours on end. Same when you're programming. Any monitor will give you eye strain eventually but this one is not going to give most people any issues most of the time.You have options for HDMI or VGA connections. In my case I had to use a VGA cable for my work monitor in the past so I got an adapter for my laptop for USB-C to VGA connections. This works fine and the quality is the same as HDMI with this particular monitor because VGA quality goes up to around a thousand more pixels than 1080p and supports a refresh rate of 85Hz (assuming you didn't get a cheap cable). This monitor has a 75Hz refresh rate so using a VGA connection is not going to reduce quality. In fact I suspect that they chose HDMI and VGA precisely because the monitor works within the VGA spec and HDMI is just a very common connector these days so they included both while excluding DisplayPort because that's mainly used for higher spec machines and people shopping for a budget monitor likely wouldn't have a DisplayPort compatible computer. Plus DP is not super common anyway outside of offices and expensive computers and has little practical benefits over HDMI to the average person right now.But don't let the fact that this is a budget monitor fool you. If you know you need higher refresh rates because you'll be watching movies and gaming then sure, this isn't for you. If you know you're going to be doing work, browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, coding, doing regular boring average computer stuff, then this is going to be more than enough for you. This is the monitor that should be the default standard for everyone looking for an external laptop monitor or that would come with any PC bundle. I wouldn't want lower quality and most wouldn't even notice higher specs if it had them. It's in the perfect spot.If you need an excellent monitor that isn't a thousand dollar gaming monitor that's basically a flat screen TV made for the Super Bowl then this will be as good as any other.",

My wife and I love the displays on these monitors very crisp and colorful. Easy to attach to our dual monitor stand and looks great, having the ability to adjust the brightness (blue light feature) is a little upsetting in that the quality (picture still looks incredible) of the display is amazing! Very thin and seamless, lightweight which has left us very pleased with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to upgrade my work from home set up about a month and half ago and so incredibly worth it. I mostly am writing and reviewing documents and sheets so I can\u2019t compare specific technical features or how it is while gaming. Generally, it was super easy to set up and works really well in a small desk space but added a great second screen. The thing I was worried about from other reviews was turning it off. It was about a day or two learning curve to just understand how to tap the center of the button and click down easily to turn the monitor off at the end of the day but it also helped me get used to find and navigate the rest of the settings. I would say if you are looking for a second screen to expand your workstation that works reliably each day go for it.",

Three factors that i have considered - Packaging, Physical Appearance and Display quality.I must say packaging and display quality were five star but the physical appearance was disappointing. The material of the body doesn't feel like its a Samsung product. Low quality plastic body, no locking system for the stand (we need screws to lock them), medium quality HDMI and power cable. Though after assembling the stand and the monitor, it feels sturdy. But I still believe the material used in the body and the way to assemble the monior could get better.Otherwise, it is definitely a great monitor!",

                "reviewText": "Although the design is now a few years old, this monitor is definitely worthwhile to consider for a new second display, or upgrade from an older display, maybe best suited to pair two as an affordable dual-monitor setup. Ideal workstation monitor for a office laptop. Good looking color quality, sharp and vivid, at nearly any viewing angle. No software installation required (optional download).OSD implementation is highly intuitive, no need to memorize buttons: Samsung's control input uses a pointing stick discreetly placed on the backside; completely replaces all buttons, very precise and easy to navigate. For example, Eye Saver Mode toggles with a click, push to the right, then click again; or click, push up, enter Menu>>Picture & scroll down.Experiment with settings, a few simple adjustments to the default configuration can tailor to your needs. Out of box, I thought the screen gamma appears darker than I want: I found switching black level from low to normal fixed it (assuming your input signal from PC is Full RGB). Enable FreeSync if you have AMD Radeon graphics. Enabling Dynamic Contrast automatically tunes (including brightness) according to whatever you are currently viewing, which works well for general purposes; when needed, activating Cinema or Game Mode should be useful for specific consistency.The panel is thin and lightweight: minimal bezel width on three sides makes this great for a multi-monitor desktop display, but even if used solo it's far far better attached to a fully adjustable table VESA mounting stand; its plastic stand is merely adequate. Non-glare matte screen looks great too but holds onto fingerprints and tends to be harder to clean. The included HDMI_1.4 cable is short; so is the power cord that leads into a small adapter box that will sit somewhere on your desk (or hanging off the side); there's not much excess cables to deal with. Basically you have a high quality 27\" IPS monitor, limited by a modest 1080p 75Hz refresh rate, and only 1 VGA + 1 HDMI ports.",
