                "reviewText": "INNOCN 32\" Mini LED 4K UHD 3840 x 2160This monitor lives up to it's advertised specs: 4K at 144hz with a quality DisplayPort cable and HDR10.For gaming and movies, this thing is great. The HDR10 helps greatly in dark environments instead of looking at a blob of black; you can distinguish things much better with HDR than without. The brightness (nits?) can be crazy high: I had to turn this down b/c when I looked at the sun in several games, it was almost like looking at the real thing....blinding. (Easy to adjust, btw)The colors are bright and vibrant; blacks are very black (though, not as great as an OLED) with some minor bleeding. I'm not a monitor snob, so I can't really compare technical details to other monitors, but this 32in INNOCN is by far one of the best in it's class and I've had a number of good ASUS, Acer and Dell 'gaming' monitors.Refresh rate is great so long as your graphics card can handle it, which means the blurring is significantly reduced. Various monitor settings will help with the lag and blur.Overall I'm very happy with this.Some minor issues to point out:The blooming effect is very noticeable when viewing at an angle, but greatly reduced when looking dead on (as you should be if you're gaming or watching movies); which leads to the next possible issue for some: the viewing angle is really bad. If you plan on having this screen far away or watch at an angle, it's not going to work well. You must be in front and center, and be a few feet away at the most, otherwise the picture will look bad. This issue seems common with this type of tech, unfortunately.Also, Windows does not recognize it as 'G-sync compatible'; not a big deal to me, but your needs may differ.",

                "reviewText": "You want true HDR? You want local dimming? Want 4K at 27in for a true Retina display in a monitor format, want deep blacks but don\u2019t want to risk OLED burn in? Wanna save some money while getting these things? Well the Innocn monitor is your best shot. This monitor delivers on the performance end, once setup it is an absolute pleasure to use. 4k with HDR and local dimming makes content pop, games and movies look great. Where this monitor struggles is in the quality of life features, accessing the OSD is via 4 panel buttons rather than a joystick, the layout isn\u2019t intuitive either, however you get used to it quickly and it becomes a non issue with use. Also out of the box settings have features like Freesync Premium and HDR both set to off, so you will need to turn those on in the OSD menu. You will likely also need to turn in HDR in windows settings menu. After doing that HDR can be left to on in the panel OSD, you can now toggle it on/off via hot key in windows. All in all not a big deal, but lots of users will miss this and never get the value of the panel they paid for.Aesthetically I thought I would hate the silver/grey panel housing, in person it is better than it looks online. It does not negatively impact my setup and blends in well with my tower/desk setup. The stand and base seem very flimsy when putting it together. Yet when it is setup, it is stable, easy to adjust and functions just fine. I like enough I am utilizing it instead of my monitor arm.Neat feature is a sensor on the top of the panel that detects light in the room and adjusts brightness of the screen accordingly. It works well and is nice feature to have.All in all it is value option for 4k gaming/content with true HDR performance and local dimming. All for the price of high refresh 4k monitors that lack those features. It\u2019s a can\u2019t miss panel in my opinion.For the high refresh section, I haven\u2019t noticed any ghosting, tearing or any other issues. I do suggest the \u201cfast\u201d setting..",

                "reviewText": "I knew this monitor was going to be a great quality and great value when I bought it, but out of the box the settings are absolutely horrid. I can see why non-techie folks might give up on this monitor completely upon setting it up. While the HDR out of the box was pretty decent - it required an HDR calibration tool (e.g. Windows has one built in) and the non-HDR picture quality was beyond terrible. It was dim, overly red, contrast was way off, and sharpness was terrible.However, all that being said, over the first 2 days I tweaked it when I got time - using both an HDR calibration tool built into windows and using color/gradient tests for non-HDR. Once I did all that, this monitor is as good as they say it is!While the onscreen settings menu is non-intuitive, it gets the job done. Some settings make no sense (like Auto Power 'Off' means wake the monitor when it receives a signal...you'd think 'On' would do that.Its clear that there are absolutely no bells and whistles, and this monitor is purely going to be an enthusiast monitor for those that did their homework on the device.",

Could not be happier with this monitor as it fits my needs perfectly .* Works with Gsync perfectly as well*No bad pixels at all , not surprised as it was packaged well and the panel must be of great quality.* Super Bright and serious black blacks*Reasonable lower price in comparison to similar monitors with similar panels and mini LED .* Just Gorgeous , quality video . gaming, and the text is exceptionally sharpCons: OSD but once you revert back 15 -20 years as it is setup the same way not a big deal.* Rear of the monitor is kind of funky but I personally do not care or give a crap it performs.Summary: If you want to game in 4K and am not an avid competitive gamer but like to enjoy beautiful scenery and intensely accurate graphics this is a wonderful monitor . Do not regret getting it in any way and would recommend to anyone who wants to game in 4 K and especially if you also want to create accurate video and stills.I love it . Hopefully it will last .",

                "reviewTitle": "Incredible monitor as long as you know what to expect",
                "reviewText": "Before buying this monitor I spent literally years watching the market and getting hyped over any possibility of a 4K 27\u201d 120HZ+ HDR monitor capable of true blacks. I didn\u2019t really think that was a lot to ask for, considering that\u2019s the maximum size for 4K monitors to be retina at what I consider a normal viewing distance, but almost none of them existed. I wasn\u2019t 100% sold on this monitor at first, since even thought it had way more dimming zones than anything before it, 1152 zones really isn\u2019t a lot when spread across 2160x3840 pixels. I\u2019ve always wanted OLED or microLED for a monitor, so the idea of settling for perfect blacks with an asterisk took some time to consider. OLED\u2019s burn in worried me because of how I use my monitor; I\u2019m not spending a grand on a monitor just to have my IDE burned in three years later. MicroLED would be perfect, if it existed or would exist in this product category for the next half decade. Given the lack of other options now or anytime soon (and a good deal I got on a gpu that could handle 4K at high fps) I bit the bullet and ordered this. The first one I got had some firmware issues and I had to return and repurchase - I was a little disheartened at that point, especially because after using this thing for a bit it literally hurt me to go back to my old 60hz IPS. The second one worked flawlessly though, and I\u2019ve been happily using it for the last half year. I say all that to set the background for why I\u2019m as happy with it as I am, given the limitations: I didn\u2019t have a lot of choice, and I\u2019m super grateful to innocn for testing the waters in a fairly untried product niche. So now, the limitations:#1: the dimming zones. On grey or dark grey screens, brighter content makes the closest dimming zones noticeably stand out. This happens often on dark mode webpages, and is most noticeable around the mouse cursor. It\u2019s not as bad as I worried before I bought the monitor, but it\u2019s definitely my biggest complaint. Given that this is what allows this thing to have perfect blacks and not burn in on me, I don\u2019t consider it too high a price to pay.#2: the viewing angle. The viewing angle on this, like with any miniLED monitor, is pretty trash. Light sections of the monitor have noticeable hazing if you\u2019re looking from too far off axis - particularly the vertical axis. This is the best looking computer monitor I\u2019ve ever seen in person, but ironically someone standing beside your chair and looking down at it will see it at its worst. This one\u2019s pretty minor for me, but if you\u2019re trying to watch the screen with multiple people the ones at the edges are definitely not seeing the same quality image.#3: the latency. This one is wholly irrelevant to me, because even thought this isn\u2019t quite as quick as an OLED it\u2019s still got less input lag than my last monitor and with the fast refresh gaming or even just moving the mouse around on screen feels smooth and instant.Now for what makes the limitations worth putting up with:#1: the perfect blacks. I can\u2019t even articulate the difference not seeing that ugly hazy blue that passes for black on regular monitors makes, so I\u2019ll just say that I\u2019ll never voluntarily go back. Having pictures that look incredible on my oled phone screen look trash on my pc is frustrating, and other than really specific types of pictures (black backgrounds with small bright patches, like a starry sky) that problem is gone.#2: the refresh rate. I honestly don\u2019t care about 160hz, it\u2019s such a minor improvement over 144 (if it\u2019s even noticeable) that I\u2019d rather crank the settings that much higher for better visuals anyway. 144hz is incredible, though, and again I\u2019d never go back. Anecdotally, after getting used to this monitor I was playing a new game and thought my pc couldn\u2019t handle it cuz it felt so janky and bad. I was super reluctantly going into the settings to start turning some down when I noticed a frame cap of 60fps had somehow been enabled - what used to be my best-case scenario looked so bad to me I was actually trying to downgrade render quality to fix it. If you\u2019re in the position I was, do yourself a favour and don\u2019t settle for a 4k60hz monitor to try to expand your options.#3: the HDR. I kinda consider this one part of #1 so I was hesitant to include it, but it\u2019s worth a mention on its own. For HDR movies and TV, this thing holds its own against the LG C series TVs (really good OLEDs, for anyone unfamiliar), and for games it\u2019s better (refresh rate and connectivity, though the OLEDs have it beat for input lag ofc). My only complaint about this part of the monitor is that I don\u2019t watch enough content, so I feel like I\u2019m not making the most of my purchase lol.#4: the price. This monitor definitely isn\u2019t cheap, but considering it\u2019s one of the very first of its kind and the advantages it has over 99% of the current monitor market, I\u2019m not going to complain. It helps that I cashed in a bank offer to effectively get 20% off this, but even at the full retail price I consider it worthwhile.Overall, I think anyone who wants a retina 4K gaming monitor with true blacks (that\u2019s also capable of regular desktop use, meaning no burn in if you have the taskbar or program menus on screen 8hrs a day) should consider this one. I\u2019d love to point out other options, but at the time I bought they really just didn\u2019t exist if you weren\u2019t willing to compromise on at least one of those fronts. Before buying I\u2019d definitely recommend tracking down a 27\u201d 1440p monitor in person, though: if your eyesight isn\u2019t perfect or if you sit a long way back from your screen, you might find you don\u2019t need 4K and that\u2019ll really open up your options. For anyone like me who sees pixels at 27\u201d 1440p or 32\u201d 4K, RIP to your options. This monitor may not be perfect, but for that specific situation, it\u2019s as close as you can get right now. I\u2019m sorry this doesn\u2019t feel like a glowing review, but I really do think this monitor is an awesome buy and I\u2019m extremely happy I bit the bullet when I did. If you\u2019re realistic and informed about what you\u2019re buying, I think you\u2019ll feel the same.",

This thing blows everything else at the same price and even *several hundred dollars more expensive* products out of the water. It's a hugely popular monitor in East Asia markets right now and definitely a market disruptor.Get it while you can, but keep in mind that compared to OLED monitors, there is still some noticeable haloing around the mouse or subtitles in dark scenes at an angle. All in all, still great value!",
