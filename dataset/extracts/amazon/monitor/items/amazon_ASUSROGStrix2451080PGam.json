                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best monitor in its class, but you pay a premium for it.",
                "reviewText": "I've compared this monitor with in-person testing to two 1080p Ultrawide Gaming Monitors:- Acer Nitro XZ306C (VA Panel, 1ms VRB, 200Hz) (Purchased for $219.99 + Tax, MSRP ~$397.99)- MSI Optix MAG301RF (IPS Panel, 1 ms, 200Hz) (Purchased for $269.99 + Tax, MSRP $329.99)This unit is also an IPS panel, 1 ms, 144hz native refresh rate, but overclocked to 220hz, purchased for $399.99 + Tax. MSRP when this first released was $899.99, but Amazon keeps it on a steady sale.The Acer, obviously was cheapest (at the price I purchased it), and had great vivid colors (VESA Certified HDR 400!), but also horrible streaking, ghosting no matter what settings I did. Typical VA panel experience, but unfortunate that I couldn't take advantage of the capabilities because it was intolerable visually. (I recommend this panel for gamers that play \"scenic games\" primarily, you won't be disappointed. Horrible for FPS.)The MSI I believe to be the best value of the three, because 200 Hz, 1 ms is very respectable, and the variety of appealing 1080p Ultrawides for FPS gamers is extremely limited. Most 1080p Ultrawides have lower refresh rates and there increasingly is a push for 1440p panels, even though there's still many users of graphics cards 2-3 generations old. So if you want a high refresh rate 1080p Ultrawide for your GPU (in my case a RTX 3060 Ti), the field of options gets small real quick. The MSI packs everything you'd expect in this: low response time, high refresh rate, a bit more screen real estate without crushing the GPU, and the price is good. Don't expect impressive HDR.Which leads me to the ASUS, which is the best on paper and in application, but it is NOT the best value. Why?PROS:- The specs of the panel itself (20hz higher refresh rate over the other two).- A more versatile stand than nearly any other monitor I've used and many on the market (how many OEM monitor stands have an integrated 1/4\" socket for DSLR and webcam right out of the box)?- A built in KVM switch for multi device use- USB-C with DisplayPort functionality for laptop use or sufficient power delivery to charge up a smartphone (the only gaming 1080p Ultrawide I'm aware of with this function)CONS- The included cables are extremely stiff, and the port placement being poorly implemented makes it quite difficult to plug in and cable manage when setting up if your monitor / desk has a wall behind it.- The stand, while extremely versatile, lacks sufficient height adjustment for tall users like myself (6' 4\") because of the 1/4\" socket taking up the final 1-2\" of the stand. The low range of adjustment is not uncommon among OEM stands, but just because it's not uncommon doesn't mean it's acceptable to require tall users to either get a different stand, set the monitor on a separate elevation, or buy a separate stand, or face poor ergonomics. ASUS ROG makes a desk clamp on stand for its ROG monitors, but this unit is not compatible (major fail ASUS).- The price. $399.99 is a great deal relative to its MSRP, and the ASUS has the best specs and the best feature set. But is it worth $130 more than the MSI? I would argue it isn't. 20hz is not a tremendous increase in refresh rate (pretty much not noticeable in my experience), and a 1/4\" socket for a camera nor a USB-C port makes a $130 value perspective justified either.Which one do I daily use? This one! The ASUS! It is the best in its category, and if I'm going to keep / use this monitor for years to come, I wanted the best that I could buy for the specifications I required. If you share that, then get this one! If you just want high refresh rate, low response time, and 1080p Ultrawide, you won't be disappointed with the MSI alternative either.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best 27\" 1440p 170hz monitor! Beautiful colors! Wow!",
                "reviewText": "I spent months and months reviewing monitors and reading reddit and numerous forums to find the perfect monitor. For the last few years I've been gaming at 1080p and have really looked forward to 1440p to match my new gaming pc with ryzen 3900x, asus strix 570e and a Asus strix2070 super. I was hesitant to drop $600 on a monitor especially a new one with not many reviews. Boy am I glad I took the chance because this thing is epic. First let me say Amazon got it to me in under 36 hours from order date. It came in 2 boxes and was well protected. I have ran multiple monitor testing applications on this and there is not a single dead pixel. Not one. It was super easy to set up. The colors are outstanding! Super bright beautiful colors with dark blacks and perfect whites. It's very bright. Not too bright but just right. I was worried about the panal texture as I had read numerous complaints about it being crummy. Well either those people are crazy or they have fixed the issue because its gorgeous and looks fantastic. I have been gaming like crazy since I got it. Doom Eternal and Modern Warfare look soooo good. Better than I could have ever imagined. 1440p on 144hz with gsync has been buttery smooth. You can overclock it anywhere between 144hz to 170hz. 170hz runs well and is very fast. The stand and design are superb and very well made. The stand does sit deep so you will need a decent amount of depth on your desk to fit it. If you on the fence about which monitor to get strongly suggest this over the TUF gaming ips and all the LGs. And as for old pg279q, why get an older model that's more expensive, slower, not as bright, and only benefit is a g sync module which isnt even necessary anymore. G sync works wonderfully with my 2070 super. This monitor has significantly better backlight bleed than my friends 3 pg279q's. The lottery with these panal is significantly better than previous models. The colors are fantastic and super saturated beautiful colors its hard to even look at my old monitor now. Amazon has excellent return policy so trust me on this one and give the XG279Q the try it deserves. You won't regret it..Update 8/10/20Have had the XG279Q for about 3 months now and I am still extremely happy with my purchase. Games look soooo good on this thing the colors just pop. I have had zero issues with mine since day 1 I have zero dead pixels. It is disappointing to see some having issues with theirs but remember the majority of people who buy this panal are happy with it and dont even leave reviews the few that have QC issues are sure to come leave a review. I realize I was lucky and got a good panal but thats why Amazon is great you have free returns. If you aren't happy with it return it. But it's one the best all around 1440p monitors in 2020. The price fits the performance and quality.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:-Responsiveness and Smothness, feels better or the same as the fastest TNs on the market.-The OC (270hz) works flawlessly with no problems.-Colors are on point, I did have to tweak them for a better use at a lower brightness and my likeness for 1.8 gamma instead of 2.2.-HDR looks really good, although brightness is too much since the contrast ratio isn't very good.-I play a lot of games at 60fps (Fighting games) and the monitor still feels super responsive at 60hz.-It comes with all the cables needed: Type C, DisplayPort, HDMI, power. And they all feel of good quality.Cons:-Contrast ratio is somewhat bad, it has 1000:1 contrast ratio, but compared to VA's, you can really notice it.-The calibration was just a tiny bit more saturated than normal.",
