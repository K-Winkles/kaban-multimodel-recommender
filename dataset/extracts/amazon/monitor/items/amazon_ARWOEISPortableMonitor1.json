                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars What a great find",
                "reviewText": "My first plan is to use this as a 2nd display for my MacBook Air. Works great for this. I just plugged it in and it worked. The size and the included case mean that I can slip it into my bag along with the Air and it's ready to go. Only adds about a pound and well worth it.It comes with a power cable and adapter (as well as the other cables you might need), and the instructions are pretty clear that it needs proper power to work correctly. The MacBook appears to provide sufficient power through the USB-C port (at least when it's plugged into a charger) to make this a 1 cable solution.It has speakers.This would be an excellent monitor for many more uses. I'm thinking about using it when I'm setting up Raspberry Pi computers. I rarely watch TV and got rid of my television, but I could see plugging my Apple TV into this and using it as a television instead of co-opting one of my computer's monitors when I want to watch TV.It has four holes in the back that might be a VESA mounting point, but there is not one word about that in the instructions.It is only 1080P, so not like adding a 4k monitor to your PC. I've also heard reviews of other portable monitors that have more options for mounting and viewing angle.But, like I said at the start of this review - \"What a great find.\"",

                "reviewText": "This portable monitor has some really cool features. For starters, it comes with a magnetic protective case that is completely removable. There is a specific way you fold it to stand the monitor up (instructions included in the directions with pictures.) There are also four mounting holes in the back for use with a monitor stand.It has one mini HDMI as well as 2 USB-C inputs, one of which could be used as a passthrough to charge a device (whichever isn't being used to power the monitor.) It also has a TRS headphone jack and a built in speaker.It comes with an assortment of cables and says on one of the protective shipping films that if a different adapter is needed to work with your computer, you can contact them and they'll send you one for free. However, it says \"you can contact us at .\" Not sure if they forgot to print their email/number or the printer just cut off. I think their company customer service email is probably what they meant to put there.Double check your computer specs before you jump to conclusions on startup. I thought mine was broken because as soon as it powered on, it would immediately turn off. However, on closer inspection my computer doesn't supply enough power out through USB-C to power it, so the fix was to use a USB-A to USB-C cable (also provided) to power the monitor. Then it worked fine. On my laptop I was able to use it and power it with only the one USB-C to USB-C cable. (It specifically states this warning in the instructions and packing as well, but I admittedly didn't read them at first.)Connection was quick and easy other than the minor compatibility hiccup. I set up mine to be a secondary monitor to the right of my laptop screen. Since it is only 1080P, it doesn't have full passthrough between screens, but that's on me for not getting a 4K monitor. The response is good, although I think it would be a bit slow for gaming. HDR is a nice touch. The color isn't as vibrant as my laptop, but it comes close. The menu is easy to navigate and adjust colors and brightness to the best possible settings for your needs.All in all I'm pretty impressed with this setup. I will be keeping this to use as a backup monitor when working remotely. Knocking one star for the missing contact info in the instructions and for calling it a gaming monitor when the specs fall a little short of what you want to game with.",

The case can be used as a monitor stand.The actual monitor has an aluminum alloy construction that makes it lightweight but durable. It has two USB-C inputs, allowing for a dedicated power source. A mini HDMI input allows for HD input from other devices that do not have USB-C ports.The display can be adjusted from an extensive on screen menu including an HDR (high dynamic range) option. I tested this using an iPad Pro as the signal source. The monitor was recognized immediately and mirrored the display of the iPad. A second test with an Android tablet source provided similar results.The box includes three cables: USB-C to USB-C, USB-A to USB-C, and mini HDMI to HDMI. There is also a power cube and User's Manual in the box.I am very satisfied with the performance and features of this monitor and the ease of connectivity to my devices. The monitor is a good value for its cost.",

                "reviewText": "Monitor exterior is nice. Seems well made. It's a tad bit heavy for a travel monitor.IPS monitor offers improved image clarity over more common LED portable screens. Built in speakers and HDR are a nice bonus. extended use was very easy on the eyes with HDR and good brightness level. Productivity apps and Video looked excellent for the price.My only complaint is which is going to cost this item a star is that they called this monitor a \"Gaming monitor\" in the listing. This is absolutely NOT a gaming monitor. The refresh rate/response time is far too slow to earn that particular title. Yes, it CAN play games. However, \"gaming monitors\" usually requires a mixture of visual fidelity, refresh rate, and response time. This monitor has good Fidelity for 1080p (minimal gaming resolution). However, it does not have the refresh rate or the response time needed to ensure high motion clarity while gaming.Note to seller: if you remove the tag of \"Gaming monitor\" from your listing, I will change my review to 5 stars. If you feel I'm missing some feature that makes this item worthy of being called a \"gaming monitor\" Please contact me and explain.",
