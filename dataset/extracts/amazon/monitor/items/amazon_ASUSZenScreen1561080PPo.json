                "reviewText": "I purchased this monitor so I could work remotely and do work presentations with my clients and colleagues, and it works perfectly for both purposes. I am much less productive whenever I travel without a duplicate screen since most monitors are too large to travel with easily. This monitor is the perfect size and even comes with a perfect-sized travel case so both the monitor and the case can fit in the same pocket as my laptop (see attached photos)! The setup only takes 10-15 seconds since the case couples as the stand and is very sturdy and high quality (see other attached photos).I also love the image quality of the screen along with the colors and sound. I recently decided to watch some Netflix movies using the monitor since it was already set up. When I duplicated the monitor, I preferred the screen quality and sound coming from the monitor over my Lenovo T470 laptop.Another thing I ended up preferring with this monitor over a traditional monitor is I don't need to plug it into the wall to turn on, instead, it automatically pulls the power from my laptop or whatever it is plugged into! At first, I wasn't sure I preferred this, but considering it barely pulls any power to keep on, I can use it for a full 8 hours on my Lenovo laptop, which is maybe 15-30 minutes shorter than its normal use without the monitor!I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for something small, travel-friendly, yet high-quality and simple to use.",

Both of those devices have a single USB-C port which happens to also be how you charge them.PROs - light and thin enough to fit in laptop bag - decent brightness - HDMI option is more flexible on device support - works great on an iPad with an adapter - works great on my work laptop without any software installsCONs - HDMI option means I must have external power brick - case/stand isn\u2019t always the greatest - Velcro on the case/stand is annoyingly loud in a conference room",

                "reviewText": "Purchased on a Prime Day sale and am glad I didn't pay full price. It is a good little monitor and does the basic job and looks good in a work setting.The tripod mount is plastic and feels okay but I worry about its longevity in a travel situation where I am having to set it up and pack it up multiple times a week. It was very easy to plug and play once I got the correct adapters, as it would not run with my S22 Ultra without USB-C to HTMI dongle AND connecting the screen to a separate power supply, but it worked great with Dex after that.It was easy to load the drivers to my Asus Zenbook but it is taking me a little bit to get the screen colors and settings to match my laptop. No matter what I try, the portable monitor is always a little off with the colors.Movies and TV shows don't look great on this. It is doable in a pinch but I definitely won't be watching daily movies on this. I've had much older and cheaper displays perform significantly better than this screen does in that department.The protective case it comes with is nice and snug but not really protective, and using it as a stand is very fiddly and not sturdy.It is an excellent little workhorse for data entry on a Windows machine. And hooking it up to my larger portable charger has eliminated the need to be plugged into a wall to avoid my laptop battery draining too fast. The speakers are a little quiet but I didn't expect stero quality from monitor speakers.No screen flickers and it looks great for office work, especially turning it into portrait mode for data entry. I've gotten compliments for my mobile setup from others out in public.",
