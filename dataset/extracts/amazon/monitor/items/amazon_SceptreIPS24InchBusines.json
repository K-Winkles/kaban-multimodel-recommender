                "reviewText": "My kids both play video games, and want the super fast OLED monitor, with all the bells and whistles. I don't even know what the bells and whistles are these days. I needed a decent monitor for a computer I recently got. I am not going to be playing much more than solitaire, it is mostly for work. So when I saw this one, I thought it was perfect. It has exactly what I need, a pretty big, crisp, clear monitor. Super easy to hook up, power plug and HDMI plug. Also has ports for a VGA line, speakers or headphones. It does have speakers, they are small, not wonderful sound, but OK. Again, for me, they are great.Best thing was that I plugged my laptop into the monitor to try it out, and boom, came right up, everything just the way it was supposed to be. If you are really into gaming, or want great sound quality, or some super fast refresh rate, you will find a monitor that meet those needs. If you are like me, want a decent monitor, but will not be doing much, if any, gaming and just looking for a decent, reasonably priced monitor for work or home, this will work great for you.",

I am currently connected to my Windows 7-64 computer by VGA connector. Even in VGA, the images are sharp, crisp and clear! I have ordered a graphics card so that I can try this out in an HDMI connection. Perhaps I can edit this review to add my thoughts after this change. I am not a gamer so I have nothing viable to mention on this monitor as a gaming monitor. For graphics, this monitor is the best monitor I have ever used since 1998! This is the first monitor that I find I can use at 1920 x 1080 comfortably. In the past I could only comfortably read a1600x900 screen! This one is so clear! It is definately Awesome (Brilliant)!",

I triple checked to make sure there was no protective film on the screen if that gives you an idea. After messing with the color setting I was able to mitigate the issue, to an extent.Springy stand- this would not be a problem except when typing during video meetings, I notice my video bouncing around.Best feature: The screw driver.Guys, this is a quality screw driver! I\u2019ve been on the hunt for a small, magnetic Phillips head for a few months now and ended up buying this screw driver set with a complicated magnet attachment... then came this screw driver. It\u2019s just a perfect all around screw driver for little pc projects and is really comfortable as well.Overall:I\u2019m not disappointed. Buying a monitor at this price range, you can\u2019t expect exceptional display quality and it\u2019s still 1080p. The bezels are small and the monitor is thin and light, giving it a newer look to your setup.",

Playing games on this will work and will work fine however for high refresh games such as COD and Starfield the latency is a bit too much. However for a third, fourth or second monitor for work you really cannot find a better product at this price point. I have several Sceptre monitors and every one of them have outlasted the other higher priced manufacturers. I will always support Sceptre. and will forever recommend any of there products.",

El unico punto que les falla es en los negros de la pantalla, que no es tan uniforme. No es para jugar realmente aunque tiene tasa de refresco de 75 Hz que ayuda algo, pero por el precio no le puedes exigir lo mismo que a uno que cuesta el doble o m\u00e1s. Yo tengo un par de monitores gamer LG de 24\" con excelente calidad ( costaron cada uno mas del doble que este Sceptre) y no desmerece gran cosa respecto a ellos.Algo que no se comenta en la descripci\u00f3n es que el monitor tiene capacidad de montaje VESA e incluye un desarmador y unos separadores atornillables (muy \u00fatiles) para colocar una base de pared o algun accesorio como una micro PC o un TV box.",
