                "reviewText": "Packaging is good & Shipped as promised on time.This is not a bad monitor ultra thin, built well and the colors seem to be pretty accurate under the default settings except brightness i turned it down from 80. 100 hertz shows up on windows display settings after a reset. I tried 100 then dropped it to 75 because didn't see much difference. I was running a 60 hertz monitor before and there is a big improvement. Adjustment keys feel cheap but function just fine. Display is full screen no bordering. The stand is a little on the wobbly side when using color adjustment buttons. Screen tilting is adjustable but left to right is stand movement only. Easy stand install to the screen is firm. Picture quality is solid i didn't see any screen tearing while gaming and videos look great. if your a gamer on a budget this monitor does work and I wouldn't hesitate to livestream at all on it i would buy another one depending on the longevity in the future . I call this a good deal for a functioning monitor with a solid 1080 projection.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor is about what you would expect for the price. It's a good budget gaming monitor. The one I got had one piece of hair stuck behind the screen near the top right corner - I've seen monitors twice this price with more dead/stuck pixels/hair than this, so unfortunately this is expected and common for modern monitors (hardware isn't what it used to be). I didn't notice any ghosting, which is surprising given a monitor at this lower price point.The included stand is very cheap feeling but it's usable, be careful how you have your monitor attached because it's not the most secure unless you hear it snap and even then be careful.I imagine this monitor would be much better if you attach a nice VESA mount to it so you could position it anywhere you want.It's a fine monitor for the price and you know what you're getting at this price point.edit: Honestly, this monitor is pretty good. It got a spec of dust/hair behind the screen in the very top right corner, but my brand new $300 Dell G2524H monitor had a very noticeable stuck bright red pixel in the lower middle of the monitor. I returned the Dell and got a (VIVO Single Monitor Desk Stand aka STAND-V001H) VESA stand (though a VESA arm would work too) for this, I'm keeping this display, and I'm damn impressed. Time will tell how this monitor holds up and I will edit my review if necessary but for now, good job SANSUI. I am impressed.",
