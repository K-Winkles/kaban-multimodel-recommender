I have not tested the functionality of the built-in speakers but knowing they're there is a nice little addition. Pairing either through HDMI cable with the extra power cable or USB-C is as easy as plugging it in. This works well if you're looking for something light and easy to take with you, or something to keep in place as a second monitor for daily use.",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually write product reviews, but I am so pleased with this monitor! I was going out of town and needed a second monitor to work remotely. The picture on this monitor is better than the one on my gaming laptop. It is plug and play, worked immediately, just plugged it in, set my monitor settings on my laptop, and off I went. I have also used it to plug in my Switch and a Firestick while on the road, and it was excellent for both purposes. Compact, fits in my laptop bag with my laptop. For this price (there was a coupon I paid about$75 after tax) this was everything I needed and more. It can be hard to sift through all of the available options for something on here, I scoured them all trying to balance price with reviews, and I can say that this one is a winner.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this set up, so I'll update my review later when I've put this through more usage... but my initial impression is very good.The display quality is fantastic. I've got it connected via USB-C from my Surface Laptop and it's fantastic. Plus, it's being powered by the laptop so I don't need an external power source. This is going to make my life a LOT nicer when I need to work in random places with my laptop.I plugged it into my Samsung S10+ phone via USB and was even more impressed. Like the laptop, it was powered by the phone and looked great. I'd never seen my phone on a display like that, but being able to launch Outlook and the browser from my phone was pretty cool. It felt like I was on a tablet. I'll have to play with this more. I only wish this display had a touch screen to really make it feel like a tablet.The device came with USB C and HDMI cables, plus an AC adaptor and cord -- so you're totally set unless you need some other connection type. A+ for that.There's a simple menu interface like nearly all monitors have for brightness, contrast, color, etc. But I didn't need to tune anything. It was all fine right out of the box.It came with a \"smart cover\" that uses magnets to hold itself into place. It's decent, but I don't trust those magnets. The cover doubles as a stand for a couple pre-determined positions, but I wish there were more angle options or an actual kickstand.The ONLY negative is that the sound quality was very, very poor. The speakers are tinny and quieter than those built into my laptop. I didn't buy this for sound, so I'm not disappointed, but anyone thinking about using this to amplify their game/movies better think twice. Just don't do it. On the plus side, it does come with a standard headphone jack which I suspect just passes the sound through from USB-C or HDMI. I haven't tried this yet.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this in anticipation of a long trip where I'd be working primarily from my laptop. I took a chance on this screen after reading the reviews and seeing people touting the value on it. After using it for a few weeks, I agree wholeheartedly.The Good:1. Build quality is excellent and feels like it should cost 2-3x as much.2. The LCD Panel is solid and has good brightness and sharpness.3. It includes a bunch of connection options in terms of wires and cables.4. No issues connecting even with a finicky HP Elitebook that doesn't have the best Thunderbolt Performance.5. Not overly power hungry.6. The included cover/stand is pretty good and not as bad as others have complained about.The Merely \"OK\"1. It has speakers but they are not great. I haven't gamed on it with a steamdeck or switch but I imagine the sound experience would suck.2. Doesn't come with a case; as good as the build quality is, it is still a thin, light, standalone LCD panel. I worry about packing it so I bought a padded case for it.In short, it's an excellent screen whose positives GREATLY outweigh any of the \"negatives\" (which aren't really negative.Buy with confidence.",

It is lightweight and very thin and easily fits into my laptop bag. The fact that it can be powered and receive display through 1 Type-C going to my laptop is the best feature. It even has built in speakers so it really could be a standalone portable monitor if that's what you need. I just want to hedge your expectations though. As an ultra-portable monitor, it can't have the very best brightness or contrast or screen response, but it is so freaking impressive for what it is! Picture quality is far better than I expected it to be.",
