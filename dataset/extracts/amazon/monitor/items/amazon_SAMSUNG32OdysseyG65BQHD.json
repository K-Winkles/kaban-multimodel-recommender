                "reviewText": "Solid Monitor with a high quality image with strong blacks on a VA panel, fantastic 240hz refresh rate, quick response time. Comes with some extra built in UI features and a remote for TV like functions or cloud gaming, which I don't really need, seeing as I am using this exclusively as a PC monitor. But certainly not a downside. Wasn't perfect out of the box, but with a little calibration and optimizing, gaming at 240 FPS looks and feels great. Perfect alongside my old 1440p 144hz monitor as a second monitor, and my new PC. Able to hit those 1440p/240FPS marks with my 7950X3D and 7900XTX GPU.Would recommend at it's current sale price just under $500. If your looking to spend more, consider an OLED option in the $800-1000 range for a screen with comparable specs. Also has Freesync Premium Pro with an effecting range from 60-240FPS for system/titles that are unable to hit that 240hz refresh rate at all times. From my testing this seems most optimal from 120-240 FPS, 60-120 FPS seems a bit less effective. Either way great monitor for the money spent.",

The curve is super immersive, it's absolutely magical for gaming (240hz baby!), and it has all the bells and whistles. It's made for Freesync (sorry Gsync bros), has fancy RGB to up your frames, and a solid stand. Assembly was super easy. ALSO, there's a remote and you have Samgsung TV channels and easily link to your streaming stuff. Superb!",

Feels like you\u2019re looking at a high-end magazine where the pictures can somehow move.Huge amount of screen real estate. And helps so much with eye strain. The 1000R curvature (the only radius that matches our eyes\u2019 natural optics at a meter), the HDR 600 contrast capability, and the extreme refresh rate all help with that.No, I wasn\u2019t paid a nickel for this review. I\u2019m just happy to have my eyes back.",

The colors have a yellowish tint and are inaccurate and make the screen look dirty. Then you have the scanlines. They are everywhere. There is no perfectly rounded edges on this monitor, they will all look pixelated because you can see the scanlines. Long story short I am never buying a samsung again",
