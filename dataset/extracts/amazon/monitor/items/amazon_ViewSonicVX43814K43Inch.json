There is motion blur when moving windows around, but that is expected from a VA panel. I recommend it for productivity. Got a second one on sale to replace wife's 27 inch Viewsonic too.",

                "reviewText": "The display on this monitor is near to illegible for reading text, the pixels fuzzy, not sharp, absolutely worthless for desktop publishing. The display was received in excellent condition. It also did not support the HDMI input off a 2012 Mac well, the display being squished horizontally, but it was fine for a 2018 Mac. I had to return this monitor to PC Nation. They did not pay for return shipping, so while they shipped the monitor for $50 on their corporate account, I had to ship UPS for $360, half the price of the monitor! An expensive mistake on my part. You've been warned.",

                "reviewText": "I originally was using a 14-ms response time sharp 43\" 4k tv and after changing video cards from a GeForce 2070 to a 3060ti it had difficulties getting signal during restarts so after some research I decided to give this monitor a try. It was easy to set up outstanding picture quality and LOTS of real-estate for viewing. I am not a fps gamer but I enjoy coop, MMO games Ark, Atlas, Grounded, Fallout 76 and Space Engineers Great picture and under 4ms response time I am Beyond happy if you are looking for a large monitor this is great.",

                "reviewText": "Took a gamble with buying this monitor because there were no decent (or not decent) test reviews for this particular model available online when I ordered it (Sep 2021). Suffice to say, this monitor is just acceptable, but not really great at anything.The major issue I have with this monitor is a very noticeable grid of diagonal lines, which briefly shows up whenever motion is involved. I've uploaded a pic for better description. This image was taken by recording a video while slowly moving a camera in front of the screen, and then extracting individual frames with ffmpeg.Motion means, e.g. the player character moves towards a structure in a game, motion in videos, and even when I look at a still image while changing my position. The grid 'overlay' pops up for just a split second, but the reoccurrence gets really annoying over time. Increasing screen distance improves things, but with ~ 40\" (~1 m) I'm already sitting further away from my screen than most people. I've mounted the display on a monitor stand behind my desk, so I can flexibly increase the distance, but this of course defies the purpose of getting a lager screen in the first place. I wanted 4k resolution at 100% Windows 10 scaling, but would have to go up to 125% at a larger distance. That's exactly the scaling I've used with my old 32\" 4k screen, so it looks like I've played myself.Some pros & cons:(+) The monitor is well-packed and protected by a humongous, large box.(+) The device comes fully assembled, including the heavy & sturdy stand.(+) All required, basic cables are included.(+) My individual 'copy' has no dead pixels, corner bleed, or other blemishes.(+) HDR in Windows 10 is supported without issues, using standard Windows PnP drivers.(+) Aside from the motion problem, still images and text look acceptable, and there are no other artifacts visible in games and videos @60Hz.(+) The screen has a DP out port, allowing to daisy-chain up to 4 monitors(-) The article description is misleading because this monitor can't do 75Hz @4k. According to the manual, 75 Hz is supported only at 2560x1600, 1920x1440, 1440x900, and a couple lower resolutions. I can't even confirm the latter because even with my iVANKY 8K DP Cable (4k@144Hz) and an RTX 3090, 75Hz is not available at any resolution.(-) Colors, especially in HDR, look washed out no matter the selected preset or manual adjustment.(-) Text at 100% scaling looks pixelated at the edges, although still acceptable. This gets better by switching to a dark theme.(-) The manual often only lists settings, without explaining them. So trial and error is unavoidable.(-) Monitor drivers, available online only, can't be installed due to error messages. The signed Windows 10 driver setup errors out by claiming the detected monitor isn't supported. Manual extraction revealed that the package indeed only includes drivers for the predecessor VX4380-4K (and older models), but not for this model, the VX4381-4K -.- For what it's worth, the VX4380-4K driver can be installed manually, but I didn't see any improvement over using the standard PnP drivers and reverted back. The unsigned Win 10 driver installer finally tops it off by wining that the operating system isn't supported -.- -.-(-) The joystick control for the OSD is terrible because the OSD often indicates different joystick directions for the same navigation.All things considered, I'm going to keep this monitor because it's technically without blemishes. Still waiting for a better solution, though. A few other options are available, sure, but they all have their issues, which made me stay clear.",
