                "reviewText": "Was a bit hesitant to pick up this monitor only because I've never heard of innoview. Little research showed me they been in the monitor business a little while just mostly in portal monitor market. This is a Chinese brand however, what PC or monitor isn't made in China? For the same price I had just bought a 1080 predator monitor and although I loved it for the same price I wanted to dive into 1440p. This monitor so far has met expectations. Love the size! 32\" of curved eye candy! Deep beautiful colors and quality build. Base is made of metal and easy snap into place system for the monitor and a built in screw for attaching the metal legs. Easy peasy. Comes with PC cable not HDMI. And yes the speakers leave alot to be desired but here's a tip. Go into the settings and up the volume. It's factory set at like 40% once you put it at 100% you get enough sound to get by but def will want some speakers. I just bought the Logitech Z313 at Walmart for $59. Pretty good speakers for affordable price. The screen is very responsive and looks sharp as it is should at 1440p. Games look incredible! See attached pics of red dead 2. Mind blown! I'll update the review after some time with the monitor as far as longevity goes. Hoping to get solid years out of this monitor. Only negative is the buttons like most monitors have u guessing what each one does until u get the jist of the order of them. Wish they would add a little joystick like the acer predator monitor had that I replaced this monitor with as the old school buttons for every input design really does suck. Can be frustrating at first until you get the muscle memory of the key functions of each button. Also as usual getting the cables attached to the inputs was not thght out well as they go straight up from the bottom which makes you either hand the monitor on its side or upside down to attach them or u can tilt the monitor over edge of table and look from underneath. A dumb design in my opinion but once connected you don't think about it. Oh and the beautiful 1500r curve is amazing. It truly does immerse you into whatever your doing. I didn't think this would be a big deal but I truly love it. And the monitor is decently lightweight but not a cheap sort of lightweight however. Full disclosure I have had several times a quick flash on the screen but I believe that was when it was switching over. Hasn't been a issue at all and don't seem to be a screen issue but it raised my eyebrow and with this being a \"off brand\" monitor where I was alrdy hesitant to buy it's something I'll be keeping a eye on. I plan to use this monitor extensively before the return window to be sure I'm 100% happy with this innoview. But so far for the price and what you get I'm 98% pleased! I'd say it's worth it. Ill update the review as time goes on!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This InnoView Monitor was a pleasant surprise. The first one I got I will say came damaged and that is why I'm giving the screen quality 3 as in mid-range because it does not take much to damage the screen of this monitor. You will have to be very careful when unpacking it, when in transit, and while setting it up. A tip would be put the stand on while the monitor is still in the Styrofoam would be my best suggestion, so you don't risk damaging the monitor. It's just very sensitive granted the first one came damaged in transit, ley me clear, I did not damage it but upon further inspection it's just very easy to damage the screen a hard press or accidental bump will do it. With that part being clarified and out of the way, this would probably get four to five stars all around because this monitor is actually a very good high-quality monitor other than the sensitivity of the screen. I have to say the ease of putting this together is amazing it's pretty straightforward a one click snap and when you look in the pictures, I circled the pivot point for the stand. This monitor can be displayed regular as I'm using it or vertical if you have dual setups as I do as well. I love everything about this monitor everything from the quality of the picture, the presets, the options AND it actually does come through at 4K60 frames per second which is impressive and that's because it has quality display ports and HDMI ports. In fact, it has two of each, along with an auxiliary port and of course your power port. I am also a big fan of the screen having a matte look not a glossy look which is very helpful when working and gaming or whatever you may be doing on the monitor. It also has a very nice finish on the stand, which is also a black matte finish, and, on the back, it has a pretty cool LED ring that changes colors around that pivot point I was explaining earlier that does allow you to position this monitor however you see fit. The I/O Placement is perfect and easy to use I don't think it could be any better maybe if it was on this side however it's just as easy to get to on the bottom and it's nice and recessed into the bottom portion of the monitor to where it's not intrusive whatsoever. It would take me a long time to go through all the options that this monitor offers but it does have its own presets it is able to hook into any type of sound system that you may have, it's very user friendly as far as using the buttons on the bottom to make any adjustments whether it's for work or gaming. It's all very easy to use within the menu. I have mine hooked up to a sound system via the aux cable and it sounds amazing but the fact that this has built in speakers is an absolute win! You have got to keep that in mind that it has two 3-watt speakers that are pretty decent sounding as most monitors do not have speakers built in, again that is a 100% plus at the price point for this monitor and for what it offers. At the end of the day via the pictures I've shown, the video quality I've shown, the options it has, the built-in speakers, a really nice I/O that's very easy to use, coming in with two display ports and two HDMI ports with an auxiliary port, 6 of presets, many user adjustments, plenty of options in the menu, the fact that the stand can be moved wherever you want as it's very light to move and it can stand vertical, it can stand in landscape mode, you can have it diagonal if you want. My point is that you would be hard pressed to find another monitor with so much built in at the price point. It's a very versatile monitor that is going to handle any of your needs whether for work or gaming or streaming movies whatever you throw at it. I feel like this monitor is going to handle it. I purposely waited about a month to review this because I wanted to really put it to the test with gaming, streaming, workload, really pushing the monitor in every way I could, and it has held up to the test. That being said, I highly recommend this piece of equipment as it's a really good monitor. I was genuinely pleasantly surprised. I'll be honest, I really was not hopeful after the 1st one came damaged, but they had a new one out to me in 2 days in working order and after a month of putting it through all sorts of bench tests I can recommend this with total confidence. This is a no brainer if you're looking for a good priced great monitor with speakers built in and plenty of in and out (I/O) options to hook it up. InnoView did a great job. Please feel free to ask me any questions on this product as I put it through so many bench tests through this past month before this review and it really did come out on top. It's a great monitor, please ask questions, I'm here to help. In the meantime, if you need a great monitor, do not hesitate to pick this one up, it came through like a champ.",
