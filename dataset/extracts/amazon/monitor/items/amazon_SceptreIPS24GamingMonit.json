                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It's actually an excellent monitor.",
                "reviewText": "I've been using this for a few days now, overall it's a great product (especially on sale at $120). I'm glad I took the chance on a brand I've never heard of. Rumor has it that this monitor is using the same panel as some $200 monitor sold by ASUS, which is what really sold me on trying an unknown brand.This is replacing an older 60Hz TN monitor for me, and I've only used TN panels (It's been a long time since I bought a monitor). So maybe take this with a grain of salt. I've also been using the monitor defaults for testing it out.Pros:No frills or gimmicks. Just a monitor that displays an image.On the back every video input is clearly labeled like in the image, and says exactly what version of HDMI each port supports. Instead of guessing, or looking up the manual.Bezel is almost non-existent.Stand is made out of metal, just a nice touch.Color quality is excellent out of the box, I haven't even bothered calibrating colors yet. Blacks are actually black. Whites are blinding, but white. Blue really pops, Red and Green seem good but don't pop as much as blue. The color quality between the TN panels and IPS is night and day better.General image quality is crisp and clear. Text looks crisp, I'm noticing minor details in shadows from movies and games I couldn't see before. The DPI on this monitor seems much higher than my previous TN. Or its just the difference between how TN and IPS pixels are made?Image quality in motion is excellent. By default the Overdrive setting is set to \"Medium\" and it has some very minor ghosting visible in the Blur Busters test, but I haven't noticed any ghosting at all while playing any games, even FPS games. I have no idea what the response time is when overdrive is set to medium, but it seems low enough to not think about. I actually forgot I hadn't changed it until typing this.165Hz over Display Port is a nice bonus. Adaptive Sync works as expected, even on an Intel GPU. On Intel Arc the \"Variable Refresh Rate Range\" supports 48Hz - 165Hz. Though IIRC FreeSync is supposed to support as low as 30Hz. This may just be an Intel support issue.Cons:The monitor is scary thin. The top half of the monitor is basically just a plastic cover for the back of the panel. There is no structure holding the top half of the panel. I'm worried I'm going to bend the panel when adjusting the tilt. On one hand it's really impressive how thin this monitor is, on the other hand it just feels very fragile. Bending your screen while adjusting the tilt would have to be the most stupid way of breaking your monitor of all time. If it falls over somehow, it's 100% going to damage the panel. There's just no structure protecting the panel IMO. Perhaps on the next version Sceptre should add a little structural rigidity for peace of mind.Stand is comically short. Though it is quite wide so it isn't tipping over easily.PS Shout out to the seller, who shipped immediately. The package arrived like 5 days early. I had to sign for it, so FedEx didn't just leave my brand new monitor on the porch. Which I appreciate.",

                "reviewText": "Pleasantly surprised with this monitor. The edgeless design works well and helps save small amounts of desk space (works great with cubicle style desks with need for smaller monitors on monitor arms). Took some getting used to the \u201ceye care\u201d feature that seems more like a privacy screen. Make sure the monitor is at a good level and centered for best visuals. Small annoyance that it only gets 165hz through display port but other than that it\u2019s a perfect monitor for me.Also the built in speakers are literally useless, otherwise this gets 5 stars.",

The speakers aren\u2019t great, but if you plan to use a gaming headset that shouldn\u2019t matter. Once you figure out your picture settings preferences you\u2019re good to go. Great for the money, probably just as good as a more expensive monitor.",

I've resorted to using cardboard to prop up on end to get the viewing angle I desire. If not for the lack of physical adjustability, I'd consider this a great buy for the price.",

                "reviewText": "So, I'm going to address the elephant in the room first. I purchased this monitor in August of 2020. It did work great for 90% of the year that I owned it. It reaches 165hz natively without needing to do any kind of overclocking or the like. It has a nice response time in games and is a decent size without being overly large in the event you want a multi-monitor setup. It more than fits the bill for its price point.However, I said it worked great for 90% of the year. This is because the monitor developed some white spots that obscured vision and were very unpleasing to look at around June of 2021. The reason as to why this review still has 5 stars is because of the absolutely amazing customer service Sceptre provided me. I contacted the TA email, and they asked me for the standard stuff: make and model, what the model # was, etc. Then, they told me to make an RMA request to get it fixed. This was done for free, even without having any kind of warranty or insurance. Furthermore, they even provided me with packaging to safely ship the monitor with, and a new adapter/stand upon its return after being fixed free of charge.All I had to pay was for the shipping of the package itself. So while I did have a minor cosmetic issue, (some white spots showing up on the monitor), the amazing customer service and overall reliability of the monitor otherwise let me confidently write out a 5-star review. You're a great company Sceptre, and I'll make sure to keep you guys in mind for future tech purchases.",

It is absolutely perfect. the blacks are really accurate all the colors pop and are very vibrant. It has a lot of options to change the colors such as. Saturation and contrast overall a fantastic monitor.P.S if you are someone who has a 75 Hertz. Monitor and have a PC and are wondering if it's worth the upgrade. I 100% say it's worth the upgrade. I thought the 75 Hertz would be all that I would need but it makes a world of difference. having a 144 Hertz monitor.",

He escuchado que en algunas laptops con gr\u00e1ficos integrados, o incluso algunas con tarjeta de video dedicada no logran llegar a los 144 o 165, sin embargo si tu pc es relativamente moderna y cuenta con tarjeta de video dedicada muy probablemente no tengas problema. El monitor es excelente, muy buenos angulos de visi\u00f3n, buena calidad, sin ghosting en lo absoluto gracias al overdrive, no existe latencia en lo absoluto (cosa que he experimentado en otros monitores al conectar mi laptop a ellos), es un 9 de 10, para darle el 10 solo mejorar\u00eda las bocinas, a pesar de ello las bocinas se escuchan alto y el sonido es totalmente claro, pero hay una ausencia total de graves.",
