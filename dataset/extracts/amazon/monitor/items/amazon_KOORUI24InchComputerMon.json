The screen is bright enough and you can change the screen brightness anytime you want to.

Problem continued but not to bad. Then after a little over a month. It completely stopped working. Total black screen. Contacted Amazon says can\u2019t help 30 day warranty was up. I contacted this company 5 times now, I\u2019ve given them 2 weeks for a reply and still radio silence. Finally went and bought a Samsung monitor that works perfectly and same price. I absolutely will NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this monitor because of the price, and because it seemed to have favorable reviews. I took a gamble buying a monitor whose brand I never heard of. I didn't intend to use it for gaming or anything. I just wanted a basic monitor to connect to my server and for a graphana display. I was not disappointed. The mount is cheaply made, yes, but it works. The display itself though was far more than I expected for the price. It has a crisp, clear picture and I've had no issues.My only gripes are the stand, as I said, and that it requires a DC power brick, not a standard PC power cord. But it's VESA mountable, which is how I intend to use it. So yeah, it's not the best monitor ever, but for the image quality and the value for price, I can't justify removing a star. It is a very good purchase for the price. I'll definitely buy more.I'm glad I gave this brand a chance.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent budget monitor for gaming but overall unremarkable. It's not very bright at maximum and the image is a little washed out and not very vibrant. However, it can be had on sale for less than half of what a comparable Samsung or LG panel would cost and you get about 80% of the performance. Playing Cyberpunk on this panel was still great fun and the fast refresh rate enhances the action vs 60 or 75Hz. 144 or 165 Hz is smoother, but not by that much. The difference between 60 and 100Hz is huge. From 100 -144/165Hz, noticable but less so.I don't know how to tune or calibrate monitors but this panel gives you loads of settings to adjust so I'm sure the image can be improved by someone with the know-how.If you're buying this as a budget alternative to a higher end monitor, you might be let down.If you're buying this as an upgrade from an old screen on the cheap, you'll probably enjoy it.Also worth noting is that it's extremely lightweight - I bought it specifically to take with me to LAN parties and it's perfect for that.",
