                "reviewText": "I waited a few days to properly review. The quality isn\u2019t bad at all, it\u2019s 1080p, and has a decent refresh rate. The colors look nice, and the quality of the images are crisp. Delivery was good, everything came in perfect condition. However, I do have 2 complaints.The built in speakers are terrible. Very low and bad quality. You will definitely need an external speaker device for this. Another thing to be mindful of, is that the height of the stand is on the shorter side and it\u2019s not adjustable so you need to be mindful of that.",

                "reviewText": "First, it is 75Hz but it defaults to 60hz at least if you connect via HDMI. The only place I found it was in the graphics driver control panel under PC connections. NOT under the standard (native) Ultra HD, HD, SD. Windows 10 settings menu is always a terrible excuse for administrative controls, you'll never find it there.The screen bezel comes in a bit when displayed about 5mm so it's not truely edgeless like a MacBook Pro. But it's a sleek looking monitor that's fairly sturdy.I was honestly worried it might be too thin like it would break in shipping, but it's slightly thicker than you'd expect which adds more to it's durability.The speakers are mostly treble, it feels very office space laptop speaker listening environment so it's fine for news clips and YouTube but if you want to listen to music you'll probably opt for headphones or a smart speaker of some kind to get any background or atmospherics unless you want it all treble and no bass. 7/10Overall I'm satisfied, it's a good match with my budget gaming PC, it doesn't overstress because of 144hz or 4k issues without an expensive graphics card.That in mind it's not 1440 or 4k so it's a nice LED curved monitor but if you press your face to the screen you can see very super tiny led pixels but then you're just getting the screen all oily.If these are big issues for you then you should be spending $500+ on a monitor and graphics card each because that's where the market is as of Mar/2020.",
