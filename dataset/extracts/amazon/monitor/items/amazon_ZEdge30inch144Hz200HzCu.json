                "reviewText": "Ok, so I'll be honest. I gave this monitor a REALLY good rating, even though I hated it. Maybe hate is a strong word. A little backstory will help.I've been working from home since Covid started, just using a laptop on the corner of my personal pc gaming desk. I finally got fed up and decided to build a specific WORK workspace, since I spend at least 40 hours a week working. When in the physical office, I had a 3 monitor setup, and the real estate the three monitors offers is awesome.So I build the desk, and decide to order 3 new matching monitors. 29 inch looks good. Ultra wide? Sure, more real estate, right? So I shop and decide to take a chance on the Z Edge monitors.When I got the boxes, I was immediately wary. I should be clear that I was only basing the wariness on the DIMENSIONS of the box, not the condition or anything. So I open one up and my fear were realized. These things were SHORT. Meaning, yeah, 29 inches and yeah, ultrawide, but coming from a world of 27\" \"normal\" screens, these were easy 2/3 the height of what I was used to.Seems in my happiness to go from 27 to 29 in, I really didnt consider the size difference. It would have helped, sure, if the sales page on amazon listed the screen dimensions (they do have the box dimensions. To be clear, THIS IS MY FAULT, not the fault of the manufacturer.So I hooked one up anyways. Honestly, the picture was AWESOME. It looked really good, the refresh was good. I opened videos, played a couple games. It was nice.BUT.. the shortness meant that i was now squeezing stuff like code editors, log watchers, policy managers into a MUCH smaller space (I use these a lot in full screen while working). Even switching the monitor to vertical would have \"pinched\" my screens in a way I didnt like.So, while I did not like how short they were, the quality and performance was fine. I've seen people here on amazon giving bad reviews for reasons that are NOT the fault of the manufacturer, and I refuse to do so. My usage of this monitor was only a couple of days to see if I could get used to the form factor.So, if you understand that these things are a bit on the squat side, and hence, the height of your real estate is smaller than before, then you wont have an issue here. Based on my usage, the monitors are great. Just doesnt fit my own personal preference.So I packed it up and shipped it back, and bought some 27 inch QHD monitors instead.Hope this helps someone make an informed decision :)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In the world of working from home, I was sorely needing a second monitor. I'm thoroughly pleased that I picked this monitor to be my second monitor. The actual video quality from this monitor is fantastic. The quality has certainly blown me away. The colors are very vibrant and it's sharp. Check out the video - It should speak for itself.Pros:- Great video quality.- Has AMD Freesync! I haven't tried it out though.- Slim and low profile- VESA mounting!- Has Speakers - Can be used as a standalone TV if you input a video source. Video has the monitor playing the music.Indifferent:- The buttons are physical push buttons locateded on the back of the panel with labels on the front. While I would've preferred the slicker soft touch buttons seen on other monitors, some may prefer the physical buttons. To be honest, since the buttons are hidden, I don't even care about this.- The stand was a bit difficult to install as it needed a decent amount of force. But I just used the stand to test it and then immediately VESA mounted it.Areas of improvement:- The UI system initially made me think I had a defective monitor! If you have no video coming into the monitor, it will briefly turn on and then immediately turn off! You cannot use the menu without a video input and the monitor doesn't idle at all without a video input! I guess it's a power saving feature but I initially thought the monitor was dead because of an issue with my computer!- Turns on slightly slower than my other monitor, but it's not a huge deal and I've gotten used to it.Overall, this was a fantastically well-priced monitor that has absolutely exceeded my expectations.",

Really easy to set up and 100% what I was looking for as my first \"over sized\" gaming monitor purchase.The RGB ring light on the back is not visible or bright enough to really be seen unless you're looking right at it, but that wasn't one of the selling points for me so it's not anything that I'd complain about.The only thing that is actually frustrating to me about this monitor, but is something you can easily work around, is that the monitor stand/base does not move at all, so you can't raise/lower it which is why I only gave it a 4 star review.Overall though, a great budget monitor with easy set up and great picture quality.",
