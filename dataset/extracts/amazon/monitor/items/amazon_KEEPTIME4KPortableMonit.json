The 2K display is clear and bright with vivid colors. The physical size is slim, and the build quality is sturdy. The included smart cover can protect the monitor when traveling. The customer service is very responsive and top-notch. The only minor complaint I have is the user manual, which has some misleading figures and instructions that do not match the controls on the actual product. Other than this, this is a product that I can recommend highly.",

Buttons and ports are at opposite sides so you don\u2019t have access to them by default and they can be accidentally pressed just by table. I solved it by buying 180 type c adapter.Cover magnets ate strong enough to position it as a stand.No need in power supply, just one usb connection is very convenient",
