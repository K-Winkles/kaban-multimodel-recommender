                "reviewText": "I've noticed a distinct lack of good technical reviews for this specific model, so I'm gonna go into a bit of detail here. If you want the tl;dr: If you see it on sale, buy with confidence.Color Reproduction/Panel Quality:Color volume is outstanding - not just for the sale price, but in general. Color accuracy is very good to my naked eye after setting picture mode to normal from the default of warm, requiring no calibration whatsoever. Contrast performance seems good for an IPS panel. There is some backlight bleed in the lower left corner, but it's invisible against any color other than deep black.Freesync functions well with zero flicker but clamps the overdrive setting at Normal, so most users aren't going to be seeing the advertised response time. Still, input lag is imperceptible and I have thus far been unable to detect any ghosting or overshoot.The advertised brightness of 250 nits appears to be correct. I'm in a moderately lit room and find any setting over 84 a bit uncomfortable with this panel, but I could see it failing to measure up in a room with lots of natural light.Ergonomics:The stand is of decent quality and wobble is kept to a minimum, though you probably will notice some if your typing surface isn't perfectly stable. All movement options are accounted for, though it needs to be said that the panel can't be lifted very high. Very tall users may wish to invest in a fashionable box to set this thing on.HDR Performance:Very good for this price point with surprisingly high color volume and decent handling of contrast for an IPS panel, but SDR color volume is so good that the HDR mode ends up looking inferior by comparison. As ever, outstanding HDR is the only HDR worth using and you won't find that here.Overall:If this monitor holds up over the years I'll most likely be buying Acer again when it comes time to upgrade. This panel feels incredibly premium for the price I paid ($199) and you can tell that great care was taken to provide a clean, color accurate image straight out of the box - most users will be happy to simply enable freesync and set color temp to normal.",

                "reviewText": "I got this monitor to replace an old 60Hz 1920x1200 Samsung monitor I'd had for over a decade, and I was blown away by the picture quality difference you feel when running at 180Hz!Colors are extremely vivid, even without running in HDR Mode, and when you're viewing HDR content everything just really 'pops'. There's no great way to show it through another screen -- you have to see it in person and in motion to really get the full impact.The higher resolution is also very nice compared to your typical 1080 screen, and the few graphics cards that can handle high-framerate 4k are still outrageously expensive, so this will be a solid primary monitor for likely years to come.The only real downside is that the HDR support is a little limited and it's just barely bright enough in HDR mode to not be frustrating when playing something with darker scenes.The stand it comes with has a lot of movement range, and monitor also has a very solid-feeling VESA mount and fits perfectly on my HUANUO dual monitor mount, so it should have no problem with any other standard mounting system.",

Speakers are what you'd expect, they are pretty low quality but if you're using it for gaming then you'd probably have a headset anyway. Super fast and looks great on the screen and physically. Great for gaming and with the screen size it is very nice for watching shows or movies. No problems with it so far, would definitely recommend this.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great monitor for the money",
                "reviewText": "This is my review of the Acer Nitro XV271U 27\u201d QHD monitor that I recently purchased from Amazon. I have been using it for six days now. For the record, I am Erika\u2019s husband.This is marketed as a gaming monitor, but I am mostly using it for word processing, personal finance (Quicken/Excel), email, web browsing, etc. I chose it because it was one of the very few 27\u201d monitors that would fit inside the computer cutout in my hutch; most of the others were too tall. I was previously using a 24\u201d monitor, but found the available screen space to be inadequate when having more than one window open at a time. Going from the 24\u201d (1920 x 1200) monitor to this one increased the available real estate by 60% (3.69 million vs. 2.30 million pixels). Acer also makes a 27\u201d UHD (4K) monitor with the same form factor as this one, but I figured that would probably make the text too small to be legible.Another selling point was the stand, which has height, tilt, swivel, and pivot adjustments \u2013 but more about that later. My own measurements of this monitor, in its lowest position, are 24-3/16\u201d wide, 16-1/16\u201d high, and 9-5/16\u201d deep (the depth of the base of the stand). In its highest position it is 19-7/8\u201d high. If you pivot the monitor into portrait mode, then of course it is taller still.I have no complaints about the display quality. Text is very crisp and \u2013 to my untrained eye \u2013 the colors appear accurate. I find that when I re-set the resolution to that of my old monitor, there is relatively little degradation in text quality, so it\u2019s nice to be able to revert to that resolution when running an app in full-screen mode. I did a search for dead pixels using deadpixeltest.org, and didn\u2019t find any. Regarding brightness: Some reviewers have complained about inadequate brightness and suggest turning the setting up to the max, but I found the brightness to be perfect at the factory setting of 80%. The screen seems ever so slightly brighter in the middle than at the edges, but not enough that I\u2019d consider this a flaw. When I view the screen from an angle, I do notice a drop-off in brightness, but it\u2019s no worse than what I\u2019ve experienced on other monitors and TV screens.I\u2019ve not tested out the HDR or FreeSync features, as these are not important to me. Since I\u2019m not a gamer, I can\u2019t speak to things like blurring or ghosting. All other factors aside, the 180 Hz refresh rate and .5 ms response time would suggest it is a credible gaming monitor. I can confirm that my 30-year-old copy of Tetris Classic for DOS ran just fine:)Now, about the stand. The stand is a mixed bag and the main reason I gave this monitor a 4- rather than 5-star rating. On the plus side, the mounting of the screen to the stand was a piece of cake \u2013 it just snaps into place using a single latch. The screen is easy to raise and lower \u2013 you can do it with one hand, there are no buttons or levers to deal with, and the screen stays put after you move it. Tilting requires two hands but is still fairly easy to do. But using the pivot feature is another story \u2013 you have to grasp the stand firmly with one hand, and use your other hand to pivot the screen, while at the same time tilting it out to allow it to clear the base. The first time I did it, I kept worrying I was going to break something because of the considerable amount of torque needed to rotate the screen off center. I would describe the process as akin to a wrestling match, and not very convenient.The swivel function also leaves something to be desired. There is a thin disk on the bottom of the base of the stand that has little rubber pads, and is supposed to rotate independently of the rest of the stand, but there is so much friction between the two parts (and not enough grip from the rubber pads) that the monitor doesn\u2019t swivel smoothly, if at all. I found that by simply putting felt pads on the bottom of the stand, it was much easier to \u201cswivel\u201d the monitor by just sliding it around. I would also describe the stand as a bit flimsy \u2013 for example, if the screen is bumped, it will rock a bit from side to side. This stand could be greatly improved by (1) making it heavier, (2) using proper bearings in the pivot and swivel assemblies, and (3) using silicone rather than rubber pads. This unit does have VESA-mount holes, so if you like the monitor but not the stand, you can use your own stand, or mount it on a wall.The monitor has a clean, minimalist look. Because the bezels are so thin, it takes up only a little more space on my desktop than my old one. The speakers are typical monitor speakers \u2013 small, underpowered, and far from high fidelity. I view them as basically a throw-in. You would definitely want to use external speakers for listening to music or watching movies.To sum up: This is a well-engineered QHD monitor with very good display quality, and, at $200, it\u2019s great value for the money. It comes with a stand that provides lots of ergonomic flexibility, but has a low-budget feel and is not entirely easy to use. Obviously, I can\u2019t yet comment on the unit\u2019s long-term reliability, but if something comes up, I will be sure to update this review as appropriate.",

                "reviewText": "I was suspicous of this product at first as I couldn't find any review online. When I received the monitor, I tried finding the catch. What explains the lower price? But surprise, there is no catch. The product is great!I had an Asus monitor, 1080p @ 75 Hz which I mainly used to play xbox. But I got myself the next gen console and was looking for a monitor that is able to run the graphics that my new hardware can handle. The quality on this Acer monitor is incredible. I play on my xbox 1440p @120fps and this completely changed my gaming experience. You will have to change some settings on your xbox, as you will get a message saying that you can't run 2K at 120 fps. First, in your monitor settings, go to Gaming and change your FreeSync Premium setting to Off. Then on your Xbox Display options, go in Video fidelity & overscan and change the Colour depth from 12-bit to 10 or 8-bit. 10 worked for me. Then you will be able to to change the resolution to 1440p and refresh rate to 120 Hz.Also, I had to play with the settings of the monitor a little bit as the colours looked weird at first. For some season, the Color Temp was set to \"warm\" which gave a yellowish tone to the image. Change that to standard. Then increase the brightness to 100, as this might be the only weak feature of this monitor. Its 500 nits brightness might be lower than what you can get on more premium monitors, but as someone who gets a lot of sunlight from the window, I feel like this monitor is bright enough.Enjoy the gaming!",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical upgrading from an already busty IPS, 144hz, freesync, has it all gaming monitor to this 1440p acer monitor. Also reviews had me believe that upgrading from 1080p IPS to 1440p IPS isn't a big upgrade but man that is a huge understatement.This monitor is absolutely perfect in every fashionable way. The options are endless, the ease of use is amazing, and the price was great for $300! The games look absolutely gorgeous and sharp. Also having the HDR setting adds an even more glorified looking display of graphics and colors. I'm shocked. I will never have to upgrade my monitor setup again, well unless this monitor unexpectedly dies in which I will change my review lol.The monitor itself is quite light, which I like, making it very easy to pick up and go. The stand it comes with is like a brick that won't quit. It holds that monitor with a death grip and provides lots of movement in many angles. Easy to unlatch as well if your going to a LAN.I love this monitor and I am totally glad I made the purchase. Acer is really stepping up in the gaming field. Thank you!",
