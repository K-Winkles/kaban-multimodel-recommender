                "reviewText": "I love this little monitor more than I thought I would. I use it as a second monitor when traveling for business. (I haven't used it as a \"gaming\" monitor so be aware that this review is focused on my experience with it in an office setting.)First, it is very lightweight. This is something you'll appreciate if have to tote your bags any distance. You won't even notice the extra weight with this slipped in along side your laptop.The included case is magnetic and completely removable if you don't want to use it. Folded properly, it makes a handy little stand. In \"storage\" mode, it provides plenty of protection for your monitor from scratches while inside your bag.The picture is absolutely great. I was VERY surprised at the picture quality considering the price. It is bright and crisp with no pixilation.I appreciate that there are several ways to connect this unit: You can connect directly with the included usb-c to usb-c cable if your laptop supports it. In this mode, the monitor will take power and signal from the single usb-c cable (of course, it's using your laptop's power so this will accelerate battery drain if you aren't plugged in).The other way to connect is to use the usb-c to usb-a connetor for power (using either the provided wall-wart or plugging it into your laptop) and the included mini-hdmi to hdmi cable. This works well if your laptop is a little older and doesn't support usb-c (or doesn't have video over usb-c).This brings me to the other point: At this price, they even included a decent set of cables with attached Velcro straps to keep them organized.I highly recommend this awesome monitor to anyone who travels for business and feels they need a second screen.",

                "reviewText": "I was very happy when I received this high resolution, 2K, 2160x1440 display, Travel/Gaming/Work monitor, with 14 inch, 3:2 Aspect Ratio, QHD IPS. It works with Tablets, Laptops and PC. This is a fantastic, second display, USB-C, HDMI, Super Screen Extender, Gaming/Work/Travel monitor with 2 integrated speakers. It has a refresh rate (value) of 60Hz which is adequate, but the visuals are stunning! It measures a mere 0.2\" deep and weight of the monitor itself is very light, coming in at a mere 1.03 lbs, making this monitor very easy to handle, use, and transport.I first connected this 2K monitor to my PC. Connecting was pretty straight forward. YOUTUBE has some very informative videos explaining connectivity should you run into any problems.Then I wanted to see if it would attach to my Samsung Galaxy S8 ULTRA 14.6\" Screen Tablet. This S8 Ultra tablet has a dual/second screen option built-in to make connecting very simple. Going up to the Quick Panel Settings Layout, find the button that says \"SECOND SCREEN\" and press on it. Essentially, the tablet does the rest for you. You just connect your tablet via a USB-C cable to the monitors USB-C port and you are good to go. You have visuals and connectivity on a second screen display monitor. The Samsung tablet second screen option even gives you instructions on what to do should you run into any problems.This is a \"Great Find\" on Amazon should you be looking for a good quality, attractively priced, Second Display Monitor. It has great looks, superb connectivity and functionality, a high resolution, stunning display with integrated dual speakers. Included, 1 Smart Cover to protect your monitor from scratches and damage, 1 wall plug-in power adapter, 1 USB-A to USB-C cable, 1 USB-C to USB-C cable, 1 HDMI to Mini HDMI cable, 1 instruction manual and 1 heavy-duty display box, well cushioned, to protect your monitor.To sum up, this is an excellent 14 inch, 3:2 Aspect Ratio, 2K, QHD IPS gaming/work/travel display monitor with stunning visual graphics and speakers to expand your entertainment and work productivity needs, all at a great price and value.I'm giving this outstanding monitor a 5 star rating. I highly recommend!",

It's so nice, I was getting it as a gift for my son and now he's getting my old one that I bought and I'm keeping this one ;)Pros:+ Bright+ Excellent color rendition+ high resolution (better matches the resolution of my laptop)+ Speakers work very well (as good if not better than on my laptop). This surprised me - my other portable monitor had pretty weak speakers. These are anything but.+ plug and play: hook up USB C to/from my laptop (Windows), and I have a second monitor+ includes all cables - USB C - C, USB A - C, mini HDMI to regular HDMI, even a small USB power brick+ included fold-able cover allows a good range of viewing angles (and magnetically attaches)With Windows, it's as simple as plugging in the USB C to USB C cable and you'll have a second monitor. Right-click on the desktop and select \"Display Settings\" and you can choose your mode, resolution, scale (for font sizes), etc. It just works. With Windows you can even create a custom color profile for each monitor (if your graphics processor supports it).Cons:- it's not completely flat - Makes transport a little more difficult. The profile is flat with the bottom 1/3 being about 2x the thickness as the rest of the monitor.- Cover doesn't protect the screen much. this seems to be common with portable monitors, but the cover doesn't provide any real protection for the screen. I'm looking for a laptop case with hard sides for transporting it.Overall, for the price (~$130 at review), its a really great little monitor. My new favorite.",
