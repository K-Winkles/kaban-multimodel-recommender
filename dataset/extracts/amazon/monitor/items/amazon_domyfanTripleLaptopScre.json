                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Triple Laptop Screen Extender, and I couldn't be happier with my decision!

It's lightweight, slim, and incredibly easy to pack for business trips or when working on the go. The durable build quality and protective cover ensure it remains safe during travel, which is a huge plus for someone like me who's always on the move.But what truly sets this portable monitor apart is its affordability. The value it offers for its price point is unbeatable, and it's clear that the manufacturers have put a lot of thought into creating a high-quality product that won't break the bank.In summary, the Triple Laptop Screen Extender has significantly improved my productivity and overall computing experience.

                "reviewText": "I have been shopping around for a suitable monitor extension for a while. After watching numerous unboxing YouTube videos of various monitor extension brands and reading online reviews, I decided to go with Domyfan. Why? Well, one of the biggest reasons was the variety of cable connections that come in the box. Domfan doesn't assume everyone has the same laptop connections and ports. All of the other Manufactures that I reviewed only supplied one or two type of connections, which would have forced me to go buy more separate cables. Even if I want to upgrade or change my laptop in a few years, I already know I am covered with the cables with this purchase, so I can still use these monitor extensions. I also appreciate that the cost of the purchase included both monitors. A lot of other brands I saw were priced by the each.PROS:1 - Easy to connect and the cables are long enough to comfortable reach all the laptop Ports2 - Variety of cable types to meet your laptop port options.3 - Screen clarity and resolution. I haven't had any glitches or screens going black, yet (I use my laptop all day long 10+hrs with I am traveling). No problems with extended use.4 - Easy of clean up and pack up after use.5 - Screens, even in a separate case I bought at Office Max, still fits comfortable in a standard sized backup for traveling6 - Domyfan does include a protective traveling case with it, which is a nice touch.7 - 200% more productivity! Three monitors is a must have when working away from home remote.8: You look like a boss with three monitors while everyone else is struggling to work with just their laptop.CONS:1 -It will add some weight to your carrying efforts for sure. I felt a noticeable difference in weight in my backpack when traveling with the monitor extensions. However, I do not specifically point to Domyfan as being at fault here. I think that, regardless the manufacture you go with, the nature of this type of product will add significant weight to your carrying load, especially if you elect to go with the two additional monitors instead of just one extra monitor.2 -Wire management. I am not a fan of wires being exposed so much, regardless of electronics. Again, not pointing to Domyfan here. It's just the nature of the product itself.VERDICT:Aside from the added weight (it's not unbearable, so don't let that be a deal breaker), this is a great product. You could even go with the S1 for a dual display, and still be more productive. I am rough with my backpack, so if you are too, then I would recommend going and buying a 15in - 16in laptop sleeve for the monitors. Even with the gray protective case that Domyfan provides, I felt an additional layer of protection was warranted. I have that demonstrated in my pictures. For now, all is well with the monitors and I am happy with my purchase. It's a great investment to stay productive out on the road!",

                "reviewText": "The screens are easy to put onto the laptop monitor. They are a bit heavy, and tend to move the screen forward. They are clear. The audio is very low, so I don\u2019t use it. If your laptop has 2 USB-c connections it\u2019s super easy. We were able to use one HDMi, and 2 usb c\u2019s. One for power and one for video connection. For someone not well versed in computer connections, it\u2019s not extremely intuitive. Once we got it set up, it works very well!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Domyfan Laptop Screen Extender for my Acer Nitro 5 (17.3-inch screen), and I must say, it's a fantastic addition to my workspace. The screen quality is impressive, providing crisp and clear visuals that make multitasking a breeze. Additionally, the sound quality is commendable, ensuring that audio is clear and uninterrupted.Setting up the screen extender was a straightforward process, seamlessly integrating with my laptop. It's particularly beneficial for work, allowing me to have multiple windows open simultaneously, which significantly boosts productivity and efficiency.The only minor drawback I encountered was the brace's sturdiness. It felt a bit flimsy for my liking. However, this was easily remedied as I crafted my own brace (as shown in the picture), which provided the extra support I desired. Despite this, I still highly recommend the Domyfan Laptop Screen Extender. It's a reliable, high-quality product that delivers on its promise of enhancing your computing experience.",
