                "reviewText": "ANOTHER IMPORTANT UPDATE:just found this out and boy am i lucky, this is a FREESYNC monitor which means it works amazing with AMD component computers. it will visually work for intel, but you wont get to use the freesync technology. if you have intel look for a G-sync monitor and thank me later. G-sync is better anyway, but its intel only.Edit: My original review comes from someone who is tech savvy but woefully ignorant when it comes to luxury monitors [being any monitor thats nothing more than basic display needs]. But does have a more average consumer reaction to it, so i will leave it.As i did more research on FPS, Hz, Resolution compatibility, this monitors compatibility with all the former, and basic monitor functionality i came to understand why i had such problems. I just didnt really know what i was doing.If you want the full 1080 @ 165 hz display you will need to use the Display ports on your graphics card and the monitor, you can still get 1080 @ 144hz with hdmi, but thats just how it is if you want 165 hz.If you want to set these settings [and you will have to] you can do it through advanced display settings in windows or just go to MSI webpage find the monitor and download the driver and program for the monitor. driver might not be necessary and its harder to do but i think it helps.Original Review:Taking it straight out of the box and plugging in to play was a no go. At first i thought i had a defective unit and was going to need to send it back due to blurry picture quality. But after messing around with the monitors menu and.... turning off the picture enhancing settings and sharpness to 0 i got the opposite effect of what should happen and had crystal clear display... but i wasnt done @.@ i could only interact with the fps counter by displaying it! And it read at 60 fps! Wtf?? Loaded league and no change. Turns out i had to download a program to interact with the monitor on my pc to even up the display to (get this) 144 fps?? Wheres my other 21 hz?? And not only that but when i reduce the fps output on league to a lock at 60 fps i still read 144fps?? Im not sure im getting what it displays as when it was set to 60 it was variable and read below 60 fps at times.All that aside, i got a 32 inch curved monitor with supposed 144 fps and supposed 1ms response times. I hope i got what i paid for, even if i had to tech geek it up to \"fix\" my monitor",

                "reviewText": "I bought this monitor because I wanted something more immersive for my main gaming display. So I decided to finally get into the 30+ range for size. It\u2019s not perfect, but here\u2019s my experience.On the positive, this monitor came well packaged, and by well packaged I mean you better be ready to cut down a lot of cardboard. Getting it out of the package, there was no damage either and was brand new (which is awesome). The monitor has made my life easier for gaming and occasionally slapping together a video for YouTube. I find that it\u2019s very versatile and having multiple inputs has allowed me to hook up my Xbox with it as well as a my computer. IF YOU ARE A SERIES X USER you\u2019ll be happy to know you can utilize the 120 FPS feature that the Series X touts but it\u2019s only 1080p soooooo no 4K for you. Though if you\u2019re buying this I doubt 4K is your issue.The negative is a little difficult for me to find, but it\u2019s things that you would expect. If you\u2019re bot going to use a monitor arm then this thing is big, with a big stand, so you\u2019re going to need that desk space. Again this is a 1080p monitor so it\u2019s not incredibly stunning or breathtaking, just practical. If you\u2019re going to be moving it or unplugging and replugging cables you might want help as it is heavy and wide. The joystick on the back feels a little far away when trying to make adjustments. The monitor is very bright out of the box, so rather than going blind I recommend you fiddle with the options that it gives you using that joystick.Long story short, this is a proper gaming monitor that hits a beautiful price point, is pleasing to look at, has a great refresh rate, fantastic for productivity, and has good enough picture quality. If you want to experience a large monitor without spending ludicrous amounts while still having quality, this is a very safe and functional option.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good curve monitor for $300 price tag. I play AAA fps like Apex and gaming experience is great as it has 165hz 1080p 1ms specs( hdmi -> 144hz). I wish it was 1440p with around 100 hz though but well that would be around $400! I was really confused with 1440p 75hz 5ms vs this one. And choose this one as i have gtx1650 and getting full benefit of even 75hz would be tough at 1440p.If you have a good graphics card(gtx 20 series+) go for MSI version of 1440p 144hz 1ms or else this is the best monitor for average graphics card in 10 series coz you want to see that 144hz rather than 400 more pixels.Also, 32 screen is really big! You would want to setup good desk or mount it on wall or else you will feel each and every freaking pixel in your eye since resolution is NOT 2k or 4k.",
