                "reviewText": "I am used to having between 3 and 6 1080p monitors to create a curved experience while having usable screen real estate. The problem I had was the monitor bezels and the fact I was trying to make flat panels appear to curve.I saw this on sale for some $500 off and bought it. I was like a kid waiting for Santa and when it arrived, I couldn't wait to get it hooked up and game!It was too large for my desk. Nothing else would fit!No worries, I have another desk, glass, that will more than accommodate this large monitor.With anything, there are pros and cons, so lets get to it.Pros:The adjustable height stand is a must-have. Once you set it's height, it stays.The assembly was easy yet frightening at the same time. The base was a sinch to assemble.Virtually no glare at allThe curve allows for a nice natural turn of the head while still allowing great peripheral visuals while looking at the center.The refresh rate is perfect. While there are higher refresh rate monitors out there, this is the largest monitor I've had that doesn't make me sick to my stomach.Freesync Pro works. That's it. It works for G-Sync on Nvidia cards as well as AMD's Freesync. This is a must-have as it prevents any screen tearing (where the motion on the screen changes quickly, it splits the image horizontally) without the performance hit that VSync creates.Its beautifully designed.Picture in Picture! YES!! You can hook up a Fire stick and a computer and watch a football game while playing a video game. More on my experience with this in a minute.ConsIt is huge when it comes to width. Make sure you have the space, with some to spare, before purchasing.Running games at high settings and the monitor at its standard resolution requires a beefy graphics card.It's somewhat harrowing to put the monitor on the stand by yourself. Get a second person. Due to the curve, I didn't even attempt to lay the monitor face down and attach the base.The backlighting should be brighter. Otherwise, what's the point?While it has DTS:X Headphone support, there are no speakers. I'd be happy with the bare minimum for system sounds, but it does pass the DTS:X Headphone sound from the computer through the monitor to a headphone jack just to the left of the power/menu button.I'm not happy with the menus not having an exit option. You have to wait for the menu to time out and close.Now, back to the Picture in Picture statement. I spent $3,000 on a Samsung Ark 55\" gaming monitor. Weighing in at 90 lbs, I got the beast unboxed and everything plugged in. It looked fantastic. The problem with the Gen 1 version is no Picture in Picture; in fact, you cannot split the screen or anything you would expect. So, back to the store it went. Now, for $2,000, you can buy the 2nd gen Ark and get all four inputs on screen at once, but I just don't think it's worth it. If you need to rotate that big monitor or need four inputs on screen, go for it, but for me, I love this LG at a 32:9 aspect ratio!",

                "reviewText": "I'm mostly writing this to inform other Linux users who use Nvidia GPUs my experience with the UltraGear, and not \"hey look at me I'm a Linux user\".The Distro I use is KDE-Neon, RTX 2060 Super, version 470 drivers.For me, Gsync works out of the box. You will need to turn off your Compositor for Gsync to activate.I have not tested Freesync but I assume it would work since that's up to the monitor.I was dreading the first time I turned the monitor, since I had read other reviews here talk about dead pixels, which happens on all monitors, and unfortunately when I turned it on I found 3 spots that had 4 or 5 dead pixels.Fortunately, I quickly fixed them and they've stayed on since. If you find dead pixels on your monitor, there is a trick you can do by lightly massaging, in a circular motion, the area of the dead pixel with the tip of your finger or thumb. You'll want your monitor on while doing this and the easiest way to see the dead pixels is to full screen a very bright, white image.Back-light bleed is an unfortunate downside of IPS screens, and my screen does have some, but it's extremely minimal and only in the corners, and the amount of bleed is very even on each corner which was very nice.I've read some reviews where people have showed their distaste with a Vignetting effect along the top of the screen. I personally have noticed absolutely no vignetting on my screen.The stand is very slim, but does take up a large footprint, and if your desk is cramped or shallow, you may have to make space or may find that it's just too close to your face to be comfortable. My 20\" deep desk just isn't enough space for a comfortable viewing distance. If your desk also has a built on shelf above where the monitor sits, you will want to measure the space so you're not surprised when it doesn't fit into it.The supplied DisplayPort Cable is plenty adequate for 3440x1440 at 160hz.Mine did not come with a Type A to Type B USB cable to use the USB pass-through ports on the monitor. I believe my box may have been opened before since one of the hand holes for the styrofoam was broken, and the USB cable may have been taken.Brightness is substantial, I've never seen another monitor this bright before. But that's coming from someone who has been using 2 ASUS PB278Qs for the past 10 years.Since my screen has very minimal back-light bleed, the blacks are very dark, even for an IPS.The menu navigation is very straightforward and responsive. 8 different modes. The fake HDR mode is a gimmick, but does have very high contrast. The 160hz overclock setting works as intended. Gamer 1 is the setting I use at all times. There is a quick select outside of the menu to change modes.",

                "reviewText": "Probably one of the best monitors you can buy if you want curved ultrawide. On the pricey side but you get what you pay for, most of the ~$400-$500 ultrawides have some cons: bad viewing angles, blurry text on the sides, not curved, VA panel, slow pixel response, issues with sleep, etc. This monitor doesn't have any of those issues and works flawlessly for me.Pros:IPS displayExcellent input lagExcellent pixel response times(I'm not very sensitive to this so make sure it meets your needs)Works perfectly with Nvidia cards using GsyncText is crisp and clear across the whole panelNo brightness/color shifts from normal viewing anglesSleeps properly with Windows(had a lot of trouble with this on other monitors and my tv)Curved ultrawide, super immersive for gamingColors look great and has very good contrast IMOThe one physical button control works really well and is super easy to useGets more than bright enough for my use(I do 40% during a bright day, 20% in the evening, and 5% in the dark)Cons:The panel is a bit reflective, luckily I have it in a position where I don't have to deal with it. But if there is direct sunlight hitting it, you may have some issues(though I think it can get bright enough to overcome this)The panel sits pretty forward on the stand, so unless you have a deep desk, you will be pretty close to it(great for games with super wide FOV though)No built in speakers(though I imagine most people spending this much have proper speakers so a moot point)The part of the power cable going from the brick to the monitor is a bit short, if your desk is high enough you will either have a hanging power brick or need to place it on the desk or something.",

                "reviewText": "Took delivery of my monitor today after getting it at a sale price. Was concerned with several comments regarding picture quality and dead pixels. I ran the EIZO monitor test and could not be more thrilled with the panel quality as I have no dead pixels and I have a Gamma that is close to 2.2 out of the box. Colour saturation is excellent and the colours are vivid and realistic. The LG On Screen Display software is excellent and in addition to it I also loaded the current panel drivers from LG. Based upon my initial experience, I expect to get many years of enjoyment, however only time will tell and I will update this review should things change. But my initial impressions are that this is a wonderful monitor at the regular Amazon price and an outstanding monitor at the Amazon discounted price that shows up every now and then. The gaming experience is excellent and the text quality is also excellent when doing office/financial tasks.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: If you're looking for a \"budget\" ultrawide with majority of the features of what's on the market. Look no further.I've been looking for an ultrawide monitor for a few years now. Always reading and watching reviews of a whole bunch of them, knowing every little detail for each ultrawide monitor out there. I had my eyes on this one for a while and just decided to get the wait over with and order it.I ordered this monitor on October 11th with it arriving a few days later. I took a risk and decided to order a used monitor from the Amazon Warehouse deals with a listing that was described as \"Condition: Used - Very Good - Item will come repackaged.\" Now this did worry me a bit as the monitor could have arrived with no accessories, missing items, or even worse dead pixels. Which would result in me having to deal with returning it.Luckily the monitor arrived with almost everything that it should have. The packaging was amazing with it being in 2 standard brown boxes and even came in the original box. It was missing some cables and had scratches which weren't mentioned in the listing. But after talking with customer support the issue got resolved.This is the same panel as my 27GL850 so I already knew it was going to be great. I highly recommend getting a monitor arm for this as the included stand is very bulky and takes up a lot of desk space. Simple to use button and the menu is easy to navigate. Colors looks great and watching a movie or video that's made for this aspect ratio is a thing of beauty.",
