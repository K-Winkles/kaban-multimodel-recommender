Real roll of the dice as I didn\u2019t know anything about them or have any personal experience with the brand, but reviews seemed good. Long story short, I\u2019ve been blown away by how nice they are. Color and brightness are great, decent set of configuration options, and universally arm-mountable. I\u2019ve found that one pair of these gives me all the space I need to work comfortably (it\u2019s also the maximum size my arm mounts will accept). I was worried I may have to buy a third, but 2 is perfect, and I have dozens of windows open for work every day. I\u2019ll also give a big shout out to the durability\u2014they\u2019ve survived a desk migration and an office rearrange with no issues at all, and even a snagged HDMI cable that snapped while my desk was lowering and there\u2019s been ZERO damage to the monitors. At this price point, and for office work on an HD monitor, I\u2019d buy these all over again.",

                "reviewText": "I am verrrrry happy with this monitor. It replaced a Samsung monitor that I've had for several years that was terrific but only had a 60 Hz refresh rate.My only disappointment was the built-in speakers. I have used 2 tin cans and string with better sound than these two speakers have. They are very tinny, have very little range, and forget any base. Better-sounding speakers would hardly eat into the profit margin but could make all the difference in levels of sound satisfaction.Overall, I rated gaming and picture at 5 stars, but only a 4-star rating because the speakers are so cheap that I'm betting they got them for a price somewhere around a dollar. So they lost a star in 'value for the money' by including extremely cheap, poor-quality, speakers.",

                "reviewText": "The screen is crisp and clear. The colors are vibrant. I thought 27 inch is small but it's huge. Maybe because I'm used to 17 inch laptop screens. The sound is ok, but i didn't buy this for sound, there are dedicated speakers for that. I bought it for the screen and it delivered. The sound is lacking in the bass department; it's non-existent. The buttons on the bottom isn't labeled as far as i can tell which makes changing the settings a challenge. Power button on far right, accept is far left, up and down selection buttons are in between.",
