                "reviewText": "The ARZOPA Max 17 is lightweight, easy to use, and connects well , and without much effort , to multiple platforms, whether as a primary or extended secondary display. I use the ARZOPA MAX 17 alongside my 24-inch Lenovo monitor , and I especially appreciate that I can use just one cable to connect it to my Chromebook, Windows 11 laptop, or Mac.On the downside, the brightness settings don't save, so I have to adjust them every time I turn on the monitor. This can be annoying, especially in low-light conditions. The speakers are also pretty weak, so I wouldn't rely on them for watching videos or listening to music. Finally, the ARZOPA website could be improved. The technical support information is outdated, and the product lineup could be better organized.Overall, I'm happy with the ARZOPA Max 17 and would give it 4 out of 5 stars. It's a great option for a portable monitor, but just be aware of the few drawbacks I mentioned.",

I like the flexibility to position the screens wherever i want versus them being attached to my laptop screens like other products. The size and clarity are perfect. They are powered by usb c connection. The mini hdmi cable works out perfect for allowing me to use the dual setup since my laptop only has one usb c connection. Overall i am very pleased with these screens.",

And that is this.You can also get a bigger screen, but I wanted something more for travel. It is the perfect size and works as a second screen. It\u2019s easy to hook up and you literally just plug it in and it\u2019s ready for you. 10/10 would recommend.",

This means I've been away from my usual set up and had been struggling to work on just my laptop. This week I got fed up after trying and failing to flick back and forth between spreadsheets and other programmes and decided I needed a second screen that I could move between spaces with. Found this and ordered, figuring anything would be better than nothing.Despite low expectations, this has blown me away. It was literally plug and play, the pass through charging means no excess cables (usb c power to screen, usb c connector from screen to laptop), and the screen itself is bright, clear and a fantastic size. My productivity has shot up, my frustration levels have dropped enormously, and it's a dream to just pack up and move as needed.Anyone who travels for work and is in need of a second screen whilst on the move would do well to get one of these. Absolutely brilliant bit of kit.",

                "reviewText": "WOW! What an amazing little monitor!!! This is one of my new favorite things! It\u2019s super versatile with only 3 cables and no real power supply brick to worry about!! This is ingenious! It\u2019s super slim and light weight. The stand is surprisingly sturdy and also versatile as it allows for Landscape and Portrait modes (with PC). The resolution, colour, contrast and volume are all at very high quality levels. Basically this is a thin laptop panel that powers from whatever you plug it into \u2013 including your phone!!!So no doubt this makes a super extra panel beside your laptop (or PC), but the best thing about this panel and speaking to its versatility, if you plug this directly into your (say Samsung S23 Ultra) phone or modern Android at least.. Android DEX fires right up, and gives you the ability to use your phone as a track pad!! WHAT!? I didn\u2019t know this existed! But add a BT keyboard to that and you have a workstation based from you phone (and it only takes a USB-C cable). Yeah.. power it from your phone with perfect integration. I often watch videos while I work this monitor is a perfect size (14\u201d) but thin and the most portable thing I\u2019ve ever seen (coming from IT Industry that\u2019s saying something)A good monitor will cost you some coin.. you mention portable the cost normally doubles.. I think this hits a really good mark of SUPER portable like nothing I\u2019ve seen and a good price point for what it is and how it goes about it. I took one of my Playstations (4 in this case) and using a combo of USB and HDMI, it was perfect! Playstation only needs power (and WiFi) Monitor uses USB and HDMI.. no fuss no muss, just Awesome.I noticed that you can plug in a powerbank (battery) to power it and it charges the phone at the same time. Really.. really good engineering here. Very Highly Recommended. 5 Stars for sure! So you don\u2019t need to eat your phone battery completely. AMAZING PRODUCT!",
