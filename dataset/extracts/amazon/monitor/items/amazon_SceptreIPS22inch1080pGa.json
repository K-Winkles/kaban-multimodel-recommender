                "reviewText": "The picture quality seems to be good for a budget monitor. I do watch a lot of YouTube, and I use a variety of apps, and I have no complaints about picture quality. I'M NOT USING THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. The build is fairly good too, the materials don't appear to be flimsy or weak. All the plastic seems strong and durable. My only complaint, thus far, is that there's no tilt adjustment, so I have a thin booklet under the front half of the stand foot to make the monitor perfectly vertical. I WAS AWARE PRIOR TO PURCHASE but note this monitor stand cannot be adjusted vertically either and the stand height is about 4 inches, so be prepared for the stand height and for not being able to adjust the stand itself in any way.",

                "reviewText": "This 22 in monitor is perfect as a portrait side monitor for teams, email, discord, coding, etc. Great viewing angles since it is an IPS panel. Compliments my Sceptre 34 in main monitor. Good color and brightness out of the box and has 2 HDMI connectors and VGA for multi-system use. Sound is trash but not used but has a headphone audio in and out 3.5mm jack. Its a good price and does its job. I still have a Sceptre monitor that my kid uses from 2016 and it is still going strong. I will also use this as my main travel monitor as it fits easily in my checked case with bubble wrap. Not a gamer but seen decent reviews on it on YT as a budget friendly panel. It runs at 75Hz but I cant tell the difference in work related applications. There is a pro or con depending on your use case. It has a vesa mount but you have to use the 4 stand-offs in the package (see photo) since it interferes with the panel stand attachment. I like it because as a side monitor combined with my 34 in screen on the dual arm stand it places this monitor further forward to line up better as it reaches around the wide 34 in monitor. Those arms are only so long and this stand off gives it just the right distance to align nicely. (Oh and if you use the vesa mount you will need your own screws to attach it.)",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this monitor for three days now. The video quality is as good as I can ask for. Color depth and detail seems as good as it can be. Motion is very acceptable, not much judder even at 60hz, I need to look very closely at it to notice any in videos. I have not tested game motion.Physical appearance is good, it doesn't look cheap.Sound is very weak but can be easily upgraded to an amplified sound bar or speakers by plugging into the headphone jack. The small monitors and tv's are not going to have good acoustics and vibration is not good to monitors or TV's, so it is a good idea to promote the use of a sound bar that won't rattle the monitor. The little rear speakers may get a person by until they can get a sound bar. I'm looking for a pre-amp with at least about 5x adjustable voltage gain(volume knob) to connect between the monitor and sound bar.After building my first try of a 20db preamp the USB powered speakers I am using needed a preamp with 20db or Av (10) ,(Av is voltage gain), so I just hit it on the nail.That is now driving the usb speakers to the edge of overdrive and they are very loud now, too loud to listen at full volume unless in an adjacent room.I can't say how much gain anyone else's speaker system will need but that is how mine worked out for the $10 Manhattan USB powered speaker system worked out. I think a 15 or 20 watt computer speaker system that is self powered, not USB powered, would be loud enough to not need a preamp.There are some 20db headphone amplifiers on Amazon that should work to boost the monitor's headphone output enough to feed a weak amplifier.I think the goal with the weak headphone output is to keep customers from damaging their ears with the out of the box system. It's out of their blame is someone modifies the headphone volume and damages their hearing. So if using headphones, unplug the add-on amp and use the monitor's headphone out.Look what I got myself into, so build at your own risk.",

                "reviewText": "I got this a few months back, preparing for my new PC build, which i had put together on a low budget, and I'd say it was worth the price. While it has a somewhat low refresh rate compared to the more fancy 144hz or higher refresh rate monitors, I wouldn't say that's a negative, unless you're into precision shooting games and need a high refresh rate.It comes with two hdmi ports, a VGA port, as well as audio in/out ports. Came with an HDMI cable in the packaging. does not include a display port, which wasn't a problem personally as my old computer didn't even support that type of display.Monitor stand was easy to assemble, came with a little screwdriver, which I used to assemble. Monitor stand once assembled is a bit loose and wobbly, but hasn't collapsed or caused any annoyance, so I'd say it does fine.For the ~$70 asking price it tends to go for usually, I personally think it's a perfectly sufficient product and was a big upgrade from what I was working with before I got it.If you were in a similar situation to me, dealing with a low resolution monitor that did not suffice, I'd say at least consider giving this one a try.I have included a picture of it showing Toontown onscreen, which is a generally colorful game, to show off its color. I am an artist, and its colors are way better than what I had, so genuinely, I am happy with this purchase. Thanks \u2764\ufe0f",
