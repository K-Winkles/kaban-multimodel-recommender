I'm not an Android person but I find it very usable. Video, sound, construction all great.What I don't care for..Little paper booklet is uselessCamera can be mounted on the end or side of the screen, BUT it doesn't work on the side because you can't flip the picture... Seriously, a simple settings code in the camera app SHOULD be able to flip the image..It's not apparent to modify the 1st Home page. I'll have to surf the web to figure that out.All in all, I gave it 5 stars. so far...",

The fact that I can take it anywhere in the house like the kitchen for recipes and tv background noise while I cook is exciting! I also don\u2019t have a tv in my bedroom so I can roll it in there or just tuck it in my closet if I don\u2019t want it out.",
