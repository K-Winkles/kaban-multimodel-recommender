                "reviewText": "This monitor works great as a monitor for my home security cameras. The picture quality is clear and the brightness is just right.It turns on when power is applied (without pushing any buttons) and does so within 5 seconds.The monitor can be powered by the micro-usb located on the left side or any of two usb-c that are located on the right side. The hdmi is located above the usb-c ports.If the front logo bothers you, you can easily remove it with a plastic razor blade, leaving a clean matte surface.For a sub seventy dollar portable monitor- it's a no brainer.",

This thing looks amazing, is super light. I can even connect with my iPhone but need lightening cable to do it. Display Quality is good. Need to connect two cables - 1st for power and 2nd for display. So far integrated stand is holding up (not tipping over and not breaking. I would recommend it",
