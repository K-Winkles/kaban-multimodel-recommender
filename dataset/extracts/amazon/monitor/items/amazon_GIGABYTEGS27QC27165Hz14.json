                "reviewText": "Gigabyte managed to deliver a very decent gaming monitor that everyone can afford. Here i will tell my experience with 2 gaming consoles and 2 different computers.PC1: A gaming laptop that connected through HDMI can reach 1440p 144hz. The colors are powerful and accurate, but it will not get to use 165hz because of the HDMI limitations.PC2: A mini pc with a display port. it can get to use the 165hz without problem and 170hz if you overclock the monitor.Playstation 5: 1440p 120hz works wonderfully. it also outputs 2160p (4k) 60hz but in my opinion it doesn't worth it. Stick with 1440p. Also, HDR works too, i didn't like it in any device because it's extremely bright and looks pale, but you can try it if you want. Movies and games look beautiful without it anyway.Wii with HDMI adapter: I tried this one just to see how it handles low resolutions and the result is actually impressive. it does look pixelated of course, but better than an average monitor or HDTV, but never better than a CRT TV/monitor.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars G27QC: A Very Solid Budget 1440p Choice",
                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant buying this monitor coming from a 7 year old LG IPS Ultrawide, but I needed higher refresh rates and 1440p at a decent price, and that led me to this monitor.So far, it's very good for the price.Things I'm most impressed with:-Black uniformity (Very good on my unit, especially for a curved VA panel)-Grey uniformity (Okay on my unit, above average for sure)-White uniformity (Absolutely perfect on my unit, 0 flaws)-Lack of backlight bleed (My unit has the slightest bleed in the top left and bottom right corners, but hardly noticeable.)-Zero dead pixels-Fast Pixel Response (It is much faster than the LG, even being VA, VA has come a long way! There is some blur, but nothing that bothers me as it's much better than my previous monitor. My unit passes the blur busters test with ease to the naked eye)-Color accuracy (I haven't officially tested it, it out of the box stock settings seem to be pretty accurate to my eye, I changed the settings though as I like the oversaturated look)-Overdrive settings (Previous reviews from Tech Channels when this product first came out always mentioned improperly calibrated Overdrive settings. Gigabyte seems to have fixed this on the newest models, I have noticed no issues using the \"balanced\" overdrive mode @165Hz)-Overall Brightness (This thing punches well above 250 nits, other reviewers on their units have cited 320 nits, mine feels even higher, potentially pushing 350+ nits peak brightness. It can hurt my eyes in the dark)-Useful extras included (Gigabyte includes 3 separate power cables (for different countries), a DP cable, and an HDMI cable. Decent quality cables as well, nice bonus.)-Great packaging, assembly was super quick and straightforward. Only thing that got me stuck was releasing the spring tension from the monitor arm. There is a small piece of black plastic keeping the spring tension, I first tried to remove it without releasing the spring tension, that was a no go. Once you push up on the stand and release the tension, the plastic falls out with ease and the monitor arm snaps back how it's supposed to, and you can install the stand. It's ready to go after that.The not so good:-G-Sync flicker. (It flickers bad, and I'm still trying to diagnose it. Some games do, and others don't, so it might not be the monitor. To my understanding, ALL G-Sync monitors flicker, some less than others. So far, playing around with a few settings has helped reduce it, I will update if I find a way to completely mitigate the flicker. I also have not tried a different DP cable, that might fix it as well. I'm not putting this issue against the monitor just yet as many other trusted reviewers mentioned G-Sync working fine on their units.)-Annoying port placement (Ports and IO is on the bottom of the monitor, serious design oversight. Very difficult to plug things in, you have to reach under the monitor and do it blind.)-That's it that I can find so far, if any issues arise in the future I will update the review accordingly.Something worth mentioning:-The seller (Amazon in my case) is supposed to stamp the warranty card with the purchase date. If they do not (Of course they didn't, even though the box arrived opened, indicating that they did!!!!) your warranty begins from date of manufacture, not date of purchase. This is super annoying as I just lost a year of warranty coverage thanks to Amazon refusing to stamp the warranty card.Final thoughts: Overall, fantastic budget 1440p 27\" curved VA high refresh rate monitor. For the price I paid ($270 + tax), it is 110% worth it. Great upgrade coming from an older (2014-2015) LG IPS Ultrawide panel.",

                "reviewText": "Review may potentially changed as I\u2019m getting a second monitor today but as of now with the first one I ordered I can say the monitor itself is good aside from one glaring issue. Mine came with a scratch on the LCD panel, it is very small so I almost didn\u2019t notice it at first until I was looking at the sky in-game and there I saw it, in effectively the middle of the monitor a couple mm gash on the display, whether it be through shipping or if it just got past quality control at Gigabyte or Amazon I didn\u2019t pay $200 for a new monitor for it to have a scratch on the panel upon arrival. PS. will update review with picture of said scratch today after I\u2019m off work, then send a picture of the new one however it turns out. So the second monitor is also has a defect being a smear mark underneath the panel itself, completely disappointed and will never purchase another monitor from Gigabyte returning both ASAP and hoping Amazon will refund me. Pictures are of the 2nd monitor with the smear mark the one with the scratch on the panel is in the box and I\u2019d rather not get it out when I\u2019m returning it.",
