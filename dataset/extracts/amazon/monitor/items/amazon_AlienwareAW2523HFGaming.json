The stand is also very sturdy, so there's no need to worry about the monitor wobbling.Stylish design: The AW2724DM has a sleek and stylish design that will look great on any gaming desk. The AlienFX lighting adds a touch of personality and can be customized to your liking.Haven\u2019t come across any negatives so far as the panel tested perfect and no dead pixels.Overall, I'm very impressed with the Dell Alienware AW2724DM.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best 27\u201d QHD IPS monitor at this price point",
                "reviewText": "This is a newer model, and because of that I can\u2019t speak for its longevity, but I am hoping with the Dell/Alienware brand behind it, that it will last a very long time.It was ultimately down to this monitor and the LG 27GP850-b. That monitor is probably the most popular gaming monitor at this price point, and it was between that, and the new AW2724dm, which this review is for.In my opinion, this new Alienware takes the crown from the LG. It was released a few months ago, and you get more for your money. Both are very similar, the two biggest differences is that this monitor has certified HDR600, whereas the LG has only HDR400, which is very lackluster, and personally I wouldn\u2019t even consider using it while gaming. The HDR600 definitely makes things look better in all the games I play, and gets rid of IPS darkness in games like COD, which you will have without HDR activated. The HDR600 does not make games look washed out like the LG does with HDR400. For movies, HDR600 is not the best on paper, but I only use it for games, so I am not going to give an opinion on that.The one thing the LG has that this monitor does not, is BFI, which is suppose to help with motion blur. For an IPS panel, the Alienware already has near perfect motion blur, better than the LG according to most reviews. Also BFI is a feature in gaming that I find useless, because you cannot have VRR(gsync/freesync) on at the same time as BFI. VRR is essential because it will cut down input lag by half in some cases, when compared to using Vsync. In every game I\u2019ve played, the VRR is like having Vsync completely off(way less input lag), with all of the benefits of having it on(no screen tearing).This monitor also has very accurate colors out of the box, according to every review I read. Unless you do professional work, you will not have to mess with the colors. Simply set the color profile to \u201ccolorspace\u201d. Every other color profile is very \u201ccool\u201d, with a bluish tint out of the box, including the one that is set by default, so be sure to change this right away. You don\u2019t really have to worry about this in HDR mode, all of the profiles look fine, just while in SDR.Before buying this monitor, a few reviews mentioned fuzzy text, which made me very hesitant, however with amazons return policy I went ahead with the purchase. I am glad I did, I have not seen clearer text on any other 1440p monitor. Both the black and grey uniformity are also near perfect for an IPS monitor, and no noticble IPS glow at all. Maybe I just got really lucky in the \u201cpanel lottery\u201d, but I am beyond happy with this monitor.",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited about this monitor, but it has the worst backlight bleed of any monitor I have ever owned, IPS or otherwise. I didn\u2019t spot it in the Amazon reviews but further searching online revealed it is a common problem with this monitor and because of that I\u2019m wary to even try to exchange it. On a product this expensive, it\u2019s unacceptable. Do note that all IPS panels have some level of glow to them in the corners and that is generally okay. It is not the same as backlight bleed and the bottom right corner of mine is far worse than the others. In gaming and even on the desktop it is VERY noticeable.Setting aside the backlight bleed it is actually a great product and that\u2019s what I find most upsetting. Colors pop, the response times are great, no ghosting or other problems. Everything about it functions the way I would expect a monitor of this price to do. Even the IPS glow is substantially reduced compared to my not-that-old LG ultrawide panel from a few years back.But given the widely reported backlight problems, I encourage people to avoid this one",

                "reviewText": "This monitor exceeded my expectations for the price.-Vibrant color saturation-Excellent Clarity-No Dead Pixels-180hz OC-No noticable blooming-Zero ghosting-Thin matte finish with no noticable dirty screen effect on a white background.I tend to game in sdr, but surprisingly this monitor has rather decent hdr for the price I paid for it. $400cnd (not sure why it had a $100 price jump recently)The screen can also reach 600nits of brightness.The 4k equivalent to this monitor is the Corsair 32uhd144hz which I also own.The display is rather identicle except for the resolution obviously but at a fraction of the price.1440p is definitely the sweet spot for pc gaming. I use the 4k monitor for my ps5.The leds are customizable to match any rgb setup which is also a plus.For those wondering it does not have an hdmi 2.1, I've seen a lot of controversy over the internet whether if it did or not so just wanted to clarify.Overall I highly recommend this monitor if its for your pc. Would look at other options for console gaming.",
