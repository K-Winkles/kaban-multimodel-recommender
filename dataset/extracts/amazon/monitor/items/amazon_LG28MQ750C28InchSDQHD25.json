                "reviewText": "I recently received a new Macbook Pro M3 Pro laptop from work (replacing an Intel Macbook Pro whose lease was up), and had a couple of older LCD monitors that needed to be replaced. After doing some research on features I decided to replace the LCD monitors with two of these babies.I mounted them on retractable arms to clear desk space, and set them into full screen mode as the work laptop only supports two external monitors (my personal Macbook, also new, is an M3 Max and supports 4). The monitors as well as a couple of other devices are hooked up to a CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt 4 Dock, and the Macbook is hooked to the Dock with a single Thunderbolt 4 cable, which provides access to all devices as well as power the laptop via the CalDigit dock.I do want to mention that I am a software engineer, and write code for a living, so having high quality monitors to save my poor tired eyes is a must.I am loving this setup! I keep Slack open on my Laptop screen, keep two web browsers open on one monitor and my IDE in full screen mode on the other. The eye fatigue is all but gone, which is awesome, the monitors are cool and don't put off alot of heat (which was not the case with the ones I have retired), and all of the cable are now gone off my desktop.(A side node, the Macbook Pro M3 Pro is ULTRA QUIET, I don't think I've heard the fans kick in a single time since I set all this up).Having the monitors on the retractable arms not only frees up desk space, it allows me to adjust the monitors so that they are conducive to coding and switching focus from the IDE to the browsers and back without alot of extra motion.Did I mention that the resolution is fantastic? It is.I have also put them in dual screen mode hooked up to my personal Macbook Pro, and that works well, switching between modes is super easy. The monitor with the browsers I put in dual screen mode but the one that displays my IDE I keep as a single screen.Highly recommend, worth the investment, this set up should do me for a few years to come, and my eyes are thanking me!",

                "reviewText": "Programmer. Tall is great.Not the smallest pixels on the planet, smaller than my eyes resolve, so good enough.If you use progressive lens bifocals, you may not be happy. I have a set of single vision lenses made at my computer distance and use those.Come on quickly, doesn't do stupid things. Audio is, let's say \"usable\". Good enough for beeps and alerts, and if I want music or a longer educational video I switch up to something more expensive than the whole monitor anyway. Comes with all the cables you might need! That's refreshing these days.I think this review is on the one that sits on a stand. I also got the one with the clamp on swivel arm which is slightly more expensive, but that arm is a work of art! It just couldn't be attached to my one desk. You will need about 3\" of overhang to clamp the clamp. But like I said, this is the one with a more traditional stand and it is fabulous too.",

                "reviewText": "I was able to grab one of these during a good pre-Christmas sale, but have been interested in this model for awhile. LG makes quality products, and this monitor is no exception. The picture quality is great and bright, and it is the equivalent of two 1440p monitors stacked on top of each other vertically. I also plan to make use of the Picture by Picture (PBP) capability that will present the HDMI1 in the top half of the screen and HDMI2 in the bottom have the screen, thereby granting a full 1440p monitor to two different computers simultaneously. Otherwise, I can allocate the full monitor resolution to either computer, as desired.I spent a week teleworking with this new monitor and I found it very useful for working with tall formatted content such as documents and software code. I also work with two ulta wide 1440p monitors, where I tile my work across the screen horizontally. This requires me to swing my head from side to side or turn my whole body to go from one end to the other. I will just need to adjust my working habits more to stack things more vertically to reduce turning of my head sideways. The only annoyance I have encountered so far is that Windows has shortcuts to snap windows to the left and right halves of the screen, but have not found a way to snap them to the top and bottom halves of the screen yet. This can be done by manually resizing windows top and bottom, but this does slow down productivity a bit. But being able to fit most classes within a single screen without scrolling is a huge win for me.",

See more code than I normally could even compared to my 4K2. Use my work computer with dual monitor and still use my Mac on the top part of the screen (or bottom if you want) and vice versa3. Have my work computer on the bottom, video game console on the top and Mac on my other monitor at the same time for those lazy days.Only thing I\u2019d say to watch for is to make sure your laptop has a dedicated video card. My work laptop doesn\u2019t and it barely runs both monitors and the hugest frame rate I can get out of it is 30(yuck) but that\u2019s not a problem with the monitor itself.I also accidentally bought the one without the ergo arm, so watch out for that",

The double simultaneous inputs from 2 devices work like a marvel as well.The arm is solid, feels great and effortless, though it doesn't go as high as I'd like, but nothing a piece if wood can't fix.I went from having 3 screens to 1 and I don't mind at all.

One of them powers my Macbook by USB-C (96W). The DualUp also acts as KVM so when I switch to the PC input my logitech unifying dongle and usb headset auto switches computers.- The ASUS is set to 1440p at 1.5x dpi (Mac OS renders it to 5K then scales it down by half so it looks sharp on 4K).- I combined all monitors in Mac OS midi to create a multi-output sound device, sounds amazing for general purpose.- LGs color temperature adjust with the OS night time settings, automatic brightness works well, and colors look great out of the box.*My computers:- Macbook Pro 14 (M1 Max)- Windows PC (3080Ti)",
