                "reviewText": "Just not really any other way to put it. From the overall design of the monitor itself, to the picture quality, to the built in safety features to prevent any damage to the panel, this display is just killer.[Some gripes I have]Firstly the packaging it came in, though good, needs serious improvement. Primarily the wrapping it comes in leaves bubble wrap stains on the display which looks abysmal and though some reports claim they were never able to get these markings off their panels, mine came off with just a bit of screen cleaner and a good wipe.I also dislike that there's no ability to personally upgrade the firmware. This results in having to buy an entirely new panel if a better firmware becomes available and that's a bit asinine with how expensive this display is.The blacks aren't super good if you're in a bright room due to problems with ambient lighting, which could take away from the enjoyment you get from the display, so it's, in my opinion anyways, most enjoyable in a darker room which is primarily where Im using it.No HDMI 2.1 which is extremely disappointing as this hurts the ability to use this monitor in its full capacity on a gaming console. That doesn't affect me however because I have an LG 55 inch oled for just such the occasion and primarily pc game. Fortunately for me.The ultra wide aspect of this display has been.. an adjustment period as well. Although overall the quality of this is, as aforementioned, incredible, it's worth pointing out that it takes a lot of adjusting if you're coming from your typical 16:9 displays and you'll see this primarily in things like watching YouTube videos, movies, and in some video games. You especially notice the difference in one of my worst examples, the game Hell Let Loose. I absolutely cannot play it in 21:9 whatsoever. Just cannot. It's so stretched out and hideous looking that it almost made me nauseous. And that sucks primarily because that's one of my favorite games, and 16:9 leaves black bars on the sides of the game which isn't a huge deal but I digress. So expect not all your games to look ideal to you when getting this and potentially having to compromise.[Praise and tips]Frankly I just don't have anything short of absolute praise for this display. I've found the best experience to be sitting back a few feet from my desk with a controller, or my wireless mouse and keyboard upon my lap-table. I personally use HDR 400 true black over the HDR 1000 option because it truly, in my opinion of course, looks insanely better, darker, significant and more atmospheric this was especially true in the modern warfare 2 campaign.Overall I'm greatly enjoying this display, I hope it lasts me a very long time as I baby it about as much as someone could possibly recommend babying an OLED. I personally use brave browser with the darkreader extension, use windows dark theme, a Screensaver after 2 minutes of not being at my desk, I hide my Taskbar, and I make sure that in any games there's no static red anywhere. I absolutely love that after four hours of use on this panel, when shut off it'll do an automatic pixel refresh. Now that doesn't mean this panel is susceptible to any burn-in whatsoever, it is an oled panel after all..but with a lot of TLC and awareness of what you have on your display, the likeliness of it burning in is about as likely as a meteor striking your house and even if SOMEHOW you do everything I recommend and it still burns in, well Dell has your back with a three year warranty. Just make sure you register it on their website when you get the display. However, and I cannot stress this enough whatsoever, this display, much like any oled display, is probably not the ideal choice if you're somebody who works from home and sits infront of their computer for an asinine amount of time. This is pretty much ideal for gamers who game for long periods of time where stuff is happening on the screen constantly.Again though, Im loving this display, it has been nothing short of a game changer for me and leaves me excited for the future of oled monitors. I'm in no rush to upgrade my pc to a 4090 an 13900k to game in 4k 120fps, and as an owner of both a 4k oled and now this, there really isn't that HARDCORE of a noticeable difference imo and this is perfect for my current pc specs. Couldn't be happier, couldn't rate this higher, trust me you're going to want this badboy when it comes back and isn't being scalped for 1600.",

                "reviewText": "I own a 34GP83A-B which uses a slightly newer 34\" version of the same panel tech (Nano IPS). Compared to that panel the AW3821DW has noticeably worse contrast, has terrible out of the box color accuracy, lacks a gamma setting, and has worse motion performance.The gamma issue could be remedied through the DDC/CI gamma capability except the monitor has a buggy DDC/CI implementation that resets any values set through DDC/CI when the monitor goes into standby or turns off. This probably won't be a deal breaker for many but it's super annoying if you use DDC/CI to control brightness from your computer and it means I can't correct the gamma either. I've reported a bug with Dell but they informed me they won't be fixing the issue as it's \"not supported\". Ridiculous, I own a 13 year old Dell monitor that properly supports DDC/CI and this 2021 panel can't?On a positive note the size and pixel density of the AW3821DW is pretty perfect for gaming and productivity but unfortunately that cons outweigh the pros for me. I'll be returning the AW3821DW and looking to try QD-OLED options or stick with my 34GP83A-B.",
