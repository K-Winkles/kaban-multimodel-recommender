Definitely recommend getting this screen if you need a second screen for cheap!",

                "reviewText": "The screen is a great quality option given it's relatively low price. Almost every other portable monitor I've seen like this is at least $10-20 more. It works very well. The graphics are good.It's less than half the weight of the 15.6 in laptop I use it with so it is very convenient to carry and use on the go.The stand/protective shell the screen comes are functional. You still can't drop it off a building and expect it to work afterwards, but the shell will protect it from the average scratches and pressures you could expect to occur when you store it with textbooks, pens, and the like. You might want to get a different stand than the protective case (but MNN's customer support will likely, in their infinite generosity, hook you up with one). Even if you don't the protective case doubles as a serviceable stand that you can expect to keep your screen securely propped up.On my desk (from left to right) I have a 21 in HP, My 15 inch laptop, an old square Dell Monitor and then mounted on the side I have the MNN.The screen is matte. It produces minimal glare and reflection by comparison with my laptops glossy built-in screen.Worth noting is the menu/multi-functioning. The multifunction button will probably not be fully functional when a usb-c is plugged into the left-side OTG port as it is too close to the button and likely places a pressure on the internal components that might displace or interfere with functioning. When I used it while connected to the OTG port, it would adjust settings like volume, contrast, and brightness down but not back up. Using the port will not permanently disable or disfigure anything, just make sure you don't need to adjust the settings while you are using it. More likely than not you'll be using some combination of the left-side hdmi mini and usb-c, so this shouldn't be an issue but take note in case you do use the OTG port instead.Overall, if you need another screen with you for work or school this is a great option at a great price. Whether your reading, writing, or streaming the MNN Portable Monitor is going to get the job done for you.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this MNN portable monitor and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Not only is it the only competitively priced monitor on the market, this little gem has completely transformed my productivity, whether I'm on the road or simply need an extra screen at home! Let me share why this product deserves a solid 6-stars instead of the allotted 5.First and foremost, portability is where this monitor truly shines. It's Incredibly slim and lightweight, making it effortless to carry around. Slip it into your bag and you won't even notice the extra weight [really, it's that light] and the included protective case ensures that it's safe during travel, so I never have to worry about accidental scratches or damage. I recently had a 2.5 week business trip and it was the MVP of my mobile desk setup. 100%The display quality is outstanding. The screen is defaulted to 15% when powered on [shouts out to dark reader people] and once turned up, boasts vibrant colors, sharp details, and excellent viewing angles. The resolution is always crystal clear and truly immersive experience, making me forget I'm even using a portable monitor!Setting up the monitor is a breeze! Plug-and-play functionality means I can conect to my laptop within seconds thanks to the convenient USB-C connection or smartphone with added power support. It even supports HDMI input which gives me flexibility when connecting to different devices including my raspberry pi, no drivers or complicated software installations required! :)The built-in speakers are surprisingly impressive. Delivering a clear and rich audio sensation. While they may not replace a dedicated sound system, they are more than sufficient for casual multimedia consumption or video conferences. It is a great addition that enhances the overall user experience.Another notable feature is the 2 year warranty and the impressive support from the team. They are extremely professional and care deeply for the satisfaction of the consumer. I reached out with a minor concern and they helped resolve my issue within 12 hours without any issue. I am extremely impressed and thankful for a support team as attentive as they are.Overall, this portable monitor has exceeded my expectations. It's impressive display quality, slim design, easy set-up, excellent audio, adjustable stand/protective cover, compatability range, and A+ support team makes this product an absolute winner. Whether you're a frequent traveler, remote worker, digital nomad, or simply in need of an extra screen, this portable monitor is a game-changet! I recommend it to anyone looking to boost their productivity.",

                "reviewText": "it works. however,- do not spill a single thing on this. it will break, it will stain forever.- do not put any pressure on this. if it werent for the price point i bought it at, i would've complained to costumer support. however, I got it cheap so I dont care like that. it WILL snap under a slight amount of pressure. I stepped on it (somewhat lightly but I am tall and big and also fat) and even with the screen protector it comes with, it just absolutely would not post. hot garbage, but im not expecting super performance here.when it did work, it worked good! quality was decent, cables that it came with was plenty, the in-book guides are decently written with links to youtube videos (qr codes) for the literately impaired (or visually enhanced individuals).I wouldnt game on this. it does runescape fine, but thats runescape. you can run that on a potato. I tried a higher frame game and while it worked, it just doesnt really feel right. if you want to, you can. I dont think it feels nor looks right. it can do, if i recall, either 120hz or 60hz. pretty standard. this is not a game changer, but if it goes on sale and youre not a flat footed monster, this is a good deal. otherwise, theres better portable monitors.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the [Brand Name] Portable Monitor, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations. This monitor has truly been a game changer for both work and entertainment purposes. Let me share my experience and why I highly recommend it.First and foremost, the portability factor is fantastic. The monitor is incredibly lightweight and slim, making it effortless to carry around wherever I go. It easily fits into my backpack without adding any significant weight. Whether I'm working at a coffee shop, traveling, or visiting a friend, I always have a high-quality display at my disposal.The display quality is simply outstanding. The [Brand Name] Portable Monitor features a Full HD resolution, and the colors are vibrant and accurate. The viewing angles are excellent, allowing for a clear picture from any position. I use it for both work and entertainment purposes, and it never fails to deliver a visually pleasing experience. Whether I'm editing photos or watching movies, the sharpness and clarity are remarkable.Setting up the monitor is a breeze. It's compatible with various devices, including laptops, smartphones, and gaming consoles. I appreciate the flexibility it offers, as I can easily connect it via HDMI or USB-C. It even supports touchscreen functionality, which is incredibly useful when I'm working on the go or playing touchscreen-based games.Another aspect that impressed me is the built-in speakers. Although they might not replace dedicated speakers, they deliver surprisingly decent audio quality. It's convenient for casual listening or when I'm watching videos without headphones. Of course, for a more immersive experience, I still prefer using external speakers or headphones.The monitor also comes with a protective case, which is a thoughtful addition. It safeguards the screen from scratches and minor bumps, ensuring its longevity. The case is well-designed and provides easy access to ports and buttons without the need to remove it.Lastly, I want to mention the durability of this portable monitor. Despite its slim design, it feels sturdy and well-built. I have been using it for a few months now, and it has withstood the test of time. It's evident that the [Brand Name] prioritizes quality, and it shows in every aspect of this product.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the [Brand Name] Portable Monitor. It has become an essential part of my work routine and a reliable source of entertainment on the go. If you're looking for a top-notch portable monitor with excellent display quality, versatility, and durability, look no further.

                "reviewText": "A surprisingly capable, yet portable display. About the size and weight of a thin laptop/big tablet, so it fits nicely in a bag. The cover works decently well as a stand and to cover the screen in transit, though you may want something more sturdy in some cases. Easily handles power and data over a single USB C to computers that support it, but comes with HDMI and power adapter for other devices.Image quality is actually quite good, and mostly bright enough for use in a normal office setting, though a little dimmer than most normal office displays. Quite decent viewing angle and colours look pretty good. Has a typical matte finish. HDR is supported, though doesn't make an enormous difference (mostly since the max brightness isn't super high). Supports 48-60 Hz Freesync, apparently, though I didn't try it. Dynamic contrast (backlight dimming) is there, though I find it distracting, so I've left it off.In general, It's pretty amazing for the price. It's basically perfect if you need more screen real estate for a laptop but want to be able to move workspaces easily. One of my colleagues saw it left on a desk and decided to try it and now she wants one too. :)",
