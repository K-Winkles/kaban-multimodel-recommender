                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the second portable monitor I've purchased. They are a lot more useful than you might first realize. The first was 16\" and 1080P with 60hz refresh rate. I really liked that monitor, and so did my girlfriend so we decided to upgrade. I gave her the 16\" model and kept this larger one for myself. We both have been very pleased with their performance. There haven't been any issues with the display or function. She uses the monitor as a dex/samsung computer thing and I think that's a great way to utilize these portable monitors. I keep this 17.3\" on a side table and use it for retro gaming and for my raspberry pi. I'll try to provide the rest of the world with my findings:Picture: 5/5It's 1080 @ 60hz - The picture is very clear. I don't have issues with glare, or viewing angles. It is also pretty bright, I have the brightness set to 100% for the video in this review - but normally it's nowhere near that. I keep it around half way or even less if it's dark in the room I'm in.Bezels & Sturdiness: 5/5The frame is solid, it feels textured - like a good powder coat or anodized aluminum. I like that the bottom doesn't have a big brand logo, it's just plain old black and it looks elegant and modern compared to some of the other brands I've seen. The buttons feel sturdy. I'd prefer a different button arrangement for the menu/settings but the switch-button it has is at least intuitive and sturdy. It's a preference thing and doesn't detract from the monitor.Sound: 5/5I was surprised by the quality of the two 1 watt speakers. They don't sound like a tin can, they sound like a quality speaker. I have watched some movies and tv shows, but mostly I play games with mine and it sounds great. I keep the volume around 16 or 17, it goes up to 100 and offers plenty of volume.Price: 5/5This is a great deal because you get a monitor, AC power adapter, a case and 3 cables.The carrying case is one place most people will either upgrade or get a replacement. It functions, the magnets work well and it holds up but it feels a bit, meh... I mean, if you get a nice monitor like this, you should also make sure it's safe when you're traveling with it. I have an old laptop bag it fits in nicely. I also use a stand when I'm at home, so I don't use the one it came with. The one it comes with functions and yeah, it will protect the screen- but I like the adjustable ones that are solid.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars UPERFECT 18.5\" (1080p): It is absolutely perfect as a portable second monitor for office work.",
                "reviewText": "I bought this monitor because I am planning to travel overseas and will have to work from another person's home for a month without any office setup already present.I use a lot of spreadsheets and web pages with complicated dashboards and a 14-15\" laptop screen simply doesn't cut it for me. I may watch some videos, but I don't plan to use this for gaming so I cannot comment on that.Pros:-For a monitor, it is surprisingly light on its own (without all the cables and accessories).-Super easy to set up. You plug it in and it's on. I was not able to use the USB-C cable provided (it didn't work with my Lenovo i7 Slim through any of the Thunderbolt ports), but the mini-HDMI to HDMI cable worked with no problem.-It has speakers! Does this thing have incredibly rich sound? No. Would you be able to sit through a movie or an episode or two of some show? Absolutely, yes.-Nice crisp screen, no obvious hotspots, no burnt-out pixels detected.-Smart cover to protect the monitor and it works a pretty decent stand in itself.Cons (personally, none of these are dealbreakers for me):-The USB-C to USB-C cables (2 provided) are pretty short for a charging cable. Get yourself a good quality longer cable.-The provided cover will not protect the monitor during serious travel: I would not just place it in my carry-on because something will gouge the screen, or it will get twisted (it is pretty large and fairly thin). I am planning to use the box it came in as a travel case during my flights. This will make it pretty heavy, but also pretty well protected.-While it is surprisingly light for what it is, I would not want to walk long distances with it in my backpack or commute on public transport (if you only use the smart cover and someone bumps into your back on the subway, this thing is toast). I think this is all very reasonable though: you cannot expect to have a very portable monitor that's almost 19 inches and just throw it around. You have got to baby this one.-This last one is very subjective: the prongs of the charging block are foldable, and they are pretty difficult to open up with long nails (I know I will break a nail or two down the line, unless it gets easier or looser as time goes on).",
