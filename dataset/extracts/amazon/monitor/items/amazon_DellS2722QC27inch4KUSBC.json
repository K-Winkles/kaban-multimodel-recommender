                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars About as good as the much more expensive Dell U2720QM monitor (I own both)",
                "reviewText": "I have external monitors at home and work so I can just plug in my M1 Macbook Air and have plenty of screen real estate.I bought this monitor 6 weeks ago to replace an aging 24\" Dell monitor that had served me very well. But 4K monitors have been getting better and coming down in price, so it was time to upgrade.Last fall, I bought the more expensive Dell U2720QM monitor for my office at work. That one cost about $550 (and often cannot be found for less than $650). This one, the Dell S2722QC, costs about $380. I will be comparing them in this review, and - spoiler alert - this monitor, the QC, is pretty much just as good as the more expensive QM.Both the QC and QM models are 27\", 4K, have nice bright screens, and accurate vivid colors right out of the box.Both have wonderfully adjustable stands: there's the usual tilt & swivel, and you can slide the screen up to a higher position (useful if the screen is plugged into a laptop and the laptop is directly in front of the screen on your desk) or to a very low position where the bottom of the monitor is an inch from the surface of your desk. But the really cool thing is that stand (for BOTH monitors) allows you to rotate the screen 90 degrees so it's in portrait mode. That's really helpful for some of my use-cases. It's also useful to help you see the ports on the bottom edge of the display, when you're plugging in cables - otherwise they're hard to see when you're trying to plug something in.Both of these monitors can replace a USB-C hub. Meaning, you can plug in several peripherals into the monitor and connect the monitor to your computer using just a single USB-C cable. Your computer will get power from the monitor over the same USB-C cable that your computer uses to transmit data to the monitor. And your computer will see all the peripherals that are connected to the monitor as if they were connected directly to your computer.These USB-C hubs are godsends for people with laptops that only have 1 or 2 or 3 USB-C ports. For this reason, I have used USB-C hubs for my offices at home and work; they're not cheap, but they're worth it for me.But the USB-C hubs take up desk space and have some cord clutter. With the Dell monitors, I don't need the USB-C hubs any more. I donated one to my college and the other to a local church. Both Dell monitors have enough ports for me to plug in my printer, my external hi-fi speakers, my external web-cam for Zoom & FaceTime calls, and an external SSD hard drive.So why does the Dell U2720QM cost so much more than this Dell S2722QC? Well, the QM has one or two more ports (for the USB-C hub functionality) than this QC model. And, on paper, the QM seems to have a slightly better display, according to specs. But I have both, and I can't tell a difference in video quality. Probably people who do a ton of photo and video editing could, but I have good eyes and I can't tell the difference, and I don't think most people will see enough of a difference to justify spending $200 more for the QM model.Oh, here's one more difference: the cheaper QC model has built-in speakers, the more expensive QM model does not. I have to say, I really dislike the sound that comes from the speakers in the QC monitor; it is very very thin and tinny sounding, almost to the point of being shrill and annoying. My laptop speakers (which are not great) sound way better.And that's a shame, because if you're feeding video into the QC monitor from HDMI (for example if you plug a blu-ray player into the HDMI port), the audio goes in over the same cable, so the monitor really needs to have its own speakers otherwise it's difficult to find a way to hear the sound.Bottom line: for most people, this $380 QC model is every bit as good as the QM model that costs $550 or $650 or more, even though both have a gorgeous 27\" 4K display and both have very useful USB-C hub functionality. And the stand's flexibility is really useful.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Great monitor, sharp, responsive, bright. It solves all the connectivity issues by having power and video share the same USB-C cable, and that cable is included, and also with USB-A type ports built in it acts as a hub. You can plug whatever dongles you need into the monitor and they connect to the computer. I now have a free Thunderbolt/USB-4 port on the MBA that I thought for sure would be taken. The one thing it doesn't have is a camera/mic built in, and the speakers were pretty poor. The speakers work over USB-C, but other reports say they won't with HDMI. I have a small great sounding setup in any case and hadn't planned on using the built-ins.And yes, in spite of the replies by Dell to the questions, it does work with a Mac with Apple silicon. I'm going to mostly use it with Zwift, a cycling training app that uses gaming tech. I set the quality level to full 4k UHD and it worked flawlessly. I could see the muscle movement in my avatar's legs! No stuttering or anything.",

                "reviewText": "So I am reviewing the 4k USB C variant of this monitor. And off the bat it has some problems. Like many I purchased it to use with a MacBook, and although it works, it has many issues. VRR just doesn't work with a mac. VRR also doesn't work with a PS5. As a researcher I spend a lot of time in front of a monitor every day, and I will say the colour reproduction is very decent and text is extremely crisp. I also occasionally use it with my PS5, as a casual gamer I must admit games look gorgeous.The style is rather chic and elegant, although the stand does make the monitor wobble a wee bit. Make sure to assemble it very tightly.As a user of the P-series and the ultrasharp monitors from Dell I thought this would be cheaply made and very consumer-level. I am happy to reoprt that is not the case. Although everything is painted plastic, like other monitors from other brands, this is very well built. OSD isn't gret but it is easy enough to use.Big surprise for me was the speakers. They are pretty great. They do sound fairly bass-lacking but they get loud enough for video calls, and they don't sound bad at all, I really like them.",

Very easy to set up. I also really liked the minimal packing material they used. Very functional too.Just using it as a basic monitor right now (web, email, watching a few channels, videos, no gaming or watching movies). The sound out of the speakers is fine for that but I might consider getting external speakers if my use changes. No built-in camera but it sounds like it's better to get an external camera and microphone if needed.Very happy with my purchase so far.",
