                "reviewText": "I'd buy this MagicRaven display again. I bought the 16\" 2560\u00d71680 60Hz panel. It's nicely packaged. It comes with a 5' mini-HDMI cable, a 5' USB-A to C power cable, a 4' USB-C video cable, a 5V brick, and a cloth.I'm most impressed with the panel's performance on an older laptop via the HDMI cable. Windows selected 1920\u00d71200 resolution and scaled text nicely (150%). It is, however, unwieldy using the USB-A cable for power. I did not use the power brick; I plugged into the laptop for power.I am migrating to MacOS and purchased this panel to use with my Mac Mini until I can afford a better display. I like that a single cable supplies power and signal. I am less impressed using this with my Mac, but that's not the panel's fault.On the down side, I'm still figuring out the best resolution and the scaling options to use with my Mac Mini. Stictly speaking, you don't need \"Better Display\" to have all resolutions shown, but you'll want it (or something similar) so you can see the OSD and use your keyboard to adjust brightness. You'll also want \"eqMac\" to see the OSD and adjust volume with the keyboard. Both apps have free versions.For the money, this is an excellent monitor. It's bright enough, colors are good, blacks are deep, and the mono audio is acceptable.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a portable monitor that can fit in your backpack, has a decent resolution and doesn't cost a fortune, you might be tempted by the 2.5k Portable Monitor 16\". But before you hit that buy button, let me tell you about the good, the bad and the ugly of this device.The good: The monitor has a sharp and bright display, with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. It supports HDMI and USB-C inputs, and comes with a stand and a protective case. It also has built-in speakers, which are surprisingly loud and clear.The bad: The monitor is not very sturdy, and feels cheap and flimsy. The stand is wobbly and unstable, and the case is not very protective. The monitor also has a noticeable lag when connected to a laptop or a console, which can be annoying for gaming or video editing.The ugly: The monitor has a terrible battery life, lasting only about 2 hours on a full charge. It also gets very hot after prolonged use, and sometimes shuts down unexpectedly. The monitor also has some dead pixels and backlight bleeding, which are noticeable on dark backgrounds.So, is the 2.5k Portable Monitor 16\" worth it? Well, that depends on what you're looking for. If you want a cheap and portable monitor that can display high-resolution content, and you don't mind the low quality and reliability, then go ahead and buy it. But if you want a durable and reliable monitor that can handle gaming or video editing, and you don't mind spending more money, then look elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "I use it with Mac 16\" m1 max for streaming/ live presentation during travel as multiple windows at same time. OBS, Keynote, Zoom and audio interface and extra resource window.Works great so great that actually added a second one after the first purchase. So I now have 3 screens and iPad Pro as forth. Now I also use ipad to mirror screen for zoom when my wife do presentations When I do the presentation I pad is used as whiteboard so I can do live illustrations/notes as cam directly from iPad to obs.Ok product review:* Find it very light, great for travel.* Case / stand: very light and works great but it feels little flimsy and only have one position to choose from. I as another user points out it feels the case will not last that long. Time will Tell. I pulled one star for this.*Resolution is slight better than my Mac so you will not have any compromise there.* Colors can not beat the Mac but displays very well. But what I do like better is that It has more like matte finish so you will by far, not get the same glare from reflection compared to the Mac.* The monitor enclosure give feel been cheap and \"plasticky\" but at same time feels it is not gonna be any issue. Great due its light weight.*Physical size almost identical to my Mac 16 in all directions (H W L)*Powers through Mac usb c port no extra power needed. Comes with power (just regular usbc power supply) supply if you need use hdmi cable instead or connect it no powered bus like iPhone or iPad.Final Note: I original bought 2.5 K screen for 100 USD and then found this one so returned it before even open it. and got one of this for double price. I loved it some much actually when ahead bought my second few days later. Great buy for 200 use price range.One picture show 4k video one one display (not sure if i\u201dpic give any justice) and other my setup with two the two extra screens.",

This screen has amazing colors out the box, brightness is great and overall quality is good. Viewing angles are a bit rough and the stand isn't really safe. Other than that gaming on it is exceptional with very little input lag or ghosting. Would recommend !",
