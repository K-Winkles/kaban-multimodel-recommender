                "reviewText": "I ordered thirty of these monitors. The monitors are fine; they're beautiful, exactly what we expected, and we have had no problems with them yet. The problem was that it took nine days to get them all because Amazon shipped them using USPS. The delivery date kept getting put off. I had frustrating calls to Support for help, and finally got a local USPS Supervisor on the phone. He told me they couldn't deliver on time because there was no room on the truck. Finally, over a two day period they were finally delivered. We have these issues often with USPS, and never with FedEx or UPS. Clearly USPS does not have the capacity to manage the additional load that Amazon has entrusted to them.",

                "reviewText": "So just received this product and got it all set up. Took a bit of playing around to get it set up to my needs and liking, but the picture quality is now excellent. I don't do any gaming so can't comment on that aspect of this monitor, but for viewing documents, surfing etc. it is very nice. Large bright clear screen which is much better than my old monitor. However, where this monitor really falls down is the sound quality. My 10 year old monitor with built in speakers is magnitudes better in sound quality. This monitor is virtually unusable for anything where sound is required. It sounds like a cheap transistor radio from the 1960s. While I didn't expect audiophile quality sound, I did expect it to be better than it is. If it had even the sound quality of my 10 year old monitor I would have given this monitor a 4, maybe 5 star rating. But as it is, the best I can give it is a 3. I have now had to order speakers as this thing will be virtually unusable without them. As far as I am concerned, if a company can't include a minimally usable feature on their product, don't even bother trying to include that feature. If I had known the speakers were this bad, I would have either looked elsewhere or just ordered separate speakers at the same time as ordering this monitor. If you are OK with vintage transistor radio sound then this would be a good buy. Otherwise, you might want to get a different monitor, or at a minimum get yourself some speakers. If you already have speakers or don't require sound, from only a viewing/visuals perspective this monitor is certainly well worth considering.",
