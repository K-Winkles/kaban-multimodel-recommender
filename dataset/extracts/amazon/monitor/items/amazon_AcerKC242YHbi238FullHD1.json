                "reviewText": "I was attracted to this product due to its promise of incredibly low input delay. Sure enough, I feel it! However, this does come at a price, that being lifespan concern. At least it is a relatively affordable price for a gaming monitor.I am using this with a Windows 10 gaming setup, and I can see that I'm supported for a refresh rate between 50hz and 100hz. At all times, I use a good amount of contrast, cooler colors, and a high value of black correction, which makes the monitor quite a ways brighter than I'd like, but ensures everything is far less blurry when things are in motion. (Such as scrolling screens, Windows desktop animations, and gaming.)During mundane browsing and office work, the screen is comfortable to use at all refresh rate levels. During gaming, however, you will run into an issue of unbearable motion blur. For example, I play Warframe, which is incredibly fast-paced and full of constant motion. The amount of unwanted blurring that this monitor can produce on its own is almost vomit-inducing, and I have been gaming all of my life. Yet, actually, this screen can absolutely handle the game, but it requires everything to be at the highest setting levels:Set your computer's refresh rate to 100hz, then fiddle with the monitor's built-in settings to switch on its \"Over Drive.\" Use the buttons/knob on the back of its right side. Now, these two things combined will completely eliminate the monitor's issue of motion blur, as well as deepen the black colors to a perfect degree. (Also, the monitor allows for customizable \"setting presets,\" which the monitor itself remembers. So it takes me all of five seconds to switch between screen intensities or refresh rates, meaning that pre-gaming and post-gaming has a low setup time, but still noticeably there.)Anyhow, the wording of that Over Drive feature is what bothers me. I'm overclocking my gaming monitor just to use it without bothersome motion blur? Does this mean that I'm putting my gaming monitor at risk of having a lower lifespan? That's quite worrying. But, I did only spend around $100 USD on this product, so the affordability does remain acceptable. Hence why I've docked stars towards screen quality, but the product is still overall a 4-star monitor. Powerful for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor is cheap. The display is definitely not great and I would not use this monitor for gaming. It works perfect as a second monitor for myself where I watch videos or have discord pulled up while my game is on another monitor. The screen has a light filter on it, not sure what you would call it, but essentially if you are not looking directly at the screen, it is darkened/discolored. So not the best for watching movies either. This is just a cheap monitor option. It is VGA mountable and I had no issues mounting it, also works vertical when mounted. The stand it comes with I have not used, but it looks big and bulky to me and would take up more space than I would want. Over all, for the price it is good but if you are looking for a strong gaming monitor for $50 more you can get much higher quality ones.",
