                "reviewText": "First off, this monitor is heavy. The stand which comes with it is very substantial and will support the monitor well. If, like me, you use an arm swivel to hold your monitor so it can be moved around, you will need a heavy-duty arm and mount. Fortunately, mine could handle the weight.Secondly, the picture is impressive. Just hooking it to my PC and turning it on made it obvious that the OLED is 100% better than my older monitors. I used a three-monitor set before and the panoramic view of this 49\" monster made them instantly obsolete. I can do the same work in multiple windows with only one monitor.It does take some getting used to but the overall picture quality and 240hz refresh rate means a seamless work surface and an unbeatable gaming workhorse.So my pros:It was easily set up and provides a great visual experience.Working in multiple windows and programs functions well and the seamless movement between them is a great asset.Gaming is awesome on this monitor with no rips or lags in any of the games I put it through. (BG3, various flight sims, Cyberpunk, Skyrim, et. al.My cons:Updates are not intuitive. There is a bit of work involved in getting the hardware updated. I had to download to a thumb drive and the find the specific port to plug into.The LED lighting on the back is meh. A series in a strip around the monitor would be more eye-catching.All this being said, I find myself really enjoying this monitor. It is beautiful in the picture and quality, seems robustly well built and allows for easy multitasking through putting up to six windows across the face.I have not tried the additional device option (splitting the screen in two) or used the built in sound as I have better base sound on the PC itself.Overall, I would recommend this monitor for anyone who needs a wide screen for multitasking or gaming purposes. It also provides an excellent streaming picture for movies/television. It is a higher price point, but is well worth the price in my opinion.5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I want to start by saying this monitor is amazing, hands down worth the money. It can almost replace your TV!(we will get to why it can not though in the cons section) Just make sure you have the desk space for it as it sits about 45 inches long and a good 9 inches away from the wall.Pros-Large, Very large, honestly it is game changing, I upgraded from a 35inch ultrawide and didnt think it would be a huge difference... I was wrong, and now I cant go back.-2 27 inch monitors with out the bar makes it great for multitasking, and better because you can have 3 full size windows screen up since there is no bar.-5120x1440p is honestly a must at this size, any smaller resolution and it wouldnt look so great. Another good thing about this resolution is that it looks amazing but its still not as many pixels to push as 4k making gaming on epic at max resolution possible-120hz You can probably OC it to a little bit more if you drop the color to 8bit or lower, and maybe even to 1080p(probably get 144hz) but honestly 120hz is a sweet spot for most gamers.-HDR10 yes 1000 nits of HDR beauty, only problem, is there aren't a lot of games that support it and not a lot of shows that do either. Still at the time of this review is the only 49inch with HDR10-Customize-able menus, you can change colors, black light,refresh rate,etc all at a push of a button.-Crosshair , yes a crosshair built into the monitor makes it so much easier to aim for games without it, and even helps for games with bad crosshairs.-Stand allows an above average range of motion(no swivel, but pivet and vertical movement)-Gsync/Fresync compatible (I tested it, it does work with this monitor)Picture in picture, allows you to see both HDMI/DVI ports at one time by splitting the screen or putting one in an overlay.-Qled while not as good as OLED, QLED does improve the blacks, RGB and still gives your a pretty snappy response rate.Cons-No Speakers (not that it matters too much at this price point, as if you can afford $1000 worth of monitor you can afford some solid speakers/headphones)-HDR on windows 10 kind of sucks at the moment, leaves a hazy look when you aren't on HDR content. And if you are in a game on fullscreen and try to adjust the volume, windows will tab out the game to show you the volume then tab back in causing you to miss a good 10 seconds.-If you use to a dual monitor setup for work, and you screen share a lot, this may not be the monitor for you. As there isn't a way to share just one side of the screen, you'll have to share the full screen-It is really large, had to buy a bigger desk to actually fit it comfortablely.(not really a con but still)-No movies or tv shows will take up the whole screen due to the aspect ratio of 32:9 Which is why it can't really replace a tv as you'll be watching most content on a 27inch portion of the screen and a few on 21:9. Now on chrome you can install an extension called ultradewide which will stretch out the content on most streaming sites but thats as good as you'll get.-A lot of games (like overwatch) wont support 32:9 aspect ratio, however most games that support 21:9 do support 32:9 and you'll just have to change Field of View. Rare exception is Overwatch which supports only up to 21:9-The stand breaks relatively easily, well at least the little connectors at the bottom.. not a big problem but still., as the monitor is pretty heavy. could be due to improper installation.-The box it comes in is revealing, I would make sure it gets delivered at a time that you're home as you can't hide it, it's too large, makes it an easy target for thieves since they know exactly what's in the box.-No way(as far as I know) to split the screen and have 2 full screens applications open, now this can be a limitation of windows or software, but I wish there was a way to do that because this monitor is the perfect size for it.UPDATED REVIEWIt\u2019s been a few months now and the monitor is still holding up pretty well.Pros-windows has fixed the hdr issues where if you adjust volume while in full screen it would flash a black screen,-I believe if you plug in 2 HDMI/DVI into the monitor from the same computer you can treat it as dual screenCons-gets hot, you\u2019ll notice if if you\u2019re in a small room especially with your computer on.-This version is not worth it seeming the price is almost the same as the Odyssey but the odyssey specs are better.-if you a big into movies and videos this monitor is not for you, honestly I would say go get a 21:9 ultra wide or one of LGs new TVs with 4K 120hz, you can get a 48in for about the same price(it is tower however there are more months available)- it does support vesa and does include a vesa mounting bracket however there are few vesa mounts that are able to support this behemoth. I\u2019m using one that is underrated for this monitor size so far so good...- Qled is good when the whole screen is taking up by content, on 32:9 aspect ratio but anything below that will have the black bars on the side(literally all streaming content and quite a few AAA games) since Qled is still LED it has a back light that noticeable fades away from the center. So you have the big bright grey area when it should be all black. The price of 32:9Overall still good however save your money for the odyssey/ a gaming tv unless you can find a used one. Samsung doesn\u2019t offer much support or parts replacement for these anymore so good luck if anything ever happens to it or gets lost.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Si buscas un monitor que alcance un color negro real, esta es la opci\u00f3n. Inicialmente habia adquirido una pantalla curva de otra marca (G....)., pero tenia muchisimo cloudy y decidi devolverla, hasta el momento no me arrepiento de esa decisi\u00f3n, fue un gran cambio. La pantalla Samsung no es perfecta pero tiene lo necesario para trabajos de oficina, si, ya que puedes trabajar con 3 documentos al mismo tiempo y se ven bien, con 2 documentos esta perfecta, algo que no pasa con mi monitor 16:9 de 27\". Para entretenimiento esta perfecta, sobre todo en juegos de carreras de mundo abierto, en especial le hace mucha justicia a los juegos que requieren un movimiento rapido de FPS esta increible.Algunas caracteristicas destacables:PROSTiempo de respuesta, escenas realmente oscuras, el tama\u00f1o es genial para trabajar, es curva y aun asi tiene un angulo de visi\u00f3n perfecto, cero cloudy (manchas blancas en escenas oscuras), sin fugas de luz, comandos de voz, funciona como TV, perfecta para juegos por su rapidez de respuesta en ms y hz.CONSMarco algo grueso (aprox 1 cm), precio, no tiene tanto brillo como una VA o IPS, reflejos (muy poco, no son molestos pero existen), interfaz (no es la mas rapida), entradas mini (ya no podr\u00e9 usar mi viejo cable HDMI \ud83d\ude14).En resumen, vale mucho la pena; y si eres exigente con las escenas oscuras, este es tu monitor. La parte trasera hace ver a este monitor \u00fanico. Para trabajos y tareas es perfecto por el tama\u00f1o. Para juegos es de lo mejor que hay. LLevo un poco mas de un mes con el monitor y no me arrepiento.PD si tienes una TV samsung esta funcionar\u00e1 con el mismo control del monitor, en mi caso como los tengo juntos se encienden al mismo tiempo y eso es un poco molesto.",

                "reviewText": "The CRG90 is a good monitor -- it's not perfect, but it is a great for gaming, and decent for everything else.The 32:9 aspect ratio takes some getting used to, and you really need to check if games support it, but for those games that do ... simply WOW! It is an immersive experience to play game on a super ultra-wide. It takes some getting used to, but once you try this, you'll realize how awesome it is to see so much real-estate. Racing games, MMO, shooter and FPS are great on this.What's good:- the color is accurate- it's 120Hz refresh rate is great for most games (FPS, MMO)- It's bright and the resolution is 5120 x 1440 is excellent for gaming- Screen curvature is better than the newer Odyssey. Viewing angle is not terrible on thisWhat's bad:- HDR is terrible. Despite what the spec sheet says, HDR on this monitor is near garbage. I tried all sorts of settings and gave it many opportunities, but I ended turning it on and then off multiple times. SD on it is fantastic though so I feel I'm not missing much. I'm not sure if it's windows setting, Nvidia or the monitor... but HDR on this is simply not good- You'll need a wide desk to support this monitor- Video on this monitor is average. I came from a 32\" Dell so in essence i'm downgrading when watching video on this since it's essentially 27\" ...however, I can have two videos playing simultaneouslyYou'll also need a fairly powerful graphic card to run game on high settings for this monitor. You're essentially pushing nearly 5K of pixels. This is one of the reason I went for this older monitor instead of the new Odyssey since my graphic card can't run games at 240Hz.",
