                "reviewText": "Pretty solid monitor, no real issues that are its fault other than hollow sounding speakers which I expected. I don't think I've had any external monitor with speakers anywhere near good, ever so not really counting that against it. Stand is pretty solid, and unless you're being somewhat forceful with your taps up at the top of the screen it's stable.Mainly posting this review in case someone else hopes to use this a real touch screen in OS X. Unfortunately Apple removed true touch screen support to force people further into their ecosystem to push iPads and Sidecar. This monitor acts like a touchpad in OS X, meaning if the cursor is on your other monitor and you touch the touch screen it will register as a click at the mouse's position on the other monitor. It will not interact with anything on the touch screen until the mouse cursor has been moved to it...which you can do from the touch screen, but you'll highlight/select everything it can on the way over since it counts as a click+hold. Not the fault of the monitor at all, just typical Apple shenanigans.Fortunately, this isn't my main use case for this monitor. I'm waiting on a Samsung s24 Ultra to show up so I can use this monitor with their Dex platform. I'd like to try to use the phone and this screen while working remotely out of my van to do web development and not worry about $3k laptop getting stolen when I'm not around. I'll update this review once I have more experience with it.",

It comes with a cover which is really nice!I wanted something super light so when I travel and if I need to remote work I have 2 screens like I do at home - so this works really great. It also connects to my phone and duplicates and extends my phone screen.",

                "reviewText": "My HP windows laptop only works with the top usb c port which is marked as power. A Lenovo laptop and Macbook air both work with both ports and a single cable. Im pretty sure the ports are labeled wrong. For pass thru power to the laptop, the power cord needs to be plugged into the bottom port and laptop into the top. Even though the top port is labeled with a power plug. But it works, just reverse the labels. It works with an iphone 15 as long as a power cord is also connected to montior. The power cord wasn't necessary to use phone with my previous monitor but as long as it can still be done for watching movies while traveling.I like the screen. I like the kickstand. I like the buttons for the menus much better than those scroll wheels used for the menu navigation that most of the competing monitors have.I'm pretty sure the sleeve it came with was meant for a 15.6 \"16:9 screen and not a 16\" 16:10. Its a really tight fit and I will probably not use it",
