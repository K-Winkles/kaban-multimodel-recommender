                "reviewText": "2019-2020 Update Pixio sent me another monitor. I have been blown away with their customer service. I love this thing. I believe the first monitor was not even faulty. I believe it was my own error, but they still sent me another monitor. I highly recommend this monitor if your a hard core gamer. Very satisfied. Older Update-Monitor stopped working for me. Went through every trouble shooting issue I could. Multiple display port/hdmi cables and it is still defective. I have tried everything. I know it is the panel because I have connected it to another computer that has a working monitor and the Pixio stays on a black screen. The blue indicator light says that it is on, but Does not display an image. I have submitted an RMA form to Pixio and will soon update this review again once I have went through the RMA process.I\u2019m a very hardcore gamer. I have used every panel type -TN/IPS/VAI saw this monitor and said \u201csomething has to be fishy!\u201d1st and foremost, if you use an NVIDIA card you will be happy. I know I know, it\u2019s a FreeSync monitor, Nvidia allows non certified monitors to use Gsync. While this may not be \u201cofficially\u201d supported it works perfect. Enable FreeSync and then go into Nvidia control panel and enable GSYNC. Smooth as butter with no flickering at all. I also own and use a 27\u201d dell 1440p/144hz Gsync display. Literally could not tell the difference. It is as if the monitor came with Gsync. The monitor is huge and I love that it is not curved. It has no dead pixels and input lag is extremely low. I honestly don\u2019t understand how they can sell this at 299.99It is 32\u201d and you can use my included pictures as reference. It dwarfs my 27\u201d.Pros - Gsync works perfectly- beautiful VA panel- no dead pixels - comes with a vesa mount- low response time. Seriously stop reading this and buy this monitor! OmgCons- literally nothing. If you are still reading this you should stop and click add to cart. You will not be disappointed!This is a steal at 299.99. They should sell this for 499.99 because it would still be a bargain!Did I mention this thing is super thin. Did I mention the colors of the VA panel are amazing!Seriously, Pixio has set the bar so high.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this on sale for $199.99. For that price it's a bargain with strong performance. Not as smooth as my Asus monitor but way cheaper and was able to pull the full 280hz and it still maintain a quality image. The Asus monitor is just a little smoother with images. I tested it against my Asus both on Overwatch at 280 fps. Asus monitor is closer to the $400 area, but can get it when it goes on sale for a little over $300. So is minimal smoothness and I believe 3 inches in screen size worth the money to some maybe. Overall great budget monitor for someone new to the pc gaming world. Me personally I will stick with Asus and give this one to my wife as she doesn't game as serious as I do. Hope this review was helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this monitor for a couple of days now and I must say it works fantastically. The picture is beautiful, gameplay is seamless, and overall I am very impressed with this monitor.I am glad that I read the reviews about the included DisplayPort cable as the one that is provided is not very high-quality. I went ahead and spent $6 on a decent cable on Amazon and I haven't had any problems whatsoever, not a single stuck pixel, not a single dead pixel, guess I got lucky.The included stand requires some assembly but, unlike other people who have reviewed this products, I feel that the stand is more than adequate is actually quite sturdy. The monitor has a very nice build quality and overall I am very impressed, at first I was a little timid about buying a monitor from a company that I knew nothing about. After a little research I discovered that this particular screen is actually made by Samsung and then pixio puts these monitors together, I am rather fond of Samsung screens and this one clearly is no slouch it is an a+ product.I will not dock stars from this product because of the experience I had in shipping, however it was terrible. now I do realize that this is peak holiday shopping season and I do realize that there are probably a billion packages to deliver all over the United States but it does not excuse the customer service that I received from UPS when dealing with this package. In all I ordered this on Monday and it took over a week before I got the monitor. The customer service was so terrible that I will personally never use UPS as a carrier ever again, I was hung up on by a customer service supervisor and then I was patronized by another one, it wasn't until I got Amazon customer service involved that anything actually got done as far as UPS was concerned.Amazon for the love of all your goodly good things, allow the shopper to pick the carrier!",

The 2456 x 1440 resolution together with clock speed up to 165 Hz is fantastic, I can use it in all my sim games.

                "reviewText": "I paid 189$CAD so I'm reviewing for that price. I never heard of Pixio before. I just learned that the CEO is a gamer so I would trust this company. 24.5\"(25) is not the usual size but it's the perfect size for 1080p content, I think bigger than that and you have diminishing returns. I don't know if the stand is good, I'm using a VESA arm. The colors are kind of good for a cheap display like that. I almost left the settings by default and my video games were beautiful. HDR350 is kind of useless, but with Windows 11 Auto HDR you can have surprising results. No man's sky with Auto HDR is just incredible. Resident Evil 2 remake with HDR is really cool. It's not true HDR1000 but it's sometimes usable. I will definitely try Windows 11 Auto HDR with every modern games just to see if it's better than SDR. So I'd say it'S useless to usable sometimes, don't buy it for that HDR tag.I could plug my wired earbuds in the monitor and the sound is good 24bit/96 (actually better than my computer Realtek drivers). The 144hz is impressive (first time experimenting it), I already can't go back to 60hz/60fps after 1 day so be prepared. I would trust this company any day.A little con but I'm not sure if I can fix it with settings or this monitor just show you bad quality content: Youtube videos and Twitch stream I watch are sometimes low quality and this monitor shows me every bad codec pixels from these kind of video content. Watching big 4k HDR video is impressive so I guess this monitor don't like lower quality content! Might be a setting somewhere, or a flaw at some point because not a lot of things I watch is super quality on the Internet. But. For that price, can't, get, better, than, this. Final point.",
