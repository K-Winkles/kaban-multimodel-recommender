I'm happy to report that the Gawfolk monitor exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts.The colors a vibrant, it is light-weight, and the stand is sturdy. I wish it swiveled, but the curvature helps with that.Overall, the Gawfolk 24\u201d Curved Monitor is a stellar choice for those seeking an immersive visual experience in a sleek and modern package.",

I read a lot of documents and create business graphics for work and need a high clean resolution. This monitor out performed a similar priced Samsung, and KTC. It has four responsive controls and turns on and off instantly, with no annoying standby light. (The other monitors had funky swivel control buttons.) It has two HDMI and two DP connectors. The 1440 resolution is by far the best I've found for the price and has a flatter curve compared to the others, which works much better with design work. The only negative I found, was the instruction book did not list the technical specs.",

My vision isn\u2019t great enough to enjoy 4k without glasses so I prefer the scale of 1080P.The only concern here is the sticker placed directly on the panel. That\u2019s gross and some people may not survive that task as well as I did. Please don\u2019t do that, put a very adhesive sticker directly on the panel.Damp rag and patience and very very light pressure should be all it takes.Enjoy this great monitor!",

I do some light gaming (city-building and strategy) using Steam and it's great for that purpose. I had to tweak it a little to get the icon size down to what I like but I really appreciate being able to have multiple screens open side-by-side on the same monitor without reducing the font size down so far that I can't see it.My vision isn't good enough to distinguish color definition much beyond 1080p so this monitor is perfect.I would definitely buy this monitor again.",
