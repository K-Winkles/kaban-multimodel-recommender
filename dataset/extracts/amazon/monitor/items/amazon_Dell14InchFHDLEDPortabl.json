Its plug and play basically. Small caveat, it is incompatible with the Dell Dock station sold here on Amazon. As you add cabled devices for comfort (keyboard, mouse, etc) things can get messy real quick. It works great, I would recommend always putting it to the right side of the laptop screen since that seems to be a default preset for Dell.",

                "reviewText": "This monitor works perfectly in a mac thunderbolt port using the supplied USB-C cable. The screen is powered by the USB port, so no external power supply is needed. This is a great second monitor on a desk with limited space. The monitor build is comparable to a laptop monitor and comes with a cloth carrying bag. I am a little uncomfortable traveling with the monitor without something solid to cover the screen (like the keyboard does in a normal laptop when folded). If I travel with it, then I will place it in a bubble wrap pouch to protect the screen and wouldn't hesitate to travel with a little more protection. The brightness is less than my primary OLED screen, but perfectly adequate for my needs.",

I wasn\u2019t inclined to try to pry the dead screen out of its casing on my laptop and replace it - that\u2019s well beyond my wheelhouse, and to pay a professional to do that was not something I could squeeze out of my wallet.This monitor absolutely fit the bill. It\u2019s as good as the original screen on my laptop: as bright, clear, crisp. It\u2019s a bit smaller but within a few minutes I\u2019d adjusted to that minute size difference.I ordered mine through Dell.For me it was, quite literally, plug and play - worked instantly out of the box.My initial thoughts: highly recommend. It\u2019s spectacularly lightweight and sleek. Ticks all the boxes for my specific needs.",
