                "reviewText": "It is been a while since I have used a standard 16 x 9 monitor. I am coming from an Alienware 38 inch ultra wide. Initial thoughts on this monitor are that build construction is actually better than the alienware there\u2019s no cheap plastic. it has a very sturdy case, and I am very confident in hanging this on the wall. I have always used TV wall mounts, although this is on the heavier side, the Walmart I have is rated up to 100 pounds.Initial use shows that there are many formats included on the monitor including a 21 x 9 so if I ever wanted to go back to ultra wide for specific game I can by changing the screen accepted format through the ktc osd menu.For what I am using this monitor for I cannot tell the difference with the matte coating. Using it in a dark room with no true light. There are LEDs around the room, but no pure whites, so the room is fairly dark.I will update my review in a few days after I have time to use the monitor for more extensive purposes. I did briefly test, Starfield, callisto protocol and cyberpunk.The reason I wanted to test these was because of the horrendous blooming in HDR on my IPS monitor for the initial blooming test. There is a reason oled is better.Since I have multiple screens, this will primarily be for gaming, and I am not too concerned with burn in or derogation.The only thing that I have looked into his firmware updates and the G48P5S is not listed on their website. I have not reached out to KTC to find out if there is a firmware update or if the firmware update is the same as the G42P5.The G48P5S does have transfer rates on the HDMI according to the spec sheet so therefore I am unwilling to test the smaller monitors firmware on this unitI will update this review once I spend more time with the monitor1/14/24 reached out to ktc as the 48 inch monitor does not show up on their support page, and wanted to know about any firmware updates as the g42p5 has firmware updates. Where as the g48p5s is the 2023 model with hdmi 2.1 at 48 GbpsUpdate 1/22/24Love gaming on this monitor, one downside is if the monitor goes to sleep it is not waking properly. I have to use the remote to turn off and then back on. The large red blinking led on the bottom is slightly annoying when the monitor is off",

                "reviewText": "The actual display itself looks amazing. However, as a monitor this is unusable. If all you do is gaming, it might be good enough, but why pay for a premium monitor that has serious issues.1) There is an over scan problem, even using DisplayPort. If you use DSC, the left and the bottom of the screen are clipped. If you turn DSC off, the top and right edges are clipped. This strikes me as the designers made a TV, not a monitor. You WILL have display scaling. If I can't see every pixel as it's supposed to be, it's not really a monitor, it's a TV.2) They are so paranoid about burn in, that unless a significant portion of the screen changes, it starts to dim. Even writing this review, I had to stop several times and change windows to get the screen to come back from being so dim it was hard to see. Simply changing what's displayed gets the brightness back. Again, if you're just gaming, that might be okay. But even simple desktop tasks like reading/writing email or heaven forbid trying to write code causes the screen to dim to unusable levels.3) It doesn't come with a stand or mount of any kind. Look carefully at the specs and it doesn't say it comes with one. The main picture has the stand with a dotted line. Their own stand is $120 after coupon, but any VESA 100x100 or 300x300 will work. Every TV or monitor I've seen comes with at least a simple, cheap stand. Not a show stopper, but very frustrating since I don't believe they made it clear enough.4) It's heavy. The LG 48\" OLED is 33 lbs. This one is 56! It's the same physical display, it's just the electronic and case that's different. Again, not a huge deal, but still worth noting.I could certainly live with issues 3) and 4). Items 1) and 2) are both huge issues for me that make this monitor unusable.",

I only have one complaint, being that it uses a super cheap cable that is also annoyingly short. Other than the terrible stock cable, this screen cannot be beat. I would like to point out a few things such as the all metal (I believe it to be aluminum) stand and base, the thin bezels, refresh rate, and low latency. I am by no means a professional gamer, but I cannot personally discern any input lag. From what I have read in reviews everyone seems to be loving this monitor and that was why I bought mine. I am very happy with my purchase.",
