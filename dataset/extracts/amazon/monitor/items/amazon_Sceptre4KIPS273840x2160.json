                "reviewText": "Since HDR isn't really all that great without like 1000nits anyways, and I'm using this for my mac studio as a work screen, I don't care about gaming or refresh rate (though 70hz is nice). I expected less than what this monitor gives. The stand is very sturdy and has a smaller footprint than the LG Ultrafine 27UN850-W it replaces. Picture is brighter and clearer after some basic adjustments. Color is perfectly -fine- if you're not a designer, especially at this price point. I will never test the speakers. I'm using a thunderbolt to display port adapter and everything works great. I love that there's not a bunch of gimmicky random features no one ever uses that usually aren't very well implemented in the first place like my other monitors, so it feels like I'm simply paying for a solid, reliably 32\" 4k monitor and that's what I got. Had it for a few days now and as for it's sturdiness, I accidentally let this slip out of the box as I was opening it and it fell onto my polished concrete floor about a foot and a half and had zero cracks or anything. I was worried but no dead pixels or anything at all.",

                "reviewText": "I don't game, so this review is solely for productivity purposes.I bought two of these for work and they are fantastic. Picture is super clear, no scratches, dead pixels, etc. when I purchased. I wanted 4K to have a really clear image for reading documents and working in excel. I know this is probably overkill for work, but I used monitors with less resolution before these (at home was 1920 x 1080p and at work was 2560 x 1440p) and I think the difference is worth it in my opinion. I'm nitpicky about these things though and I usually don't like to settle for less if I can afford something better that isn't an outrageous price. These are priced very low but the product doesn't compare to the cost. You could buy from Samsung or LG at twice or triple the price and the differences would be nil.If you don't mind having an off-brand monitor that still works just as well as the name brand and for half the price, you should go with this monitor.",

                "reviewText": "Looks great! I'm really satisfied to get a second 4k monitor for reading things in 4k at such a decent price (about 200).Pros:-Contrast ratio between white/blacks seems great, especially for LCD screen tech-Viewing angles seem good, legit IPS display-Screen resolution is as advertised, easy set up-Pretty stable base with a decent tilt functionCons:-Speakers suck, but hopefully you're not buying it for that-I don't think this contains the DRM that you need to play Netflix in 4k, but I used my TV for that-Screen refresh rate is only 60-70 Hz, so that's pretty noticeable if you're used to one of those 120-144 Hz refresh screens (but you're not getting that at 4k at any price nearby this!)-Base does not do adjustable height (I guess buy a monitor arm or stand if that's important to you)Overall, no regrets on this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The monitor is bright, clear, and has great resolution. The speakers and tinny and cheap sounding. I added external speakers, but it would have been nice to have to had better built in speakers so that I did not have to have external speakers taking up space on my desk.I didn't use my computer for a day. When I came back to use it the display would not turn on. I could not get the display's built in menu to come on. I tried disconnecting, connecting cables, using different display ports on the computer and on the display, and cycling power on both the display and the PC. It didn't start working again until I unplugged power to the display and then plugged back in. I noticed someone else in the comments reporting a similar experience that requires physically removing the power cable and then plugging back to get the display to come back on.I disabled the sleep function on the monitor and turned on the screensaver instead. This seems to have masked the problem. Hoping the monitor will last. I've only had it for a couple weeks, but like it so far.",

This monitor is an utter piece of crap.Included speakers are so crappy, you could make your own set yourselves and put in there. This should not be a selling factor whatsoever.Monitor also came with a dead pixel, and the backlighting is uneven, very poorly made.I've had this for just a little over a year and the DisplayPort keeps stop working intermittently, and now stopped working completely.So if you want a monitor with a dead pixel, poor backlighting because it was misaligned during install, crappy speakers that you can't turn off and keep showing up as a sound source and sending all your audio to these speakers when you have better audio, and want your monitor to work intermittently causing you hours of frustration troubleshooting, oh and make room for a power brick, thing doesn't even use a standard power port.So again, recommend this to your enemies!!!! Otherwise, STAY CLEAR. Don't cheap out on monitors and just get a regular brand.",

Tiene adem\u00e1s una salida de audio para poder conectar aud\u00edfonos o bocinas a manera de extensi\u00f3n.La base y el brazo que lo sostienen son met\u00e1licos y muy robustos. Sin embargo, no tienen movilidad. En mi caso lo tengo fijo con un brazo mec\u00e1nico por lo que no me afecta.La velocidad de refresh es de 70Hz la cual s\u00f3lo es posible con DP y en resoluci\u00f3n UHD.
