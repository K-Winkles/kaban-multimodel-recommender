                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My job requires me to travel a lot, and I really like to have an additional monitor with my laptop because it helps me multitask and increase productivity. I ordered this 14\" 1080P FHD IPS laptop monitor extender made by Kasorey. In the box, it comes with three different types of cables: USB-C to USB-C, HDMI, and USB-A to USB-C, so you can use different types of cables to connect the monitor to different types of laptops. Last in the box is the monitor with the mount, a nice case with two handles. The monitor is very compact to fit in the case, so you can take it with you on the go. Both sides of the monitor mount are spring-loaded, and it will just clamp it onto the existing laptop screen. On the back of the monitor mount, there is a nice little kickstand to help support the extra weight the monitor added. On the back of the monitor, there are 2 UCB-C ports and 1 HDMI port. I connected the monitor using two cables, HDMI and USB A to USB C. It is plug & play and it is ready to go. Next, you can set up how you want the dual monitor to function as a mirror or extended screen within the Windows OS on your laptop. This monitor has a 1080p resolution, 300 nits of brightness, and a 60 Hz refresh rate. The picture is crisp and clear, and it is very bright. Overall, it is a very nice monitor and very easy to install. If you are in the market to get a dual-screen laptop, this one is worth checking out.",

I\u2019ve bought two others from recently which were of bigger size and unfortunately the weight made me decide to return them. This one is perfect for on the go. Setup is quite easy as well; just plug in both ends of a cable to your MacBook and then to the screen.
