The features I like most are the size of the monitor, ease of setup, and ability to connect with my laptop via hdmi. The unit does not come with an HDMI cable, you\u2019ll need to buy this separately. The monitor tilts about 15 degrees. The color on the screen is fair. It is not as rich as the color on my Mac air screen. It would be nice If the monitor was height adjustable. The manufacturer description of the monitor is accurate. Overall, very satisfied with the product for the price paid.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Lousy resolution, garish inaccurate color",
                "reviewText": "This replaced a 15-year old LCD monitor that was sharp as a tack with excellent color accuracy. As other reviewers have noted, comes with no instructions of any kind in the box, and what you can find on-line is vague and barely approaches basic. There is limited adjustment of the picture that is done on the monitor itself, with these four small black buttons that are completely invisible in the black frame unless I shine a flashlight on them? Really? You couldn't make them silver, or protrude from the bottom so they're visible? The resolution, even on the highest setting 1280x1024 has text so ragged and pixelated it causes eye fatigue, and full-screen images like photos or art are blurry. Color is neon screaming to the point of being garish, with no easy way to mute it to a more natural setting-- gold for instance appears olive colored, and lemon yellow is more ochre. Black type has two edges- one red and one black, which contributes to the fuzzy and washed out appearance of type and makes it super fatiguing to read. And this is with the \"natural\" setting-- the others geared to gaming make it more garish and unviewable. There is no sharpness or smoothing ability, to try and get rid of the ragged edges and blurry images-- downscaling the resolution only makes it predictably worse. This is either defective out of the box, or this is just the way it is and it's a real piece of crap. Needed this aspect ratio to fit in a confining cabinet, so will have to go with the standard wide ratio and use a much smaller screen to fit in this space. This product is the worst monitor I have even seen. My first computer bought 30 years ago had a better image than this.",

I really did not want to have to purchase anything bigger. So this works out just fine for me. The color and brightness works well and it is very easy on the eyes. I think that the price could have been less though. No need to charge so much for a monitor.",
