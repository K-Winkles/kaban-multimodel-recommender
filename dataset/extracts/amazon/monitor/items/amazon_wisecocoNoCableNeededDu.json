                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was looking for a monitor for a new Pi v4. I wanted something bigger than the official 7 inch monitor and came across this one. I was as advertised, includes touch screen and came together much easier than the official monitor and case.The kit included hardware to mount a v3 or v4 RPi without running loose cables or manipulating ribbon cables.It was a bit tricky bringing up a new Pi and the monitor at one time. Make sure your power supply can support both the monitor and computer board. During bring up I ended up using separate supplies until it was running smoothly. Over taxed supplies will leave the monitor in a color cycling mode with out attachment to the HDMI signal. Once it was up, I switched to one supply for the whole setup.Good picture quality. It is a bit fragile as it is basically a bare lcd monitor.I would buy another in the future.",

The touch screen was accurate and the color and brightness were perfect for what I was using it for.I was planning to use it as a LCARS display for my smart home assistant, but as I was finishing up the code and ready to test, I turned the monitor and Pi on and there was no display signal, only the screen going through its color change as if nothing was connected... I then plugged it into my computer and still no signal!I'll be returning it, it's within the 30 day return policy but not sure I want to just replace it or get a similar monitor from a different brand...",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use with a Raspberry Pi 4. The idea of the monitor is very good. It is a clean installation when you finally get it installed. The instructions are minimal and missing important steps. For example, they do not mention that you need to install stand-offs or the Pi will contact the monitor because the mounting posts are to short. I was also unable to get the device to work unless I installed two power supplies on it, one for the display and one for the Pi. This was in spite of the fact that I was using Official Raspberry Pi supplies per the instructions. Without the two supplies, the monitor would enter a color cycling phase.I was not able to get the touchscreen to work at all. I don't know if it requires a driver. I have not been able to find anywhere to get support. I was looking to use this as a control device for a smart home. It is unfortunate because the looks like it would be a nice solution if it worked.I am probably going to be returning this device and looking for a different solution.",
