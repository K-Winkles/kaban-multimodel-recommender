A one-star potential disaster redress by excellent customer service. Plug and play! Out of the box, it seamlessly connects to my Windows laptop, no complicated configurations needed. The lightweight design adds minimal weight as I slip it into my laptop backpack. Its clever design stows the retractable USB-C cable in a small compartment at the rear.While the monitor doesn't deliver a refresh rate high enough for an edge in gaming, it's quite perfect for spreadsheets, charts, videos or browsing. Clarity and color reproduction at 1920 x 1080 are crisp for its size.Con.Couldn't get it to connect to any of my devises in the Apple ecosystem. Need to delve into troubleshooting. I'm certain there is a quick fix, but I feel this should have been included as a note inside the box.Overall, good portable monitor, excellent customer service, may need some tweaking for Apple users.",

                "reviewText": "I travel a lot for work and I find myself wishing I had more available screen while I work on my laptop. I try to plug into hotel room tvs, but that's not always an option. I honestly did not know these existed until recently. I had a friend tell me he took a second monitor with him while he travels, and all I could imagine was a huge, clunky monitor.This monitor is a great option. The screen is very clear and the colors are vivid and look great. I only use it for text/spreadsheets and online platforms, but it's more than enough for my needs. It's very easy to set up, pretty much plug and play. The cable storage box on the back makes it convenient to just pull out and immediately plug in, but I always carry a back up cable just in case, or if I need a longer cable based on available set up options.While not really necessary, it comes with speakers, a nice option to have. It's very light, and fits right into my backpack in the same pocket as my laptop. You can't even tell the difference in weight, and it hardly takes any extra space at all.The faux leather cover is nice and does a good job of protecting it. It's quite sturdy and of course doubles as a stand, which is super convenient.All in all, very nice second screen for my laptop while on the go!",

                "reviewText": "Once I got this set up properly it provides a decent screen extension for my laptop. I did have some issues out of the box mostly because I did not have my laptop set up to auto-seek drivers (due to data limiting). Once I turned off data limiting my PC connected and downloaded the proper driver and the screen connected and worked fine.Pros: The single pull USB can be moved to either side allowing you to easily connect to USB on either side of your computer. The screen looks good and resolution is decent for my use (basic laptop computing/office type tasks). See image for comparative resolution/ image quality (laptop is set to same resolution 1920*1680).The retractable cable is USB-C but the box does include an adapter if your computer does not have Type C connection. However without type-C connection you will need to power the screen with a separate (not included) power adapter.There are multiple USB inputs and outputs on this screen (3 of each).Cons: resolution would be too low for much beyond basic office computing.The cord on the retractable USB-C plug needs to be longer to really be worthwhile and you may be better off using your own cord to have a bit more flexibility.The \"manual\" isn't very helpful, is not well-translated and contains many errors.The power button for the screen is on the bottom of the screen and if you shift or move the screen to try to adjust it it is way too easy to power it down. Buttons for brightness are located next to the power button (making them very difficult to access).The box also includes what appears to be a USB stick, but I have not plugged it into any computer because there is nothing in the packaging to explain what it may be for and I avoid plugging in unknown devices.",
