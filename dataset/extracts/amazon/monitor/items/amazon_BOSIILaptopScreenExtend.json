It offers a respectable display quality with good clarity and viewing angles. Plug-and-play setup is convenient, you can do this by connecting the device using Type-C or HDMI. Its compatibility is what makes it particularly useful. It worked perfectly with my laptop.This innovative triple-screen extender empowers you to expand your workspace and productivity wherever you go. When I need to compare documents side by side or use one screen as a reference, having the option to switch between copy, extension, and second screen modes is useful. Although it takes some getting used to, the ability to switch between horizontal and vertical orientations is beneficial. The design is lightweight and relatively portable hanks to its thin profile, these can be folded easily and carried with the laptop in backpack. In conclusion, the extra screen is a useful addition to my workspace, it effectively completes the task. Compatibility and flexibility is main advantages, which make it a useful tool for increasing productivity while working on the go.",

                "reviewText": "The one thing I like about this portable monitor is that it comes with it's own carrying case. The case is nothing too special. It has an opening on the top so your monitor still is exposed but it is made of decent material and has a pouch in the front for all your cables. There is a velcro strap that you can put on your actual monitors when it is closed to keep it from opening. The portable monitors are nice to have if you are looking for multiple screens that can attach to your laptop but this is not exactly something I can put on my lap anymore due to the extra weight. These monitors are thick but the actual frame is fairly thin for these screen sizes. Regardless of that it is pretty heavy having both monitors on my laptop. My lenovo can support the weight at certain angles but any movement will cause it to lean backwards from the weight. You could close one monitor if you only want to use one as needed. There is a clip on top to give extra support as well as the pressure pinch on the size. It has fits most monitors but be aware that if you have a thick monitor like a gaming laptop, it may not fit. You could however just use the clip on top to hold it but it may not look as nice. This will make your laptop bulkier and not something you can close. If you want stability, the laptop has a stand in the back to handle the additional weight of this monitor. The stand is a bit weird because you have to twist to extend. You can see the \"latch\" come off to know you can adjust the height. It stand is okay. This one is a bit weird in that it only uses type c on the actual monitor. It comes with a type c to HDMI cable if you want to use hdmi but it is not hdmi to hdmi. I would recommend that you use type c to type c whenever possible to reduce the amount of cables you need but you can use mini HDMI. If you decide to use HDMI to type c you will need to have two cables per monitor. The monitors do have sound output but it is not very loud. I have only been able to play out of one monitor at a time. I am not sure if you can play out of both from one source. I did try to play games on it and it is not too bad. It is definitely not the best monitor to use for gaming but it can be done. The nice thing is that you can easily unlatch this monitor. The latch is pretty strong so you should not have to worry about the latch falling off. The screen is not too easy to scratch but the monitor flips out so the monitor is facing out making it more prone to scratches. The cables are long enough to run from the laptop to your monitors. The type c cable is angled so it does not stick out but the HDMI cable is not nor is the USB A to Type C. One thing I should say that is nice but also can be annoying is that the plugs are in the inner back side of the monitor. It can be harder to plug into but it does help with cable management. There also is no usb hub so you may actually lose your ports. The monitors do not run hot but they will drain your laptop battery super fast. Overall the monitors work really well. It actually comes with a case so you do not have to shop around for a case. The monitors are decent screen size and the screen brightness and viewing is not bad. I am not a fan of the stand adjustment but it holds my screen up. The screens clamp and hold well. The cable port design is nice to help make the cables less messy. The cables provided is not too bad but basic. The sound quality is okay but do not expect anything too crazy. You can game on it but not the best for that. The material is also not bad and sturdy so you do not have to worry about easily cracking the screen.",

With HDMI, USB-A, and Type-C compatibility, it worked like a charm with both my laptops. Biggest plus, it's super travel-friendly, so you can take your extended monitor wherever you go!The picture quality is just stunning. Those vibrant colors and sharp details really make everything pop. Whether I'm working on spreadsheets or gaming, the screen never disappoints.
