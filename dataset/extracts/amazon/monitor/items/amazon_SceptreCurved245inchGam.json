This picture quality on this thing is stellar, better than my 32\" Curved Samsung, and so far I've been impressed with the visuals for all my gaming. The base is larger than I anticipated so if you're planning to use a monitor stand a normal size one won't work, but it's a very sturdy base! All in all would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the Sceptre Curved 24.5-inch Gaming Monitor at a great sale price of $130, and I must say, it's been a pleasant surprise. The display is remarkably smooth, and the setup was a breeze. I particularly appreciate the wealth of customization options available, allowing me to tailor the monitor to my preferences. The added touch of a color-changing LED at the back of the monitor adds a nice aesthetic touch to my gaming setup.One downside worth noting is the relatively weak built-in speakers, making headphones a necessity for a more immersive audio experience. However, this seems to be a common trade-off for monitors in this price range.The monitor's ability to reach up to 240Hz is a standout feature, and the curved screen provides an immersive experience without feeling overly stretched. The colors are vibrant, adding depth to the visuals and enhancing my overall gaming experience.At this price point, the Sceptre C255B-FWT240 offers impressive value, especially for those seeking a high-refresh-rate monitor with an immersive curved display. It's a worthy addition to any gaming setup, and despite the minor audio limitation, its performance and visual quality make it a solid choice.",

RGB light in the back works fine and is a nice touch, albeit rarely seen if your desk is in a corner.3440 offers enhanced multitasking capabilities and all modern games support this resolution (older games can be stretched or played at native resolution) and there are many wallpapers available. If you stream, you will have to make some sacrifices for a pleasant viewing experience since most users probably have 1920x1080.This unit came with a single dead pixel, and it shows up green most of the time. I saw another review that mentioned this same issue when I ordered it, so take into consideration. It is mostly unnoticeable except on darker scenes.",

                "reviewText": "First of all the monitor performs great when it's on. Gaming is so smooth and immersive and like night and day coming from a 60hz monitor. The issue like some others have reported is when the display goes to sleep. Moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard doesn't wake up the display. I have to press the power button several times to get it to power off then I can power it back on and it will detect the input. Tech support says there is no firmware update available. If you can live with that annoying issue then I would recommend this for the price.",

The quality of the picture is pretty good but you can see that it's not the best, obviously I was aware of this when I brought this monitor. It's still really good quality, but I guess I am spoiled by my other uhd screen which is top of the benchmark. The monitor allows extra space for your work and I am glad I got it as I was able to replace two screens with one. I will update this review in 6 months as I have only been using the monotir for a few days now and all seems great",
