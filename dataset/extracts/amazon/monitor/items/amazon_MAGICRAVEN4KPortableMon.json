                "reviewText": "I like monitors! On my work desktop I have 2x 32\" 4k monitors hooked up side by side on my standing desk. However, even with that much real-estate I decided that I need to get this monitor for some ancillary items.I use Microsoft PowerToys' \"Fancy Zones\" to chop up my monitors into little sections that I can snap windows into. So I opted to add this so that I could have my Beeper app (iMessage, WhatsApp, Goolge Messages, etc) take up half the screen. Then on 1/4 of it I put my BitWarden password manager for quick access and my Walking tracker (Excel version) to keep track of my steps taken that day on my under-desk treadmill.This has been an amazing add on to my desk & I use it every day! It also serves as an overflow should I need more space--especially during Zoom meetings to throw the shared screen presentation down there & keep the people on the main screen.PROS:- 4k with a USB connection - I was skeptical whether the USB C monitor would get power & 4k without any additional cords. Plug --> Play truly described it. 100% zoom with 4k and it is a beautiful picture- The adjustable stand being part of it is a great add on. I don't have any additional clutter on my desk.- I tried to take a picture to show just how thin this monitor is & it didn't do it justice. This thing is super thin.- The viewing angles are surprisingly good!CONS:- Since I have been walking on my treadmill a lot & it's winter time out there, every time I go up to touch my mouse, if I bump the cord on this, static electricity reboots this screen & then it takes a few seconds to come back- It is a bit over-priced, but in my opinion, worth itIf you're like me & dream of the future desks that have a status monitor built into them for quick viewing, this is the add-on to get!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a portable second monitor for use with my Surface Pro 8. This unit is great. The Surface can power and send signal to the device using one of the USB-C ports. It took a few minutes to set the resolution to very closely match the Surface. One thing is that I cannot get the monitor as bright as my Surface. Not that big a deal, but my only complaint. I would recommend this monitor. I may purchase a second so that I can have 3 monitors while traveling (which I do a lot).",

At first they worked well but then they started flashing in and out like the was a short. Now they only periodically come one. I would have rated them a 1 but when they do work they are nice. I would suggest a different company/model screen for your needs.",
