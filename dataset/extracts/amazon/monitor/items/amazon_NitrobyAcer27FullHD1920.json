I tend to play Fortnite, COD, and apex on PS4 PRO and this monitor definitely keeps up. I use to own a ACER ED027 SBIIPX 27 INCH FHD 5ms response time so as you can tell, I'm a fan of these affordable monitors. Which is why this version called my attention with the adjustable stand. The biggest reason I bought this version was it being ergonomically friendly. I can adjust it to the height and angle i please which is great for my neck and shoulders.Visually: this monitor gives off great bright colors and deep blacks and has good presets already. For someone who has never owned a UHD or QHD monitor, i guess i have nothing to compare to in terms of display. When gaming, i do not experience tearing which is something I did experience with my old ED0 that had 5ms response G to G. This monitor has Overdrive mode so I'm sure that makes things look much better, which is something I hadn't experienced before.When doing work on a computer and using it as a main display, i am pretty content. I feel that the pixels are less noticeable for some reason so this just goes to show that even with a 6 month manufacturing difference between my old and new model, Acer is working on their models performance and quality even at the mid range level on VA monitors.Price point- i was actually pretty confused when I purchased this monitor at a cheaper price than my last. The Red Nitro has some 2.5 watt speakers that i honestly can't complain too much about. I tend to game on headset but when I feel like it, the speakers on 80 volume are pretty alright. That's the setting i have them at in the video. These speakers aren't to blast, but more almost to have background noise. Definitely not the best for an immersive experience but for a monitor this is a feature you can't really find at this price point.So for this Nitro to be $160, have speakers, overdrive mode, and be 1ms VRS, have a strong beautiful red stand, Height/Tilt adjustment and 165hz FHD? THIS IS A STEAL. If your kid or even yourself, wanna upgrade to a slightly bigger monitor and have a flexible, resourceful monitor for any occasion, this is THE ONE.Also- i honestly went on a whim buying this monitor because there are not many reviews out there on this particular version. So i wanted to make it known this is an affordable monitor that makes some great competition.Con- I wish they made the monitor settings more user-friendly. The buttons are at such a weird angle, and really takes concentration to adjust to your likings.I personally feel like those speakers could use some tweaking but I get that it's a budget monitor.UPDATE: I've been having a problem when gaming where the screen will go black. It'll go black for about 6 seconds and then come back. It hasn't gotten me killed yet in game play, but it happens at the worst times.9.5/10 for it's price point. Updated review is maybe a 8/10 cause for a gamer this black screen can be a headache.",

It's the perfect monitor to get gaming with higher refresh rate like 165hz and AMD freesync technology. The picture looks great when used as a TV and connected to a PC. The built in speakers sound just ok nothing to rave about. I really like the metallic red stand it comes with but this monitor can be easily mounted. The resolution is only 1080p but most games are not being made in 4k yet so you can't go wrong. Overall I think its a great value for the money. Very easy to set up, very well packaged too.",

Thinking about swapping the internals from my HTPC: R7 2700, 32gb 3200 RAM, 2060 Super to see if there will be a bigger difference in quality.They look amazing compared to what I used to have. And for the price they look good.So far the only bad I can find is there are 2 pixels on one of them, one red/one green, that will randomly show up for a bit, and then disappear just as randomly. They seem to be showing less, and less the more I use them. Have gone through all the settings, and nothing seems to make a difference as to the random appearances. Maybe they just needed a bit of warming up?Since this isn't my main gaming rig, more of my work area, and test system I wasn't looking for the best of the best.These def work. Having the curve to them helps set them a bit further back in the corner opening up a bit more room on the desk surface.As far as the small amount of gaming I do do on this setup it def looks good. 1080p@165hz through Dport looks pretty amazing.When watching TV, or movies the quality setting of the software, and resolution, plays a huge part in the image quality. if it's a 720p setting, or lower it shows. 1080p or higher it does look good.1 Dport, and 2 HDMI's allow for some connectability. Comes with an HDMI cable with each monitor. Build quality is good. They're light for their size which made it easy to mount on the dual Veas arm mount.For the budget minded these are worth a look.Update- 11/30/23: the pixel issue has gone away, & haven't seen them in months. Did the equipment upgrade to a R5 5500, 32gbs 3200mhz RAM, gigabyte b550 aorus pro-p MB, bequiet dark rock 2 CPU cooler, and the 2060 super outta my other system. Def uptick in performance, and visuals. FPS have gone up. Went through HDR calibration, and the image quality has greatly improved during gaming. The only real issue is when there is an abundance of white on the screens they get a bit smeary when scrolling up, or down.Still with the money after a handful of months.",

It has a 10Bit rate which means way more colors and I had no clue. Super nice that the colors just pop out and make videos or gaming so vivid.
