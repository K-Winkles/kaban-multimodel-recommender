                "reviewText": "I have a home office setup with an ACER ultra-wide second monitor on a floating arm. It's a nice monitor, but for some reason it's a buggar to get my work laptop (a Dell CAD workstation) to find the correct resolution with. I had to fiddle with the settings (as it's a 75Hz monitor) and finally my system recognized the correct settings... and even with that, sometimes my system sees the monitor as just a 1920x1080 generic PnP monitor or sporadically flashes in and out (as if it's struggling to find the correct settings/source (as it's autosensing). Ugh. It drives me nuts. With that, I also use it has an extended monitor for my home setup (where my wife and I share the monitor, swapping between a couple older MS Surface products (SurfacePro5 and SurfaceBook2)); when those are hooked up to the ACER ultra-widescreen monitor, it's the worst looking stretched-out blurry 1920x1080 interpretation, and by no means 75Hz). It was nasty.Now bring in this AOC 27\" monitor. It's a big monitor, but it has basic settings: 1920x1080 at ~60Hz. It's much thinner than the bulkier ACER, and this AOC monitor is nicely 'frameless'. It fits on the computer arm in our little home office so much better/more-flush. Also, it is instantly recognized by all our computers and Windows effortlessly matches up the correct settings. It's a clean, bright, and crisp image monitor. It's SOOO much nicer with our older laptops than that ACER ultra-wide.I had such high hopes for that ACER ultra-wide... but this taller rectangular 27' AOC unit is actually much nicer to work with. The AOC viewing real estate is 13.5\"x24\"... where the ACER ultra-wide is 11.5\"x27\". The taller/narrower AOC screen is just nicer when reading webpages, building a presentation slide, or doing CAD. That's probably just a preference (based on my usage), but it's noticeable. I imagine the ultra-wide is perhaps better for gaming, but it didn't really work well for other uses.Oh, and for under $100, this AOC 27\" unit is a smokin' deal! Great size, quality, and performance for the price!",

                "reviewText": "I am not able to afford a more expensive monitor, but I need to say this one is perfect! It is very easy to set up, extremely light, the box is really compact, it is also extremely light and when assembled the screen can be moved vertically about 20\u00b0. This is my first IPS screen and I am very satisfied, it is also the smallest one I ever had, but needless to say 24\u201d is not bad, and other than it\u2019s technical use, the monitor is very aesthetically pleasing. I use it as my main screen (and only one.) But I believe professionals or gamers would find it more useful as a secondary one. Overall, it is a great for people on a budget, or people who don\u2019t need a better one. Extremely satisfied!",

It's a good size monitor, at a decent price & works perfectly fine. Using as 2nd display to have Discord & Spotify visible while gaming. 10/10 I'll buy another if I decide to setup a triple monitor system. Well worth the price.",
