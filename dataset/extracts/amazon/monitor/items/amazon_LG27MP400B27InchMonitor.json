I do find that I prefer to just keep it at the highest level, but it's good to have an option. The set up was easy, just screwing in a few screws to set up the stand and then attaching the monitor. This monitor also comes with an HDMI to HDMI cord, so if you don't have an HDMI port on your laptop you will need an adaptor. Picture quality is great; I don't game so I don't know if the refresh rate and picture quality is good for that, but I've watched HD movies on this monitor and it's amazing. The 27\" screen is large enough for me to fit several windows on it, and it's so much easier for me to do work now--instead of having to toggle back and forth, I can see everything at once. Overall, great product, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought my first desktop computer since 2014 a couple weeks ago. I tried setting it up with an old 24 inch flatscreen TV, and found that the computer's resolution was so much more powerful than the 720p HDTV's max output that everything came out blurry. I found this LG monitor for about $130 and it works perfectly for what I need. The computer I bought is an upgraded Mac Studio M2 Max that I use for music production. I do not need perfect graphics for such a use as this, and this monitor does a perfectly adequate job. The display is clear to my untrained eyes. However, If a person was in need of a monitor for photo or video editing, I would consider one with a higher resolution. All this said, this monitor is perfect for my needs and I am very happy with the price and quality.",

I didn\u2019t use the standard mount so I can\u2019t attest to it, but it mounts to a wall bracket perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Before I bought this monitor, I read the reviews on here and on other websites. Then I went to the LG website listed under Product Description on this page and downloaded the Monitor Driver and the On Screen Control Support software (for Windows and Mac) which lets you choose Screen Split (to arrange multiple windows), Monitor Settings, My Application Presets and Game Mode Settings before I bought the monitor.I am not a gamer so I don't have any high quality games to try.I also downloaded the User Manual in PDF format, the link to download the User Manual is under Product Guides and Documents on this page. There is a lot of useful information in this manual.I turned on my computer after connecting this monitor then installed the Monitor Driver through Device Manager in Windows 11. This driver gives Windows 11 full functionality of the monitor.This monitor replaces my old 9 year old Acer. The picture & graphics on this LG FHD 27-Inch 27MP450-B is fantastic! I am very pleased with this monitor and I highly recommend it.The joystick control on the power button is very easy to use and is easy to get to all the settings just by moving the button forward, backwards, left or right. Just push the button in once and the settings menu will be shown in the On Screen Display. This is much easier than all the separate buttons on my old monitor to adjust the settings.I'm glad I got the 27MP450-B with the tilt & height adjustment stand. The height adjustment lets the monitor glide slowly & smoothly up or down and it stays right where you raise or lower it to. There is no lock or adjustment to be made on the stand to raise or lower the monitor, just slowly move it up or down, it doesn't take much pressure to move it.",

Despu\u00e9s de mucho investigar y probarlo en varias computadoras, pude ver que la calidad de este monitor es p\u00e9sima, desafortunadamente no le\u00ed todas las rese\u00f1as antes de comprarlo, de haberlo hecho jam\u00e1s lo hubiera comprado, incre\u00edble que una marca como LG tenga a la venta algo de esta calidad, por un precio ni tan barato. NO LO COMPREN!!!",
