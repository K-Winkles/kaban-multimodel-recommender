                "reviewText": "This is actually my first time writing a review on Amazon. I was so excited to finally have what I was looking for! So I hope to help out anyone thats struggling. Portable monitors seems to be a growing trend so not much precise information online.It took me some trial and error with different brands, both well known and third party but this one is it. Overall this monitor fits in everything that I was looking for in a portable monitor.Now to begin with my specific use case; I am a professional photographer, and at the moment a Computer Science student. I wanted a portable monitor that fits in all of my bags along with my laptop, allows me to do some photo and video editing (16\" MacBook Pro), would connect to my cell phone via USB-C (iPhone 15 Pro), would allow portrait mode for coding projects, and would plug into Nintendo Switch without needing a dock. This is the one that delivered! So thank you so much ViewSonic for delivering!Some caveats to mention, One Cable USB-C works prefect with the MacBook Pro, even in 4K resolution.To use with Nintendo Switch or iPhone, the other USB-C port has to be connected to a power source. Wall outlet or PowerBank. (In my scenario I used and Anker PowerBank and it works!)This is will all portable monitors though, not just this one. So here's why I settled with this one.Pros:+ Super lightweight! This screen is approximately 1.6lbs and will add nothing in weight for carrying.+ Very Portable! 16\" is a great size and it does a good job at being close to matching the MacBook Pro.+ 16\" OLED 4K screen (Its great to watch movies but don't expect it to replace a 65\" 4K OLED TV).+ 170 Degrees Visual from different angles (Consistent image quality from different angles).+ 100% DCI-P3 coverage/most of Adobe RGB (which is great for color accuracy, photo and video editing)+ Built in Portrait mode which is great for coding or editing (might need to level the stand)+ Has a built in speaker (No, they are not strong but at least its provided, better than nothing)+ 3.5mm Jack (plugs into a portable speakers with 3.5mm Jack or headphones)+ Provides Power to devices (iPhone 15/Switch) that are connected via Wall Outlet or PowerBank.Cons:- 60hz only (would have been even better at 120hz to match my Mac, and maybe the Switch 2?)Probably asking for too much but would hav been the icing on the cake.- Expensive ~$500 (but to be honest it's not really a con, you get what you pay for and for it to do everything that I need without extra dongles. I'm perfectly fine with paying the price tag)Overall though I can't complain about this purchase; just being a little nitpicky. If ViewSonic decides to keep producing these and release a version with 120hz, I would buy it in a heartbeat but as of now it's perfect! Check out the attached photos for my use cases.-----|The only other well know brand I tried was the ASUS ZenScreen MB16QHG. Almost kept it too but I did not want to carry around with me additional dongles for my Switch:Pros:+ 2K+ 120hz+ Built in Stand (Portrait mode too)+ 3.5mm Jack+ 100% DCI-P3+ Full HDMI Cable (Not Mini)+ Great Portrait Mode Stand+ Auto-Rotate (Windows Only)+ Very LightweightCons:- It doest NOT connect the Nintendo Switch without a dock, then even with a dock connected the 16:10 aspect ratio doesn't not convert to 16:9 for gaming. It left the gameplay looking distorted and for me personally I wasn't a fan.- No built in speakers- Expensive while lacking features ~$400-----|The only third party brand I tried was the UPERFECT 18\" Gaming Monitor (Almost perfect). Would have kept it if I was just for gaming. But it doesn't fit all my bags, and having to constantly recalibrate it would have sucked.Pros:+ 2K+ 144hz+ Connects to Nintendo Switch via USB-C without a dock+ FreeSync+ Both 16:9/16:10+ 100% DCI-P3+ Vesa Mount+ Affordable ~$257Cons:- 18\" Screen not very portable.- Passible Portrait mode needs Vesa Mount Stand to be more stable.- Brightness settings reset when disconnected from power.",

                "reviewText": "I bought TWO - the first for an Apple MacBook Pro (M1); the second for an ASUS ZenBook Windows 10 computer.1. The Apple connection was easy - NOTE: you should plug the ViewSonic into a power source, then connect the ViewSonic to the MacBook Pro (M1). That way, the ViewSonic provides the sole power (initially to the ViewSonic and then through the USB-C PD cable to the MBP-M1 (make SURE you get a cable rated for 65W or above (I use a 100W cable and things work as expected)). Connecting this way is important as if frees up the second USB-C port on the MBP-1A for anything else you want to connect (I have a USB-C hub and four hard drives connected (this all at the same time as the ViewSonic is connected)).2. The ASUS took a bit more finagling - however, if you set the resolution correctly for the Mouse Screen, you can actually have all three screen available (ViewSonic, ASUS laptop screen and Mouse screen) at the same time. I have all my ViewSonic's positioned \"above\" my laptop screens.3. It is important to understand the screens are set to 50% on all settings when right out of the box. This initially makes the screen look washed out. HOWEVER - by simply access the built-in ViewSonic adjustment menu (available by pushing the button on the back of the screen), you can increase both the brightness and contrast to mimic your portable screen (if necessary).These two screens are awesome on the road - they are thin but sturdy and pack/travel well, easy to set up, and the touch screen works as advertised with the appropriate drivers downloaded and installed.I've even used them with an iPad Pro - and as with all things connected to an Apple computer - they simply work!Can you tell I really enjoy the versatility these monitor/screen give me?",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I am extremely pleased with this monitor. Excellent to toss in with your laptop in your laptop case.Pros:+ Incredibly thin, very compact+ Excellent build quality - metal backing, protective thin shield for screen+ Excellent touchscreen+ Can be powered from a host device USB-C. This works whether the host device is plugged in or operating on battery. When you can plug in the host device, that powers the ViewSonic monitor, as well.+ Lots of adjustments+ Even when brightness is turned down (to save battery on the host device), the screen is very readablee.+ Good resolution for very readable quality.+ Excellent multi angle kickstand is very solid and supports the entire monitor.+ Works well for Samsung DeX. The touchscreen really helps with this type of usa.Cons:- Speakers are thin and tinny.... better than nothing, but you might want to use headphones with the host device.- As others have observed, the colors are a bit on the dull side. There are lots of adjustments available through the monitor menu, so it can be tuned for what you need it for. Generally, this a very good office applications monitor and less of a multimedia monitor. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad at all for Netflix, etc.Overall, I think ViewSonic did a great job with this monitor and I highly recommend it for your road use.",

Al convertirse en t\u00e1ctil al conectarlo a una pc debes instalar ciertos drivers y conectar otro cable, digo esto porque yo me asust\u00e9 pensando que compr\u00e9 la versi\u00f3n no touch y resulta que solo era necesario eso. Al conectar esos cables extra se convierte ahora s\u00ed en algo m\u00e1s estorboso pero tampoco nada exagerado. Tiene un stylus o lapiz bastante r\u00fastico que bien podr\u00eda mejorarse pero como yo no planeaba dibujar ni nada que demandase algo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de navegar por el sistema operativo me resulta suficiente.Al conectar este monitor como monitor secundario en una pc, el touch no sirve, necesita ser el monitor principal y eso a veces causa peque\u00f1os problemitas, aunque nada de real cuidado.Tiene una patita trasera que sirve bastante bien, permite varias posiciones de acomodo, no parece ser muy resistente y a veces me da la impresi\u00f3n que no durar\u00e1 mucho, los \u00e1ngulos que se logra con dicha patita no son tampoco muy variados pero son suficientes para lo que se requiera.Los colores del monitor, creo que es su lado m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil... son colores muy opacos, saturando todo y movi\u00e9ndole mucho a los par\u00e1metros se logra algo decente, pero si es un punto malo, si lo buscas para algo de edici\u00f3n no creo que sea lo mejor.El men\u00fa o sistema operativo interno del monitor es bastante com\u00fan, se maneja bien, solo hay que agarrarle el modo.Es un buen monitor secundario, es muy port\u00e1til, es una excelente compra, lo recomiendo bastante!",
