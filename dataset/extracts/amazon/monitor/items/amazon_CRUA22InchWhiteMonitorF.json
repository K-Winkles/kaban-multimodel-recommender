                "reviewText": "I was a bit worried since the 1440p 144hz version did not have any reviews yet but I was amazed at how good this monitor is, absolutely one of the best monitors for the price, considering this is in the price range of most 1080p 144/165hz monitors but this one is actually 1440p.I didn't know how much better 1440p was until I selected the resolution in a game and was blown away by how much more I could actually see, although, unfortunately, my PC can only do either high refresh rate or high resolution in most triple A games, and I can only experience both when I'm playing Valorant or Rocket league or similar light games, but regardless, the color and response time are amazing as well. The screen gets plenty bright and I only ever need to turn it up to 100% brightness when the sun hits it directly and I'm watching low light content, like when it is nigh time in-game or similar situations, and I generally keep it at 20-50% brightness during the day and 0-10% at night.Mine came very well packaged and as far as I know, it has no dead pixels in the month or so that I've had it for. Excelent monitor overall, specially for the $199 price tag.",

                "reviewText": "I got this monitor since I had already splurged on 2 LG monitors for 300+ each and wanted to save some money on a work setup. This monitor is a quality screen for a lower price point and does an amazing job.Only thing to point out was: initially I was worried that there was some burn-in on the monitor. However, I reached out to support and they quickly responded to me saying that I had left the dust film on the monitor. So don't be a dummy like me and stress over marks on the screen and double check that you had removed the dust film!I wasn't expecting good support of this monitor, but the company did a great job quickly getting back to me on my support request, so plus sign for that!",

                "reviewText": "I REALLY liked this monitor and want to keep it, however text on the screen seems to be blurry. I can't go more than an hour on this monitor without getting a headache. I've tried spending roughly 3 hours changing the monitor settings as well as windows settings to get the text crisper similar to my 1080p monitor. I've reached out to support (email on, no website) and waiting for a response. I'll update once I hear back.Update:Support got back to me via email within roughly 48 hours. Unforntately, my eyes couldn't adjust and I had to return the monitor. I use my monitor 90% business/reading and 10% gaming. The gaming aspect was great, no headaches but the reading and business portion really hurt my eyes, most likely due to the vibrant (this sounds like a fake review setence...) colors and bright monitor. Sad to have to send it back though.I went for their 27\" curved VA monitor instead of the IPS and other than the first day, I haven't had any headaches or eye strain while reading or handling business. I believe this is due to the VA monitor having a higher contrast ratio that makes the text appear sharper, that just my opinion, I'm not a monitor exquisidair.Based on support and the above I'm changing my review to 5 stars because if I purchased this only for gaming it would be perfect. I can noticably see the difference in speed and color when comparing the VA & IPS monitors.",

                "reviewText": "Well in all honesty, for the first hour, it was a great monitor haha. Unfortunately after that hour, I noticed the bottom half of the screen started to flicker, than out of nowhere the bottom half just started showing white lines horizontally across everything. I tried all the basic stuff, different display port cable, turning it off and on, unplugging it, plugging it back in. I know the monitor itself is defective because when you turn it on, the whole screen is purple with their logo in the center. But the white lines were still present on their logo screen. But to their credit, i think this may have been an amazon issue. When it arrived, its in its normal box, but typical amazon protocol, that box was in a bigger amazon box. But it was in that amazon box with no packing material like foam, the bubbles, or those bags of air. So I guess it is possible it got damaged in shipping, seeing as the amazon box was not packaged well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When i was looking for a 27 inch, 1440p 144Hz monitor, this CRUA monitor showed up as the lowest priced option at 189.99. And so far, it\u2019s worked great! The picture is very clear and colorful, and it\u2019s fairly easy to set up. I had trouble displaying my laptop on it, but the support team advised me to buy a usb to HDMI adapter, which solved the problem! Here\u2019s a warning for putting the stand on: there is a square hole in the back of the monitor, so there\u2019s a chance that a screw could fall into it if you\u2019re not careful. That\u2019s why happened to me, and while it\u2019s obviously my fault, i\u2019m just slightly worried about what might happen in the future due to a foreign piece of metal in the monitor. If you\u2019re careful though, unlike me, you should be just fine. All in all, at 189.99, i think this monitor is great.",

Picture quality is great for gaming, the 144hz refresh rate looks really good. Personally I like small bezels, and these are pretty much perfect for my tastes. 1440p is very useful if you use multiple programs on 1 monitor.Overall, a fantastic buy for the price.",
