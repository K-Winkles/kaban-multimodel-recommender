It was easy to put together despite the minimal instructions. It fits together like a puzzle. All you need is an allen wrench which is supplied. The only weird thing is where they drill out the wood at an angle for the screws. It is light wood color so it shows against the black stained wood. So I just colored that in with a black sharpie. Other than that, it's a cute table at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "Great piece of furniture. I spent all last weekend assembling Ikea furniture, so compared to that this has very clear instructions, is very easy to put together, and appears to be made of high quality materials. The assembly screws it not just into wood, but nuts inserted into the boards, giving it the feel of a very stable piece of furniture.My only complaint is that the attachment points, because of the angles, are very clear. You can see it in the product picture at the base and unfortunately the contrast between the particle wood and the veneer is great and really detracts from the aesthetics. I think a little black paint will cover this up nicely, but it would be great if they could have included a cap or other sort of mitigation so this minor issue wouldn't be as obvious on the assembled piece.",

I can keep my drink or phone on the top, and store other items below (I keep my cat brush there as they often hop up on my lap when I'm sitting here).No cons I can think of, construction was sturdy, all pieces were included, and all the screw holes lined up easily for assembly. Hex tool included, no need for a screwdriver.",

The side table is a perfect size for a small room and holds a great deal of things. I have coasters, a laptop with charger, box of tissues, cup of pens and pencils, a large holder with scissors and a sewing project-quite a few things for such a small side table.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for a modern end table to use at a stand for some large but short speakers to lift off the ground. This was about the only one I could find which was the size I was looking for and didn't look old fashioned or too cliche. It's a smidge unstable with the way the center is designed and the narrow base but hopefully the books we intend to add for storage will resolve that. And hopefully the dogs and people don't knock into them too often or hard. Overall, it's the best we could find. We ordered two of them in two separate orders. The first one came with scratches but since they were on the underside or in areas where we didn't think anyone would notice, we decided it wasn't worth the effort to exchange them.",

                "reviewText": "I searched and searched to find a unique end table for my living room...and almost everything I found was far too expensive for my budget. This table was a great deal, and fits in perfectly with my modern decor. It was easy to assemble - I put it together by myself in maybe 20 minutes. The quality is great - it's made from good, solid wood. It holds up a rather weighty lamp, and doesn't show any signs of sagging or wear. The shelves are perfect for storing errant magazines or books, too.",
