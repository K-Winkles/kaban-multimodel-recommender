I would like to give it a 5, but I found quite a few scuff marks on the wood (in close-up pictures) and the metal legs were scratched up a bit. The desk itself was very easy to assemble and I did it without any help. It\u2019s a pretty heavy piece of furniture, so if you aren\u2019t that strong I would suggest having someone to help you lift it once it is assembled. I left a few pictures of the desk by itself as well as one to show how spacious the top is. The walnut color is super beautiful and the top of the desk is quite sturdy. Only issue I had was the screws. Some of the screw holes were a bit hard to get the screw in. Legs were wobbly at first due to this, but I managed to get them in tight enough to solve the issue. I would recommend this desk if you like to have a lot of room!",

I didn\u2019t need an IKEA marathon.The bolts are very sturdy and it is a solid piece of furniture. The included hex wrench is also very sturdy. You don\u2019t really need the instructions. It\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. Are used pliers to turn the wrench as I don\u2019t have the greatest grip strength. You have to do half turns on the bottom bolt since there\u2019s little clearance with the bottom of the table top.I put this together myself, older, female, without a problem.I am framing these instructions as a reminder to myself not to be rude when I\u2019m moving my furniture.",
