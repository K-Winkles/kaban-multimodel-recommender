The paint on the frame was nice and felt smooth, cheap metal of course but still sturdy and looked nice. The desk top had a very nice wood grain finish that had no imperfections. It is cheap as well but looks nice. The solid frame helps with the cheap wood. Instructions are very clear and is easy to put together, 15-20 minutes or so. Not too big and not too small but again I am very impressed, with shipping, quality, everything, I recommend if your looking for something like this!",

I have a couple of very wiggly students so I wondered how they would hold up, but we\u2019ve had them for 3 months now and haven\u2019t had a single problem with either of them. They came together super quick also!! Definitely recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this nifty little desk on sale for only $19.99! Originally, I wanted a desk that I could fold up and put away, but for $20, I couldn\u2019t pass this up. It\u2019s sturdy enough to hold my husband\u2019s giant Mac computer and the HP Envy Printer without feeling crowded. The height is tall enough that my small two-drawer file cabinet on wheels fits below it along with the big shredder (which I moved only to make it easier to feed paper into the shredder\u2019s slot), and the user\u2019s legs with space to move.It was packaged well enough that even though the corner edges of the box were crushed, no harm had occurred to the wood or the metal pieces.I TOOK THE ADVICE OF ANOTHER REVIEWER, who is a few years older than me (in her 60s), and installed ALL OF THE RODS AND LEGS WITH THE LETTERS FACING INWARD. This was very good advice, because making the mistake of placing the finishing touch of the metal decor in the corners inside-out would have looked wrong. (If you buy it, you\u2019ll understand me. \ud83d\ude09)\u2014 As always, with any type of DIY flat-pack furniture, I do not and did not tighten the screws completely until I had all screws inserted and partially screwed in. Once I was out of screws and the structure was built, I went through each screw and tightened them in a pattern that I thought would make the legs the most level.\u2014 I MADE THE MISTAKE OF OVER-TIGHTENING three of the screws that connect the metal square frame to the wood, and the screws popped through the top of the desk and cracked the wood. Luckily, the worst is at the back and covered by the computer (yes, there is a front & back, which is why installing all letters facing inward was such good advice), and the other two screw pop-throughs aren\u2019t too noticeable.\u2014 All of the hardware is well packaged and had dots with their corresponding letter on the piece of paper of poorly written/drawn/pantomimed instructions.\u2014 Mixing up the \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cJ\u201d screws was easy to do, so double check those before placing them anywhere.\u2014 The same \u201calmost senior-aged\u201d person whose advice I followed in regard to keeping the letters facing inward also mentioned she had assembled her desk on a bed. I did that, too (but on the guest room bed, because ~ EWWW~ gross box all the way from Vietnam with gnarly germs and potential hobo spit or snail-slime, plus washing that room\u2019s linens at my leisure is easier than changing my bed after putting furniture together).\u2014 To conclude: I\u2019m disabled and put it together rather easily; it\u2019s a nice looking, albeit basic workspace, AND I GOT IT FOR $20! I\u2019m happy!\u2014 One star was taken off for the terrible instruction sheet. When will Asian, Southeast Asian/Indian, and other non-native speaking manufacturers realize that spending a few hundred dollars ONCE on a SKILLED COPYWRITER will elevate their image into \u201cA few dollars more but worth it\u201d type of company?",

                "reviewText": "I use this for a sewing table and it is excellent! It's on carpet and does not wobble or shake when my sewing machine is at full speed. This table is lightweight, easy to move around if you rearrange, yet sturdy. I can imagine this weould make a great, simple desk. This is the second time I've ordered this table. The first time I ordered two and this time I ordered one. The have nice straight edges so you can easily sit them next to each other to make a fantastic and big sewing surface. It''s great for quilting where you need a bigger space. Then if you move apartments, houses, or just move them around, it's easy to do that. I ordered on the 6th and it was at my front door on the 9th! It was very well packaged and all pieces and hardware were very well marked. It's simple and fast to put together. They have made some great improvements to the braces and now come with littel feet to screw into the bottom for leveling. I would not hesitate to buy this again and as a matter of face I wish I had ordered another one which I'll probably do.",
