I wanted something small-space friendly as I live in an apartment, but one that still had a large enough surface area to be functional for a phone, drink, remote, etc. I love this one as it is a perfect size, and it has two smaller shelves below for decor or maybe remotes, coasters, whatever you like. It is the perfect height for my recliner and the design is very wood like and fits in well with my other real wood furniture. It was super easy to assemble and although lightweight feels very sturdy and well built. And for the price you can\u2019t beat it.",
