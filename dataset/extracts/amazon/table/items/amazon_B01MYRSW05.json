                "reviewText": "I am at a loss to explain the many very negative reviews of this product.I need a lot of storage space, and have about a half-dozen of various Furinno shelving units. All are cleverly designed and went together with the greatest of ease. Considering the light-weight materials, they are quite sturdy. I wouldn't put very heavy things on them, of course, but for general storage of linens, etc., they are great units at good prices.This piece is no exception, though it is slightly more complex in terms of the number of pieces involved and how they go together. The instructions might seem a little daunting to a novice. Study them before assembling to insure success. Some intuition also must be used when drawings and parts are a bit unclear. But this is not exactly rocket science -- just common sense.The worst thing about my unit was the ghastly Styrofoam cushioning that the materials were packed in: it becomes magnetic when broken up, sticks to everything, and is very difficult to clean up. It can be removed by using tape, as you would to remove lint on a sweater. It sticks to the tape and can then be disposed of.The unit went together as instructed with little fuss or confusion. It took me about an hour to assemble completely, as opposed to 10 or 20 minutes for the simpler shelving units. It is held together with dowels between pieces. Long screws secure them. All the holes are in the right places, but examine the pieces first to make sure where everything goes. No glue is required, included, or needed as some reviewers state.Everything must be tightly joined, however: dowels must be lightly tapped in all the way, preferably with a rubber hammer. Screws must be fully inserted and tightened completely. Just hand-strength is sufficient, but give everything that extra little twist until they feel completely secure.The top piece attaches easily and securely with cam nuts and screws. Anybody who says it comes off just doesn't understand the working of the cam nut. The table is standard-size: not overly heavy, nor too small, substantial enough for ordinary use. It is not one of those football-field sized tables some people seemed to expect. In any case, the measurements are clearly and accurately described in the product description.Of course, you cannot put sweating glasses down on any piece of furniture without leaving a ring, including walnut and mahogany pieces which may sell for 100 times the price of this unit. Use a coaster and/or wipe off any liquids immediately.Some of the pieces did have nicks or broken veneer on them, as people say, but a little scratch-cover polish can take care of that. The cloth drawers are sturdy enough for what they are, and are attractive. They provide a little much-needed extra storage space, which comes in handy in a New York City apartment.A good table for a very casual setting, at a pretty fantastic price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this coffee table for our basement/game room where the couch is ony about 6 feet away from the t.v. Our old coffee table was way too fat and tall and I really wanted something small so i could put my feet up withiut my feet interfering with the t.v. screen without spending too much on real wood furniture.It is pretty small and looks good but while you put it together you are reminded of the cons if particle board.Here is my review and experience after buying this coffe table:PACKAGING: It's always a hit or miss with build it yourself furniture. It could come scratched, dinged, or chipped. Fortunately mine came safe and well packaged with just some minor cosmetic flaws on the legs (4/5).ASSEMBLY: Very easy to assemble. Not a lot of pieces. HOWEVER, the pilot holes for the screws are not recessed so when the coffee table is fully assembled, you'll see the black screws on the finished side of the legs. It makes it look cheaper so i drilled new holes and coverd the holes with wood stickers in dark brown/espresso. Also, it is very wasy to strip or chip particle board so be careful when you add and tighten screws. Overall, easy to assemble, just wish they changed the pilot holes for the screws or included stickers to cover them. (3.5/5)APPEARANCE: For $65.00, it looks good for what it is and is pretty sturdy once fully assembled. The finish is typical of this type of furniture. I ordered the espresso/dark brown and it seems these colors are always up to interpretation. To me, it's more of a dark walnut rather than espresso. I guess that's why they advertise it as dark brown as well. Either way, it blends pretty good with my existing furniture so it was ok. Just prepare yourself for the potential that the color won't match your specific expectations (4/5)STORAGE: While it is nice that they include the 2 bins, they are very thin and cheap feeling. I would'nt put heavy things in them, just light stuff like game controllers or remotes, things if that nature. Fortunately, they look nice so at least they are not eye sores. Plus, you can always add higher quality baskets if you want. (3.5/5)OVERALL: I think this is a great buy for those on a tight budget and/or in a small living area. Perfect for college dorms or small living rooms. Just remember you are paying for, and getting, particle board quality furniture so your experience may vary in terms of quality control. (3.8/5)",

                "reviewText": "For the price this table is very pretty. The color of the collapsible storage bins leaves a bit to be desired but those can easily be changed to a color that more suits your flair. You will want to look for 4.5x10x14\u201d ish. The table was easy to put together, the directions were written well. I think it took me like ten minutes. The packaging was not so great. It arrived beat up and the eco friendly foam blocks they used had somehow been shredded in parts so it left me, my black dog and my wood floors covered in white snow that 24 hrs later I\u2019m still trying to remove. It clings to everything! Just a warning so you can plan your preparation area accordingly. I got the espresso color and it\u2019s beautiful. It does have a couple of minor scratches on it. The trim is where the cheap price is evident as numerous areas were loose on arrival. I\u2019ve glued them, but who knows how long it will stay. I do love the fact it has little feet you can hammer on so it protects from scratching. There is room for improvement, but it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. Overall it is an OK affordable piece that will get me through til my next move, but won\u2019t hold up through the move.",
