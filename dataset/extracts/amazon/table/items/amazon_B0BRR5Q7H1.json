I will repurchase the new model.UPDATE: this review went from 5 stars to 2 stars. I have had the table a few days over a month and it\u2019s already falling apart. I can\u2019t get a refund because it\u2019s been 36 days and the policy is 30 days (ridiculous) the rubber around the wood is peeling off leaving behind extremely sticky residue all over everything. It\u2019s very disappointing. I can\u2019t glue it back on it will not stick onto whatever they originally used. As of right now it is just the chair doing this and the table isn\u2019t yet but I know it will start soon. I am leaving my original review under this oneThis table and chair was EXTREMELY easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and I love that the seat height is adjustable so it grows with your child. The seat stores perfectly underneath the table and takes up very little room. It\u2019s perfect for households with minimal space. It\u2019s also very easy to clean. When I opened the box there was a not so great odor that I thought was coming from the wood of the table BUT thankfully it was just the foam used to protect the pieces and the smell did NOT get stuck on the table. Love love love this and my 1 year old loves it too",

This looks great, durable and stable. The wood won\u2019t bed or break, can be wiped down clean. It\u2019s the perfect size for a growing toddler because the seat is adjustable. It was easy to assemble and easy to change the height of the chair if needed. I wipe it down after he eats and it\u2019s so convenient. The table weighs more than the chair but it\u2019s easy to move. Super compact and the chair slides under the table perfectly I absolutely love it and so does he.",

I got this for my 2-year-old grandson for Christmas and within 2 hours of having it when he tried to push the chair back from the table he fell over and then again when he was trying to push the chair back from the table the table flipped and hit him in the face and knocked out his tooth so that being said do not buy this product. We spent Christmas night in the ER.",

                "reviewText": "I encourage small businesses and tend to keep my expectations low. I usually don't give a bad review either. But this review is purely to reach to the makers to improve design.1. The screws break when you try to install.2. The material is a bad quality plywood, with melamin sheet covering. Result, it is lighter than what it would be with MDF, but given the bad quality plywood, it is brittle.3. The instructions are worse than ikea. The whole set comes in 6 types of flat boards. No markings of sides, every board has 4 different way to install of which only 1 is the right way. Or you will have to open the screw. Luckily I didn't even get that far, I only installed one screw and by the time I try to install second, it broke before it even went all the way in.Suggestion to maker: Please don't cheap out using those stupid aluminium screws, please include some good quality magnetic screws and also try covering the holes with metal washers, so that the screwing in is easy without the whole brittle plywood piece fall off.The surface is slippery, and the hole patters don't even stay on ground. It requires 2-3 people.That said, the quality may be is justified for the price it is being offered. I just feel bad that, I am willing to pay extra, but give me a better quality product. I thought the design is really good, but the installation is a pain.Wouldn't recommend this item to a friend. If any better products will definitely consider buying from this buyer.Lastly, message to Amazon : Don't call it overnight if you can't deliver overnight. After expecting it on overnight, it came 2 days later.",
