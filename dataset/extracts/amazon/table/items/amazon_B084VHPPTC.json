                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Gorgeous, sturdy desk - incredible customer service. One of the best experiences I've had on Amazon",
                "reviewText": "I really like this desk. I got the rustic brown one, and it is just gorgeous. It's a very sturdy desk. A lot of the stuff I end up ordering on Amazon is flimsy or just low quality, and I have just come to expect that at this point, but this desk is simply sturdy. Even the hardware was very sturdy and did not feel cheap at all. It rivals anything I'd purchase in the store. I believe the price for this desk is very fair.Everything about this desk and experience has been nothing short of top-notch, even down to the instruction manual. The instructions were so clearly written. I know that sounds like a minor thing, and I'd of been fine with an instruction manual that was difficult to read through, it wouldn't have bothered me or anything, but it was just one more thing that showed me how much due diligence these guys have put in to their product.A note about the size, in the hopes it will help someone: I got the 47''. It's the perfect size for me, personally - enough room for my clunky laptop, desk lamp, stack of notebooks, some art supplies, and enough room to draw/write comfortably. Not too big and not too little - just right. I hope the picture I'm including helps give a good idea. Initially I was debating between the 47'' and the smaller 40'', unsure of which would be best. Really happy I went with the 47'', because after getting the desk, I realize now the 40'' would have been too small to suit my needs. I think this desk is the perfect size for a working desk, but smaller might be difficult. If you're on the fence and unsure if the 40'' would be too small for you, I'd suggest to go with the 47''. But that's just my opinion - asses what you need the desk for, and make the call based on that. Make sure to measure whatever space you're planning to put it in of course.About the weight - this desk is lightweight enough to move around with ease. That's been useful for me as I'm one person and not particularly strong. It comes with little protective feet, but I think they're a tad rough and I'd suggest putting some additional sort of little felt tips on the bottom if you have hardwood floors, but that is just good practice in general.The side pocket is really spacious. It's not cheap or flimsy. I have definitely put that to use. I did not use the headphone thing, so I can't comment on that. But it's a really cool thing to include.Finally - a word about customer service. Oh man. This is probably the best customer service experience i have ever had on Amazon. My desk was slightly damaged during the shipping process. I really wasn't sure how to handle it. I did not want to go through Amazon since I've found them so rigid and difficult to deal with, so I reached out to the seller instead, not sure what would come of that. I was contacted back by Zain. He took care of it immediately and offered to send me a replacement at no charge, or a partial refund, whichever worked best for me. Packages are a bit difficult for me to receive, and I let him know I wasn't sure if I could get another and he was more than fine to wait, give me whatever time I needed. The guy was just insanely easy to deal with, a real delight, on top of taking care of everything. Ultimately I am getting the replacement issued. I truly appreciated this experience. I have had so many poor experiences on Amazon, and this really boosted my spirits. I feel like you don't need to worry if you buy this desk.Overall, I feel like this was such a great find, and at a really decent price too. It's exactly what I'd hope to spend on a desk like this, if not a little less. The quality is great, the desk is sturdy, it was easy to maneuver, and the customer service is absolutely top notch. I felt like these guys have really put the effort in to making this a solid offer all around, even for the smallest details. 5 solid stars for these guys. You can't go wrong with this!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention - mine came with something extra in the hardware. They were labeled 'C-clips'. I did not know what this was, and assumed I'd gotten some extra hardware mistakenly. Well I opened it up today - it's actually a set of 4 little magnets with the 'C' on them from the CubiCubi! Haha I actually really like these magnets and put them on my fridge. Just wanted to say, if you receive these mysterious 'C-clips' and are unsure of what it is, open it up, it's just some cool little magnets! I'm not sure if I received them by mistake in my order or not, but I really needed some magnets so if so, that was a really useful mistake.EDIT: I heard back from the company regarding the 'C-clips'. It turns out these are intentional - they are actually a utility to help manage your cords - you fix them on to the leg of the desk, on top of your cord. Attaching the picture they sent me to demonstrate, in case it helps anyone. I think I'll use mine as fridge magnets though as I don't have cords to worry about!",

                "reviewText": "I have been hesitant to upgrade my computer desk for a while now, which has been LONG overdue. Recently repainting and upgrading the entertainment room pushed me to finally find something.I start scanning all over the internet and came across this option. Looked great on paper, but of course scanning through reviews you start to second guess if it will be worth it... People noting quality issues, fitment, etc... But I figured, I didn't want to spend 2-3x as much on a simple computer desk for my needs, so why not. Let's give it a go!Given my height (6'6\") I need something with legroom, as well as plenty of desk space for my desktop setup which includes dual monitors, computer speakers off to the side of those and ideally comes in black (to match room aesthetic). Of course, I wanted something relatively cheap and good quality as well, which needless to say, you often don't get both. Decided to take a chance on the 63\" variant, hoping it would not arrived damaged or have issues during assembly.Shipment arrived quickly in perfect condition, double boxed and packaged well with foam and desk edge protection. Really nice! Unpacked everything and got ready to assemble.Overall, took me about 30 minutes which was probably longer than it should have, but my dog was insisting on 'helping'! Assembly was very easy and straight forward. I used Loctite on the threaded fasteners just to ensure things didn't back out over time with vibration and normal use. I also used a handheld drill to help during assembly versus the allen key supplied. Everything was in perfect condition with no flaws, no misaligned holes or poorly threaded inserts. Very nice!Fully assembled, this thing is really solid/sturdy. I was *very* impressed given the price point just how solid this desk is.I put the desk into position and got everything setup. With everything loaded on the desk, still solid as can be with no sagging, wiggling or other stability issues.As far as legroom goes, the floor to the top of my legs when seated come in at 25-inch when seated with my chair at it's highest position. This desk measures 29-inch from floor to top-of-table. The critical \"legroom\" dimension from floor to the bottom of the supporting member on the top of desk comes in at 27-inch. Perfect! Plenty of room to sit comfortably and have additional room when gaming with pedals. No issue here.Actual measured dimension (Width x Depth) of the desk is 63\" x 23-5/8\".My giant computer tower (23-inch height, 23-inch depth) fits perfect under the desk off to the side. Of course, if you don't have a monster tower, no problems to put on the desktop if you prefer. I just like to have it out of the way to allow for more desk space.Overall, this thing is a complete steal for the price and it's quality. I can't be happier with it! Assembly was easy, it's very sturdy and gives my tall self plenty of room. I don't have any concerns for it's ability to hold up long-term either, aside from scratches/wear on the table top surface over time (normal wear/tear).On a side note, the desk also comes with a few magnetic clips to help manage cables if you like. I have yet to complete my cable routing (as seen in the picture) as I await an upgraded sound system en-route, but I do plan to use them to clean up the wiring once everything is set to go.I'd easily buy this desk again if the need arises without question. Highly recommended if you want a no-frills, sturdy desktop table (or for another purpose). It's fantastic!",

Instead I found an online video that was much better. I like building flatpack, so I took my time, and didn't screw things too tight until I was all done and absolutely sure they were right, then I tightened up the screws. I did have to undo a few as I went along, so I recommend doing that.All screws went into proper holes, and not just embedded into wood, so would be easy to disassemble and pit back together again if moving.
