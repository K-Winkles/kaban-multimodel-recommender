With \u00c0 Table, I dive into the magic of France that I've gotten to know intimately living here. I share recipes that offer up the sexy, sparkling charm that is the French meal to others, wherever their homes may be. What can readers learn from the French way of cooking? The rituals and customs around cooking in France have long been romanticized, but that doesn't mean they're not accessible. \u00c0 Table aims to merge the imagined French fantasy with the truth of cooking and eating to create a doable but charming reality. What is your favorite meal to make for yourself? My absolute favorite meal is really a \"snack dinner,\" which sounds much more chic in French: \"ap\u00e9ro d\u00eenatoire.\" On my table it includes Le Grand A\u00efoli surrounded by vegetables for dipping and a tin of sardines. Add a crusty baguette, some olives, maybe a few slices of saucisson, and a good bottle of wine and it's, hands-down, my favorite meal to enjoy.",

I am not a fancy French cook, so was a bit worried that the recipes would be too complicated or the ingredients would be impossible to find. Definitely not the case!I\u2019ve had this cookbook for about a week and I\u2019ve made at least 10 recipes plus quite a few cocktails. I even had a small gathering and cooked exclusively from this book. My friends loved it and have also ordered it!This is completely approachable, with easy to find (or substitute) ingredients, many of which you probably have on hand. The author also gives tips on how repurposing sauces, dressings & leftovers so you aren\u2019t left with a mystery jar in the fridge. And many of the recipes have similar ingredients so you won\u2019t have a mostly full jar of spice gathering dust in the cabinet.The writing is witty and totally inspiring! The pictures will motivate you! Many of these recipes can be made in advance, which is perfect for entertaining. I made the carrot tatin pictured above (I promise, I didn\u2019t decimate the carrots, I used rainbow carrots so the purple ones look charred :)) in the morning and it still looked and tasted great several hours later when my guests arrived.Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "From start to finish, this STUNNING and ELEGANT cookbook displays incredible creative mastery that has beauty, romance and magic layered throughout the pages from start to finish. This book makes you DREAM and gets you excited about the new world that awaits: a world in which we can all gather around a table again, rub elbows with friends and family, eat gorgeous things out of communal dishes, sip on wine for hours and linger on into the night. I'm completely in awe of the stellar aesthetics and impeccable photography, the food styling (done by the author herself!), witty language, the play with shadows and the presence of the female form throughout the book. What I most appreciate is the accurate and vibrant reflection of what modern day Paris looks like around the table (not only classic French, but also gives a fair platform to the myriad of influences (Middle Eastern, Asian, etc) that have made their way into the palates of the French. Each recipe has a \"remarque,\" Rebekah's clever way to introduce a bit of historical context for each cocktail or dish while also adding a personal (and usually hilarious) personal anecdote. Excellent book to have around if you like to entertain and want to add that je ne sais quoi feel and magic into your days and nights! Recommend 100000%.",

We had our sailboat in St Maxime and I had a French boyfriend from Brive la Gaillard (lived there too). That experience changed my entire life. I miss France dearly every day. This cook book has hand selected the perfect recipes to showcase life in France. From aperitif to dessert, Rules included, my favourite part. The thing l learned in France was that the rules of gastronomy are the most important. They are the way to experience life. It has been developed over centuries and they, in my opinion and probably the French as well believe it is perfect. I think this book reflects this in a kind and simple way doesn\u2019t intimidate. Right down to the photography. She has done a wonderful job of capturing la vie en France. I am an avid cook and I look forward to making all the creations and reliving my time abroad. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf77\ud83d\udc8b",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this book and it did not disappoint. In fact, it managed to exceed my already lofty expectations. My husband and I have frequently turned to Rebekah Peppler's previous hit, Ap\u00e9ritif, not just for its stellar (lower ABV) cocktails, but for all of the salty, snacky companion recipes. I had no doubt the recipes in \u00c0 Table would hold up; what I didn't expect was just how much I'd be swept away by the gorgeous photography (another Joann Pai hit) and LOL-inducing (and very thoughtful) commentary. Maybe it's living under lockdown for the majority of the last year, but I read this book cover-to-cover in a single sitting the day I received it, letting myself dream of the days we can freely travel and enjoy the company of others safely again. In the meantime, you can cook and entertain your way through unfussy, approachable Paris life through \u00c0 Table.",

I want to be where she is, drinking what she's drinking, and eating her delicious recipes. There's classic French recipes (of course), but with her own twist -- like Coq au Vermouth -- a riff on Coq au Vin, but Rebekah also branches out showing the type of food you might find at a dinner party in France today. The photos are some of the most gorgeous I've ever seen in a cookbook. Every photo has been so well thought out, from the food, to the light, to the styling. In the short time I've had it it's already been a huge source of inspiration. This cookbook is a must-buy!",
