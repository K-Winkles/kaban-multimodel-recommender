Assembly was very easy, everything is provided to put it together. The table was a little wobbly, so make sure you tighten each area the same amount.

It was a massive headache and my temper kept flaring.It is a VERY small table and chairs, but it fits a small space well. My friend who is 6 feet looks like a giant in the chair, but I, on the other hand, and 5'1\" and it fits pretty well. The table is cheap quality and wobbles but it will do for a college apartment or very small space.",

                "reviewText": "Ok. It\u2019s really cute. The assembly instructions are not in a logical order however. My recommendation, do step 5 first (backrest assembly of chair). Then set the backrest to the side. There is nothing about this step that touches any other step. Then do Step 4 (chair seat plate assembly). Wood plate is predrilled and the wood seat plate doesn\u2019t bend. It\u2019s easier to attach the legs without the metal backside. Then do Step 3 - attach the backrest assembly to the chair plate assembly. The fit will be tight and snug. But nothing that can\u2019t be easily handled. And no need for the backrest top to get scratched up as you try to get the entire chair upside down as you screw it into place which is awkward.Yes it\u2019s doable. I\u2019m disabled and put this chair and table set together alone. As for the table ignore their steps.Attach the wine rack/shelf to the legs loosely and then the table top to the legs securely. Flip it over and add the lower cross sections then tighten the shelf and lower sections.I recommend doing the chairs first so you have a place to sit and rest IF like me, you require rest along the way.Happy assembly!",

                "reviewText": "While the table and chairs were small as I wanted for this area, all is well as long as you don\u2019t lean in the back of a chair to reach something that has fallen to the ground. The chair back is bound to collapse and you will go down with it. Otherwise the quality is fine for the price and they all clean up well. The seats are quite small and a purchase of 2 round 14\u201d cushions goes a long way. Amazons option is quite pricy for this size of cushion, but I\u2019m sure that you can find something suitable for less.. I would just recommend some padding as the seats are certainly hard in their own. A hidden shelf under the table has found to be s great place to hind trays.",
