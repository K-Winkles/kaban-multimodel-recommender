                "reviewText": "We bought two of the same end tables to go next to a new couch. We were going for the mid-century modern look and I think these tables fit nicely. They are good quality, nice wood espresso tone, packaging was well done and protected all pieces (I wish no stryrofoam was used but it was packaged very well). The tables are incredibly easy to put together (wooden dowels and two screws per leg using an allen wrench included in the packaging). The screws fit easily since the threading in the legs were already completed. Though I agree with other reviews, you will either need a mallet or a strong person to push hard. I did one table with a mallet and then my husband was able to push the other one together just using force. I would score this a 9/10 for ease of putting together with only one point off for needing the mallet - the first table took maybe 15-20 minutes to put together and the second one 10-15. I would buy these again and I would recommend them to someone looking for a mid-century modern look.",

I have been looking for a table in this style for some time, and this was the first one I've found that fits exactly. For the low price, I wasn't expecting anything particularly sturdy or long lasting.I was able to assemble it solo without major difficulty... except that the top surface piece I received was faulty. It would not snap to the built-in connectors on the support piece. And, in fact, those connectors ended up pushing up through the surface of the table and damaging it, even though I was following the assembly instructions.I reached out to customer support via email on a weekend, and received a response the same day to send a replacement table top. It arrived about 10 days later, and this one attached properly and easily. I am very satisfied with my completed table.",

                "reviewText": "These tables are the perfect mid century piece! The quality is great and they feel solid. Only one thing I didnt care too much for was the \"pop-in-place\" way the top shelf fits on the base. It was a bit hap hazard and I would have preferred a locking nut. This furniture feels and looks high end for sure. One of the tables arrived with a good size scratch on the top and a chip out of the veneer, but it wasnt enough for me to make a fuss about, as the condition was listed as \"like-new\". I am totally happy with it, and the shade of stain matches the picture shown.",

Not only can you NOT press the shelf down without ruining it, the shelf isn\u2019t even sturdy. It wobbles itself off. Even tried to hammer it and it won\u2019t work. I\u2019m honestly disappointed in this product. I\u2019ve seen its prices range from $90-120 and its lack of usability is not worth that price.I should also mention that after inspecting it some more, there are several scratches throughout the shelf. It gives me the impression that this must have been a used shelf that was sent to me when I was sure ordered a new one.",

With the End Table is setting beside your Lazy Boy Chair approx 11 inches by 8 inches is a waste of space on the far side of the centre piece board holding up the top shelf that you can't get access to. With the suggested modification you have access to all of the end table both top and bottom shelves.",
