It was a snap to assemble, even for someone like me who usually has trouble with these things. It only took me about 15 minutes from emptying the box to a finished table. The instructions consist of only three simple steps. It was the perfect size for my new Denon stereo, and I plan on using the shelves for CD storage. It is very well built and sturdy, and there is no chance of it toppling or collapsing. It fit perfectly in the space I had for it in my living room, and it matches the other dark wood furniture I have. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This little table was exactly what I needed: a short, compact table to use as TV stand (24\" tv). I was pleased with the quality; very sturdy with two shelves. It has an \"industrial\" look, but doesn't look cheap. Very easy to assemble, just make sure the holes on the side piece are lined up the same. Definitely recommend it for the quality. Well packaged too, not a single mark on the top.",

                "reviewText": "LIKE:The product came very well packed, so no damage and no hassle.The look of the table is not an eyesore. For $49.00, I am thankful. Perfect for 6 pairs of work boots.The spacing between shelves is just high enough for ankle-high boots.Sturdy enough to handle the weight of 6 pairs of heavy boots.Like the leveling feet.The shipping box was shockingly small. That is likely a good thing, environmentally speaking.NEUTRAL:Is this a gorgeous table? NO. It is okay. It is also NOT expensive.It doesn't show well in the photos, but all black metal bars come in two pieces. They fit in such a way that the piece remains strong.Assembly was not too hard.The quality is good enough for the piece to function.For the price, it is good enough. I think it could be priced lower and still be a profitable item for the seller. Nonetheless, it is not an expensive table, it DOES do its job, and it is not fair to gripe about it much if you paid $50.00 for it.DO NOT LIKE:The table top comes in two pieces too. It is clear in the photos, so it is not a surprise, but I wish that it was in one piece.Also, I wish that the metal bars were in one piece (for each run).The directions are helpful but lacking. You need to figure it out.Overall, it is not an heirloom, but it will work in situation of necessity.",

Assembly was pretty straightforward and not complicated, which is a plus. I am giving it 3 stars because I needed a small table like this to house my two aerogardens and it definitely delivered in terms of space and aesthetics. It is a very small table though. More ideal for a small college apartment or for decorative use.",
