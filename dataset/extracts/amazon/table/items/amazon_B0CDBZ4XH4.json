It is somewhat small, but very sturdy, well designed, and heavy. It certainly does not look as inexpensive as its price. In my humble opinion, it is an excellent product for its price.",

I did however receive two \u201cR\u201d U shaped pieces, but they are essentially the same part just labeled differently. Took be about 45mins to put together in total because i had the \u201cDs\u201d upside down. If you are using the Apple Fast Chargers then only one will fit at a time. So the only issue is that the outlets are too close but this is a nice bedside stand for your remotes and phone and other small items.",
