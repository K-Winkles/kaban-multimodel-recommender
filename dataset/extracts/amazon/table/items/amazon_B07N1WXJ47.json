                "reviewText": "I use my Ultra model exclusively for my iPad and it works perfectly without giving me a painful neck. As you can see from my photo, I have it angled down and at the maximum height so I can cross my legs, and often use a soft stand that I already owned. That works well for me. With all the height adjustments and the choice of a flat table or angled down, I would think everyone could find a way to hold their device at the correct angle for viewing. I like the way this particular table can easily slide on a rug to fit comfortably close to me, especially with the curved surface on this model. I usually don\u2019t use the slot in the rear for my device, although if I also need a surface for writing, that does work out well. As others have said, it is a bit wobbly, but fine for lighter objects, even if used as a TV tray. I do not use the cup holder since I like the table at an angle. Oh, and I put it together in less than 5 minutes. Altering the angle of the tabletop is very easy, but changing the height required the help of my husband to squeeze the buttons on the legs. Not fancy, but just right for my needs.",

However after I assembled it I discovered that it wasn't as sturdy as I thought it would be! It's still a great design overall and I love the cup holder but it still causes the table to wobble when you put a drink in the drink holder! When I put my laptop on it my laptop wiggles and I can't really adjust the height of the the table itself to the proper height I need when I'm sitting on a couch or if I'm sitting at a desk it does never come to the proper height it's either too high or too low! But it was a really good price and I can see myself using it for other things besides well my laptop!",
