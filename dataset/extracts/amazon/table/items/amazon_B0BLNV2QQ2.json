                "reviewText": "It is pretty nice, esp for the money. Apparently hand made, with some nice hand-carvings on the top.My dislikes were:1) Made out off some cheap wood (allegedly mango wood, not much grain or natural color) .2) The stain they put on it looks horrible. Looks like it is smeared with something unpleasant.Some other reviewers complain it looks cheap.. well, to be fair, it IS cheap.I ended up sanding the whole thing, refinished with teak oil and then sprayed on some black lacquer from a can. Took almost a whole spray can per table, 2 cans did 3. Once the black lacquer dried, gave it a few coats of spar urethane (wipe on poly).Now it looks rather nice. The sprayed on finish comes close to Piano-black. I think is is best to use a solid color, there is not much nice wood grain to show off.I used Rust-Oleum 1905830 11 oz. from HD. It is rather soft, will not stand up to heavy wear, so a glass top or a protective coating of spar urethane may be useful, or just touch it up as needed.If you are willing to do some light refinishing, you will end up with a rather nice end table, for rather reasonable money. See picture of how it looks refinished.I though it would be nice to have some extra weight in the base, (like a bag of buckshot) , but surprisingly it is not very tippy as it is.",
