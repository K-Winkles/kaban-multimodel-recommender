                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Yoobure Nightstand with Charging Station and was really impressed with the quality and functionality of the piece. The nightstand features a large drawer and storage shelf, which provides ample space for storing books, magazines, and other bedside essentials. The rustic design of the nightstand adds a stylish touch to my bedroom decor and fits in perfectly with my other furniture.The charging station feature is incredibly convenient, as it includes both USB ports and outlets. This means that I can easily charge my phone, tablet, and other devices while I sleep without having to worry about finding extra outlets or cords. It's also really handy to have a place to store my devices while they charge, as it keeps my bedside table free of clutter.The drawer slides smoothly and feels very sturdy, and the storage shelf provides a lot of extra space for displaying decor or storing items. The nightstand was easy to assemble and feels like a high-quality piece of furniture that will last for years to come.Overall, I highly recommend the Yoobure Nightstand with Charging Station to anyone looking for a stylish and functional addition to their bedroom or living room. The combination of the charging station, ample storage, and rustic design make this nightstand a great investment that you won't regret.",

                "reviewText": "Very pleased with our purchase. We needed an affordable nightstand for a guest room. This piece was perfect! It is not very big, but neither is our guest room so it fits well. It was easy to assemble. I really appreciate that all components were clearly labeled, and extra hardware was included in case a screw or something gets away from you. I've put together my share of furniture and this has to be one of the easiest I've ever done, with easy to understand diagrams and they even give you a screwdriver so you don't have to go hunting in your toolbox. It seems sturdy and I think will be fine for light use. I really like the charging ports. Excellent value and quality for the price!",

Parts were pretty good quality, and assembly went well with good instructions.The only negative was with the cam bolts. 4 out of 8 of them stripped with little force. Be careful not to overtighten. It shouldn't be a problem. If so, I'll just glue it and screw it. Overall, pretty satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I seldom take the time to write reviews because if a product works or appears as expected, then it has simply done what it promised to do, that part is built into the price. It's like tipping at the counter of a sandwich shop. Why? You're getting full wages already to make the sandwich (looking at you northeastern state Micheal). Anyway, this little table surprised the heck out of me in three ways. First, the quality of the table is not crap. Don't get me wrong, we're not talking pure cherry wood or anything but I expected the cheapest compressed particle board junk. You know, that stuff that the screws would fail to grip into when you've tightened just a tad too far? Not what I got, everything looked great for what it is and it all went together tightly. Which brings me to the second way I was impressed, it was easy to build it. the instructions were embarrassingly simple. Honestly, I was expecting not to be able to understand them. But I figured it's a little table... if I couldn't put this little thing together without the instructions, I really shouldn't be buying it, lol. But the instructions were simple, easy to read/follow, and did the job nicely. The last way this little table impressed me is by how sturdy this little thing came together. Once put together, the little table is pretty darn solid. It does not wobble and it holds the heavier stuff I have placed on it perfectly fine (wanted it for my XBOX series X and Remotes/charge dock). So for the price, it's a great little table. And if you need one like it, pull the trigger, I think you'll be as impressed as I am, or at the very least, you won't get less than what you expected (if your expectations are better than mine were).",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy little nightstand. It took me longer to assemble due to the fact that there are no words in the instructions only pictures to put it together. Besides that it was pretty easy to put together. All of the parts are individually labeled, which made it so much easier. They even send the Phillips screwdriver and the Allen wrench.Unfortunately after spending all of that time putting it together I got to the last step, which was putting the drawer together. The bottom drawer insert isn't cut correctly and is uneven, so it isn't flush making my drawer uneven, which is very disappointing after spending so much time and effort putting it together.I would give it more stars if I could get just the piece of wood to fix the drawer, but that isn't an option on Amazon. I'm not going to take the entire table apart to return it. It isn't worth the money and I need it right away. So paying extra money to have an end table with a drawer was a waste of money. Now I just have one with a cubby, which is frustrating.",
