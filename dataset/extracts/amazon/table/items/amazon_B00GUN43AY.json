                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I put this together myself, I'm almost 9 months pregnant.It was easy to put together. In the instructions it says you need needle nose pliers but I don't see why. Never needed them, everything is put together with an allen wrench which is provided.It's very solid. Doesn't wiggle around, but light enough you can move it by yourself for positioning purposes.The changing pad it comes with isn't super thick, however that doesn't mean it's thin. It's made so the rails are much higher than the pad. It's actually surprisingly plush and I would use it if I didn't already have a curved one. I loved the curved changing pad from my 1st so I'm going to use it again.I'll probably use the pad it came with for downstairs in my home as a 2nd area for changes.TLDR:quality item at a good price. Can't go wrong with it.",

But it\u2019s an easy build if you built this type of furniture before. I kind of wish there were caps to hide the bolts. And there were two barrel nuts in the back that stick out.",

When I got pregnant a second time I wanted our babies to have separate spaces to be changed, so I splurged a bit and got this. Best decision I\u2019ve made! It\u2019s got so much more space than our dresser and has been helpful in keeping our first from gator rolling on our dresser, as she really can\u2019t do that on here. The product seems very sturdy and well-made and we\u2019re super excited to get the matching crib to complete the new nursery set!",
