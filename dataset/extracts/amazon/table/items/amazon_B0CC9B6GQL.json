                "reviewText": "This is a decent console table but I definitely wouldn't pay $100 for it, as Amazon better console tables for the same price (they're bigger and have better features). Tables measurements match what's shown on Amazon at 31.9\"H x 35.4\"W x 11.8\"D. I like the look of the solid black finish, as it goes with my other living room furniture. It states that it has a waterproof finish, which is also accurate but that's also not the greatest thing either, as you can see in the picture showing how well the waterproof finish works, it also shows all the fingerprints. The 2 drawers are NOT wood/fake wood/particleboard, whatever you want to call it but fabric drawers. I don't know why they decided to go this route when Amazon has other console tables that are the same price or cheaper but are bigger size with better features. Even though I'm not very happy about the fabric drawers, at the very least they are a solid fabric drawer if anything else.... I just wish they were bigger because we plan on putting our printer on this table and I wanted to put the toner in the drawers but they don't fit because the drawers are to small.It does say 2 person assembly in the instructions but my husband was able to put this together by himself without any difficulty and within 30 minutes or less. Overall, I like the solid black finish but don't like how easily fingerprint show up, even though it's waterproof. I also wish the fabric drawers were bigger and made of the same material as the rest of the table (not fabric).",
