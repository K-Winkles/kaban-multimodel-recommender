It has not succumbed to water stains from not using coasters yet. Though, we're going to start soon \ud83e\udd23.We use this coffee table in our living room and the bottom shelf holds my various books and textbooks. It definitely holds more then 15 lbs. No issues with bending the wood or breaking. We've had it a couple of months and it's very solid.Do recommend if you need nice furniture for cheap!",

                "reviewText": "The table is nice overall, but has its share of pros and cons.PROS:* Assembly is a breeze. They say 10 minutes; that estimate seems to include five minutes for wine consumption during assembly. :-)* Looks nice. I bought the French Oak Grey/Black, and the color matches very closely to the manufacturer's pictures. (Mine might be half a shade darker.)CONS:* What the manufacturer DOESN'T tell you is that the table can support only 35lbs. I have a 63lb printer. The table holds the printer, but if either one gets bumped hard enough, I'll be picking up printer and table pieces off the floor. The manufacturer describes the table as \"sturdy,\" which I consider to be a gross misrepresentation of the table.* The table comes packaged in thin, flimsy styrofoam, which is not a problem for table (the parts are suitably protected during shipping) but is a HUGE problem for you when you unpack the table -- the styrofoam is the kind that breaks apart easily, and it's electrostatically charged\u26a1, which means all these little styrofoam bits attach themselves to EVERYTHING -- you, the table parts, the rug, the dog, your spouse -- AND YOU CAN'T GET THEM OFF. I ended up putting the table parts in the shower before attempting assembly, just to get all of the styrofoam pieces off. I recommend opening and assembling this table outside in the rain. ;-)If the weight limit is not a problem for you, and you don't mind getting the styrofoam everywhere, then it's a pretty nice table at a great price.",
