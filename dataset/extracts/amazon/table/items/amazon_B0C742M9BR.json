We don't have a particularly large room and it's nice to have smaller bedside stands. I wanted to go with a set that was mostly metal, since they're usually more sturdy and I thought that the USB and plugs built in were a nice touch. They were very easy to put together, I have no complaints. It took me about 20 minutes for each table. They seem nice and sturdy and look fine next to our bed. For the price, it's great!",
