                "reviewText": "This is an inexpensive nightstand, and the wood pattern is a nice pattern but still doesn't look real, but it was very easy to assemble with clear instructive images, and is very sturdy once put together since the frame is metal. I got it for my son's bedroom, and it will serve its purpose well and be a means of additional organization for him. The charging station works well, and it's nice that the back of the table has a hole that the cord that plugs into the wall feeds through, as it makes it more neat. likewise, since the charging station is on the second shelf, not the top, you can plug things in down there, keep the cords in the back and out of the way, and just have them come up from the back over the top shelf so that most of the cord is not visible. Little features such as this make for a neater looking setup. It comes with the tools to put it together, except that you will need a small screwdriver to attach the magnet that catches the door. All of the drilled holes are well aligned so that everything matches up well with no gaps or anything once you're done. It's not high end, but it is attractive and does its job well, and I would definitely recommend this little table for a teen's bedroom or as a side table as a part of a very casual setup.",
