I will say to measure beforehand if you want to option to angle it over your bed because it\u2019s not super tall which is really the only downside. The charging ports are truly a game changer though! My two biggest concerns beforehand was being about trying to fit my bulkier chargers and the plug-ins falling out at the slightest pull which neither of those are an issue at all which is why I love this on so much! There is a lot of spacing between the two plug ins and they are secure in the outlets.",

I bought the 6mx15mm. 6mm stem is perfect!!!! Now the table rolls around amazingly. The ones that come with don't roll great when you have things in the table and need to constantly move it. They seemed ok for rolling back and forth but side to side on a flat hard rug....not so much. Buy the table and buy new wheels!!!!",

It is so convenient to have this table plugged into an outlet and then have outlets and USB ports in a convenient spot to use when working or just relaxing on the porch. A laptop fits perfectly on the table and the wheels make it easy to move around. The C shape allows it to be tucked away as a side table when not needed for work. Very happy with this purchase.",

It's lightweight so not a bulky pain to move around when needed. It's got a shelf and a basket, a compartment when you lift the top, and somewhere to plug my phone in, so really what more could I need?",
