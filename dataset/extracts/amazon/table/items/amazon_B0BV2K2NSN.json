Hardest part of assembly for me was putting the top on because I secured it to wall (cat proof) before putting top on. Wasn't sure how I was going to secure it. Finally came up with velcro straps screwed into the stud. It's perfect for my bedside and kitty loves the view. Got good deal on Black Friday. Would buy again. Would be nice if it came with hardware to secure to wall.",
