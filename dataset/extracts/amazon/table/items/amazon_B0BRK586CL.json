                "reviewText": "I purchased this table in a rush to prepare for Thanksgiving as I was hosting this year and was afraid that I didn't have enough seats. My foyer has always been a large empty room and I wanted to add something to give it a more homey feeling but also double for seats so I decided to scope Amazon and find a cute table and chair set. I came across lots of small unstable looking tables or tiny chairs. My family are quite tall and some are stocky so I needed a set that could withstand use. I came across this table which matched my decor well and the legs were quite sturdy. I really enjoyed planning how to decorate the table as it was large enough to hold a small decoration and be able to eat at the table. It was easy to build even for a novice like me and it came very well packaged. The best thing about this table is that it is very sturdy, doesn't seem like it will easily crack under pressure. It's a decent size bar table and goes well with standard sized bar chairs or stools. When all the chairs were taken, my husband and I got to sneak away and sit at this table to eat. It was definitely worth the last minute purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 3 of these for a party I hosted recently. I was going to rent tables, but buying these was cheaper! They work great with or without bar stools as they are at standing height. And they took less than 10 minutes to assemble.They were very sturdy and have adjustable feet if your floor isn\u2019t flat. They looked great (and just like the photo) with my modern farmhouse decor, and I even got several compliments about them. Didn\u2019t even need tablecloths!",
