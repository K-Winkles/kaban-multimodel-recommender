                "reviewText": "When screwing the legs onto the desk there are two areas in particular (1 on each side) where they screw won\u2019t align with the hole in the desk. I tried so many times to get it to attach and screw; and it didn\u2019t work. I ended up going in my old tool box and finding a slightly longer screw which worked. So keep in mind to have atleast 2 back up screws slightly longer in length or just a heads that you will need to go get atleast 2 different screws. I bought 2 desks so I thankfully had 4 extra screws in my toolbox. Otherwise 1st desk is nice and sturdy. The second desk is as well but I did notice cracks in the desk upon opening but my kid refused to allow me to return it bc he wanted it up immediately.",
