I enveloped it with a pillow cover that I got with the bed sheet set, so, it now looks like an extension of my bed. I was able to adjust the height to bring it just above my mattress and lock it in that position. It's cool that I can rotate it, if needed. Am planning to attach headset holder and a few other things to optimize the space. Very impressed overall.",

                "reviewText": "I got rid of my nightstand because my room was getting to be a little too crowded. This was perfect. I just need somewhere to put my glasses and my phone. Don\u2019t take up any space on the floor and it works for us very well. You can literally put it anywhere on your bedframe. This is also good for someone who has a bunkbed and needs a flat surface to put something. My daughter keeps asking for it for her bunkbed because she likes to take water to bed, but it keeps spilling into her bed. I might have to get her a second one.",
