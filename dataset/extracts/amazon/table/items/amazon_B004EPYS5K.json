Durable, while being easy to move around, looks very nice in our room, and personally I think the size is perfect. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like the color but I do!",

It did arrive with some bent pieces as well as cracked but I was still able to assemble and hide those defective areas. The directions could be clearer so thankfully I am handy and can figure it out without having to read them. We shall see the longevity of the table but for now, it\u2019s not bad.",
