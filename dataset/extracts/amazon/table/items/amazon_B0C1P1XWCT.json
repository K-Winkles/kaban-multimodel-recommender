It was easy enough to put together, all the pieces were labeled, the hardware was packaged neatly, and the directions were simple. My only complaint is that the drawers are cloth - like those collapsible cube bins everyone has. It's a collapsible cloth drawer, with a wooden front and a plastic handle.Overall - great table, great price. Just wish the drawers were solid wood.",
