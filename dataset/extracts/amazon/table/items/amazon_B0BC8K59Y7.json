The instructions were easy enough to understand, the only fiddle part was the actual lid and closing things. I put those on backwards because by the end it seemed self explanatory so I didn't read what to look for. Its sturdy, it looks nice, the lid opens and closes gently so there's no slamming shut. If you want a storage coffee table but you are on a tighter budget, from one thrifty person to another, I recommend this table highly.",

My only complaint is that the top of the table springs out easily but putting it back in place you would need to have it on carpet because the top of the table is heavier than the bottom so when you push the table top back down it slides and you can hear the spring. Other than that it wasn\u2019t too expensive and it looks nice and sturdier than most cheap Amazon finds",
