                "reviewText": "I bought these to serve two purposes.One: When I have multiple musicians or a whole band in the studio, this makes everyone a little more comfortable. Everybody gets a table to put a drink on, their cell phone, and some prefer it to a music stand. For that purpose it has been appreciated. Almost a luxury for some of the folks I work with.Two: I also got it so visiting friends and family members can eat dinner in the living room like the rest of us. We usually watch TV while we eat on the couch. Now everyone has their own side table or dining tray when they\u2019re visiting.They were not difficult to assemble and they look as classy as I imagine a folding table can. Great to have around and surprisingly stable.They are also relatively dog-safe. I find for our medium to large dogs a cup is more likely to get knocked over by a wagging tail than the table itself getting toppled. None of the tables have been knocked over yet in spite of the presence of a VERY energetic, fifty-pound, psycho-puppy.",

Les tables sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 assembl\u00e9es, il faut simplement monter le support, ce qui m\u2019a pris moins de 10 minutes. Les vis et la cl\u00e9 Allen sont fournies.La finition est bonne, et chaque table mesure 48cm de long x 38cm de large ; le plan est lisse et facile \u00e0 nettoyer. La hauteur de 66cm permet de manger dans de bonnes conditions. Je mesure 1,72m et mes jambes passent sans probl\u00e8me sous le plan.Un fois rabattue, la table est plate et n\u2019occupe pas de place. Les pieds sont moyennement solides mais jouent leur r\u00f4le. Le support des 4 tables est pratique mais je trouve qu\u2019il manque de stabilit\u00e9.Dans le carton, ces tables Amazon Basics \u00e9taient bien prot\u00e9g\u00e9es et elles sont arriv\u00e9es chez moi en parfait \u00e9tat.Points positifs :+ 4 tables pr\u00e9mont\u00e9es+ Peu encombrantes+ Bonne finition+ Abordable+ Look sympaPoints n\u00e9gatifs :- Manque de stabilit\u00e9 du supportEn conclusion, ce lot de 4 tables Amazon Basics est pratique et bien pens\u00e9. Les tables sont bien finies et le tarif est accessible (80\u20ac environ). Je les recommande.",
