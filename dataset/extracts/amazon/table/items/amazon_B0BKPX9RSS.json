                "reviewText": "This thing is great. It works great for eating dinner at the couch and using a mouse and keyboard if you have a pc hooked up to your TV.I don\u2019t know about the other reviews saying this was difficult to put together, I would say they are clearly wrong. The instructions are super clear and the only reason I could see someone struggling is if they have never successfully put together any furniture in their life. It\u2019s a very simple and straightforward design.If put together correctly and making sure all the nuts and bolts are tight, this table feels very sturdy. I would recommend this table to anyone who is looking for something of this nature.",

                "reviewText": "Love this coffee table. Instructions were easy to follow. Lots of storage space, easy to move nice color. Wish I had purchased this several years ago.It's recommended to have 2 people to assemble this, however, I was able to put ot together myself in about 45 minutes I did get the top lid backwards and had to remove that one and turn it around. Thats the part where 2 people would have really helped, but i was finally able to get it righted, so double check the fit before you tighten all the screws.Two tools are provided. Wrench and small Phillips screwdriver. If you have access to an electric screwdriver, definitely use that one.The top lid/cover seems like it could hold a decent weight (1/2\" solid wood) The inner shelf (flimsy board like material <1/4\" )shouldn't be used for heavier items though.",

Of course, not everyone has another person to do this with.I assembled it alone to the best of my ability, followed the instructions, and the table isn\u2019t very sturdy. It wobbles a bit side to side and I tried fixing this before moving forward to the next steps and nothing made it more secure.I\u2019m thinking maybe some wood glue where there\u2019s some gaps may help, but I haven\u2019t done so yet.On the plus side they sent 4 extra of each tool I\u2019d need.It\u2019s a nice looking table, and the lift is great. However, save your money and get something sturdier and invite a friend or get help with assembly for sure if you do get this table.Update: it broke. Lol",
