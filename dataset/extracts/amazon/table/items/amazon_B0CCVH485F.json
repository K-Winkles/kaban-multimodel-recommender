                "reviewText": "The instructions were very unclear. The premarked locations for installing the top of the table were completely wrong, resulting in additional drill holes. But the worst offense was the packaging. The plastic straps used to seal the box cut through the box and cut into a wooden panel. Luckily it was a bottom panel and easily hidden. Overall the product is nice once you can get it put together.",

It won't close properly and it's very difficult to open. One of the pieces even put a hole through part of the table. We glued it back together the best we could. It looks nice and goes with our aesthetic, but it is a regret buy",
