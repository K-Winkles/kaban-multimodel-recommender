                "reviewText": "UPDATE - I'd like to note that the company reached out to me after reading my review, asking what they could do to make my purchase experience a more positive one. They offered to send me a new replacement outlet part at no cost. I installed the new outlet into the stand once it arrived and it is a bit better (less tight) than the original one.Original review - I like the table, it works well for small, tight spaces. It's stable and relatively strong and it has a nice appearance.However, I do have one big complaint - the outlets are very tight. Whenever I was try and unplug any electrical charger, I have to tank on it very hard to get it out. Given that this is happening under the table top, more often than not I slam my hand into the underside of the table hurting it (even when trying to be careful). This is a huge drawback and it's already driving me crazy just a few weeks into owning the table.We did, btw, install casters on the leg bottoms in order to allow it to slide more easily (an idea I took from another reviewer). The casters install really easily if you buy stem ones that insert right into the existing feet holes.",

Additionally, the plug and USB were helpful for charging our phones or for plugging in my wife's heated blanket! Very happy with this",
