It also blends in to the stretchable black tablecloth very well for a professional appearance. The table legs are sturdy black powder-coated pipe steel. They are slightly on the stiff side, but this also means that the table won't easily collapse. The table assembles very easily. Releasing the catches and two quick, firm knocks is all it takes to break down the table. I'm very happy with this table and know I'll be getting a lot of use out of it.",

I really like these tables and not sure where the problem is originating from. In 2 instances, the boxes were damaged, and the table. In the 3rd instance, box was fine, but table had damage. I actually kept one table that was a replacement for one that ended up at the incorrect address. Small amount of damage, but not super noticeable. I\u2019ll be using these for crafts/sewing. I will continue to use this product, but won\u2019t order on-line anymore unfortunately. For how much these tables cost, I will buy in local stores. Again, GREAT product, but somewhere there is a huge problem from assembly line to delivery!",

Nicely open beneath to allow legs as people sit there (vs. some folding tables you can find). The white color is great as it allows small objects to be easily seen (not sure if the black surface would be as good in that regard). I don't see myself folding this up anytime soon, but if I needed to it's nice to know that I could fold it away for storage.Half a star off for the fact that the white color (which I got) is more expensive than the black. Seriously, basic colors shouldn't be hard to supply or worth a price difference...",
