Please note that these end tables are intended to be for a bit of a smaller space, which is what I was looking for. So make sure to check the measurements of the space you are trying to place them in!",

I don't find that very attractive.When I contacted the vendor they responded with, \"I am so sorry for that, and maybe its a mistake to us. And we have improved this product without the srewhole. But maybe our warehouse place a few of end table with srewhole by mistake, so we can not make sure that if you will get a new end table without screwhole. So I hope that you can accept some refund for $3 or more if there are not other problems to the end table. Looking forward to your reply, have a nice day.\"There are so many positive reviews and yet no one is bothered by the screw showing on top? It would be OK if the photo showed that, but clearly it does not. I would have thought twice if the photo showed what it really looks like on top.",

All tools needed were included! Plugged them in, and the USB ports are decent quality, as well, the power port. Up close the finish is rather cheap looking, but from a distance, they look fine. It is on the small side, but that is perfect for us. It is rather sturdy and the fastenings are decent. Adjustable rubber feet allow leveling of the table top. For the price, I thought worth every penny. I will be buying another set for the kids room. If you are looking for an economical nightstand set, this is your choice.
