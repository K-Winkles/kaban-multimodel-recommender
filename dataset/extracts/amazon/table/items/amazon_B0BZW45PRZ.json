Beautiful - fit close to my couch.Assembly Instructions could be much better.The listed underneath height (meaning the clearance you would have to fit above a couch arm) are a bit misleading. The stated measurement is to the BOTTOM OF THE WOOD not to the bottom of the metal arm that is secured to the bottom of the wood top. Therefore, it did not fit above the arm of my sofa arm. Went to Home Depot to get taller screw-in feet. (Picture #3)Otherwise, great table!",
