                "reviewText": "I have only positive things to say about these. Well built, well packaged, instructions clear, parts labelled perfectly, even a bag of spare hardware. Only thing to be aware of is size. The size in the description is absolutely accurate, just take note of it and measure out what that really looks like in your room. Once you\u2019ve got a lamp on these, you might get a glass of water and a phone on the top shelf, but that\u2019s about it. Luckily you\u2019ve got two other levels to put things on and a drawer. In my case, it\u2019s fine because more space just means more clutter for me lol.",

                "reviewText": "These are nice little tables with great additional features, but about $50 a piece for these seems a little too high for the size and materials used. The drawer with the handle is fabric like material.I do like the lights and built in outlets and think they're a great option for those who may not be able to routinely lean over to reach a standard wall outlet. To me the red light is easiest on the eyes in low light settings. The weight is also low, making these easy to pick up and move.Assembly was simple and I built both at the same time. Both arrived in the same box and it's easier to assemble if you sort/group the pieces in order.",

They should both be plugged in before turning the lights on or it's a pain to sync them. Both remotes work on both lights so you can't just turn one on and off.Easy to assemble if you have half a brain and all the pieces are there \ud83d\ude01",

They were easy to put together the instructions were very clear for anyone wondering yes the drawer is like a fabric product but I have three more dressers with the same type of drawers so this works for me.The drawer is a nice size and then you have the top and bottom to place things on. The convenience of the outlets is great also. The ONLY problem I have is that the lights tend to turn on by themselves and sometimes it\u2019s just one side so if I hit the power button the one that\u2019s on goes off but then the other one turns on which forces me to unplug the one that is off and then turn off the other one.Overall though they are nice sturdy little nightstands and are lightweight for easy moving",
