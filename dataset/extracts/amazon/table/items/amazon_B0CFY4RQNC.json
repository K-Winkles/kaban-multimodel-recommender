                "reviewText": "I was impressed at how nice this looks, and how sturdy it feels, definitely not flimsy like some self assembled furniture can be.This was something we really needed as we were recharging various things on a kitchen countertop.All the outlets, USB and regular plugs, work as expected.The light underneath the top shelf works well, it is not super bright but bright enough for it's purpose, it's not meant to be a floodlight, but it gives enough light to see what's on the shelf beneath.It was easy to assemble, just pay attention to the directions.I assembled it one day, then the next day I noticed the sticky pads used to hold wires in place underneath the top shelf did not hold, the room I have it in is not humid or hot so it's not due to that. They had 2 small plastic clamps (screwed in) for the LED strip itself so that was not affected, perhaps they should have used screwed in clamps for the wiring also instead of sticky pads (see included photos). Now I did not think that that by itself was enough to take off a star because the table is otherwise so very well made, maybe I would take off 1/4 star. I will have to check around and see if I have some extra wire clamps with small screws somewhere and redo those wires with that instead.Aside from that one very minor issue I mentioned I think this is an excellent table and glad we got it !",

Enjoy the two outlets and the two USB A ports in the front to only take up one plug outlet on the wall. The lights are great for nightlight. Comes with remote for the lights. The center shelf can be mounted in one of two different positions allowing for more room on the bottom shelf of on the center shelf. Great little nightstand.",

However, we have a space twice it's size if we keep the floor lamp, or four times the space if we don't. The interesting thing about this end table is the LED lights. We are enjoying them, however, the instructions were not clear on how to install the LED lights. We used the wrong brackets and they fell down every day just like the cables. We fixed the LED lights with clear boxing tape, but the cables are too heavy to keep up. However, it is sturdy and it looks good. And I like the lights.",
