                "reviewText": "This is NOT the desk I was promised! The legs are flimsy and have a footprint 30% smaller than the desk top, making it top heavy and tip-able! The desktop is thing and NOT AT ALL the heavy duty desk depicted in the pictures! This desk is A CRAPPY CARD TABLE - not a replacement for a real desk. I'm upset that AZ allows this kind of bait n switch to happen so often. 4 out of 5 things I order I have to return because of some kind of deception.",

Although, I don't think he has folded it up at all yet. He uses it as a desk, nightstand and t.v tray! Very happy with this purchase.",
