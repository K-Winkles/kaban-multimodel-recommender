                "reviewText": "UPDATE *****:GreenForest went out of its way to make the situation right; and stayed in contact with me the whole time (most companies won\u2019t do this). They didn\u2019t have replacements for Part-C, so they just sent me another table entirely, and it arrived quickly. The replacement table is nearly perfect. The table is sturdy enough to support a full, good-sized mini-fridge (which is what I bought it for), and the bottom shelf is also handy. The instructions are clear and straightforward, too. However you will need 2 people or else another support when first putting on the side panels, due to the weight of the metal legs.OLD REVIEW:There is a lot of questionable design and quality assurance problems with this table. The plastic screw grommets do not fit snugly into the lower shelf\u2019s drilled holes (will fall out frequently when trying to insert the wood screws; a good idea would be to have a second person hold another Phillips head against the top of the grommet), and some holes were still packed with loose wood chips, blocking the grommet entirely (you\u2019ll need a very small flat head to get them dislodged).But the worst part was that the screw-in rubber feet had shoddy threading and 2 of them would not fit into the bottom legs, I confirmed this by switching them to other legs and those 2 would not fit in any leg before being jammed askew half way down. I managed to brute force 1 of them with a pair of pliers (and a ton of effort), but the last one wouldn\u2019t even screw after the rubber head just started turning independently of the screw head.I hope the manufacturer reads this review and promptly sends replacement rubber feet, and then puts more funding behind quality assurance in the future. My table remains unusable and very unstable until then.",

                "reviewText": "After utilizing a TV tray for a decade in my computer room for my mouse and SiriusXM boombox, I figured it was time to get a larger surface and spread out a little. I also wanted to upgrade to a new wireless router. As the new router was larger than my previous router, I knew I would have to set it on a table/shelf as it would not fit in the cubby on my computer desk as the old one did. This table was the perfect option for me. I can still keep my SiriusXM boombox on the top level, and I was also able to get a much larger gaming mouse pad. The lower shelf is perfect for the new wireless router. I also bought a laptop cooling fan to set the router on. Both are on the lower shelf with plenty of room to spare. The lower shelf stays within the legs of the table, the upper level shelf overhangs the frame by a few inches on all sides.I am not the most mechanical person there is, but I was able to get the table fully and correctly assembled in around half an hour. I am sure those that have a knack for assembly probably could have done it faster, but this is my only knock on the product: I wish it was just a little bit less time consuming to assemble. However, overall, this table met all of my needs, looks great, and I feel it has amazing value and quality for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The product was perfect for my needs. It will be my chess table as a standard tournament-sized chessboard is about 20\"x20\". But you want a little extra to place captured pieces. So this just right. A couple of tips for powered screwdriver users: 1. Use a light touch and \"blip\" the driver rather than full-on drive the screws; those screws ultimately mount into plastic end pieces you insert into the pre-drilled holes. So there is no actually sinking the screws into particle board. I found it best to hand-tighten the last final turn or two. 2. The angled cross-bars interfere with driving the bolts used to mount the top to the frame. Ideally, you'd want to use an angled rachet or short-handled hand driver. I made my electric screwdriver do the job, but that's because I don't intend to ever disassemble it. So I don't care if the bolt heads got a little stripped in the process. If you are looking for a reliable, easy-to-assemble 24\"x24\" side table this is by far the best one on Amazon!",
