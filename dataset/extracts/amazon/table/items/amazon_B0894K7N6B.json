Attractive, well made, easy/assembled, sturdy, right out of the box, advertised as it it described. Handy for the holidays, yard sales, extra space, exhibits, lemonade stands, camping and picnicking, registration tables, remote work, a thousand other uses. Pulled it out of the box and there it was. Weighs about 20 lbs, but I was able to maneuver it and set it up. Will work on a standard luggage rack, dolly or or cart. Just a terrific buy all around. Folds flat using a spring loaded mechanism.

Ripiegato sta facilmente in piedi appoggiato da un lato; non \u00e8 molto leggero negli spostamenti, ma \u00e8 il prezzo che si paga per avere una stabilit\u00e0 dell'oggetto (le gambe sono robuste e montante con precisione).
