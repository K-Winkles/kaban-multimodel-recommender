In order to maintain the overall stability, I removed another peg on that was on the same side. This does make it's balance worse than it should be. I personally don't mind as the table doesn't move around much and mainly stays in the same spot. But it is still something to keep in mind.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my husband as he really needed a small table to put his cup or laptop while in his recliner. He didn't want an actual side table since that takes up room. This was perfect for that reason.He set it up in less than 20 minutes and had no issues at all. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and all the parts were accounted for.Once built, this little table looks very nice while being unobtrusive. It's easy to move away from the chair, and fits perfectly over the arm rest when he wants to use it.It is a wee bit wobbly on the carpet which is to be expected. I have a feeling it would be more stable on a hard floor. Just in case out tornado toddler bumps it, we use rubber coasters to keep his coffee from spilling or sliding.The table seems strong and has no problem holding his laptop. I love how this one has outlets. I have a larger c-table in a similar color that I wish had outlets too. Although mine is more stable on the carpet, but it is heavier and twice the size so has more stability.Overall this looks very nice, is good quality and works well for what we use it for.",

                "reviewText": "This little thing is so convenient. I keep it next to my spot on the couch and I no longer have to get up as much because my little table is right there holding all my stuff and barely taking up any space. I love that I can easily reach and access the charging ports. It\u2019s the best feature. I can plug in my nail salon stuff, light, apple devices, fan, glue gun, and other endless possibilities. It\u2019s sturdy for a little table and was really easy to assemble. This is a must-have little table and it definitely gets 5 stars from me.",

                "reviewText": "The c-shaped bottom frame, rather than the closed square bottom frame was really important to me because the couch I plan to use this with has really wide feet. I have another table similar to this, but to use it at that couch, I had to lift the couch and have to put the feet inside of the square - so I can't move the table much. With this c-shaped bottom frame, I can reposition it easily as needed. I can use it as a side table, or I can very easily move it to be in front of me.I don't care for the side pockets and was happy to see that they are detachable. A flat plug would have been much more versatile than a standard plug. While the power cord was long enough for me, the location of the outlet it would go to is in a tight spot, so the protrusion of a standard plug is annoying. Instead, I use short surge protector with a flat plug. The two power outlets along with two USB outlets is generous given the size of the table. I do wish that they, themselves, were surge protectors.I removed the 4 feet because I didn't like the little bit of height that it added and the carpeted floor it's on is level enough for me not to have to deal with wobbling.I was able to put it together easily and it seems sturdy. I will be buying another to replace the other one I'd been using. This one is so much better.",
