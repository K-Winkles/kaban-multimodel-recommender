                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ODK 63-inch Super Large Computer Writing Desk for my home office, and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This desk offers a perfect blend of aesthetics, functionality, and convenience, making it an ideal choice for both gaming and professional work.Assembly:The assembly process was a breeze, taking me approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The instructions provided were crystal clear, with parts well-marked using both letters and numbers. This made it easy to identify and match the components, ensuring a smooth assembly experience. I appreciated the inclusion of one extra piece for each screw and an additional foot pad, showcasing the manufacturer's attention to detail.Design:The vintage design of the desk caught my eye, and I must say it looks even better in person. The color options available are a nice touch, allowing customers to choose a style that suits their preferences. The desk is spacious, providing plenty of room for a dual-monitor setup, and it exudes a sturdy and reliable build.Functionality:One standout feature is the convenient storage bag on the side, offering a handy solution for keeping essentials within arm's reach. The addition of a headphone hook is a thoughtful touch, keeping my workspace organized and clutter-free. The desk's overall quality is evident, and it provides a stable platform for both work and gaming. The ODK 63-inch Super Large Computer Writing Desk exceeded my expectations in terms of design, ease of assembly, and functionality. It's a fantastic investment for anyone looking to upgrade their home office or gaming setup. The vintage aesthetic, combined with practical features like the storage bag and headphone hook, make this desk a five-star choice in my book. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and stylish workspace.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great desk. Easy to assemble and take apart, sturdy, and the bag + hook are amazing additions. My only complaint is that, while I got the 63\u201d desk and it\u2019s the perfect length, it\u2019s a very shallow desk. If it were maybe 6\u201d deeper, it would be perfect. As of right now, having my work laptop and monitor on the desk leaves me with my laptop hanging off the desk. I\u2019ve always used XL mouse pads and when I put that on this desk, my monitor is half on the mouse pad and wobbles because of it. I don\u2019t really NEED to have an XL and luckily my company gave me a normal sized one, but it\u2019s an issue that could be easily solved with more depth. Overall, I don\u2019t regret this purchase since it\u2019s just my WFH desk, but it would be nice if it were bigger. I\u2019d definitely recommend if all you have is a laptop, but I\u2019m iffy if you have monitors and no monitor arm for them.",

                "reviewText": "Does it have all the bells and whistles? No, but it has much more than some at half the price. In addition to those little touches like the side hook and collapsible organizer, everything else from packaging to the quality of material and even assembly were easy and stress free. The legs of the table are a thin metal making them lightweight and more modern, the tabletop is clearly cheaper material with a painted varnish in the gray that I chose, but it still feels nice and sturdy, as individual pieces and once they're all put together.The box came and actually showed the best way to unpack, inside it was packed well to the point where even though I used the box cutter to open it, I did not have to worry about scratching the table surface. I unpacked everything, the instructions were there And we're very straightforward. The pictures said everything it had the list of things that we needed laid out, And because of the easy way everything was laid out and explained, I had this put together in 35 minutes (though probably would have been 25 had on it been constantly distracted by my nosy dog lol).I had to pick this up and move it to the room it was going in (in part because there's no room to build it in that room), but the desk was lightweight but still sturdy and fit perfectly in the space I needed. I haven't piled anything heavy on the desk yet, so I can't speak to durability and the promised weight of what I believe was 110lb that it's supposed to be able to hold, but it feels really solid and it looks really nice in the space I chose. I don't know if I'll ever actually end up testing out the weight considering what I plan on using this desk for, but I think it's worth the price for sure, I think I paid $50 and it's a much better quality than some stuff I bought here on Amazon for $20-$40 more. There's definitely nicer things on Amazon, but between how sleek and modern it looks, the price and, depending on what you're using it for, I think this is well worth the choice.",

The first time I ordered, the desk arrived damaged, but I believe that\u2019s the mail carriers fault. Customer service reached out almost immediately and sent me a replacement desk. They were super helpful, and the second desk (shown in the last 3 pictures) arrived double boxed, clean and nicely packaged. There is no damage and I am so happy that I now have a beautiful desk for my space! The desk is pretty good quality and super easy to build. All and all it was a good purchase, I would definitely order from the company again. And I highly recommend their customer service and efforts to make things right, super happy!",
