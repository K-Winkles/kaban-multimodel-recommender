                "reviewText": "This table tuned out to be a great buy. The price was very reasonable. It was very easy to put together. I was nervous when the box arrived because it was so small and I couldn\u2019t figure out how the long table I had ordered would fit in there. But, each long piece was actually smaller pieces that connected together easily. And it still looked very nice once put together. I would buy this again and would buy other things from the company based on this item. The only reason that i didn\u2019t give it 5 stars was because 1. there were two support pieces that were missing and no way to contact the seller to ask for them to be sent. My only option was to return the whole item and wait for another one. However the table was plenty sturdy without them, and 2. Although the box included the tools needed to put the table together, one of the tools was incorrect and did not work and I had to find and utilize something else to make it work. Regardless of those two minor issues, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this product if you need a nice, modern looking console table and you are on a tight budget!",

                "reviewText": "I was 95% done with assembly when I discovered a missing pre-drilled and threaded hole in one of the very last pieces to complete assembly of the console. The hole was to secure a corner brace (see pic) Instructions were clear enough, and assembly fairly easy, but it still took the better part of an hour to get to Step #8. But there are a multitude of small bolts, screws and metal pieces.Because the supporting structure is entirely black metal, it wasn't immediately obvious there were any \"missing\" holes. It never dawned on me to check each and every part before assembling to make sure all holes were where they were supposed to be. Up until the very end, everything went together fairly smoothly. So frustrating to hit that snag.I contacted Amazon and initially was told by an agent \"no worries!\" They would send a replacement with no need to return the 95% completed - but defective - unit I'd been shipped. Not so fast! Moments later an email from AMZ dropped in my inbox with return instructions. I again contacted AMZ. This time I'm told, sorry, you were misinformed. If I didn't return the defective unit I'd have to pay for a replacement.So cancelled the replacement before it shipped. No way was I about to disassemble and repackage all those pieces. Disappointed, first, with seller's \"quality control\" in manufacturing, and second, with Amazon's about face on making this right.",
