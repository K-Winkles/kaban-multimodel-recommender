                "reviewText": "The product arrived well-packaged and in good shape. A few of the pieces were not labeled so I had to ID them from the diagrams on the single-sheet (front and back) directions. The directions were diagrams only, and sometimes it was a bit difficult to tell where the arrows were pointing.It took me about 30 minutes to assemble, after laying out the pieces and reviewing the diagrams.Full disclosure, I work methodically and frequently review the instructions. I used to be one of those \"I'll look at the directions if I can't figure something out\" but after having to take apart one too many of this type of furniture, I changed my process! It takes more time this way, but there's much less frustration and the shouting of colorful metaphors, not to mention the potential to strip a screw or something.One of the nuts had bad threads and I struggled with getting it to work with the little wrench they provide, until I finally got fed up and used my needle-nose pliers to finish the job. Everything else went smoothly.The finished product is nice-looking but I wouldn't put heavy items on the tray. The wire on the baskets also is on the thin side. I like that 2 of the casters have brakes on them. Not sure I would pay the asking price but I'd go for a nice sale price.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a nifty little table! I love that it\u2019s on wheels, and 2 out of the 4 have locks on them. It\u2019s surprisingly sturdy for being put together in a half hour. I like that it has adjustable height also, that\u2019s a huge perk. It was rather easy to put together with the instruction sheet and came with a few extra screws in case they get misplaced. I really like the finish of the wood surface top. It\u2019s a grayish wood laminate, and looks attractive with my other gray furniture. I recommend this side table! It fits a laptop (without mouse pad) or a plate and cup, etc. so it\u2019s really handy to have around, especially for kids or elders or anyone who needs something like this. Plus it\u2019s not ugly! You can easily take the top part off for easy storage too, just don\u2019t misplace those screws when you store it. I like to tape a zipper baggie (containing the screws or small parts, etc.) to the surface (painters tape will hold but doesn\u2019t damage the surface!) so I won\u2019t lose any small parts when storing something like this!",

                "reviewText": "We picked this up to use as a portable table and as a stand for a laptop while working remotely.Assembly is easy. The table assembles into two L shaped pieces. Each L is multiple pieces that bolt together. The directions are very clear, and this doesn't take long to assemble. The top wood is mounted with 2 screws and 4 screws into embedded nuts. There is only one way to assemble the top, so if you damage it you will not be able to flip the top over. Do not overtightened anything or you can deform the tubes.The two Ls simply slide together and the height is adjustable. Two thumb screws secure the height. That is a concern as the metal screws will likely scuff up the paint on the upper tubes eventually.As a last note, don't allow water to stand on this. It can delaminate if water gets under the laminate. The laminate is high def and textured, however.If anything goes wrong, I'll update this review.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This table is fantastic. I've been looking for something like this since the summer, and it's just brilliant. It was relatively easy to assemble. I assembled it in about 45 minutes, I think, and I even did something wrong and had to redo a part.The directions are OK to follow; they are not the worst flashback directions I've ever seen, not the best. The only thing is it's a little clunky to adjust right now. Granted, I've only had it open and set up for about 24 hours, so it'll probably get more accessible to go up and down with time, but right now, it's a little stiff.It's a good size, and my 15 laptop fits on it well. The basket on the bottom can hold a medium-sized garbage can. ( At least, I think this is medium-sized) don't use the wrench it comes with. Just get a real wrench. Just trust me. Wrenches like that are useless.The box isn't marked on the outside, so I had it in a more significant Amazon order and had to guess what was in it. So, if that matters to you, be aware that you're getting it for like a gift or something. Make sure that you are picking up and opening the Amazon packages because it will come inside a plain brown box no riding, no indication of what it is at all.",

It took me about 30 minutes, but that was including taking pictures and video while moving slowly (currently recovering from surgery).It's lightweight and rolls easily. Two of the wheels have brakes. The height of the table can be adjusted. Its adjusted by you putting it at the height you want, then screwing the two knobs until it is firmly in place. This is where I decided to deduct a star. I wish this was done a different way. Maybe with some holes and pop-up buttons? Or at least some marks to help us align it straight. When I first set it to the height i wanted, it was only off by very little. Most probably won't notice, but if you are like me and want it to match up more evenly, pencil or tape some marks to help align it easier.The rustic wood looks beautiful. Came with a few minor scratches, but the pattern of the wood hides them (and any future scratches) well.I'm not sure how much weight this side table can hold. I feel it more sturdy when its lower than higher. Still feels pretty stable overall though.",
