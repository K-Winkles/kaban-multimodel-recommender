                "reviewText": "Arrived today, and was super excited to put it together. Sadly, I opened the box and it was only a table top, two legs and instructions. Table top feels solid so that\u2019s a good thing. I followed the instructions for replacement parts, and sent the manufacturer an email. Hoping I get them sooner or later. I work in furniture so I know how the industry is about sending out parts. Hoping for the best. Will update when item is put together.Update as of 5/13: Replacement parts arrive from the vendor after 2 weeks. Table was easy to put together. Table is solid and quite heavy. It is definitely more red than I had hoped. I like the style just wish it was more of a true dark walnut color",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with this table, NO veneer, solid wood throughout. Easy 15 min assembly, just LOOSELY bolt all 4 legs on first, THEN tighten the bolts. Lock-washers are included, so no need to over-tighten the bolts, the lock-washers will keep them tight, just tighten snuggly, then stop! This way you don't strip the threads and end up with a loose leg. Very happy with this table, great quality at this price point. I would highly recommend!",
