One has the surface a bit uneven from water glasses being placed on it (it's a cheaper material so definitely use coasters). As noted above, we ended up purchasing a third set recently because we did like them so much- so despite these issues, I would highly recommend.For the price and ease of putting together (they take less than 10 minutes each, and that's if you're moving slowly- with no tools or second person required outside of emotional support), I definitely would recommend them.",

I have a table inside and outside which have been nice. They clean easily and the black wood looks nice. I will use this side table for my books, drinks and more. The price was great!

Well, that depends on what you mean by good quality.All I can say is in terms of design, it's quite attractive. The quality of the material is also not bad. Not the best out there but it's solid. Granted the table is not as stable as you'd want because after all the pillar is made of plastics.This is one of those products that you want to get something cheap and easily replaceable when broken and you don't want to embarrass yourself with some cheap looking product. For what it's worth it serves its purposes well hence the 5 stars.",
