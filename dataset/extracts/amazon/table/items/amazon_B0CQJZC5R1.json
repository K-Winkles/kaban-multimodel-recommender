                "reviewText": "This table is extremely sturdy. You can use it for computers, writing, art, gaming systems, etc. It was very easy to put together. It looks really nice. One side has a soft sided holder for files, paperwork or whatever you need. Nice side too. Most tables are just too big and this one is just perfect for smaller spaces. You still have a nice size work area - almost 32\" x almost 20. Great price too!",

After weeks of measuring and looking at different options we settled on this one. We liked it came in different finished to fit best with many difference styles.It was on sale and for the price we could beat it, even if we didn\u2019t like it we could use for other things. Putting together was super easy about 30 minutes with one person. All hardware was accounted for which is always a plus.We got into the space and it was perfect size!We only got it for occasional working from home for small increments. I defiantly wouldn\u2019t say this is for someone that needs multiple monitors and works from home everyday. We just have a small laptop and keyboard and it fits great with enough space for a small pad to take notes.We are pretty happy with the purchase!",

I would have to unsewn it to cut the cardbord inside and then sew it back up cause its so long it pushes the screw holes too low. All in all, it does what I need which is thankfully a very simple request. But for how much it cost? Not really worth it, I should of looked around more.",
