                "reviewText": "I needed a table for inside my sauna - to hold a water bottle and small items. The footprint in the sauna is very small as a heating element is on the floor. I looked at a lot of options on Amazon, very happy with my choice of this item. Super easy to put together, great directions. The powder coating only has a couple very small places with irregularities - you would not notice them in your space. I would buy this item again with no hesitation. No wobbling, sits square. The only problem I saw with it is the seam around the table top is a bit noticeable but if you make sure to affix the table top in a way that this would be to the wall, it would not be an issue.",
