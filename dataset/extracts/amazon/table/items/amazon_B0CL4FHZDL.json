                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Simple and Easy to Assemble, but Shoddy Manufacturing",
                "reviewText": "It looks exactly like the pictures, except smaller than you're likely imagining (if you're like me and can't judge sizes or comprehend measurements and didn't notice the second medium option, apparently). I wouldn't have sized up either way. For my own purposes, the smaller size actually ended up fitting the limited space of my bedroom much better than I initially considered. The dresser's simple design comes across very neat and classy, though its construction and materials are obviously on the cheaper side. The cloth drawers are fine for storing clothes, books, or bedside knick-nacks and the handles seem sturdy.However, the product I recieved had a manufacturing defect with one of the holes in the leg frame that wouldn't permit the screw to enter into it at all and I ended up having to leave it out. Thankfully it doesn't cause the dresser to wobble or creak or seem any less sturdy without that final screw to fully connect the frame. But I haven't put anything weighted in the drawers yet, so that could change. And one of the \"adjustable\" feet wouldn't screw in all the way, therefore I'm unable to actually adjust any of the feet's sizes, but it still screwed in enough to allow me to use all four feet, stuck at near-full extension.The dysfunctional screw hole in the frame and the yet another screw hole issue with the adjustable feet are the reasons why I couldn't give this five stars. Shoddy manufacturing is the only downside of this dresser, I suppose.",
