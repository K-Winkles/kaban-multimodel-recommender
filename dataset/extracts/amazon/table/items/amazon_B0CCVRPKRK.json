                "reviewText": "This was by far the easiest thing to put together. All the parts and screws were individually packaged and labeled. The instruction sheet pictures were very clear and plainly understandable. There were some extra screws included and an allen wrench so you didn't need a screwdriver.I would have liked a little more depth & width on the top, but all in all it is attractive and sturdy. I'd buy another if I needed one.",
