                "reviewText": "I bought two of these. The reason I bought two is of course I need space to put things. This thing is very large and the best thing about them is the sturdiness. I can barely shake the table, you can tell it's heavy and high quality and will probably be able to withstand a very large amount of weight. Very easy to assemble, I used zero tools other than the L wrench that came with it.. you get extra stuff too incase you lose anything. It really only takes one person to assemble, if you have trouble with heavy large slabs of steel and table, you probably do need help. The table is nice and smooth and is dense \"wood\".. I accidently dropped one of mine on a corner and it cracked a little bit, you can see the inside if some sort of compacted type of wood panel, it's not an actual solid piece of wood. The tabletop with the wood is attached to heavy hollowed steel which is pretty heavy. it comes with two other pieces, the legs, they are indeed steel and are hollow on the inside, they are pretty heavy themselves (you can tell they are not thin aluminum, they are decently thick steel pieces). It comes with an L wrench and come with steel long screws that are easy to put in. After everything's assembles you have a heavy duty table that can withstand a lot of weight, I assume.. given that the legs and metal are steel. I can easily stand on the table (i weigh 200 lbs) and the table top would not give an inch, so that tells me everything I need to know. Is it worth over $100, heck yes.",

Nice that it comes with a tool, but I used a t-handle ball-end allen wrench which made things smoother. I'm quite pleased.",

I have two in my office, one in my partner's office, one in my living room for my PS5/Xbox under the TV, one in the dining room. One had chips/scuffs, Amazon support gave me a credit. It's in my partner's office. One arrived with the screws holding the top to the frame ripped out. I got a larger credit for that one and fixed it myself. You can't just put larger screws in, but you *can* shift the table top a little forward (about 1\") and put the screws into new spots on the tabletop. Just make sure it's perfectly square, predrill the screw holes, and go slow so you don't split the tabletop.",

I actually have an electric screwdriver but it was not as useful as the tool that came with this desk.About the desk itself: It is very flat and steady. I can comfortably write and read on this desk. The leg bars make it even more steady. The sandalwood board is also well-designed and fits my room very well. I really like it. I am also satisfied with the height of this desk. I am tall and with other desks with a lower height or with a thick bar under the desk board, my legs will constantly hit the desk when sitting. It is not a problem with this desk. Overall speaking, it is a nice desk and I definitely recommend buying it.",

I'm using it solely for my mouse and keyboard and just wanted something strong that wouldn't move around on me. For that it works great. I knew ahead of time that if there were any chips or imperfections in the corners it wouldn't matter to me and will still be well worth considering it was cheaper than the other options. That being said the table I got does have a chip in the corner. The product is good and easily assembled, the company just has to change which ever monkeys are handling it before its sold. Like I said though, doesnt impact me and I'm happy with my purchase.Conclusion: Highly recommend and worth it for gaming and what it says its for, computer desk. If you're getting it for presentation take your chances.",
