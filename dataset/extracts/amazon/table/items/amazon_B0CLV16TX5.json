You are able to swap the sides of the storage bag and hook if you'd like. Thought the surface was going to be flat black, but it kind of has the fake wood lines, but it's fine, that doesn't effect writing on it. Able to fit a laptop, monitor, keyboard and mouse on it. Good space saver. Got a stationary chair and it slides under it fine.",

The space works well for my intended use. The desks came very securely packaged and thus no damage due to the shipping. I liked that the screws for the assembly were packed together and seperated by the two different sizes used for installing. My son and I put the units together with out a lot of difficulty. The only issue we had putting the folders on the desk was that the holes did not line up, one hole was higher than the other. Drilling the holes to align was simple and quick and fixed the issue. I would recommend this unit to any one that needs something for a rather small spalce.",

He works with a laptop, 2 24\u201d monitors, and a wireless keyboard & mouse. I also purchased a dual monitor mount that clamps to the desk for the 2 monitors and he has plenty of room to to use everything. Before we mounted the monitors, he was still able to set up 2 monitors, keyboard & mouse on it. The side hook is perfect for his headset when not in use and the side pocket is quite large and great for his notebooks, pens, etc. Desk is perfect for work or even a small gaming space.",
