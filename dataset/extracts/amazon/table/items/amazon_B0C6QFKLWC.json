If I saw it before he put it together I would have definitely returned it.I don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t like it. If I don\u2019t like something I never will. I won\u2019t be happy with it. Yuck. What a scamAlso, my son said that putting it together sucked.They didn\u2019t have guide holes for the tops .He said it\u2019s just badly designed.Cheap crap.I might end up putting it out on the curb with a sign on it that says \u201cfree\u201d what a waste of my money.",
