                "reviewText": "I will say, first off, that the materials are top notch. It's made of very heavy metals and the top is wooden, it's really high quality. I just...didn't expect it to be QUITE as tiny as it is. I wanted a table to sit beside my reading chair that would maybe hold just a cup of coffee or a book, maybe a small lamp. It does all those things...just not all at once. It IS my fault, I suppose, for not looking at the measurements. I mostly use it as a plant stand in my living room now and it looks fantastic. I wish I could have used it for what I wanted BUT I do love it and it IS very much serving a purpose so I'm definitely not bad at it.",
