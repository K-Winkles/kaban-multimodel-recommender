As a bonus the built in power strip works perfect and helps conceal the cord from the refrigerator. Instructions were easy to follow with no issues. Make sure you just snug the bolts when first assembling and then tighten everything once finished. Be careful and don't overnighten the bolts holding the top shelf as they will start to bend the corner joints if overtightened. Overall good quality for the price.",
