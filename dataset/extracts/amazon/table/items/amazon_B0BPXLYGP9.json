                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Simple side table, good for small spaces, a little unsteady",
                "reviewText": "This is a simple side table, which I ordered with the intent of acting as additional living room furniture.The construction of this is essentially a number of metal bars that screw together with a glass top for the top surface. Assembly is not very challenging, taking approximately 20-30 minutes at a leisurely pace. Only an allen wrench is needed, which is included with the product. The design is simple and modern. One relatively unique feature is the hanging pocket, which is nice to hold things like magazines, books, or other various and sundry items that one might want to keep at hand, but not necessarily on the top of a side table. The top surface is large enough to hold a small lamp and a handful of other items like a phone, keys, wallet, etc. If used as a side table, it could hold several remotes, a plate, and so forth. However, the surface is certainly not large enough to act as something like a desk and might not replace a larger nightstand.One other thing that I've noticed is that because this is made of lighter metal, the table can be somewhat unstable or prone to tipping over. As long as you're aware of this, I don't think it's a huge problem, but you might not want to place this table in an area where kids or larger pets will be running around. Another thing to note is that this sits a little lower than I was expecting, particularly based on the product images, so make sure that you measure the area where you plan to use it and make sure that it will be at an appropriate height for your purposes.Overall, this is a relatively easy to assemble and simple side table that incorporates some extra storage with a lower pocket. I think you get reasonable value for the price, but you should be aware that it's a little unsteady which might limit its uses, and that it ends up seeming a little smaller than the pictures would suggest.",

                "reviewText": "Right off the bat, you know you're not to be looking for perfect seams, pristine finish, etc.This is not a $500 end table, nor even a $100 end table. Yet for the present $35 that it sells for, it knocks it out of the park.It took about 20 minutes to put it together. As usual, the directions are a wasteland when it comes to language, but the visuals are completely adequate.It comes with extra screws, which I absolutely love. Every such item should have the \"baker's dozen\" attitude, so you never come up short. Most do these days.The connections are again, very basic, yet solid. It may feel a bit \"wobbly\" as you're moving the parts around, yet the designers leveraged the whole of the piece to support all when fully assembled with supreme aplomb.This thing is like a tank in being solid. The glass top is seriously nice. Solid. Beautifully clean. Nice, smoked leaded glass, from all appearance.I find this to be an excellent utility table in my office. I can see it working wonderfully in a very large number of roles. I consider it will likely make for a good home in dorm rooms, and especially rooms that are tight on space, with the C function being put to such effect. A perfect \"slide in/slide out\" table, when tasks are desired. Eating, for example. I would rather eat off of this than the large majority of sloppily designed and built \"folding tables\" for such purpose.I am glad to have it, and consider it a solid, well planned, well appointed, budget side/end table. I do hope this helps.",
