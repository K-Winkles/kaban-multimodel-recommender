                "reviewText": "Perfect for using in smaller spaces like apartments or RV's, and the plug that is on it charges your devices super fast, which was a pleasant surprise for me I know. My laptop fits perfectly on top of the table and it will roll underneath the chair I sit on while using it, putting it at exactly the height I need it to be at so I can use my computer comfortably as well as write or any other tasks that require a small table top to do. It is also a sleek design and looks nice with all of the other stuff in the room, very simple looking yet sleek and elegant as well. Assembly was rather straightforward and for the most part simple enough, I was able to figure out what wasn't clear in the instructions provided. Also included extra hardware and the tools needed to put it together.",

It can also be used up against a sofa or chair. It's sturdy and holds a good deal. The charging station is a bonus and works well. It also doesn't take up any of the table top space since it's placed on the side/front of the table. Good price point at under 40.00.",
