                "reviewText": "If you have a standard sized bed or couch, this is going to be to short as a night stand or side table. It's little. I sleep on a Japanese futon mattress that gets taken up each day, but find that I need somewhere to put a reading light, and to set a few things aside. This is perfect for that. I can reach both shelves from on the floor.When I put it together, it took about 10 or 15 minutes, and was very easy. The instructions were accurate and made sense. One of the short legs under the bottom however, I had to take the plastic piece that holds the screw out and reglue it because it popped loose.Now, the problems I found. First, the paint is thin and scrapes off easily. It's a cheap little table though, so you shouldn't expect top end. Second is that there are divets in the top where the screws go down into the legs, that will be impossible to clean. Last is the same problem from the faux wicker shelf. Whatever you get on that, dirt, dust, or anything else, it's not coming out.Because of the negatives I knocked off a star, but, for 20 bucks I feel like if I get 6 months or a year out of this little table, it'll be worth that.",

                "reviewText": "This is a somewhat sturdy yet light little table, tall enough to use with a couch or at your bedside although not as big as a standard end table. I can see it getting knocked over easily when used for either of those purposes and find it better in a location that you will put stuff on it then leave it alone, like plants or decorations or maybe a small lamp. It is not flimsy, just not as substantial as tables I would want to use for bedside or by the couch. I left this for over a week because I did not feel like putting it together--but it was actually pretty easy and took about 15 minutes. The instructions provided are not very detailed, but I was able to figure it out just by looking at the materials provided. Building from the bottom up, you put headless screws in the bottom short legs, slide them through the bottom table tier, then attach the longer sections by screwing into the other side of the headless screws, then screw on the table top using the allen wrench provided--which I appreciate so I don't have to search the house for an allen wrench. As the instructions do say, make sure you have all the top screws in the holes before you tighten them all, that was the only thing I had a problem with, and not much of one. There are also sliders provided to screw into the bottom legs, although you could use without them if you want. It would have been nice if they provided wood plugs to tap into the top screws but does not look too bad without them, the top screws are black and match the coloring of the table so not too noticeable. This is a nice little table to have around, I will probably put plants on it.",
