                "reviewText": "This is a simple looking end table. It is put together like a jigsaw puzzle. The product is fairly simple to put together however be very careful the material it is made out of crumbles very easily. When assembling do it in a location that can easily be vacuumed or swept up since there is a fine white powder/dust all over this unit. the powder/dust gets everywhere. Once assembled you will need to wipe the entire shelf down to get all the residual white dust off of it. It is not very strong/durable I feel as if it will fall apart/biodegrade over time. The overall look once assembled is actually ok. It is not worth the price paid. I would say this is more of a $10-$15 dollar table. If I had to purchase this all over again I would not. I would return this table but disassembling it and trying to pack it up into the tiny box it came in without breaking the pieces would be to much. I would think twice if you are thinking about purchasing this item.",
