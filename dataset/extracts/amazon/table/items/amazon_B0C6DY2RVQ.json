                "reviewText": "This would make a great plant stand outside or inside - so long as whatever is on it makes it heavy enough so that it can't be blown over in the wind. It's extremely light. I like that it's all metal and I'm likely going to put it out on my porch and put plants on it. The one I got arrived dented so I'm replacing it with a new one. That's ok - it happens. Assembly couldn't be easier! You just unfold the legs and put them under the tray, and voila! I love it.",
