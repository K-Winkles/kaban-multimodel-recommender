                "reviewText": "I was looking for a low profile coffee table with a modern aesthetic and came across this one. I am so glad I purchased this. In my new stage of life, I have to put furniture together myself so I was a bit hesitant to order something requiring assembly. This was so easy to put together, except for a screw issue, which I will mention later. It took me maybe an hour from start to finish because I am new at putting things together on my own - to someone with more experience it would probably take less time. The color is gorgeous. The low profile is perfect and allows for flow in the room. The little cubbies are great for decorations and books. I put a gray fabric tray for the remote and coasters in the cubby facing the couch and put a plant on the edge to give it a nice overall vibe.The only issue I had was a screw was too short. There's a bracing bar and the screw to attach into the top of the coffee table from underneath was too short--it wasn't even long enough for the width of the bar. It doesn't seem to impact the integrity of the furniture piece though and when I have time, I am going to Lowes to get a longer one.Overall, even with the screw issue, I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.",
