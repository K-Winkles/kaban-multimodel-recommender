                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this table. Reviews seemed decent and it was the right price. When it came, every part was dirty and scuffed up (you can see some of that in the pics). But the worst thing was that the legs were all milled to different specs (see pics). They would not slide all the way into the base - the legs were not cut deep enough to fit into the grooves of the base. The table could not be assembled. Very disappointed, immediately returned.",

They were super-easy to assemble. It literally took me five, maybe ten minutes. Also, if they wobble, you can adjust the screws on the bottom of the legs to make them level. I'm very happy with these, and they're the perfect size for a chair side table.",

If you don't put downward pressure on this table, it won't break. I made the mistake of slightly leaning on it. If you just use it to set things on, it won't break.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Don't buy this. It doesn't use wood for the table part. It uses pressboard, which is like sawdust shaped with high pressure. The top broke with very minimal downward pressure. It looks nice, but with extremely poor workmanship.",
