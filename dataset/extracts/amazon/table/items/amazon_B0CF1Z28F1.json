Pros: light weight, sturdy, love the additional outlets and USB slots, has a nice shelf on the bottom, love that it has wheels.Cons: super small, doesn\u2019t hold my laptop and a mouse. Super short, can\u2019t use a dining room chair comfortably. Suitable for a sofa, but I didn\u2019t buy it with that intention.",
