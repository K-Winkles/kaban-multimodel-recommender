                "reviewText": "This table is amazing! It's thoughtfully packed; I assembled two different pieces of flat pack furniture today from two different companies, and this one was far superior. All the corners were protected by styrofoam inserts, all the styrofoam in the package was sealed in plastic (no styrofoam snow all over the place while I was unpacking and assembling!), and the hardware was blister packed on a cardboard card so nothing was roaming loose in the box. It came with the usual L-shaped hex tool, but Zinus also included their own branded hex tool with a nice handle that was much easier to work with. Eight bolts and you're done. The instructions have large, clear diagrams. The package also included an envelope with a thank you note and blank cards to send to friends/family. This company cares about its product AND its presentation!The table itself is lovely. I purchased the natural version, and in person it's a mellow honey color. The legs are solid wood with felt feet already attached, and the top is real wood all the way through. It is a pieced wood, not a solid top. I included a picture to show what it looks like because the joins are very visible, but not messy or unpleasant. The hardware was all heavy duty and included bolts and washers. It would be very easy to paint this table. It's also got a nice weight and it's sturdy enough that I dont anticipate any issues using it as a craft table.Some pictures show this table with two chairs on each of the long sides, but they'd have to be very narrow.This table was a great buy for around $100. I am so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the whole package at the price point...honestly, it put most of the other flat pack furniture I've bought or assembled to absolute shame. This is a great piece!",

It's very sturdy and doesn't wobble at all.Cons: I'm not crazy about the hairline crack running from one of the short edges toward the center of the table. It's not very noticeable, but it keeps me from giving the table a 5-star review. I noticed cracks mentioned in other reviews. Just be aware that it's an occasional issue and that it would be a huge hassle to return, so be prepared to get what you pay for, and if you're lucky, you won't have this problem.",

I was afraid once assembled I would not be able to set it upright but it was light enough to handle. I am totally happy with this table. It looks fine and seems quite sturdy. My thanks to the company for such careful packaging. Styrofoam encased in plastic kept cleanup to absolute minimum. Everything was included, nothing missing.",
