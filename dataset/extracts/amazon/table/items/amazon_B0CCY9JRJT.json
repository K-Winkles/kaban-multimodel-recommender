                "reviewText": "I ordered this shelf without reading the full description, was a little disappointed when I read back through to find it had fabric drawers. The small box it came in added to the disappointment and concern of reliability as it was then I learned the top was 2 parts and not a single plank of \"wood\". The assembly went well, and I gained some confidence that this would do the job (still not happy with fabric drawers). The outlets are a nice touch as this puts access to power where there was none before. The absence of a bottom shelf is what I was looking for considering I am using this in the kitchen and putting a dog feeding station under it. On top I plan to put a combination ice/water machine that holds a 5-gallon jug of water (this has not come in yet). The wife feels the shelf is not sturdy enough for this, it does have a wobble to it (side to side), but I think it will do the job (I may have to brace one end to the wall or add something to stabilize it). If there was an improvement to be made it would be wooden drawers, and something that fastens to the framework behind the drawers to steady the shelf and remove the wobble. The adjustable feet to level the shelf is a great feature, most houses do not have perfect level floors. We'll use the drawers for tea bags etc. hopefully they will hold up for a while before I have to build some simple drawers.",

                "reviewText": "It was fairly easy to assemble and the outlets on the side are great to have. The top piece is two pieces of wood and not one large piece which makes it look tacky and cheap. The cloth drawers were cheaper than I expected as well. If this table was $30 bucks, I would have given it a higher rating but charging $55 for this cheaply made table is way too much.",

I wasn't expecting them to be this way based on the listing, so was a bit disappointed. The multiple USB and power outlets make it easy to charge phones and/or set up lighting. It was a bit of a hassle to put together, but I'm pretty happy with the finished product.",
