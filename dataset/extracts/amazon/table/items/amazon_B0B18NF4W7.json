I love that the foot ends are adjustable, pso I can make the table a little taller also! So easy to put together about 15 mins by my self. Arrived in perfect condition. It is so sturdy!! The \u201cwood looking\u201d part is MDF, so I placed a plastic protector for water spills. Other than that it is a great value.",
