                "reviewText": "This was super easy to put together for which I\u2019d very much like to thank the creators that I didn\u2019t have to tear up my hands with tools. The lug nuts needed for the top were already in place and it was intuitive to screw the two legs together to make them longer and the screw to the top and put the soft rubber caps they include on the bottoms and sit it up. It looks perfectly sturdy for whatever you would want to sit on it but I suspect an adult human would be pushing its tolerance. It\u2019s so easy I\u2019m pretty sure given enough time my 6 yr old niece would pretty quickly figure out how to assemble it. I\u2019ve had some real wrestling matches with putting together furniture so I\u2019m extremely thankful for this one\u2019s simplicity. The table/stool is exactly as I envisioned from the ad for the purpose I wanted it for. No main star negatives and only one took for sturdiness as I would worry about it tilting on a child that can\u2019t sit still if they decided to use it as a seat or to reach something since it\u2019s very lightweight and let\u2019s face it very few can sit still and they don\u2019t really understand the concept of gravity. I\u2019m pretty sure some days my 3 year old niece wonders if I can anything other than \u201ccareful\u201d",

The assembly process doesn't need an instruction manual it's so easy. 1 minute and it's already up and running. It still includes an instruction manual just in case.It is able to support 140 lbs without giving out. The legs come with nice rubber caps to prevent it slipping or damaging any hard floors. They also hide the only unsightly thing about the table, the small welded metal balls at the end of the feet!The table disassembles as easily as it's put together making for easy storage while it's away!Be careful as this could be mistaken as a chair. I wouldn't fully trust this for use as a chair all the time, though it will probably hold your weight. It can be moved around fairly easily with a bit of wobbling.",
