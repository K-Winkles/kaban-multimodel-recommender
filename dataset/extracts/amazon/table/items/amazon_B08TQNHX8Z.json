                "reviewText": "Love this table! It\u2019s perfect size and height for the space. Super easy to put together in 5 minutes, didn\u2019t even need the instructions. It says blackened bronze but it\u2019s for sure matte black which is exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s sturdy and steady with adjustable legs. The glass is a nice tempered glass with round edge. As an interior designer i\u2019d definitely buy this for a client and great price point at $80 and very high end looking. I did buy an \u201copen box\u201d table, which means somebody bought it and returned it. It did have a couple of scratches from the previous person who didn\u2019t put it back in the box correctly, and it rubbed a little bit and made marks. But I was able to put that on the inside and you can\u2019t see it. It wasn\u2019t worth returning for that small flaw. So if you do buy an open box, just be sure to check the metal pieces. great purchase very happy with this. This exact table was for sale from other websites for $50-$70 more.",

We put together puzzles on it all the time, and we spread the extra pieces on the lower level. You can look straight through the top level and see the pieces below. Also, the glass and black just sort of disappear into the room, so it doesn't seem to take up much space visually. And I'm pleased to not have any corners to catch my shins on. I have it in a room with a bunch of furniture and lamps from Pottery Barn and West Elm, and it looks fine. It has exceeded my expectations. I will say it's a bit of a pain to clean. Fingerprints and dust show easily. It's worth it though.",

I looked for something that would match my existing coffee table and end table, both of which are silver with glass. I saw this table, did some measurements and figured with luck that two would be exactly what I\u2019d need. Both arrived perfectly, well packed with no damage whatsoever and after an easy assemble they did everything I\u2019d hoped they would. They create a definite punctuation to my living room space and have provided me a space to place tasteful decorative pieces and I\u2019m planning to do a full holiday spread of decorations very soon. I\u2019ll post photos once I\u2019m done, chit these tables add such a modern and truly tasteful flare and really finish my room off perfectly!",
