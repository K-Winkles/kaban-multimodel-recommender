                "reviewText": "I wasn't eager to haul this to the baby's room, but it's worth it-- even though he isn't even sitting up yet. It's an excellent table and chair set but doubles as an interesting toy shelf and table top right now. Plus, it gives us a place to sit if we're in the room with him.It's got four stools, so it's really for toddler age kids that are walking and sitting without help, but can finally sit on a stool alone and work at a table. It can seat four-- and the colors are beautiful primary colors, though I may paint the stools to go with the room. Not sure. I did add some contact paper to the top to protect the table top for a while. It will remove easily enough, not worried about removing paint, since I got the low adhesive kind.It holds a ton of toys, stuffed animals, a few board books.On the table, I can keep the lamp and some incidentals. Maybe a clock. I might put the table next to the feeding chair, so I can also use it to rest the bottle.Thrilled with the table. Great item. Really well made, strong and the finish is solid-- nothing was chipped, everything arrived in perfect condition. Didn't take too long to put together. I had it done in an hour or so alone.",

                "reviewText": "This set works, but IKEA or others are better bang for the buck. I was disappointed in a few different areas, but most of all it just kinda feels cheap.Things I like:-Compact. Nice how chairs fit snuggly into the desk.Things I don't like:-Feels cheap and wobbly, more so than most particle board furniture.-Assembly was more difficult than I think it needed to be. I've done lots of these (like anyone else) but was surprised how many pieces there were.-Lots of chips and scrapes after the first few weeks.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great addition to my kids play area. The colors on the stools make it really stand out and become a focal point.In our play room we have a play kitchen and store so it's great to have a table to pretend to eat at. This is also good for coloring or reading. It's a bit higher than a typical children's table, almost like a little high top. The stools are easy to move around and push close to the table when not in use to maximize space.The assembly instructions weren't difficult but it was a lot of screwing so a power drill really helps. The material is MDF so we'll see how it holds up. The surfaces wipe clean easily.I was interested in this partly for storage in the stools but I'm realizing that's not very practical. Yes the stools are open but I can't see fitting much in there, maybe stuffed animals? I like the concept but not sure it works with this design.Overall it's a very adorable table for your little ones.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this table and chairs set. My favorite part is that the seats tuck back into the table when my kids are done playing with it. I like the bright fun colors, but that they are also not the typical colors. It does look a little cheap, but I don't mind that for the price and knowing that kids will color on it any ways so I wouldn't want to buy something too nice. This works perfect for the ages they are now.",
