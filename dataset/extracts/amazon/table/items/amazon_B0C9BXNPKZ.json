                "reviewText": "Definitely pay attention to the listed dimensions! It is much smaller than what the photo examples show. I honestly thought they would be about twice this size. The other furniture in the pics must be kid sized.Anyway, the dimensions listed are accurate, so go by that an not just looking at the pictures. They are sturdy and look nice. They do not wobble and were very easy to put together. I did flip the legs so the pegs/screws are facing inside instead of obvious on the outside. While they won't go where I had intended, I can use them elsewhere. And with how expensive everything is nowadays, it is still a good deal at this price with the size they are.One star loss due to size as advertised in example photos, though my fault for not paying better attention to listed dimensions. They need to use different pictures.",
