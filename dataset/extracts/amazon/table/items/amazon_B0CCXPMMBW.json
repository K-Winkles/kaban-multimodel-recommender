I didn't give it a five for the manufacturer internal packaging needs more cushion or bubble wrap. My legs were lightly scratched by the other pieces. But for the price I'm still very satisfied.",

That still may be the case.This is incredible simple to assembly and doesn\u2019t require instructions.HOWEVER the pilot holes for the bars that screw into the wood do not line up in any way. I likely just received a bad item but it was incredibly frustrating.I\u2019m not worried about it personally, as I have drills to open up the pilot holes to allow the Allen screw to line up. Though, MANY people (rightly) will be pretty pissed if this happens to them too. One should not have to do what I\u2019m doing to make it work.Don\u2019t forget people, this is a $30 table. You have been forewarned.",

                "reviewText": "This table is supposed to be used behind the couch or in a foyer, or somewhere decorative, yet I've been using it as a personal table that fits around my antigravity chair, and it works great this way! (It's been very difficult to find a table for this purpose).This table is very sturdy and functional as a personal computer table, or personal dinner table. For the computer function - I can fit my old laptop on it's stand, along with the oversized mouse pad, and the keyboard, and still have room for my coffee mug, or water bottle, and my phone.For the dinner function - I have easily placed my full sized plate, a regular soup bowl, a separate saucer for bread, my water cup, my coffee mug, and my phone and stand, along with my utensils beside my plate.**It took about 30 minutes to put together, by myself, and I haven't had any issues with it tipping, however, it can get top heavy and when I have the top covered with meal dishes, or with my computer stuff. I am also very careful when extending the antigravity chair, because the bottom bar of my chair can run into the front bar of the table, however, because this works so well, it is really a non-issue in the table's overall functionality.**Important note - I use furniture sliders under the table legs in order to make it functional the way that I need it, and without the furniture sliders, I can't move it easily, because the table is fairly heavy, and too bulky to move out of the way.",
