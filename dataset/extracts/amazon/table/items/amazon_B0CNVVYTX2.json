Honestly it was a great buy and it was super sturdy!",

There\u2019s 3 shelf levels and a roomy drawer. It was extremely easy to assemble and came with all the needed tools. Free allen wrench & phillips-head. Great buy, however, the LED strip is not worth it and wasn\u2019t really something I was anticipating to use regardless. The adhesive isn\u2019t nearly strong enough to hold it very long. Mine has already fallen off after about 2 weeks.",
