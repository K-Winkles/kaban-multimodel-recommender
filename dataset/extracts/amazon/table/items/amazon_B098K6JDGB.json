One of the tables arrived with shipping damage that was bad enough that I asked to return it. I sent photos of the table and the shipping box that showed the damage. A return label was sent to me but it did not have postage so the return was going to cost me quite a bit of money. I messaged the seller and got a prompt response that they would refund me the cost of the table without me having to ship it back. I accepted the solution and received a full refund for the damaged table. I'm very happy with how it was handled and will purchase from this seller again!",
