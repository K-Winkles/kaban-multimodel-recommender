I've been looking for awhile for another and all of the ones I've found are cheap, have bad reviews, come with only 1 chair etc. And finally I found this. The same my first son had. Now I have 2 little ones and this chair is perfect. My 2 year old loves it, sits in the chair and eats his meals now, plays toys on it, watches TV at it, its versatile, sturdy and extremely easy to clean. And he will be able to use for years. My last one was able to use until he was 8. The chair locks into place so a child cannot close it and there is no assembly required. I'm not letting this one go. Great price too compared to others. Definitely recommend",
