They went together relatively easily. Overall, I'm very pleased. The only slight issue I have is that the glass top of the larger table has one area where it seems a bit off-size somehow. The smaller table has no gap at all between the glass and the frame, but the larger one has a small area with a gap of about 1/8\" although it meets the frame most of the rest of the way around.",
