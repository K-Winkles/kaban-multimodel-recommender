Neat as a pin, and looks better in reality than in the listing, or as implied by the price. Easy and quick to put together. Very pleased.Packaging and unboxing: The desk is well made and packaged. Everything was well protected inside the box, and unboxing the pieces was no problem. Several long metal pieces were in plastic bags, which was more protection and more plastic than needed, but very effective. Hardware was in a blister pack.Assembly: Assembly was straightforward. All of the screw holes are well tapped and accurate. There are two possible hitches during assembly: One of the diagonal shanks wasn\u2019t quite bent enough at the screw hole flange, but a quick bend with the pliers to increase the bend angle took only a few seconds, and allowed the shank to line up with the drilled hole in the leg. The second step to be careful with is attaching the desktop. Don\u2019t tighten any of the screws until all six are seated and halfway turned. Since the desk is lightweight, it is trivial to turn it around during any part of the assembly whenever needed. Since there are only two types of screws used, it\u2019s almost impossible to get confused over which piece goes where.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Smaller legs than they appear in the images",
                "reviewText": "I bought this desk to HACK it, not like destroy, but to mod it to heck and back, put wheels on it, peg boards, magnets, binder clips and what not.Pros:-Easy to assemble-Good quality feeling pieces, not the thickest of walled pieces but I don't fear under normal use that these legs will easily dent, deform, or buckle.-Inexpensive so it means when you modify it, you don't feel too bad and can easily buy another if you mess up.-Apparently they listened to shipping complaints since mine came perfectly intact. Noticed they applied thick rubber corner guards on my table for shipping and that was greatly appreciated.Cons:-The long bar only has one screw securing it, I mean yes it later secures into the side legs, but during construction makes it hard to align the side holes to secure the long bar to the two side pieces. My tip to you guys, when putting this together, don't fully screw in the long bar, let it dangle a bit so it has some play and wiggle. Once I released that tension made putting the side pieces on so much easier.-The top, it is not waterproof, it's particle board with a laminated texture on it, you will need to use a coaster or your sweaty water glass will deform the particle board and it will expand and bubble and ruin the laminate top. I bought a mouse pad that covers the top and a vinyl table cover as well. Mouse pad acts as insulating layer, vinyl is there for waterproofing.Hacks/Mods:-Peg Board, found this great 1/4in thick by 18in by 22in peg board (sadly only comes in white), is the PERFECT size for the side, width wise (18in) and comes up a little short for the 22in part, but not that big of a problem. Secured it to the table using rubber 1in tape on the legs (legs are technically under 1in, so probably 2.5CM or 2CM since the 1in rubber tape seeped over the edges slightly. I put rubber strips on the front and back side for grip, then used 1/4in zip ties to secure the peg board to the table leg. The Duraboard Polypropylene is a plastic pegboard, that sadly only comes in white. With said peg board, I can now secure anything to this desk-Binder clip- it holds my brown 2-prong extension cord that I plug my box fan into and control by a switch so I can turn on the box fan.-Box fan - 20in box fan from Walmart, that blows into my lap and keeps me cool in the hot Mississippi Coast summers that can literally get unbearable, even with a pool, my pool by August can get up to 100F. NOT EVEN kidding, that's according to my salt system's control panel. So that floating box fan really allows me to not have to keep the AC so low and blow out its capacitors.-Wheels, this one took forever to figure out a conversion for. I ended up going with 3in with brakes wheels with the four screw holes, thought of popping off the plastic caps and going with a peg option, tried that with my folding table I was using prior, but those kept popping in and out and was annoying. So went with the plate style wheels, and a 6x6 dot brace thing from LOWE'S (x8 two for each wheel since the plates were kind of flimsy), 4x #8 screws with washers and nuts at 1 1/2in length. And they secure it well and only add about an inch to the over all height. Before I used these wheels that were like for some industrial table and could fit on square legs, but were too big and added like 4in to the total height. I'm thinking about trying out 2in wheels too. since the legs on the end past the bottom brace only seems to be about 2.5in, so the 2in wheels should be able to allow me a slimmer profile and make this more comfortable to use in my armchair in the living room.Conclusion:I bought it since it was inexpensive, I wasn't expecting massive quality since I knew I was going to be hacking/modding the heck out of it so, it just needed the sturdiness and I think it has that. This is great for first apartment and college kids, but not for real adults and as real furniture. It works for my needs since I love modding.",
