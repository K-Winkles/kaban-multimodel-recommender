                "reviewText": "I looked at a million tables, and read a million reviews as I always do. This fit the bill in EVERY WAY! I just set it up and know it\u2019s what I needed for sure. I purchased initially for one main thing,\u2026. I needed a place to craft. I usually do it in the kitchen which turns into a tiring thing because I have to gather all of my craft supplies back and forth and then the clean up is exhausting. Now I can work directly where I keep my supplies and contain my mess making life much easier!!! Yes please haha! Also, this table has like 5 levels of height! Perfect again for my little 2 yr old granddaughter to play, eat, craft and anything she wants to do when visiting and it\u2019ll grow with her! Great for Holidays, when extra room is needed, great for a \u2018wrapping station\u2019 for Christmas gifts,\u2026\u2026.and I LOVE that its foldable! I can literally it stash behind a door, under a bed, closet,\u2026.. I\u2019m so happy I took a chance ordering this!!!! It\u2019s going to be awesome and it\u2019s very sturdy and will be easy to clean as well. A wonderful buy at a good price, for all it will do!! I almost bought the 6 ft table but so glad I went with the 4 ft. which is perfect in the guest/craft room.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the table. It came folded in half in nice box and easy to carry inside. From unboxing to set up took me less than one minute. Just pull the folded halves apart (yes, it takes quite some force so go for it!), lay table flat on floor top down, slide the legs out and they click into place. Boom! Next, to adjust leg height, use a hand for each peg and push hard and slide upwards to desired height. Yes, it helps to stand on lightly on crossbrace or have 2nd person but I did this alone in that 1 minute setup.Confusion for me for a few seconds trying to figure how to \u201clock\u201d the middle sections cause my other brand tables have a slide lock. This doesn\u2019t. You simply turn table over and it locks in place. There are 2 yellow buttons to push on underneath front and back to unlock it.The unhappy part was that I was looking for table 19-20\u201d in depth and the product description says Size 19\"D x 34\"W x 24\"H.Well, it\u2019s actually 24\u201d D x 48\u201d W (L) X whatever adjustible height settings.This is not a deal-breaker cause it\u2019s a really nice, almost level table. I\u2019m sure to love the size. But, I didn\u2019t account for those extra inches and now need to rearrange everything around it.",

I don't fold it up often because we have it in a dedicated space, but I anticipate using it in the future as an extra camping table or for holiday dinners or [etc]... It's such a wonderfully useful bit of indestructible plastic and metal. I like things that last a long time and have multiple uses, and this checks both of those boxes for sure.",

                "reviewText": "This desk holds two 24\u201d monitors, an entire full keyboard mouse set, binders with room to write, and coffee of course. I would have loved to use this as a make shift kitchen table for my apartment, but I had to work from home so this is what I am using it for.Takes 2 seconds to put together, easy to adjust legs for height (for use as an office set up or a kitchen table) and is study to hold what I need it to. Only problem is the top is a tad hard to clean with the not as smooth surface, and you definitely need something over top of a piece of paper if you plan on using this as a desk for writing. I would also really love this as a makeup/hair desk. Planning on buying more, especially with the great price!!!",
