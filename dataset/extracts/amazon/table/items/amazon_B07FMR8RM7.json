                "reviewText": "Much smaller than I thought it was gonna be. Even though I did see the measurements and measured the space at home beforehand. The photos (even one that I took myself) makes it look bigger somehow. But it's both lower and shorter than I pictured. Next to a regular \"tv tray\" table\u2014it's shorter. And it looks like it's longer in length in the photos than looks in person.Having said that, that's how much I still like it. To still give it 5 stars! The quality is what you'd expect but is good. The accuracy of EVERYTHING makes me happy: color, ease of assembly (took 4 mins; no tools required), the arrival time for delivery, and THANK GOODNESS the UNUSED, Brand New condition of the item! Because, yes, Amazon sellers are notorious for sending out used items as \"new\". So thankfully mine is scratch free, dent free, buckle free, scuff free (not a fingerprint or smudge in sight), lift free [no surface lifting or peeling], has all of its parts, and was in ALL of its original wrapping and boxing! I know not everyone is so lucky. So I'm Grateful.This is a good cart that holds a decent amount and it does work very well for my own personal needs. If you get a good, NEW one like mine that ships to you fine, you won't regret it! \ud83d\udc4dAnd, no, mine does not tip or topple over. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don't know what's making others do that, as I read in the reviews before I purchased this, but mine balances just fine. {Perhaps it's the placing of the wheels? There are 2 that have locking mechanisms on them. I placed mine in the MIDDLE of the board. Maybe others are placing those 2 lock-wheels on the EDGE of the board? Maybe that has nothing to do with it, I don't know. I haven't tried it with the wheels placed at the edge, because I like the effect of having it swivel from the middle when I lock it.)Will probably soon get several more. Thanks.",

                "reviewText": "For the price these little tables are a bargain. Too good to be true? Well, all I can say is that you get what you pay for. Which isn't horrible or bad in this case, just not \"great\".The Pros:1.) Super easy assembly. Like 5 mins and done. No tools required.2.) They \"look\" nice, I like the color.3.) They are the perfect size for small spaces.4.) Extremely economical, especially for two tables!The Cons:1.) Not the highest quality material, like plastic rods that hold the top & bottom pieces together, and dorm like basic wood type material with a fake finish. (I still really likes the color, I got the grey oak.\ud83d\ude42)2.) Although very easy assembly, I did end up have to use wood glue because as I was twisting the rod into the \"fixed\" socket, so it clicks into place, well the the whole \"fixed socket piece\" popped out. This happened to both tables, and it happened to two rods on each table. So I put some wood glue in each socket and waited for it to dry a bit, then tightened up the pieces, and then left them to dry for like an hour to \"set\". Then I finished putting them together and now the tables are standing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f3.) They are cute and fit into small spaces, however, they are wobbly. \u2639\ufe0f No matter what I do, they wobble.Conclusion, for my purposes, they will work out for now. Side note* I wouldn't put anything too heavy on them, but they hold a decent amount of weight as you can see from photos attached. I would just watch placing anything of value that might get knocked over because of the possible wobble issue.\ud83d\ude09In the future I will probably upgrade to something of better quality and that doesn't wobble. However, they do look nice and function, and for the price to be able to get two tables...I will give it 4\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50's",

I use it for dinner sometimes - and for small projects I can do when I'm sitting there. It was super easy to put together. It is not very sturdy and so I fear it won't last long. My dog bumped into it and it wobbled enough that I thought my drink would spill or tip over. So, I would not recommend having drinks or breakables on it, and I would not recommend this model if you have children or pets that would bump into the table.",
