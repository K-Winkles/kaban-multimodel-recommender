                "reviewText": "As you could guess I did have to put it together. I'm disabled and almost 70 years old and it was not hard for me to do even alone. I took some pictures and as you can see it's good looking. The reason I got the nesting table is because my granddaughter comes and it's nice to be able to pull the smaller table out for her to have meals on while we're watching a movie or something. Actually I found that I'm pulling the smaller table out so that I have something close to the couch for me. There are small plastic screw feet on the bottom so that it's easy to slide on the carpet. And as long as I don't fill up that basket on the bottom too much I don't expect the table will ever be too heavy for me to pull out. Right now it's very easy to slide. Putting it together was a breeze. I had my little electric screwdriver handy so that I could make sure that all the screws were tight and I couldn't believe how quick it was to do. It doesn't look cheap, it looks well made. The wood grain tops look great and as you can see in my pictures the candle glow reflects off the surface. That's how nice they are. I like this table much more than I thought I would and I find that it was worth the price I paid. It took me less than a half hour to put together and I kept having to take breaks because of my bad back. 5 Stars!",
