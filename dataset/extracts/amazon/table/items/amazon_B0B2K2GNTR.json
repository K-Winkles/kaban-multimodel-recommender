                "reviewText": "At first, I was a little annoyed by the pocket pouch on this table. Everything else was incredibly perfect. But the pockets are too small to fit standard remotes. It ended up being an easy fix though. I had some stick on Velcro that I stuck down the center of the middle large pocket to create two deep, remote pockets. I then sewed the center remote pocket so that it didn\u2019t hang outward when the remote was put in it. Now the remotes and my cords all fit within the pocket pouches easily and without excessive hanging.I absolutely love the table. And the ability to extend it is exactly what I needed! The design is completely unique to anything else I have seen, and it fits perfectly within my space. It allows me to extend it out over my loveseat, which I sit on sideways, and place an easel on it to draw or place a dinner plate there to eat.The instructions were easy to follow, and I got everything built without too much hassle. It came with everything that I needed, including a few extra screws just in case.Overall I greatly recommend.",

Use the screwdriver to line up holes before trying to put screws in. Read instructions and take your time and you will save assembly time. Just common sense. The small wrench is to tighten wheels.",

                "reviewText": "Things to know about this table;Pros:It's a table.Cons:- It is wobbly as all get out.-The plastic parts 9 and 9-1 are oversized. they will have to be pounded in with a mallet to fit and they are not straight when going in, which causes the first point.-You may have to drill a hole in part 7 mine was missing a hole which needed a drill to push through.-The screwdriver that came with this is either melted or was badly cast, it almost cut my hand open using it.-What is the flat wrench for? It's too big to tighten the only nuts found on this table-The aforementioned nuts will fall out so be careful, you'll have to tighten those with your own wrench, and without them the table top won't attach so be warned.Yeah, this table was not worth the money or the effort to put together. Everything about it is faulty in some fashion or another, no quality control at all. If I didn't need something right now, I'd return this hunk of junk to China and pay the shipping fee myself.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am 36/F and like to think that I am fairly capable and mostly handy, under average circumstances.I made the mistake of thinking that assembling this would \"be totally quick and easy\" and decided to put it together as I was supposed to be getting ready (and leaving) for work. All in all, it took me an hour and 14 minutes to assemble, with only a couple of hang-ups, but it definitely wasn't as quick as I thought it would be. I did struggle with putting the canvas bag on, so it is important to make sure you don't tighten all of the screws until the very end (common sense).Initially I was going to use this for a vanity cart - to hold my hot tools, blow dryer, clips, etc. The built in plug was much easier to access than the powerstrip I have under my vanity and it looked a lot neater. Ultimately, I decided to put it in the bedroom as my personal work station (I felt like I was wasting it uses bc I couldn't put anything in the storage pouch when I had it next to my vanity). It holds my tablet, mini-keyboard, pens, and a small notebook perfectly and it does not take up a lot of space.I wanted to spruce it up a little, so I added concrete temporary wallpaper (like thick contact paper) to the surfaces; I think it makes it look better than the all black surface.",
