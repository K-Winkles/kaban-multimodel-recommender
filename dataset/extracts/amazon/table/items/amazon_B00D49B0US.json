As a 50+ year old woman, I found it a bit heavy to carry by myself, however, I really wanted a 6 ft table so I will maybe get a hand truck to make it easier to transport. I had trouble getting it to stand up by itself. When I tried to stand it up on one side, I found the opposite leg would fold under and vice versa. I wish there was something I could use to lock it in the middle to help it stand up so I wouldn't need assistance to get it up. However, once it is up, it is sturdy and there is no fear of the table folding into itself while standing.",

                "reviewText": "I make and sell jewelry and use a folding table to go to fairs. My old 18 year old table finally broke and I was looking for a new one. This one caught my attention simply because it is black in color since I personally have \"things\" against white plastic furniture. It's just white plastic looks \"cheaper\" to my taste:). I'm so glad I took a chance and bought this table (since at the time it was not reviewed yet ). This table is exactly what I was hoping for and compared to the old one it has more pluses in design and functionality. The edges of the table are more rounded. The plastic is thicker and looks more durable. The metal parts are well welded. The locking mechanism of the legs slides easily and is designed to eliminate any possibility of losing it (see photo). It's very stable. Does not have a bad odor either. When the table is unfolded, there is no gap between the two parts. In the folded position the thickness of the table is approx. 3 and 3/8 inches. The surface of the table has a matte finish. The table has some weight (compared to my old one), maybe for someone this is a disadvantage in the sense of carrying it, but for me it is a plus as I had a couple of times when at the fair some kids were not behaving well (to say the least...) bumping into my lighter old table and flipping my stuff on the floor. The unfolding mechanism is a bit tight, but personally I prefer more tight than loose, however for a person with bad arthritis it might be a bit of a challenge to unfold the table.... Hard to say... I don't have this problem and only notice it in comparison to my old table. Perhaps it will become more loose with time and use. In addition to the above, the box arrived earlier than promised and the packaging was decent. I bought this table on prime big sale days and would highly recommend this table.",
