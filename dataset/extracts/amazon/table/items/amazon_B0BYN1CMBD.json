                "reviewText": "It fits nicely in the square space up next to the wall where I needed a little table with no bottom and the legs spread out. I use it at work to hold my purse up off the ground while I put a boot mat underneath for winter boots/shoes during the day. Fits nicely, the color is not bad - sort of blends in. I didn't want anything that stood out. I do like that it is smooth and coated so its easy to clean and dust. *You don't want to put anything too heavy on it or keep it in a place where it could be tipped over or bumped into. It's not fragile or anything, its just not solid wood. Its solid enough to hold a small amount of weight and that's it! I like it though - 9 out of 10!",
