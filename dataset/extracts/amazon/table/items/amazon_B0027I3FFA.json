                "reviewText": "I purchased this product for use as a bed tray and as a floor-tray, meaning- sometimes I would sit on my floor (Hey, it's clean!) and want to have dinner without it becoming an utter mess.This product is absolutely perfect for my needs. It doesn't take up too much room when you fold it and put it away, so that's nice,The legs aren't floppy or anything, they definitely hold up even when my little dog jumps around it as if he was trying to trip it over,It's wide enough to hold up a drink and food, and even something extra. You can really serve someone an indulging breakfast in bed with this thing,It's not tall enough to serve as a little table if I'm sitting with my legs crossed (\"indian-style\")- then I would drop whatever's on it, so it's definitely not for that. But I can absolutely put my legs under it regularly and it's definitely tall enough.The most important thing you probably want to know about is how this product actually looks in real life:This product looks just like the picture. You might say it's a big more dark-dark-brown than pitch-back, but like many things that involve colors and hues, it's pretty debatable.It looks very chic and fancy, like it's very heavy weight, thought it's not too heavy to hold (I wouldn't hold it with just my finger, but it's absolutely manageable, and I'm very small and weak, so it's not at all too-heavy)Hope I helped you figure this one outI enjoy this product thoroughly. It does what it's meant to do the best way possible, and with some household chic added to it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had two of these trays for nearly a year. It's a nice rich black wood. It's a perfect color and shape for me, arrived on time and in perfect condition, so there was nothing to technical to complain about. The legs open and close with a smooth action, even with heavy food on it, it's not very hard to open it up once to get to the bed. The join system isn't so loose that the feet open up once you move your hand away from the base, but it's not so tight that you need a considerable amount of force to pull open the legs.The color and ascetics is exactly what I wanted. I ordered Winsome Wood Sedona Bed Tray Curved Side, Foldable Legs, Large Handle first, but was disappointed that the bottom of the legs were not smoothed, but rough which caused them to catch the threads in my comforter and pull them up. I needed something with smooth legs that wouldn't destroy my comforters and duvets. The bottom of these legs are rounded and smooth, so you can pull them across you bed without snagging a thread or causing a rip.I recently purchased a tufted ottoman for a coffee table, and have place one of these trays on top for a flat surface for food and drinks. It works really well for this purpose and is easy to lift off and away or move around the ottoman as necessary, the legs fold into the bottom of the tray perfectly leaving noting sticking out to snag on my ottoman. Overall, I'm really pleased with his tray and I'll definitely order it again. The price has dropped almost $5 since I last purchased it, and has made this tray an even better deal!",
