The 2 tables together cost me just over $100 with my Amazon Prime free shipping (whereas I was looking at closer to $900 for retail+shipping on 2 fancier, non-folding 18x72 training tables sold by those office furniture type companies which were the only other 18x72 tables I could find; the shipping alone on even folding versions of 18x72 tables was nearly $200, double the entire cost of my order- with the free shipping- via Amazon Prime). These tables are excellent - they are a perfect size for my needs, they are sturdy (even in my carpeted room), the color is beautifully warm, and the varnish is beautifully shiny- the only minus is it took a couple of days to air out the strong varnish smell (I aired it out with an open window and plates of baking soda). I highly recommend these tables (and if you are looking for a very spacious, very affordable desk option, I would strongly recommend making an L-shaped desk by buying two of these -- or even, as I ultimately went with, a U-shaped desk using these 2 tables as '90\u00b0 side extensions' on either side of a current desk).",

Very easy setup: Just unfold the legs and its done. My only drawback is that there are no screws, bolts or locks under the table to lock the legs into place. Overall I'm giving it a 4/5 Stars.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice table. It is sturdy and and a good value. As others have written the packaging is horrible. The box is flimsy, there was no padding and as a result it arrived torn in several places. It\u2019s very heavy so I\u2019m sure it was shoved and dragged across the floor and or ground. Unfortunately, the poor packaging resulted in damage. There is a about a 1.5 inch gouge on the table top. In normal times I would have returned it, but with COVID19 I was honestly lucky to have it delivered. I did not feel like waiting a month for a new table. The blemish is hidden under my laptop so I\u2019m not bothered. It\u2019s serving well as a desk. It\u2019s holding my laptop, two monitors, a lamp, and desk supplies.",
