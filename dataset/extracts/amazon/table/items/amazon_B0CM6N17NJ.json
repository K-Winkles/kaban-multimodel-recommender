                "reviewText": "I bought this table to use as a writing desk/work space in the very small corner of our bedroom. It is perfect, just the right size. It is sturdy, but light-weight, so I can move it out of the way when I'm not using it. Assembly was easy, following the instructions. Assembly did require patience, and I suspect that reviewers who complained that the table wobbled did not follow the instructions for attaching the legs carefully. That said, it took less than 30 minutes to secure the legs properly. As I move it daily, I expect that I might need to tighten the screws 1-2 times yearly, using the Allen wrench provided. There were no missing parts.",

It's worth paying extra for this desk instead of buying a cheap flimsy desk that you can find everywhere. I am VERY happy with it. It looks nice too.The size of this desk is perfect if you are looking for a desk that is bigger than a computer workstation, but smaller than a full size desk.One issue I have with this desk is that they should add sliders or casters to the legs to make it easier to move. Because this desk is good quality, it is heavy. My solution was to add stick on sliders to the legs so it is easy to drag over carpets. But, it would be nice if they offered an option to add sliders or casters to the desk. That would allow this desk to be used as a computer workstation (that typically have wheels).",

The metal frame forming the legs is made of a dense, heavy metal and the wood top is equally heavy and very good quality. This desk is well built, excellent quality and at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "This desk is a bit deeper than most, which is exactly what we needed to put my fathers Da Vinci magnifying reader on. The DaVinci is like a large all in one PC with a camera at the top that looks down on what you are reading - newspaper, magazine, etc. and then magnafies it on the screen. I needed a small desk deep enough to hold the reader and still be able to set a magazine or newspaper down in front of it. It was easy to assemble, and very sturdy, which is important because I knew my father would lean on it a bit when he got up from his chair.It was packaged well, and arrived with no damage.Very happy with this purchase.",
