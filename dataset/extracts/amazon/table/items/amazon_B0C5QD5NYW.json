Also, one feet was not attached and the side cross bars couldn't be attached as there were no pre-drilled holes. On other hand, it looks good, color is nice, and quality is decent. The corners are sharp!! So, if you get a good piece and ready to put efforts, do it!Update - seller contacted to help after reading this review. So, added 1 star for their proactive customer support!",
