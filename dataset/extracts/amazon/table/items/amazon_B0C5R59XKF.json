Could have taken me 30 but I didn't read the instructions very well \ud83d\ude1cYou get 2 tables that are adjustable in height which you can put together or separate. I love the shelves because I can store things on them instead of just having my stuff strewn about on the floor. They're pretty sturdy and I don't think getting condensation rings will be a problem. Very good value for the money if you bought one in-store already assembled it would probably cost you 200$ very good value",

                "reviewText": "The table is heavy and solid and still easy to move. For me, it replaced a table that was a lot deeper, and I just didn't need or want the depth. I have been sliding the one side of it closer to the sofa when I play spider solitaire, which is once or twice a day, and there has been no loosening, for about 5 days now. The wood is good, perfectly smooth, thrilled with the greige color, light and airy feel. The wood is definitely not easy to scratch and so the table holds up to being used as a work surface for me. The adjustable side works really well, is easy to do. The different levels are so smart. I have a tray that has my little tools in it, box cutter, screwdriver, etc., which was always on top of the other table, just looked sloppy. Now it's down on the bottom on a roll-out tray, out of sight but still right there. So great. The pouch on the side, thick, nice quality, 5 different slots. It gets screwed on x4 so it does not flop around. Assembly was easy, just follow along with what they tell you to do. It took me just over an hour.",

                "reviewText": "This table was just what I was looking for to use for music storage in our pool house. The metal and wood finish blend well with our rustic eclectic d\u00e9cor. The metal is heavy enough and the finish wasn\u2019t marred. The wood has a high gloss finish on all sides \u2013 protection I wanted because our pool house is not always acclimated. All of the parts were labeled and corresponded to the included instructions which made for an easy assembly. Not sure why there are a few empty holes in the metal frame when you\u2019re finished, but it\u2019s just like the advertised photos. The smaller table has adjustable height options so that you can make it the same height as the longer table or higher for an attractive offset. I chose the higher and placed our turntable there. The weight limit for the longer table is 66 lbs and the smaller 22 lbs. The heaviest object I have is our vinyl album collection, but I\u2019m sure its below the max. Overall this is a beautiful versatile rustic table for a good price.",
