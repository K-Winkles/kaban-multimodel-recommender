(I had to loosen the screws that hold the threaded piece to the table and insert cardboard on the side that needed some more height when assembled. This only took about 5 minutes.)Remember, it is heavy. I would definitely recommend this table. The price goes up and down a lot. Wait for the right time.",

I put mine near the front door because I always seemed to have stuff in my hands that I wish I could put down in a hurry as soon as I walked in the door. This did the trick. It's simple and yet a quality piece of furniture that fits my other d\u00e9cor well.Took a little while to get here, but made it without any damage. Mine doesn't wobble as others have mentioned.",
