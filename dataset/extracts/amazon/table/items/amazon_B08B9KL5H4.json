                "reviewText": "We ordered this table to hold plants over top of a radiator and not its intended use as a commercial seminar table. This table is supposed to be heat tolerant and sturdy. I can attest that it is sturdy and the perfect size for fitting over a four foot radiator. It holds a decent amount of plants with no sagging. We have not had the heat on yet but the table is far enough above the radiator that I\u2019m not expecting any distortion. It was listed as being able to be used outside in the sun which would be a much higher temperature with UV degradation than my 65 degree basement with solar gray windows. I am very pleased with this product. We looked at a number of tables and sizes because these tables have support braces and it was going over the top of something. This table fits perfectly over a four foot radiator with a little room to spare. The price was great also for a quality table.",

Other than that its a fantastic item and feels quality! If this item ever gets updated send me one and I will review it on my ESENTL Youtube channel",
