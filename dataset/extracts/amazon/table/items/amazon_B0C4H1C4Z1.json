The size is perfect for my small room, fitting in just right without taking up too much space. Despite its compact size, it offers ample surface area for my work essentials. One of the best features is that it allows me to comfortably fit both of my monitors, which is essential for my work. The quality is excellent, and it was easy to assemble. I highly recommend this desk to anyone looking for a practical yet stylish solution for their home office!",

Very lightweight, stylish, and has other minimal features that fit her minimal room aesthetic. There\u2019s a built-in side pocket fits her homework binder and notepads which is perfect and there are hooks attached to the other side of the table where she hangs her mini backpacks and whatever else. Easy to assemble and move around.I\u2019d give it 5 stars if the corners weren\u2019t so sharp, I had to add table corner pads that make it look funny. Overall, we love it. Worth the price.",

This desk's legs are inset a few inches on each side while the top extends out to 47\" which is exactly what I needed. The espresso gray color is very modern. Also love the storage pocket and hooks. Setup was simple, just pay attention to the instructions. The main downside of this desk is it's only 20\" deep so my large monitor and keyboard feel cramped.",

It comes with little tools to put the screws in so you don\u2019t have to use your own tools, which is a plus. It\u2019s nice and sturdy and looks exactly how it does in the photos. It\u2019s beautiful and feels high-quality. The only bad thing is the instructions seem to be poorly translated from another language and are very vague and confusing. Despite this issue, the average person should still be able to easily put it together because it\u2019s a simple process. Would recommend.",
