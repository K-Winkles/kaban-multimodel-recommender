So, I picked this one because I could use it without the casters to get my desired height.Easy to assemble, sturdy and they are as stable as a tall and narrow table can be.Plus, you get two tables for the price of one.",

But I really think it looks pretty good for the price, certainly much better than the little cooler I was using for a table! It fits perfectly for the small space by my recliner. I was very pleasantly surprised by how sturdy and wobble free it is. The legs have plastic inserts for you to put screws into and on the bottom the foot pads are adjustable so that you can eliminate any wobble. The only tool needed was a small Phillips head screwdriver and the Allen wrenches that came in the box. It\u2019s very simple to put together. Everything is labeled although the sticker had come off of one of the little bags of screws. The pictures are clear enough that it was easy to determine which screw goes where. You can see in the pictures plastic and metal inserts for the screws to go into. Also an iPad and 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper along with recliner for a size comparison. Very happy with this little table and love the fact that it has charging ports on it.",

Gave it 3 out of 5 stars though bc on the second table I built, one of the legs that you have to screw in was broken. It was a giant pain with one already being built to have to undo everything to send it back for a replacement(only option Amazon returns provides), so I ended up doing a \u201ctape and glue job\u201d on the broken piece to get it together, but I wouldn\u2019t exactly label that table as sturdy now lol. Bit disappointing in that for the price,so you do take your chances in buying this set.",

Just note they are very narrow only 7.5\u201d wide but I have a nice lamp on each of them with an Alexa pop. I also have on the bottom shelf my router, modem, and telephone.
