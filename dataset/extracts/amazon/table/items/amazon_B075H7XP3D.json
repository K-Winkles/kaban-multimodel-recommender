The assembly directions couldn\u2019t be simpler and it took me all of 5 minutes to put together. Table was well-packed too. Honestly, better and sturdier than I expected.

Do not entrust anything precious to reside on it but it serves it's purpose well to hold a lamp. The storage drawer is also very handy.",

It\u2019s perfect for me because I really needed a bedside table/drawer to put my important knickknacks on and in for easy access, with not much to spend and extremely minimal space to work with as you can see. Before now I kept my phone and remotes and other stuff on the bed with me and was always losing it lol... I had nowhere within easy reach to put a drink or other stuff and cords were all over the floor. So this is nice.The table portion is a very sturdy decent quality particle board and the legs are a hard plastic which I expected considering the price. The drawer is optional and I actually was able to fit a lot more in it than I expected.The assembly was quick and easy. I was able to put it together in five minutes and without help, which is rare because I\u2019m terrible at assembling things. No tools were needed just twist on the multiple legs.It\u2019s nothing fancy and a little wobbly on carpet but super cute and handy.A really Great buy for the price!",

The wood is vinyl coated particle board and while the vinyl makes it water resistant, any water will destroy the 'wood'. The drawer is actually a fabric bin and just sits on the shelf with a large gap of almost an inch above it.That said, it's the perfect table for my purposes. Keep in mind the weight limit for the table is 15 lbs. Will NOT support a small 3-5 gallon aquarium and I would not use anything with water around it.",
