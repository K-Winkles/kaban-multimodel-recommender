                "reviewText": "I know other's have also said this and I didn't read the reviews before I purchased this unfortunately. The \"gold\" is just a flat mustard color, not gold at all. I could spray paint it or something but I don't care that much. The table is a little wobbly but that's not surprising given how the base is shaped. Mine was at least level. And the top of the table is a little smaller than I expected but it will work for holding a drink and my phone while sitting at the couch. Definitely too small for my MacBook Pro but I'll make do.On the plus side, this was super easy to put together. The faux walnut wood finish is pretty realistic looking and I actually like that it's basically plastic so I don't have to worry about water rings. I like the shape of the table - it's a little more versatile and ergonomic than a rectangular or square top. Overall this will work for my needs.",

Color is WAY off - the gold base? It\u2019s more of a flat mustard yellow. The base was welded so poorly it barely went together. Am I keeping? Yes, probably because I have a knee injury and am stuck in the couch for a few weeks and as stated once we finally got it together it does work. Shipping was so slow I really just want to use my table. Nothing a hammer some spray paint won\u2019t fix but definitely not worth $60.",
