                "reviewText": "For the money this is hard to beat for a nice little sofa table. Crazy how small of a box it comes in but it was very easy to put together and instructions where good. It looks nice, it\u2019s plenty sturdy for normal decorations, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to sit on it for any length of time though. Having the two power outlets is honestly amazing. Being able to plug laptop chargers, phone chargers, decorations that require power and so forth makes this table worth every penny. But nothing is perfect and the big flaw with this table is the usb power outlets. They basically don\u2019t work. I mean technically they do work and when you plug a phone into them the phone does say it\u2019s charging, but it\u2019s such a low amount of power that they literally can\u2019t charge a phone. Most of the time it just keeps your phone from losing more battery and some bigger phones like a 14 pro max will still lose charge while plugged directly into the usb ports, it just doesn\u2019t lose charge as quickly vs it not being plugged in. I think the usb outlets would be fine for like an LED light strip or something like that maybe. But as far as charging a phone you will need to plug a charger into the actual power outlet, which isn\u2019t a big deal and it\u2019s still convenient having it right there behind you.",
