                "reviewText": "This decorative entryway table is elegant and looks good with the overall refreshed theme of my home. The table is pretty heavy, but it's also sturdy and feels pretty secure once propped up. This is meant to be covered with decorations anyway, which will hide any, let's say, imperfections that might be present with this. Draping a piece of cloth over it, and putting little knick knacks over it will do it wonders. I'm pretty satisfied with this, and my guests love it too. It's not the best, but it works.",
