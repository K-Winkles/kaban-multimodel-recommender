I wouldn't suggest using with an actual computer keyboard as it is not very comfortable to type. The bottom tray is fixed and a tight size for a keyboard. I use it for to hold my mouse and I have small hands and I have to position it pretty carefully to be able to use it. I mostly use it to hold my cell phone while charging. Table is very portable and can hold a laptop quite easily. Wheels lock when you don't want the table to move around. Good value for the price.",
