                "reviewText": "Assembly tip: follow directions haha do NOT attach both ends to the rails before inserting shelves. I made this mistake and it was WORK to get the shelves in. Otherwise assembly is a snap and all I needed was a screwdriver. Should take about 20 minutes or less if done right.We\u2019ve been using this table for a few weeks and so far it\u2019s been great. I was sick of bending over and breaking my back so I purchased this and it\u2019s a life saver. I\u2019m 5\u20195 and my husband is 6\u20193 and we both find the height to work.It seems quite sturdy even on my uneven bathroom floor. I just slid a diaper under one leg to even it out ha!There\u2019s a changing pad with belt included but I wanted to use my keekaroo since it\u2019s easier to clean and it fits perfectly!The shelves are great size as you can see I fit some large diaper boxes under and there\u2019s plenty of room for baskets if you prefer a more organized look!Some reviews said the blue was more purple. I think it looks bright blue but my husband thinks it looks purple so I included a picture of the table next to a true navy blue bootie so you can get an idea.As the item is a temporary furnishing we were very indifferent and I just ordered whatever color was the cheapest so purpley blue-ish works for us but it may not be for everyone.For the price this is Perfect and exactly what we needed.",
