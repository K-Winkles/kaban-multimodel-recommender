                "reviewText": "The desk itself is fine. No assembly, pretty easy to unfold, and seems sturdy enough for a home office or homework desk. Problem for me was color. I looked in the questions prior to purchase to make sure the oak desk was white metal, not cream, which the answer said it was. It is not. My Photo shows the desk next to something white. It also had several stains, as shown in my other photo. No it wasn\u2019t dirt. Too much trouble to return so I just painted over the stains white, which is what I wanted. If the color or having stains matter to you, beware.UPDATE: Guys. This company has the best customer service. They emailed asking me about the product. I basically told them everything in my review and they wanted to make it right. I was happy because the desk itself was great and I wanted white so painting over the stains was not a big deal. Don't hesitate to buy anything from this company. They want to make sure you're satisfied.",

Will update with a photo later if possible!",
