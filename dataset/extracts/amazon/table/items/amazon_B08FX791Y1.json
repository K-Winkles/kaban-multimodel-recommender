                "reviewText": "This was a great find for a bar table! I am mixed if i want to use this as like a bar table with seats, or use it as like a bar counter for drinks. You definitely have the space to put bar seats which i like, and it is slim enough for a drink counter as well. The wood top is lovely, nice and thin, light weight and easy to move around. The instructions were only a few steps and did not take long to assemble at all, I would recommend using two people, just because of how long it is. I really like this bar top, but with it being so thin and narrow, it is a little wobbly. The feet do help stabilize it, but i think with it being narrow, its hard to be perfectly level. But a great value and worth it still.",
