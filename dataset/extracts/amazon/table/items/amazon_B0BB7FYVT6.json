                "reviewText": "This is a great small side table & was exactly what I was looking for. It was super easy to assemble, took me all of 5 minutes! It's stable, as it has adjustable leveling feet on the bottom, in case your floors aren\u2019t level. This adjustable feet makes this table super stable. It also has suction cups that pop into holes on the frame where the trays fit, these suction cups are what separates this table from others on Amazon. The suction cups hold both round trays in place! The trays are packaged individually in plastic to keep the black finish from getting scratched in shipping. I purchased this table due to the open bottom, as it is in a small area beside a favorite chair and the openness makes the area look larger than if I had a solid table. The table is very stable & it looks so much more expensive than what I purchased it for. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. The table was everything & more than what I expected! If you\u2019re looking for a small table, that lends to openness, looks chic & you\u2019re on a budget this is IT!",

It was very easy to set up as well.Some issues I have about the table is that there are some random holes in the sides of the top and bottom \u201cplates\u201d. I don\u2019t think they serve any purpose either (unless I set it up wrong lol). The top and bottom plates also can spin around which I don\u2019t love.",

Great for food delivery or when your hands are too full to unlock the door :) the color is more sage green than I had expected, but is still beautiful. Assembly is very easy and user friendly. Maybe not the most sturdy table in the world, but for its price I think it performs well. The box came with all the tools necessary for assembly (no missing parts), didn\u2019t need to use a screw driver from my (small) toolkit :) the only thing I wish I paid more attention to is the caps at the top. I used to have a table just like this that was all the same color, but this one has little white end caps, which I don\u2019t love. I would have preferred the caps to be the same color, but hey if that\u2019s my only complaint I would call this table a success!",

I bought a jute basket to sit under the tray for blankets, and an 18\" round piece of tempered glass to sit on the top for funtionability.It does not fold unless the screws holding the legs to the tray support are removed. For this, and the fact the description states that the table is a folding one, I have removed a star. Other than this I like this table. The paint seems durable. There is a small hole in the upright of the tray presumably to drain water? It does not affect the looks or performance.",
