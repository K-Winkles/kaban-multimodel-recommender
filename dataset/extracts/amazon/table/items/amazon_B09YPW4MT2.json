This c-shaped side table does not have wheels. but you may buy some wheels from other store and try to match these two end tables, but need to pay attention to the match screw Does the set of 2 comes in separate packages or in one package? This c shaped end tables set of 2 comes in one package. How far off the ground is the top of the bottom bar? Trying to figure out if this will fit under my couch The top of the bottom bar is 1.5 inches above the floor. Can you push the two tables together to look like one long table? Yes. The supports don\u2019t exceed length of tops.",

Just measure your sofa and the description on Amazon shows a picture with all measurements. No one should be surprised.So EASY to put together and I\u2019m a 75 year-old grandma. Each piece is clearly marked (the stickers come off easy if removed slowly) and hardware is separately bagged. There\u2019s even a bag of \u201cspares\u201d! Directions have pictures and clear instructions. Bravo!!",

                "reviewText": "Very attractive tables. They were shorter than we anticipated, which is our fault for not reading the sizing description clearly. Look closely at that so you know if it'll work for you or not. They're too short to use comfortably as a tray table for comfortably eating a meal while sitting on the couch. They're too short to go over the arm rest of our couch, too. But we ended up using them as small side tables for a rocking chair and will use them for guests when they come over so they have somewhere to set their drink or phone, or whatever and they're great for that. Very nice colors. Seem to be good and sturdy, don't wobble too easily even when our boisterous dog is running around playing with toys and bumps into them. Way sturdier than the fold-able tray tables, that's for sure. Would make a great item for small spaces or corners when you need a surface but don't have a ton of room. Assembled quickly and easily. Highly recommended, just make sure you look closely at sizing so it'll fit what you need it to do.",
