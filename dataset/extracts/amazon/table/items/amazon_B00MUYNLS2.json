It cleans up easily with soap and water. The legs fold in all the way and do not stick out making it easy to store this table in narrow spots.I give it four stars for maneuverability as it is not as light as some lower quality tables and can be just a little cumbersome if you move it without folding or perhaps, elderly or frail.I would buy this table again and again.",

And they have so many uses -- you can play cards at them, work jigsaw puzzles, use for storage, dining, play table for kids, extra storage table, there are a multitude of uses. You will love this table because....*Super heavy duty and sturdy*Waterproof*Stain resistant*Gray locking legs*Maximum weight is 220 pounds*Seats four adults comfortablyThis table's cover is 1.75\" granite. It is nice, smooth, and looks goods. The legs are strong and sturdy and come with protective floor caps. The table measures approximately 34\"W x 34\"D x 29\"H.We have used this table in many different ways since we received. We also use it to put our newly purchased food items on and keep them there until we have sanitized them. This is much better than keeping them on the floor and bending over so many times to clean the items. We have also used this for playing PARCHEESI with the grand kids, having lunch with the grands, and a puzzle.The table comes assembled and is easy to slide in your car to use at sales, work, or lend out to someone. It folds up nicely and is easy to store if not in use.The uses for this strong, sturdy, good looking table are endless. It is worth every penny, will last forever, and looks good at the same time!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
