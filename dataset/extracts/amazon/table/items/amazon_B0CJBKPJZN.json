It has wheels and rolls under the sofa up against my waist and I use it for my laptop computer, a writing desk, or a desk to set my yarn on while I am crocheting. It takes up very little space when not in use. I am very happy with this purchase and am thankful to have found it available from Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I'm no stranger to prefab furniture, having assembled literally dozens of pieces over the years. Unfortunately, this is one of the most flimsy and cheaply made pieces of junk I've ever seen! The metal tubing is extremely thin and bends easily, and the welds are very weak and shoddy. There is almost no structural support for the top of the cart, and it flexes significantly with just a little bit of weight. Words simply cannot describe how disappointing this thing is. Luckily, I'm pretty good at fabrication, so I can add the structural support necessary to make it work as intended.There is no way I could ever recommend this computer cart to anyone!",
