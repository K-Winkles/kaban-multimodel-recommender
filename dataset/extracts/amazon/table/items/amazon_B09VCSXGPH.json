        "description": "This square end table offers chic storage and stylish design. Its small, square shape fits easily as a side table or end table next to furniture. The 20 inch tabletop and lower storage shelf provide ample space for item storage or display. Use this table to keep items easily accessible but still in their place with purposeful design. This end table has a steel frame with a high quality engineered wood table top and storage shelf. The shelf and tabletop have a laminate exterior in a dark faux woodgrain design. The laminate ensures the tabletop and shelf are durable and easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth. The warm-toned wood grain design adds a natural element that mixes with the metal frame for a sleek, modern restoration look. This square end table has an open, airy design with a table top and shelf that almost appear to float with the minimalist metal frame. This helps prevent the table from looking heavy and clunky in your space, especially in smaller or more crowded spaces. While this piece is popularly used as an end table or side table, its sleek and simple cube design and small profile make it a great choice for a variety of uses. It\u2019s the perfect height for an end or side table, but also as a nightstand or a low profile table in any space. This end table is easy to put together and comes ready to assemble. This piece coordinates with other pieces in the Household Essentials Black Oak Furniture line.",

Ordered some drink organizers to go on shelf as well. Easy to assemble and came well packaged with no damage. It is not made to shake around a lot\u2026.so if you need something super sturdy or your baby will be pulling up on it\u2026.this is NOT for you. This is for the \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend much to organize this area \u201c person. I would recommend.",

Since it was difficult for him to get up to go to the fridge, I got him one of those small refrigerators for next to his chair. Bought this table to set it on, and it worked perfectly. It was also nice having the shelf below to put other things on that were beneficial to have next to him. Very nice table. Recommend it.",

Buying furniture at a lower cost can be a gamble, but I took the plunge on this one after some research and am very happy with my purchase.",
