                "reviewText": "Arrived in good packaging, easy to understand instruction, and is actually easy to assemble. Best part of this table is that you can choose how would you like the table to be. It is beyond the two different options that they present The only negative I found so far, and this could be crucial to someone, is that the holes drilled on the legs are not centered, I bought two packages and none of the legs had its holes drilled at the center. Which means that when you put everything together, the legs don't look straight because how they are put together.",
