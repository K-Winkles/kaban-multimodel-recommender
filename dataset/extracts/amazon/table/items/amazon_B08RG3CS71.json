        "description": "This dining table set with a drop-leaf table and 2 chairs delivers maximum style and functionality while taking up minimal space. Laminated in a dark taupe wood-look finish for a rustic touch, the tabletop and drop leaves feature thick-panel construction and are finished on all sides for a polished look even when the leaves are down. Lift up one leaf, both leaves, or keep them both down according to the surface space you need. The table legs and chair frames are in metal with a black finish for a modern look. The chair seats are padded and upholstered in a black faux leather fabric for comfort. This 3-piece set for small spaces is ideal for eat-in kitchens, apartments, and dorm rooms, and is so versatile that it can be used for more than just dining. The all-purpose round table can function as an office desk for studying or working from home and as an accent table for displaying decorative items, while the lightweight yet sturdy chairs can serve as a desk chair or guest chairs. Additional measurements: Depth of chair seat: 14.5 inches Height of chair back from seat: 15 inches Height from floor to seat: 18 inches",
