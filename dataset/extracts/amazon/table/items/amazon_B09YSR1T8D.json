                "reviewText": "I was really happy with this when I finished assembling it. Assembly got a little tricky when putting the grill sides in - they don't really get screwed on, are inset into slots. Once I got it all together it was sturdy. But getting them to stay in place until I screwed the wood frame around them was hard. Maybe a more experienced person would have figured out an easier method than I could. But it got done and is exactly what I needed. Nice looking, does not wobble, very sturdy. Great for keeping things in place that previously I kept knocking off. Instructions were pretty good, but be sure to study them very carefully and read them all the way through before starting. Exploded view not extremely clear.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 3 of these side tables to serve as bedside tables in two different rooms (2 in one and 1 in another). I selected these as I have other furniture in both rooms that have black metal bases and wood tops. I figured they would compliment each other and wasn\u2019t worried about the wood matching exactly since they are on opposite sides of the room. All in all, they fit nicely in the small spots I had available. Now that I\u2019ve bored you with why I selected these tables, here\u2019s the important stuff about them.The first one was a breeze to assemble. Instructions were alright, but could have been explained a littl better. Thank goodness for pictures. The second one not so much. If it had been the first box I opened I would have sent them all back. The metal was a little warped and it was the most difficult of the 3 to assemble. The third was not near as warped, only one little bit. I was able to make all three and once I got them together they all look fine and you can\u2019t tell which had issues.They are fairly sturdy. I wouldn\u2019t it on it though as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that strong. Great for a drink and a place to leave a cell phone while charging, a shelf for a book or two, and the bottom storage bin for whatever floats your boat.If I need a fourth in the future, would I order it again? Yes, just so they match. Is this the table I would pick starting over? Maybe not. Price is fair.",
