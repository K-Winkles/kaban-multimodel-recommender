                "reviewText": "Arrived with a broken hinge for the magazine rack. It seemed to be well package, so I'm thinking it was broken before shipping.I had laid every piece out and made sure everything was there, BUT I didn't unfold the magazine rack! So I was half way through putting it together, grabbed the magazine rack to put it in, and noticed the broken hinge. VERY disappointed. I would not recommend buying this, but if you decide to chance it, make sure your magazine rack isn't broken BEFORE you start putting it together. :(I know it looks fine in the picture by the chair, but I put some clear tape on the broken corner of the magazine rack. It won't be strong enough to hold anything, but maybe I'll try hot gluing it in the future.Also, another side note, it isn't the most sturdy table. But, it is nice how small it is. Just be careful when you set your cup of tea down on it...",
