                "reviewText": "We bought this to put in our bedroom to use for the first 6 months before they could start staying in their nursery. It was easy to build & will definitely get the job done for what we need. But it doesn\u2019t quite look like it will hold up over a long period of time. I watched my neighbors baby, who\u2019s just shy of a year old & he\u2019s very tall/long, 20lbs. I put them on the changing table & he was almost too long haha but the table held up well to his weight & it didn\u2019t shake or move a lot as I changed their diaper. Very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "Love this changing table. It fits the cube organizer storage shelves perfectly (11x11) and is easy to put together. We put ours on carpet and were concerned about it not being sturdy, but with all the stuff you store on the bottom shelves, it\u2019s perfectly fine.I would recommend buying a separate changing pad since the one it comes with is really thin.Also, shipping to Hawaii took long (over 3 weeks). Not sure if it\u2019s because of COVID-19, but just plan ahead.",
