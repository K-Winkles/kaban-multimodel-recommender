                "reviewText": "So much sturdier than I had thought.it\u2019s the perfect size for our little cabin, and love the color! There is plenty of height to scoot under the table and have extra space from thighs to rack.It has metal inserts in stool seat so the screws were not going directly into wood so the screws tighten down very good. I ordered pads to put on seat, but not sure if we will need them. The directions were fine, though we found that if you put the back rest on (before you put the seat on) you can get the seat holes lined up better , because you need to have the legs where they cross,tightened down before you screw the seat on. Also it takes some wiggling and tugging to get the screws all lined up so you don\u2019t strip them out, and make sure you have the legs crossed right so holes line up for back. It came with all the hardware plus one extra of each , for just in case. Also came with the 2 tools you need to put it together. A hex wrench and a little wrench. It took 2 of us (me just being a helping hand while hubby did the work;) less than 1 hour to put this together , it would have been 1/2 the time if We had did it when we had more light as it was pretty dark when we started. Shipping was fast , and I am thrilled!!)",

It was wobbly at first but what I had to do was just tighten the screw and nut at the same time. I used the two tools provided in order to do that. The seat itself was also difficult. Getting all the screws lined up and in the right place was a challenge. But it worked out fine, it just takes a lot of patience.Nothing about the table was hard. It does wobble a little but all the legs touch the floor and the wobble isn\u2019t too noticeable.Though it was time consuming trying to fit the parts together perfectly and involved a ton of troubleshooting. This product is sturdy, perfect for small spaces, and looks great.",

I love the set, i just moved into my new place and goes with the decor very well, it's so cute and fits very nicely in the corner, the table went together beautifully, has easy to read and follow directions the ONLY issues I have is that one of my chairs wasn't welded together properly and can't be used at all and the other can be sat in but the backing doesn't line up to be able to screw it together so it pinches. Please help would definitely love to have set up in my new place. Pics and vids included.",

I bought it in addition to my computer desk unit I already have and it accents it perfectly for somewhere else to sit if I don't sit at my desk. It came in Black wood which matches my desk set perfectly too. It was super easy to put together in no time flat. No complicated words, just \"picture\" instructions to follow and the parts and hardware were clearly labeled which I loved! I highly recommend if you want something like this set to fit into a small space. I rated 5 stars!!! I am very happy with this excellent purchase!",
