                "reviewText": "This coffee table fits well in our smallish living room. The wood veneer is a very nice color and looks like it will be pretty scratch resistant. The metal legs are well made with clean welds, and the table is sturdy once assembled. The corners are fairly sharp, so use some cation if you have little kids.The table was fairly easy to assemble, with a couple of things that might cause trouble for someone who hasn\u2019t assembled many of these before. The first thing I found was a couple of the threads for the fixed nuts in the legs still had some metal that wasn\u2019t cleared. The screws would not go in at all, so I had to get my tap set and clean them out. You may be able to clean them with a heavy metal brush. The second issue was a little more minor, but the legs didn\u2019t quite line up well when being assembled, so make sure to very loosely put the screws in until everyone is in and they are lined up, once you do that they can be tightened and will be straight when it\u2019s all together.",
