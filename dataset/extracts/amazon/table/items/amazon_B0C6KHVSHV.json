I like the fact that both table and chairs can easily be adjusted as the child grows. I bought during a sale for $83. The chairs are a bit slippery on our hardwood floors but are also stable due to the angled legs. The set is fairly easy to move around and is a good balance between being light enough to carry and strong and stable.",
