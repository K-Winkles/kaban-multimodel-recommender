                "reviewText": "I was a little torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I went with 5, and I'll explain why.My only complaint is that the color is not really as pictured. Other reviewers have said the same. Indeed, it does not look like natural wood up close. I don't mind that; I liked the idea of the grey top. It's less grey than a sort of combo grey-brown, a little paler than a natural wood would look. I like that because it's more airy and modern, but be aware that the color is less pure grey than you might expect.It was incredibly easy to put together. You really don't even need the instructions, just use common sense. Took about ten minutes by myself.It is also, as others have noted, a shorter desk than average. However, I - as a 5' 4'' woman - consistently have issues with desks that are just an inch or so too high, and when I work for a prolonged period of time my arms get a little tired. This is a PERFECT height for me. The construction seems very stable (I just got it today so if this changes, I'll write another review), especially for the price. It's wide enough to be roomy, allow me to keep things on both sides of the desk while still having space for me to move around and work on my computer in the middle. I really love it. Great for the price.",

                "reviewText": "There is so much going for this unconventional table, and so little wrong.First off, as said in other reviews, this is not a desk. It's about the hight of a school desk. Not something you would want to work at unless you're in the under-5 foot set. This would be great as an entrance table, where you drop your keys and mail, admire the fresh flower arrangement and set down your gloves, hat, and cigarette case before regaling your lover about today's traffic while enjoying a well-deserved cocktail they had the Spidey senses to pour a mere minute before you arrived.Pros: The legs look great. They *look* solid like re-bar, but they're hollow and lightweight making the table easier to move. The top is not wood, but a fairly passable oak laminate, like laminate flooring. At first glance it looks solid, but it doesn't take much effort to see that the edge laminate does not line up with the ends of the \"planks\". Another PRO: the bottom of the table is finished. This sat at the top of a staircase and looked fine.Cons: The word \"desk\" in the description. This is much too small for that, an odd duckling of a size and height of standard tables (too low, short for a console table, too deep for an entrance table, too large as an end table).I've moved this piece a few times, and it now lives in my home office holding paperwork I don't want to deal with. I've put a retro school chair in front of it for fun. And because it looks like I have under-aged employees without dealing with pesky child labor laws.I'm tempted to buy the matching TV stand/entertainment center and swap the legs. (http://www.amazon.com/Ameriwood-Industries-Altra-42-Inch-Gunmetal/dp/B00L27K5KK/ref=pd_bxgy_196_text_z)Not much of a hack, but this table's top is a good size for a coffee table, and I think it would look great to have the A/V components at this table's height in the other table's top.",
