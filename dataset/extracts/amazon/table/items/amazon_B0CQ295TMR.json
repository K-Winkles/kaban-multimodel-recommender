Everything came well packaged and the instructions were easy to follow.The quality of this table is very good. Once assembled, it looks great. It is the perfect record player and album holder. It's the exact perfect size for what I needed.I'm excited that my record player now has its own permanent home and I can keep my records right with it.This is a nice piece, looks nice, and is sturdy. I think it's very well made. I do recommend it.",

I was able to put this together in about 30 minutes while taking my time, and I am very impressed with the sturdiness of this table. The back cross-supports add additional stability, and I think you could drive over this with a tank and it wouldn't bend.The screw-on bumpers on the bottom mean you can adjust all four legs in case there is a wobble, and this will fix that quickly with the self adjustable leg ends. Overall, perfect design and execution of a small table.",

Also, the led light strip had a bad connection and wouldn't operate unless it was held in place with a 3m adhesive strip so the ac adapter cable wouldn't move. I would still recommend buying, but be mindful of the problems and be gentle with the led strip.",

                "reviewText": "This table is perfect and just what we needed for our record player!I will say this before going into the details: Please check the size of your record player and compare it to the measurements rather than eye ball it like we did. We almost could not use this table because the image makes it look like it is larger than it actually is, but luckily the feet of our record player fit exactly on the table top.Now that that warning is out of the way, I will say that this table is absolute perfection! The LED strip that it comes with is so cool and comes with a remote for different settings. My favorite setting is the one that flashes the lights to the beat of the music, so cool.I also love how it had the holders, which you can either have this shelf in the middle or the bottom. These little holders allow you to keep your records organized and at arms length for easy access. The table itself is very modern chic looking and it was incredibly easy to build. I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying to amplify their space!",

It was quite simple to put together, but there are a lot of different hardware pieces, which makes it kind of a pain to deal with. I like when Furniture only requires a couple different types of hardware. There was really no need for all the different types to be included. Otherwise it\u2019s great adjustable feet in case your floor is not level.",
