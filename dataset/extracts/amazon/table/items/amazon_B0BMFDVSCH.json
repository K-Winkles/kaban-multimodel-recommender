A major factor that helps the table is the solid, single-piece wooden tabletop. The USB and electrical plugs on the table are very convenient, and the cable to power them is a good length that allows you to plug in the table without having so much excess cord that you have to do a lot of work to hide it from sight. When first plugging items into the outlet, it was a tight fit that took some effort, but we have never had any problems with it.",
