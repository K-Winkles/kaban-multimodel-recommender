                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I decided to give this five stars instead of four now that I see how much it is helping my baby. I gave it four stars before because there were some imperfections in the wood. But I easily sanded smooth the inside of the butterfly cutout and can glue the crack on the monkey.My baby loves his table so much! It helps him side sit and kneel and engages his fine motor skills. If he is on his tummy or sitting upright on his bottom, I tilt the table so it\u2019s a vertical busy board in front of him and that gives him a new way to reach and play. This table is the perfect height for a baby getting mobile and sitting up on their legs, so I recommend it for that development stage which is usually sooner than the age the package recommends, which is 12 months. If you receive one that is damaged, I encourage you to try to get a replacement because it really is a great toy!***********My baby boy is 10 months old and was hooked on his new activity table as soon as I gave it to him. There are so many little things for his fingers to do and the design is cute with animals. I like the color scheme because it\u2019s not the same ol\u2019 bold primary colors on all other toys. It was fun watching my baby discover each activity. He looked busy at work! It\u2019s a bit too tall for him while sitting down, so I sat and held him on a foam step to get him higher. When he can pull himself up onto his knees more, he will like to play that way. The only complaint I have is that the monkey door is cracked halfway through. I\u2019m concerned this will break a chunk off so I will have to try glue to seal the crack. Paint on the snake was chipped, too. And the butterfly cut out on the circle spinner is raw cut wood, not smooth like the rest. Maybe I can put clear nail polish over that. I think it\u2019s a cute table overall! But really, should be priced lower than $36. So nice to not have unnecessary lights and sound and tons of plastic, though.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good for 5mo+",
                "reviewText": "As others have said, despite the recommend age on the box, if the baby can sit with at least some support, then they can enjoy this. My 5mo old enjoys fiddling with the pieces. But so does my 4 year old. This is a plus because it helps them interact despite the age gap and despite the fact that my baby cannot talk or crawl yet.It is about sitting height and a little bit larger than the average fast-food tray. This works great for us as we don't have a lot of room for toys that sit out taking up floor space.The construction seems sturdy and it went together without trouble.The reason I knocked of a star was because the packaging was pittful. The box containing the legs was not closed, and the package containing the screws had popped open under the weight of the screws. This resulted in a couple of dings in the wood from the screws and legs rolling around in the box. It's surprising that it was not worse. It was not too bad so we kept it, but I'm glad I got it on a good sale. Something with this poor packaging would not be worth full price.All in all, I'd totally recommend it for its entertainment value, but buy it on sale if you can. And if you're gifting it, open it up and check it first.",
