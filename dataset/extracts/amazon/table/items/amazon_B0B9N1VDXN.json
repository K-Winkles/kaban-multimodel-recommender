                "reviewText": "While I thought the price was a bit high, the product works as advertised. I used block like furniture lifts first and found my folding table tipping over more than once. Once I installed this product, I had no more issues with my folding table tipping. What I like about this product is that I can slide the table around a bit while it is still lifted. I use the folding table as a home desk and like to pull the table back and over my lap while reclined to watch movies or play games.",

However, the table leg will not reach far enough down the inside of the tube despite the listing stating that they are compatible with \u201cbent\u201d & \u201cwhishbone\u201d table legs. These table leg extensions only work for straight table legs.",
