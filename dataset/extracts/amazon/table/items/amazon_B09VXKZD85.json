                "reviewText": "I have this next to a reading chair and while I may not be putting a light on the table, its effective for placing our electronics on it while they are charging. Its short enough that its perfect height for sitting and would be perfect next to a standard height bed, if used for a nightstand. I do wish it had a small drawer for the cords, as I bought Apple and Android USB cables for guests to charge as well. The charging ports all work well as well, charging fast for both Apple and Android products. Assembly was fast and easy, maybe takina total of 20 minutes and the instructions were clear so I didnt have to take anything apart and put it back together and no additional tools were needed, as they provided everything needed.",

Rating 4 stars because it seems during fabrication one of the legs got the holes for the screws on the wrong side. Husband was able to saw off a portion that attaches to the table top so not a big deal. And the bottoms are adjustable so no wiggly table. I\u2019d still very highly recommend these to anyone looking for some affordable AND useful end tables.",

The packaging was great, the parts are effectively separated, all the tools (two Allen keys) are provided, and the instructions clear. They went together really easily. Only a couple holes were slightly misaligned but it took a couple seconds and some extra concentration to get through it. Both tables were assembled and put to use within 20 minutes.The tables themselves are small. I like it, it works really well with my space, but double check the measurements to ensure you understand what you're getting: I feel like they look bigger in the listing.They're fairly sturdy for a side table. Again, they're cheap furniture, so don't expect to use them to prop yourself up or barricade a door or anything lolOverall, I have zero regrets and would buy again but I don't think I'll ever need to. Maybe when technology gets to the point that they generate electricity from the magnetosphere or something, I'll look at upgrading.",
