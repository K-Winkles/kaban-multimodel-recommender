The table is attractive and serves its purpose.Cons: The screwdriver is \"short\" and can be difficult to use when attaching multiple screws. The bottom panels did not come with pre-drilled holes to secure the metal brackets. That was difficult if you didn't have a drill. Pre-drilled holes would have been appreciated.The two top panels on the table don't seem to flush. When assembled, one panel was about a 1/4 inch off from the other panel. I'm still trying to figure out why. The bottom panels are fine.The company apologized for the problem and offered a small refund. Great company to work with and very responsive to my emails.",

In the right light you can see a hint of grey in it. The sides are not white. It also has a hint of grey. ( lighting is key). It looks great either way. Wasn\u2019t damaged in any way. Is sturdy. Quality is fine. For the price it is excellent. Mine is in a room that doesn\u2019t get used and that is the reason I didn\u2019t spend a fortune.
