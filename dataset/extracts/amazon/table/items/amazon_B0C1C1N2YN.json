                "reviewText": "First the good news. This table is remarkable in its design -- it is higher than many more expensive models, quite sturdy, and for its economic size has a lot of placing/storing potential for books, drinks, glasses, and whatever else you would want. And it moves, easily. I am pleased, as I viewed many other side tables that cost more and seemed to offer less.Now for the assembly caution. All the parts are labeled, but the pictures are small and the directions sparse. So it began: attach sides to the bottom (I believe B to A). OK, that was easy enough. But then nothing fit and I began to feel this table was cheap for a reason. And I was working alone, so the pieces would not always stay in place for ease of attachment. I felt frustrated, paused, took a deep breath, and then...of course, those four holes go on the bottom for the wheels. You can't see it in the picture. So I started over and the whole project went much more smoothly. Then I put on the two top wood pieces, and as a previous reviewer stated, they didn't match up. I didn't like that. So I stopped, breathed, and...why not switch out the two? I did so and they matched quite well. There is not instruction for this, it's a 50% chance of getting it right. But after my first error it just seemed possible there was more than one way these could fit. And, like I said earlier, I am quite satisfied with the result.",

During the day when I have to walk in and out of my room I can roll it by my desk, and at night when nobody\u2019s using the doorway I can roll it by the bed. This also proved to be able to store a lot more things than I had grown used to from using a nightstand previously and despite the wheels, do not feel wobbly at all. Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This came in such a small box that we had doubts it would work for us but it did. The top comes in 2 equal parts which go side by side on the top. The instructions were terrible but we figured it out on our own. Now that we're using it, it works great. My wife broke her foot, so we needed something that rolled around and carried her things. Nice little table.",
