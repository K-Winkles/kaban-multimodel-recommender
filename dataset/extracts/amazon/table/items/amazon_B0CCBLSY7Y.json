                "reviewText": "This is a nice, padded card table. I covered it with the box it came in for crafting, to protect from the hot glue, and paint. We wanted to use it for putting together puzzles in the winter, but the pad makes it hard. Also, under the padding there is a piece of trash and I am afraid it will eventually puncture it. I kept though because it would be a pain to return. I like it for crafting.",
