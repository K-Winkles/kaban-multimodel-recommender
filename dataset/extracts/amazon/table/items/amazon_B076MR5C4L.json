                "reviewText": "I wish amazon let you reply to comments because i have seen so many pictures of incorrect installation saying that it is not sturdy or they have to tighten down the screws. CHECK YOUR INSTALLATION AND LOOK AT THE PRODUCT PICTURE FOR REFERENCE. bought this item over a year ago and the only problem I have had with it is the paint discoloration. Wiping it down daily definitely strips the paint. Other than that it's super incredible sturdy. It has held up for over a year, no cracks, not wobbly, haven't had to tighten anything down. Definitely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this set in 2021 for my then 2 & 3yr old girls. My intention was to get something study that would last a while. It has exceeded my expectations and we still use it to this day. If you have toddlers you know they\u2019re not exactly careful with their items! My girls have used this daily since it was delivered. It\u2019s served as a meal table 3X a day, a craft table, coloring table, and then some. They have leaned back in the chairs, toted them around the house to climb, used them to help mommy with dishes and chores, as well as a podium to stand and sing on! I\u2019m back 2yrs later to purchase again as one of the chairs finally gave away. Please do not let this detour you, this chair has survived more than most over its 2yrs in my home.Pros:-Sturdy as heck, my 3yr old thinks she\u2019s Spider-Man and this chair has been her favorite crime fighting tool.-Easy to clean and forgiving of stains; I\u2019ve cleaned it with soap and water multiple times a day everyday and it\u2019s barely faded in a few spots.-Perfect size; I was worried it would be too small as my girls got older. My 5yr old is 64lbs and it\u2019s still very comfortable and convenient for her. We\u2019ve used it since my youngest daughter was almost 2yrs and it was never too large.Color and style- It\u2019s a nice neutral color, obviously made for children, but is not flimsy and colorful drawing a lot of attention. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is; it sits in my living room and isn\u2019t a site for sore eyes. It looks nice in the room and ties well with our other furniture.We love it and definitely recommend it!",
