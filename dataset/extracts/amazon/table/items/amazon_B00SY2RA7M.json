The price is more than fair and it DOES NOT FOLD IN THE MIDDLE, something I did not want. Its a bargain!",

                "reviewText": "Each year I make almost 100 small Christmas gifts for people with whom I do business during any given year (ie. bank, vet, post office, etc.). I love making them and being able to show people in the little town in which I live how much I appreciate them. The problem has always been coming up with a reasonable surface on which to place them as each gift dries between processes, as well as be able to store the finished products until I am ready to distribute them. This table solves both problems.First, it is lightweight, yet very sturdy, can easily hold whatever gifts I decide to make through all of the various processes; it is easy to set up and break-down to move; the size makes it easy to work around and walk around.I ordered one of these tables and when it arrived, I quickly ordered the second. Right now, I have them set up next to my painting table and they are perfect! I am just in the middle of making these year's gifts and it has been so easy to shuttle them between painting table and these tables, while still giving me plenty of room to walk around. When the project is finished, the tables and gifts will be moved to the storage side of my basement to wait for Christmas delivery. There, these tables mean the 100 gifts won't be in the way or on some big, clunky surface I keep running into until I start giving them. After that, the tables will easily fold and be stored out of the way until next year's gift production.These tables make my annual gift-making so much easier, especially the stages between between beginning and completion. Yes, it's the little things...and having the perfect platform to accommodate these little things through each process.",

                "reviewText": "I was really impressed for what you get for $30. I required a fairly small lightweight and portable table for a small gaming setup. It's perfect because I just moved without furniture and will use it for a few months until I order a nice desk. With two 27\" monitors, an Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch, it is fairly sturdy and does not move a whole lot. I can see how the vinyl would rip, but I think it's a fair trade off. It doesn't have the appearance of a bad plastic cheap table. I will say that if I had a single monitor, 27\" would be okay depending on how long the back part of the stand is. Unfortunately on one of mine, the thing is 10\" so the monitor is halfway in front of me so I had to position them to the corners. I'm planning on getting a better VESA stand anyways. Otherwise I'd say 27\" monitors are pushing it maxumum for this table but would be PERFECT for just putting down a laptop and/or docking it to a 24\" monitor. Needless to say, I do enjoy the minimalist aesthetic it gives.I can see this also coming in handy for other things once I'm done using it for my computer/gaming stuff. It's very easy to store and I was able to toss it in the backseat of my car.",
