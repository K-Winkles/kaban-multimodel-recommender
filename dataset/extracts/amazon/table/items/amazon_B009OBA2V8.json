It was so easy to assemble, just screw the legs into predrilled reinforced corners.Because of the very affordable price, we were expecting just average quality. We were wrong. This table is very sturdy, while the physical appearance is pleasing to the eye & feels & looks wonderful. The boxing & interior protection assured us that there was no shipping damage at all. ZERO, Great!We have set our 48\" new TV on it & were concerned about sturdiness. It turns out it is STURDY! With the TV sitting on it it does not wiggle at all. It is perfect for our application.We, to say the least, are so pleased with this Amazon purchase.",

                "reviewText": "When I moved into my first apartment many years ago, I built a coffee table out of flat rate shipping boxes, duct tape, and aluminum foil. It was lightweight, fairly sturdy, and actually pretty cool. It lasted a couple years. This DHP Parsons coffee table is one step up from that. It's basically made of stabilized cardboard or fiber board (Don't know the exact technical term). This is not a wooden table, it's a hollow fiberboard rectangle with hollow fiberboard legs. I've included photos so you can see the material underneath. My unit arrived with a minor dent on the underside, but I'm not going through the hassle of returning for a replacement because nobody can see that part anyway. This table has a very thin veneer that looks like dark wood, but any scratches will reveal the light-colored board underneath. It serves the need of holding cups, plates, a small plant or two, and other small items quite well. If your friend should sit on this table it would violently snap in half immediately, as it is not solid construction. It is PERFECTLY ADEQUATE for the purpose though, and I only gave it 4 stars because I located a cheaper table of similar construction at Ross, so I used to think this was a great deal but now it's only a fair one.",

While I haven't gotten that far yet...this is a great, cheap coffee table.PROS:--Relatively inexpensive.--Easy to move around--very lightweight.--Nice looking.--Seems fairly sturdy.CONS:--Might scoot across the floor at the slightest bump, being so light. I'm not sure, since the room I'm using it in is carpeted.--I think it would probably scuff/dent easily, so if you want it to stay nice and have children.....it probably won't happen. (But better this cheaper one get beat up than a designer piece?)--Might break right in two if sudden force (such as an adult falling) were applied. It's not THAT sturdy, I think.These cons are hypothesis, keep that in mind. Merely suppositions. But I'm trying to give you an accurate picture of this table. It is something I'd buy again, without question--even if I never get around to making that kotatsu!",

                "reviewText": "As many have indicated, this is a decently cheap coffee table and the quality reflects the price and vice versa depending on how you're trying to decide what to buy. As a point of comparison, most wood tables (not a \"wooden\" outer layer type like this one) will run you over a hundred dollars depending on your tastes, etc..This particular table is not really truly made of wood...it's more accurate to say it's made of wood byproduct like cardboard and wood pulp. As a result, save for the outer layer you see there isn't a lot in way of durable material. And therein lies part of the problem a lot of people and myself have had in purchasing and receiving the table.Since the table really isn't solid - solid in the sense you'd feel comfortable pushing down on it full force with an arm or elbow - it's also prone to damage during transport. Normal shipping bumps that would otherwise perforate the shipping board (cardboard) can damage the legs in particular due to the way they're packaged. The legs in the package are placed on both ends of the box, so these bumps and blows are usually focused there resulting in having a leg or two that's had the outer layer knocked in or deformed.In terms of assembly, you don't need any tools. The legs have screws preset in them and the bottom of the table has premade screw holes. Grab a leg, screw it in by hand, and repeat three more times. If, on the off chance, one of the legs is damaged such that the screw on the end is off-center you should return it immediately for a replacement. Attempting to assemble the table with a leg in this state will result in the leg being off kilter and no good, or the screw coming loose from the leg itself in attempting to screw it in if there's too much to-and-fro motion.Regarding stability, I believe some of the complaints people have had with it being wobbly may have screwed a leg or two in too tightly or loosely, but not discounting the possibility of one of the leg ends getting damaged making it uneven. I placed this table in the living room on carpet, so stability isn't really an issue but others with wood flooring, etc. may have more complaints in that regard. I do not particularly recommend putting glasses on the table without a coaster of some sort if not only because if moisture were to seep into the table it would gradually turn the inner cardboard/pulp into mush - I'd dread to think what that might result in. As others have noted, it's also not a great idea to put more than maybe 20-30 pounds on the table at a time. Or at the very least, don't let someone slam a stack of textbooks on top of it.TL;DR: It's cheap but functional if you aren't particular about cosmetics - it looks and functions like a coffee table. There is a reasonable chance of it being damaged in transport due to the materials it's made of. If you want functional, more pristine cosmetics, and a longer term reliability; you should look elsewhere and expect to pay more for said table.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it for $20 and I think it's worth it for the quality you get, and it's easy to assemble. I wanted to buy it again and am surprised jumped to $70, and I believe that amount is expensive for this table since it's a lot for this quality. Now a few months passed and the corners of the table started to scratch. Overall I don't think you should pay more than $30 maximum on this table.",
