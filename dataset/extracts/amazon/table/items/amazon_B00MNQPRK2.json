Sadly though the lid is not as sturdy nor is the pieces that hold the lid level. I will take time this summer after school to shore up the lid with 1/4 inch or 1/8 plywood and use wood blocks for the lid to be level. It would be great for one child as long as they did not attempt to sit on the top. For a classroom of children though it isn't quite as strong as it should be.",

I had no problem with the pre-placed 4 gray block mats on the block side of the table. They were glued on securely and all 4 mats lined up perfectly. No problem using Mega, Duplo, Lego, or the small blocks that came with the table. They all fit securely, even over seams where the mats joined. I purchased it for my 14 mo old grandson who can stand at the table to play. The table is meant for kids to use while sitting on the floor, kneeling, or standing. It is not tall enough to use with a kid size chair. There is ample 3\u201d deep storage space under the table top that lifts off to loosely store blocks and/or arts and crafts materials. There is also a depression on either side of the table for a little hand to reach in to grab blocks. The table is not made to hold sand or water. The table top consists of a block side and a smooth wooden side for arts/crafts, pretend play, drawing/painting/coloring, etc and it is easy to clean. It is a great table and I would buy and/or gift this table again.",
