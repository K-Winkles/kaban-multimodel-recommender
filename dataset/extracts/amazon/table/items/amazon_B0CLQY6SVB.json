                "reviewText": "I spend hours every day, studying, and cannot take sitting anymore. I bought this desk and a balancing board, and I now work my core strength while working my mind! Overall, this is a wonderful desk with good dimensions, a very sturdy construction (doesn\u2019t even seem to be phased by my using it as a ballet bar), and a smooth, quiet, quick motor. I also love all the little details \u2013 \u2013 a hook to hang my bag, a cord clip/organizer, and a cup holder which accommodates all of my various sized drinks so I don\u2019t spill them on my computer. I would give this nifty desk five stars except I have one complaint/suggestion: The edge on which I lean my arms when typing (and my leg when stretching) is quite sharp. I recommend either planing the edge more to make it more rounded, or attaching some type of transparent cover. Besides this one feature, this is the perfect desk for me!",

Love the raising/lowering feature press the arrow for 3+ seconds and it\u2019ll raise on its own! My corporate desk at my job you have to press and hold until you get to the level you want. The desk is very sturdy, take your time putting it together.I love putting stuff together so this was a breeze! The nails are somewhat hard to distinguish on the manual.I use it for work, sewing, other arts/crafts\u2026and for lunch/dinner.Side note: as someone who was born in the late 90s\u2026 this desk could\u2019ve used some drawers. Also I love putting furniture together, if you don\u2019t this will be a bit frustrating.",
