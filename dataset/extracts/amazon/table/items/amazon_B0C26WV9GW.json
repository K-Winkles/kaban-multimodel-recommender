                "reviewText": "This cheap little table will suit my needs, I'm going to put it between my loveseat and the wall/window and put plants on it. It's not very stable, but the kit includes a mounting kit to stabilize it to a wall if needed, but I'm going to wedge it between the sofa and the window. The top doesn't match up, and there is a small gap between one panel of the top and another, but it will be covered with flower pots, so no one will be able to see it. If you are not going to cover the top up, you might want to keep that in mind.",

                "reviewText": "I need to preface this review by letting you know that I will be 77 years old in three weeks and have COPD that requires me to use oxygen 24/7. No, I'm not looking for sympathy...I'm letting you know because I ordered three of these tables for behind my sectional couch and had two of them assembled in about three hours! I love them so much that I ordered a third, this one the larger sized table, and that had put together in under two hours. If I can do it, anyone can! First of all, I loved the price! Second of all, the instructions were easily understood (not always the case when you order DIY furniture!), third of all, the finished product is more than suitable, although not really spectacular. That's okay, though, because they will be between the wall and the sofa and won't really be seen, anyway! The kit comes with more screws than you will need as well as the hex (Allen) wrench for tightening the screws. You do NOT need any additional tools, so everything you need is in the box! Young or old, healthy or ill, you should be able to put this table together quite easily. I am extremely pleased with this purchase! Please pardon the mess on my buffet unit; I'm in the process of decorating for Christmas and shifting things around before putting them away...there isn't normally any clutter around!",

                "reviewText": "Did I get a different product from everyone else? I don't understand all the good reviews. Mine was a nightmare. The console table comes in a million pieces. Even the wood top is four separate pieces. Not all of them were labeled, and they all look very similar. And they didn't seem to put much effort into linking things up. As a result, assembling was a total nightmare. Nothing wanted to line up or slide into place. I almost gave up twice during step one cause things just didn't want to fit. When I did finally force everything together, it looks absolutely terrible. There's gaps and the boards don't sit level. I wouldn't have paid $20 for this.",

                "reviewText": "We wanted a cheap console to use in an outdoor area. We decided to give this one a try. Overall it will do, but I feel the quality isn\u2019t worth the $50 or so I paid for it. It comes in a box just a tad bigger than a shoe box and is in a thousand pieces. You have to hold your breath just right and try to keep everything tight as you put the bolts in. Nothing lines up correctly either. One of the main beams I had was bent at the end. The metal was so thin I was able to bend it to a place where it could be used though. It doesn\u2019t balance very well either. It has balancers for the legs, but I couldn\u2019t get it sturdy no matter how much I worked with them. I feel this should be in the $25 to $30 price range. I wish I\u2019d paid a little more for something that doesn\u2019t feel as flimsy.",
