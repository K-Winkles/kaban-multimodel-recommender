                "reviewTitle": "Gadroad Round End Table with Charging Station",
                "reviewText": "To be completely honest when I saw this table pop up in my feed I just really like to look of it And with the addition of usb ports on top I decided to give it a try. After placing my order the box arrived quickly and in good shape. The table comes disassembled and flat packed in Styrofoam. Is probably the only part that I don't like about the table is the styrofoam packing, it's the light white kind that comes apart really easy into tiny little pieces and sticks to everything and it's generally a nightmare to clean up. Besides that, after pulling all the pieces out of the box all the metal pieces are also individually sleeved in plastic I assume to protect the finish on them as well as the tabletop. Along with the screws to assemble the table there is also a hex key Provided to assemble the table. One thing I do appreciate is that all the fasters are the same size, making it much easier and faster to assemble. They included instruction book is easy to understand and follow. I had the table assembled in less than five minutes. I ended up ordering the Brownwood tabletop and to be honest it looks really nice. After moving it to its new home beside the couch in the living room, I plugged in the charger, then plugged in my phone into one of the USB ports and the charger worked as expected. The charger also has AA plastic cover that rotates to gain access to the usb ports and plugin socket. I think this table is a great addition and if I could make a couple of suggestions I would ask that something be included like velcro strips or zip ties for cable management so you don't have this big black cable hanging down from the table, it would be nice to have something included turn the power cable down one of the legs. My other suggestion, would be to raise the usb charger so the top is level with the top edge of the table making it a little bit safer in case someone places a drink on the table and spills it. I ended up designing a 3D printing a small spacer to raise the charger up a bit. All in all I personally feel this table is built quite well and with the included charging station I would recommend it to friends and family. Thank you.",
