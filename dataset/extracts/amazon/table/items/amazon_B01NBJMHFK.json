It is very low, which is perfect since my bed is on the floor + box spring. Definitely worth the price! It was shipped with no damages and the parts are all smooth and clean looking.",

Packaged well with very clear instructions and was NOT made in China - how pleasantly surprised was I. Read the description - that is what you get. This is not high-end, high strength furniture but- if you need a light duty, reasonable-looking, small utility piece in a large variety of finishes, you have found it.

                "reviewText": "I originally bought one of these to put next to a chair in my bedroom so I could sit with coffee and read a little. I loved it so much I bought two more and put them next to a futon couch in my office. They don't take up a lot of space they are low profile but have just enough storage to put your little something's out of the way until you need them. Not the best quality, but that's why the price is so amazing. They have held up to my everyday use just fine and they are aesthetically pretty to look at. If you're looking to save some money, this is an excellent product. Easy to build.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble, I think the instructions could be a bit better. But I figured it out anyway and had it together in about 10 minutes.Quality seems perfectly acceptable, better than I thought. Doesn't wobble or wiggle very much. Wouldn't trust it with much more than a lamp or more than a 2 year old kid sitting on it LOL.Good buy for the price and got here quickly for me. I do advise selecting to put it in an Amazon box, the box it would have come in was rather beat up and the tape was peeling off.",
