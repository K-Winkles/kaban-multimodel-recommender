                "reviewText": "I first bought this end table for someone else in May 2016 (for $17) and it arrived in good condition and was easy to put together. It is also sturdy and is still going today with no signs of slowing down, though granted it has remained in the same spot and has been handled delicately throughout. Also since I have not heard any complaints from the new owner I cannot comment on much else, but hopefully there have been zero issues. Because of this and the fact that it was found at a decent price, the \u201cDHP Parsons Modern End Table, Black Wood Grain\u201d gets a serviceable 3/5 stars!",

It has a large enough surface area to hold normal bedside items like a table lamp and phone charger. It will not support a lot of weight but for the price is a great buy when your needs and budget are modest.It worked perfectly for my application of a nightstand paired with a rolling/folding bed for a temporary sleeping setup.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a portable fridge from Amazon a couple of years ago for our son. He spends half his life in the basement and I thought, he thought, a little fridge would be great down there. A year and a half went by and still the fridge was in it's original box. I guess he didn't need the fridge as much as we both thought he did. I finally hauled it out and forced it on him. We needed a little table to put it on and this table was perfect. Easy to put together and strong enough to hold the little fridge. Too bad the fridge sits down in the basement on this nice little table.........unplugged!!!!",
