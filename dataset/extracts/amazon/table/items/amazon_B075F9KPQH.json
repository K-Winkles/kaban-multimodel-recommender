                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This desk is sturdy, easy to assemble, appears just as described, and very reasonably priced in my opinion.When I arrived home from work and saw the very large box this came in, I was a bit nervous the desk itself might have been damaged because the box did not look very good. But I know how shipping goes sometimes, so I was hopeful the desk was in good shape.I should preface the rest of my comments with the fact that I am an accountant at a manufacturing company. I pay attention to all things associated with getting a product I ordered and how they end up being executed as promised when I placed the order versus delivery. Including things like packaging, installation instructions (if applicable), shipping time, condition at delivery, and of course the product itself. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I opened this box. The condition of the box was no indication of the condition of the components of the desk inside that box. It is very apparent that this company is aware of how it's product travels and the conditions it will have to make it through to arrive to their customer in the same condition it left their building. Not only because it is a sturdy product to start with, but also because they meticulously package the components with the proper packaging materials to ensure it can travel securely and safely through all shipping environments it might encounter.All the screws were in a sealed and labeled plastic package with perforated lines on the backside for easy opening. Additionally, the end part of that package was labeled as spare parts, also sealed separately. I cut that entire end piece off with a pair of common household scissors so I could keep that in one piece in the kitchen drawer. Having the spare parts sealed on the end of the package was brilliant and very user friendly.A ratchet comes with the desk to assist with assembly. The ratchet is attached to a piece of cardboard with a clever message on the backside of the cardboard. The quality of this tool is outstanding. It is now part of my toolbox and normally little tools that come with items for assembly get thrown away after use.The instructions for assembly were easy to read and simple to follow. I put the desk together myself and found it simple to do with as the tools and instructions provided were exact and easy to execute. My desk looks like the picture in the product I ordered.Finally, there was another envelope included that is what really made me write this review, which is the first one I've ever done for any product, ever. The message on the inside of that envelope exuded to me the culture of the company that I bought this desk from. I could feel it through that message, so much that I took all the pieces of this packaging and showed the owners of my company. I am so impressed with my experience with this product that I'm still talking to people about it.....and it's a desk! I would never have imagined being this impressed with a furniture company, more because of the packaging with care of their product than the actual product itself (which is really amazing too), to feel this compelled to write all this about a desk......",

                "reviewText": "I have 3 of these tables, which I think says enough. It's a nice looking table for a good price. It's a firm table top that's rich in color, secured with a stable steel frame and it's stylish. I'm an avid PC gamer and I often work from home, so it's important to have a steady table to support my monitors and desktop. My cat also jumps up on the table, and he's a big boi, so I'd prefer to have something I feel won't topple over or wiggle.I am picky on my furniture and the color the wood. I'm also tall, 5'9, and I have plenty of room for a stool, my legs and a trashcan to all fit without nudging or feeling tight. I've not had any issues with these tables arriving scratched, dented or missing pieces. All of the holes have aligned and the setup has been super easy. They also include some little grips for the metal edges. I have wooden floors so that's a plus.The only thing that I was a little wary of was the last table I received was a bit more wiggly than usual. I couldn't identify where it was unstable, though it doesn't seem to be affecting anything for the time being. Also, something that confused me and just personally made me frown, was the bag that had the screws, instructions, etc. in was torn open from the bottom. I worked several years for a company where we packed items for customers and I would have never sent an open bag (torn from the bottom...) to them. To me that's a sign that this was already used, perhaps one that was attached to a table that was returned (the customer opened backwards even though it has a ziploc end... which happens way too frequently and a red flag of return or sloppiness). If they had at least put it in another bag, even if it didn't match the product itself or what I had gotten in the past, that would have been fine. Really it's just a sign of quality control.The package was pretty beat up when I got it. I was worried that the table would be damaged, but to my surprise it was well enough protected to where it came out just fine. I know that's not necessarily the seller's fault and more so the people who are being careless with their deliveries. It's a big table, but it wouldn't hurt to have a little extra padding on the front and back of the box, rather than just attached to the corners and the metal frame.I will definitely buy these tables again as long as they continue to hold up. I've heard some not okay things about Zinus' customer service; however, as long as the tables keep arriving in wonderful condition, I won't have to deal with that, ha!",

After it\u2019s assembled it felt stable, as long as I didn\u2019t lean my weight on it. I didn\u2019t notice any issue with its surface, and the whole desk certainly look very decent and not too cheap.",

It would be a lot easier to lift and faster to assemble with 2 people. Easy to understand instructions and sticker labels on the actual parts to help make sure you're doing it right!The desk is sturdy and sleek looking just as shown in the pictures!Zinus products (I've ordered a bed frame before) always seem to come well laid out with the necessary tools included (just need scissors or a knife to open like with any packaging).Also included a couple cute thank you cards and reminder to recycle, just overall a great experience (felt personalized even though it's a bigger company!).I also liked the rubber bottoms to stick to the bottom to avoid scratching of your floors... Very easy.I looked at so many desk options and one of the reason for going with this one was based on my positive experience with Zinus in the past, and I am very happy that it has surpassed expectations simply based on the easy of assembly.",

Together they are pretty heavy and take lot of space but as you can see on the attached picture, I still have some space to spare! I try to shake the table and it is sturdy enough that it doesn't move one millimeter.Assembling was unbelievably easy, took about 20 minutes and they even include a handy ratchet that makes the process painless.I feel like for 137$ CAD tax included, I won the lottery.Couldn't recommend more.
