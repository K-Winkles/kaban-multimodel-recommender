                "reviewText": "After a very frustrating experience with another amazon seller and a different changing table, I chose this one and I'm glad I did. It shipped out and was delivered a full 2 days before the estimate. Price was great. It was fairly simple to put together, husband started it while I was feeding our newborn and I finished it when little dude was done eating. (I enjoy putting together furniture weirdly enough.) Not a ton of pieces or hardware. The instructions are a tad confusing but just be patient and you can do it. Looks great in our son's nursery with his black crib.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I love this changing table. It was slightly difficult to put this together and I would recommend 2 people for an easy, quick assembly. However, it\u2019s nothing crazy. Also, make sure you tighten the two bolts on the bottom after you finish screwing everything just to make sure it\u2019s super sturdy. I love that it has tons of room to store stuff (as you can see) and it\u2019s super cute. The changing pad is thin but it didn\u2019t bother me because I was creative and took another changing pad, purchased a sheet for it, and made it into a pillow cushion for baby. \ud83d\ude42",

If indentations that do not go deeper than the paint bother you, you may want to skip out and buy direct from a furniture store. It feels sturdy, is a great height for someone taller like me, and looks fantastic with my Kalani crib, even though they are different brands. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy this due to the mixed reviews and tales of damaged items but, the price was right after spending on all of those essential baby items getting ready for little one's arrival. I was able to put it together in less than an hour, by myself at 9 months pregnant. As others have stated, the changing pad is rather thin. I bought the \"Summer Infant Changing Pad\" as a supplement but in order to attach it, you have to make an extra hole and I just was not willing to do that. The top of the table has two, pre-drilled holes to secure the changing straps for the pad that is included, so I plan on just sticking with the thin pad and hoping my baby doesn't mind. There were a few defects in the wood upon arrival, not scratches really because the color did not come off but little indentations in the wood on the railing from the pieces coming together during shipping (shown in 2nd photo). They are not even noticeable unless you look closely and are looking for defects. The shelves seemed kind of thin at first but after putting it together I am satisfied with the strength. The whole thing seems very stable and I was able to fit 2 half size fabric storage baskets total on each shelf to keep diapers, wipes and other supplies handy. I think that this was a good buy and I am satisfied, especially for the price.",

The reason for 3 stars is there were orange spots on the front side of the back \"sleigh\" that looked like rust. Very easy to see, but they faded after bleaching for a couple minutes. There was also a scuff on the front side of the front \"sleigh\", but not as noticeable. There were other paint imperfections here and there. It is also pictured with a contoured pad and a thin pad. Mine came with the thin pad. I would have returned it, but I needed it right away for my visiting grandchild, which was the whole reason for ordering from Amazon in the 1st place.",
