                "reviewText": "My son wanted a desk for Christmas to start the journey of pc gaming. I got a really good deal on this one. It didn't have all the fancy extras such as the led lights etc but I figured we could install some on our own. It's not as big as I had hoped. It's a pretty basic set up. However, he's 12 and new into the journey so it works pretty well for what we needed it for.The assembly wasn't too difficult. It seems sturdy and it has a pocket slot on the end of the desk where my son keeps none other than all of his snacks \ud83d\ude02. For the price it was definitely worth the purchase.",
