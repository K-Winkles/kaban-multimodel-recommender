I was just about to pull the trigger on a very simple black tray-style end table when this cute little thing popped on my \"Other buyers also liked...\" (or however it goes lol) and I instantly knew that was the one. Perfect size, perfect combo of color, great price and decent reviews. It's an all-wood piece with a a tray-like top. It's well built and was super easy to assemble. I'm so happy with this purchase. My favorite part is the contrasting black/mid-tone wood on the legs. Such a cute detail. I will also say I really like the white version as well...so tempting. You won't regret the purchase.",
