                "reviewText": "I have no issues with this table. It was pretty easy to assemble about 15 minutes. Easy instructions, if you've put one of these together it gets easier each time. It's all wood. I thought it was going to be an adjustable metal stand instead it's nit adjustable and the entire stand is pressed wood. It's nice tho.it has a plug with 2-3vprong plugs and usb- and USB. Itscoretty sturdy. The legs are all even, no wobble. It's a stained black wood which I like. The bottom self looks like rattan. Over all a nice table with bonus plugs.",

                "reviewText": "i wasnt sure how this end table would look in the end. the listing was a little unclear whether it would turn out to look cheap, or turn out alright.i am pleasantly impressed with this little table. its quick to assemble, its built well, it includes wall anchors so little ones cant tip it over on themselves accidentally & its got considerate versatility & efficiency. the included power ports ( with usb-c!!!!) are super useful - i have an old home with scarce outlets which only appear every 4 rooms or so, loi... so the long cord that can reach to the only outlet that just so happens to be behind the headboard - is so useful & helpful & i no longer have to pull the bed from the wall to take my charger with me if i need to... its so much eaasier being abel to just quickly unplug it from the table itself... & yes, i know, i could just get another charger but that would make too much sense so i got a table with an outlet instead.... logic!this table doesnt look cheap at all & i usually hate anything wicker/ratten(or whatever its called) but the black shelf that is of this material is tastefully included & adds a great aspect of texture to the finished look.i love this. its absolutely worth it & adds a modern touch to my otherwise outdated house.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a stand that matched my sons stereo set up in our loft. He received a lighted holder for the album cover of the currently playing album for Christmas but we really didn't have a place to put it. This all black stand matches perfectly and has a USB A plug built in that he can plug his lighted holder into. It also has a standard 15 amp outlet and a USB C. It was very easy to assemble, and looks and works great where we needed it. I'm debating whether its current $50 price is too high, I think it probably is but not by too much. I also don't think I would use this as a main piece of furniture that get lots of use, like an end table, It would be a bit shaky for that. It is very light so it lacks some stability for that reason.",
