Love that the outlet enabled me to plug in and place a small spotlight on the table, too, for a highlighting effect. Really wish they had a matching smaller version of this table as well, with a shorter length, for another area of the room, but haven't been able to find one yet.",

                "reviewText": "This is first time I have been disappointed in a piece of simple furniture. Wasn't hard to assemble for a 72 yr old, but when you do NOT have all the screws to get it together, what's the point? Actually, the top was to be secured with 10 screws. Forget that!! Because I liked the table, I ended up using a glue gun for the top and glued it on. Maybe they don't make hardware at this facility.",
