                "reviewText": "I think this was my best purchase in 2023. I bought this for a family member who was recovering from surgery. I thought the built in power strip would be helpful to keep phones, tablets and earbuds charged for entertainment and it would fit easily next to the recliner. It was so useful.It was very easy to put together. Fits well in a smaller space. Sturdy. And it looks like a more expensive piece of furniture than it is.",
