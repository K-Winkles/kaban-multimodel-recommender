                "reviewText": "I got this table to use as a stand for my game consoles since I like to have a few out and accessible at a time while also allowing plenty of airflow. I've only been using it for a couple of days, but so far, it's serving my purposes fine, and $32 is a pretty good price for a table this size.PROS:-Quick and easily assembly, which was one of the things that led me to order this particular table.-Size is about as expected and is large enough to fit my PS5 in its horizontal position.-The color and appearance of the wood in the French Oak/Black scheme is nice, aside from the scratches mentioned below.-Reasonable price-Stands okay on its own (at least so far) without being attached to wallCONS:-The product listing on Amazon says it will hold 20 pounds per shelf. The printed product manual says only 15 pounds per shelf.-The wood appears to have some white scratches on each shelf, with some shelves looking worse than others (see pic showing some of the scratches). However, it's not very noticeable when you have items on the shelves.-The product is advertised as not needing any tools for assembly. Technically, that part is true. However, the printed manual instructs you after assembling the table to secure the table to the wall (using tools and parts not included) to prevent the shelf from tipping. It makes it sound necessary, not optional. I've skipped attaching it to the wall, and things are going okay so far, but I worry because I already caught my cat on the shelf once. I placed my PS5 (the largest console) on a lower shelf instead of on the top like I initially wanted to do.-The black poles are cheap plastic, which you can tell by feeling them and also looking at them. However, they're doing their job fine and don't look too bad, especially for the price.I do recommend this table if you're on a budget and don't mind the cons mentioned above.Update after a few months: the shelf has been holding up great, and there have been no tipping incidents even though a cat has been on it at least a few times. My game consoles have all been safe on it, and it's a nice size for this use. I'm pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Having gotten back into the hobby of model building in the last few years I have found myself quickly running out of existing display space and after one too many glaring disapprovals from the wife every time I had to pull the old switcheroo and replace one of her photos or Knick Knacks with my latest completed project, I knew it was time for some additional shelves.I decided on the Furinno Turn-N-Tube 5-Tier Shelves based upon it seemingly to be a fairly decent size at a fairly reasonable price. In other words, it was cheap. It also seemed like it would be easy to put together, which if you are someone like me who is both mechanically uninclined and still bear the emotional scars of trying to put together one too many IKEA purchases with their hundreds of parts, keeping it simple stupid is the main goal in home furnishing decisions.This last point gives the product high marks on its own as it was a simple matter of placing the plastic tubes through the four corners of each shelf and hand screwing the one above it together, continuing this till all five shelves were erected. The entire process took all of 10 minutes and involved no utterance of salty language. If only everything in life could be this stress free. It probably could have easily been assembled in half the time had I not had to stop several times to pay attention to the cat who was fascinated by \"The New Thing in The House\" and also wanted me to hurry up so she could have the empty box it came in.As far as the quality, the shelves themselves seem fairly strong despite being kind of thin and the finish is passable. I'm not sure how much weight they will support, but I think it's safe to say I wouldn't trust it to hold one's bowling ball collection or for a dumbbell rack. Also, while it's relatively stable on its own, but still kind of wobbly for my total piece of mind. If one chooses not to use the optional wall anchor that comes with it, I could easily see a tchotchkes disaster in the making during an earthquake (not an issue where I live) or cats that like to seek the highest spot in the house to look down upon their human servants (a million times more likely for me). There is only one anchor included and I would recommend the purchase of at least one more and tying them to the wall at both ends.At a little over four and a half feet in height, even the topmost shelf is easy to reach for all but a small child, though the bottommost should probably be reserved for books or something like that as anything one wants to specifically show off, like your vast collection of Franklin Mint or Beanie Babies that are now worth less than when you purchased them, will not be very visible at floor level.Overall, it is a relatively good product for the price as long as you remember the saying of getting what you pay for. Though obviously not as good as a quality metal shelf or glass door cabinet, but neither is it some flimsy contraption your kid made in shop class to complement the lamp that blew out your home wiring and almost caused a fire (still sorry about that, Mom) It is squarely in the middle and should meet anyone's lite display or storage needs. If there is any significant drawback, I've found is that even with the new shelves I am already running out of display space. Again. So is life.",

Please note: This type of shelving has maximum weight limits for each shelf. There is hardware included for wall attachment. While this shelving works great on hardwood floors, it tends to a little less sturdy on carpet. This item comes with a hardware packet for wall mounting.",

                "reviewText": "When you live in a small apartment, you desperate for space. That\u2019s what it gave to me, space and order. I think the picture talk by itself, but I just want to mention to be careful about the weight it can support. I knew these shelves are not made for heavy loads, it is specified on the description, no more than 25 lbs per shelf, so I chose the bottom right tablet to put my sewing machine in her organizer because I knew I would have to support it one way or another, so I added a piece of wood under as you can see on the picture if you pay attention.This said, I\u2019m very happy about this purchase and the different size of each of them. They also came on time, they were very well packed and truly easy to install, one person only. Now, it\u2019s clean, pretty, and with all the boxes gone, it looks organize and the apartment seems bigger.I do recommend them.",
