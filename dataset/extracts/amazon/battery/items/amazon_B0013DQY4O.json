No issues at all from the ones we have used so far in two kitchen appliances (battery operated salt & pepper shakers) and a penlight flashlight that we have used these in.If you would like to see pictures I took of the package and the batteries, please go back to the batteries' main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, then look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section. Seem to work very well for us.Yes it is a bit disconcerting that they come in a box that does say Not For Retail Sale on the bottom, but the price was right and our devices are back up and running perfectly once again.As long as the price is good, I would come back for more. If they die an early death, will return to update this review - until such time, all is good.Go for it.",

                "reviewText": "These batteries are great, and I'd highly recommend them. We have a lot of rechargeable AAA's that we use but sometimes it's just easier and more affordable to use single-use batteries, since a lot of the expensive rechargeable ones seem to go dead way too fast.I dinged these 1 star because, as many others have mentioned, none of these have anywhere near a 10 year exp. date like it describes in the item information. As you can see from the picture we received ours in Feb 2016 and they have a March 2021 exp. date. 5 years is still plenty for us to go through a 24 pack but if you're looking to get a decade of storage out of these think again.All in all, great product and I'm not to worried about the shelf life since these are still a fraction of the price you'd pay for name-brand batteries locally.",
