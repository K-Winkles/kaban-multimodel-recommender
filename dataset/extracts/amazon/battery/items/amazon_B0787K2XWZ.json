This is the second time I have purchased them as I use the in my car fobs, kitchen scale and thermometer. You can buy cheaper batteries but, from my experience they never last long and lead to having to change them way too frequently. I would say that these amazon basics compare to Duracells in longevity and quality. Happy with the purchase.",
