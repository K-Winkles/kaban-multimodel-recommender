Had to do some minor tinkering to get it to work with my flat battery posts on this smaller 12v but that has nothing to do with the product itself it's not made for this. When I did get it set up it's actually really easy to use and works as advertised. I did check multiple times with my digital multimeter to make sure there was no voltage or current and there was nothing. I put up with years of self-inflicted misery having to charge the battery every single time I wanted to start the mower. This is 100% the mower's fault and not bad batteries. No more!",

I tried this one out and found that I had to order a box of brass washers (only needed one) to make up space for unit to sit level on the side of the battery. I feel that it was an engineering mistake in design in the shape of the brass terminal so I didn't give it a perfect score of 5.",
