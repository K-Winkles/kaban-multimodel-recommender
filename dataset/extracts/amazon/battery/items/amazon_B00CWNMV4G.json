                "reviewText": "Let me tell you about these Amazon Basics Rechargeable AA Batteries. They are literally the little powerhouses you didn\u2019t know you needed. I picked up a 12-pack and they\u2019ve been an absolute lifesaver. First off, they come pre-charged \u2013 how convenient is that? You can use them straight out of the package.Their 2000 mAh capacity means they last a surprisingly long time in my gadgets \u2013 from remotes to my digital camera. And the best part? You can recharge them up to 1000 times. I've been using mine for months and they hold up just as well as those pricier brands.The environmental benefit is a big plus too. By using these, you\u2019re cutting down on waste, making a small but significant impact. And let\u2019s be honest, not having to constantly buy batteries is not only good for the planet, but it\u2019s also great for your wallet.So, if you\u2019re tired of constantly buying and throwing away batteries, these Amazon Basics ones are definitely the way to go. They\u2019re reliable, eco-friendly, and an all-around great value. Your devices (and the planet) will thank you!",

I use these in flashlights, outdoor lighting(solar) and other areas where AA batteries are used. While they might not last as long (per charge) as onetime batteries like Energizer, I simply put these on a charger and they are ready to be used again & again. A great money saver. I now use both AA & AAA Amazon Basic batteries and will not go back to the expensive one use batteries. BTW, my original set is going strong after 2-3 years of use. I love these and the price is great for what you get.",

During the week it will go the full five days without needing a change. I am going to order more for my other battery controlled devices.",

The 2000 mAh capacity and the ability to recharge up to 1000 times make them an eco-friendly and cost-effective choice. From TV remotes to gaming controllers, these batteries provide reliable and long-lasting power for various gadgets around the house. However, one minor drawback is the initial charge time, which can be longer compared to some other rechargeable batteries on the market. Despite this, the overall value and sustainability make these batteries a smart investment for anyone looking to reduce waste and maintain a constant power supply for their devices.",

I'll update this review with performance details after some use.I also found them effective in Panasonic cordless phones, outperforming the originals. In terms of quality and affordability, these batteries seem comparable to renowned brands.I appreciate the economic, functional aspects and the environmental benefits of reusability.In summary, these batteries are proving reliable, offering good value and performance.
