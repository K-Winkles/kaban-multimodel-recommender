                "reviewText": "Updating my review to 5 stars:It turns out the batteries were not bad at all. It was a blown fuse in the battery compartment which linked all (4) batteries in series. Once I replaced the fuse the batteries all worked fine.So the repair shop I took my scooter to didn't bother opening up the battery box to examine it and just assumed all the batteries were bad since there was no power coming from the battery box.After I wrote to the company which sold me the batteries through Amazon messaging. They replied that they would refund me for the (4) batteries. I did not take them up on their refund because I wanted to test/charge each battery up individually instead of trying to charge them all through the battery box in series. They charged up fine individually. That's when I noticed a small round container with a twist off top instead the battery box. It contained a fuse. After replacing the F30A250V fuse the battery box was able to charge up all 4 batteries and plugging it into my scooter worked fine.[Original 1 star review]Purchased (4) of the Nermak 12V 12AH lithium batteries for an old electric sit on scooter. Used 3 times in 5 months and the last time I used I hit a small bump in the road and the scooter stopped working. I thought my scooter's wiring was faulty so brought it into a repair shop. They tried to charge the batteries but said they see 0 voltage coming from the batteries and recommended me to replace the batteries. The other 2 times I rode the scooter I got stranded because the batteries died. Again I thought it was a mechanical/electrical problem. But it was able to start back up after charging the batteries. Since the 30 day return policy has long passed and don't know how to contact \"Nermak\" since they only seem to sell through Amazon I am out of luck with getting new/working batteries to replace these duds. All 4 batteries... Wow!",

                "reviewText": "When I first got them they did ok ( 9-30-2023). Took Grandma to Vegas for her 99th birthday (mid October) and she road around for 3 days. We got home and scooter was used once/twice per week. Went to use it last week and scooter charger showed green but scooter would not turn on. Checked charger, connections but all is OK. One battery is 12.92 volts but other is 8.87 volts. So here it is 12-07 2023 and scooter is not useable. I am sending a complaint to Amazon because I can not find any contact info for Nermak batteries on the internet. Only buy if you pay extera for the warrantee or just buy a better battery.update 12-07-2023----Had to go online to find the customer service phone number. After 2 tries with the electronic voice I finally got through to \"Kajal\", who help me get a partial refund. Just wish the Batteries would have work correctly the first time. Will research the batteries before I buy again. Thanks Pat",

When the package came, I thought I'd made a mistake as the box didn't weigh as much as one of the original lead acid batteries. I opened the box and there were indeed two batteries inside. After charging the batteries, I installed them and was very happy to see that they functioned flawlessly. Half the weight, less money... What more could you want?",
