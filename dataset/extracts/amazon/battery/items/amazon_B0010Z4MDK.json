The first component of the battery is the ABS plastic shell. We then insert our very own lead plates and glass mat separators into the shell before filling with acid. The batteries are then capped, sealed, and charged to complete the process. Step 2 - Assess for Quality The next step in the process is that of quality control. We don't make great products by accident. Our inventory is carefully controlled by strict quality assessments that must be met before qualifying for shipment. Our products undergo voltage tests, weight measurement, and psychology tests to make sure they are physically and mentally sound. Step 3 - Pack with Care We've all gotten that package delivered in the mail that was clearly marked as 'fragile' but looked like it was used as a football by the delivery man. That's why all of our items are packaged with the customer in mind Step 4 - Deliver On Time, Every Time Your order is not completed until the item is in your hands. After all, what good is a great product if it doesn't get to you in time? When your alarm is screeching 'Fix Me, Fix Me!', you can trust that you won't have to wait an eternity for your battery to arrive.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Peace of mind: Knowing my alarm has a fresh, reliable battery powering it gives me immense peace of mind. I haven't experienced a single false alarm or power outage issue since switching to the EXP1250.Long-lasting: This battery boasts a 500-cycle lifespan at 50% depth discharge, which translates to years of worry-free protection. I haven't had to replace it yet, and based on current performance, I don't expect to for quite some time.Compact and compatible: The EXP1250 is a compact 12V battery that fit perfectly into my alarm system's designated space. Plus, the F1 terminals ensured hassle-free installation \u2013 no need for adapters or modifications.Durable and leakproof: The hardened ABS plastic casing feels sturdy and gives me confidence that the battery can handle accidental bumps or spills. Plus, the sealed lead acid technology eliminates the risk of leaks or corrosion.Great value: Compared to other brands, the EXP1250 offers excellent value for its price. Considering its performance and lifespan, it's a budget-friendly investment in your home security.Cons:Weight: While not a dealbreaker, the EXP1250 is a bit on the heavy side compared to some other 5Ah batteries. This might be a consideration if you need to move or handle the battery frequently.Overall:I highly recommend the ExpertPower EXP1250 to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting battery for their home alarm system. It's given me peace of mind knowing my security system is always powered and ready to protect my home. The exceptional performance, durability, and affordability make it a top choice in my book.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new battery for my Craftsman garage door opener. I received an alert that the battery was no longer charging. This battery serves as a power backup for the garage door opener. In the event of a power failure this battery will allow the opener to continue to function normally. I bought my garage door opener specifically because it had a battery backup so if the battery needed replacement then I will replace it.Since Craftsman is now owned by Lowe's I went to my local Lowe's store in search of a replacement battery. I was shocked by the price. Let's just say the retail price was about 30% of what a new garage door opener would cost. There had to be a cheaper alternative. I went home and did a search on Amazon and found EXP1250 12V 5Ah Home Alarm Battery. The price was less than $20 which seemed very reasonable to me. The description said it would fit my Craftsman garage door opener so I placed my order. This battery was a perfect fit.It took me less than two minutes to install this battery. It's as easy as unplugging the positive and neutral terminal plugs from the old battery and plugging them onto the new battery. Another few seconds to put the battery in the garage door opener and my battery backup was back online.I have had this battery installed for several months now without any issues. We had a power outage about a month ago and I took the opportunity to see if my garage door opener was still functional. The door opened and closed flawlessly. The lights and control switch were fully functional. Perfect!I am very pleased with my purchase of the EXP1250 12V 5Ah Home Alarm Battery. It is a perfect replacement for my Craftsman garage door opener. Five stars. If this review is helpful for you please click the \"Helpful\" button below.",
