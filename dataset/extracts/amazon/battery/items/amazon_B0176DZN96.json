You might be able to go for say 5 hours with a headlamp on regular batteries but only 40 minutes with rechargeables. I called Panasonic and they said that's just the way it is; the technology is not there yet to make them better. So buy more batteries than you need and change them out while some are recharging.",

That way they age in pairs and it's easier to know which ones need to be replaced (eventually).",
