That a properly fitted crimp style battery terminal should be installed.That being said, I probably have several dozen of these type of \"clamp\" battery terminals on our equipment. I have used the lead type of terminal for years and have started replacing the lead out to these copper alloy type of terminals.When I first installed this particular terminal, I over-tightened the battery post clamp screw and the terminal broke so easily that I was dumbfounded. I did a little better on my second try, but I made dead sure I used a light touch when I tightened things down. So far the battery terminal has worked well, and only the precursor of time will determine their effectiveness.",
