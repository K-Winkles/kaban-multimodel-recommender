Would recommend based on experience so far. As others have stated the terminal connection could use longer screws, thicker nuts or shorter terminal gap as for my setup I had to put some shims in there to get the screw to engage the nut. You can then remove the shim once tightening things down. A bit of a hassle due to the tight spacing around the battery, something to consider depending on how much access you might have.",
