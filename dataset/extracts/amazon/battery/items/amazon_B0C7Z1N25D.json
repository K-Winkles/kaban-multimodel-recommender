The maximum number of identical batteries that can be connected in series is four, providing up to 48V. In parallel, up to four identical batteries can be connected, providing up to 48AH. Batteries can also be connected in parallel and series simultaneously, for up to 48V and 48AH. Only batteries with identical voltage and capacity purchased can be used in parallel or series.",

In addition, their usable capacity is twice that of lead-acid batteries, while their weight is 40% less due to their significantly higher energy density. With no memory effect, the lithium battery can hold a charge better when not in use and will not lose capacity due to a previous discharge state.",

Plus, you're essentially recycling, so it's 'greener'.",

                "reviewText": "I have several LiFePO4 batteries and I really like them for their high capacity to size and weight ratio as compared with lead-acid batteries having a similar capacity. LiFePO4 batteries have several other advantages, notably a longer service life, both in years and discharge/recharge cycles. Comparing this battery to another one I have that is physically the same size and has the same capacity rating (amp-hours), this battery has nearly identical specifications. However, this battery claims a 5000+ lifecycle whereas the other battery only has a 3000+ charge/discharge cycle rating. If they were the same (or similar) price, that would make this battery the obvious choice. However, this battery sells for $39.99 but the other one, which is also available on Amazon, is only $18.90. That makes this battery about 2.1x as expensive for 1.7x times as many charge/discharge cycles. So, when I do the math, unless I was building a system that would use a battery that was difficult to replace, I think I\u2019d look for another, more cost-effective battery. That said, when I tested this battery, it performed without issue, so the only reason I\u2019m giving this product less than a 5-star rating is because I think there are other batteries that offer better value for the money.",

This one is half the size and a higher capacity than the one that was in there. All I could think to do was unplug it and run the garage door opener up and down a bunch. Ran quite a few times until I got tired of messing with it and charged back up with no issues. Being the LiFePO type, I shouldn't have to replace it for a long time!",

                "reviewText": "I got this 12 volt lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery to use as part of our solar powered security camera monitoring an area of our yard that we can not easily get power to. I really like these lithium iron batteries. They are much lighter and handle deep cycles well. The battery size is 3 1/2 inches x 4 inches x 2 3/4 inches and has F2 terminals. These LiFePO4 batteries are much lighter than the lead acid batteries and are rated at 8Ah (my old ones are 7Ah each).When the battery arrived its voltage was at 13.3 volt (as expected). I hooked this battery up to a 12 volt charge controller connected to a 50 watt solar panel to top it off before installing this in my UPS. It took about a few hours to finish charging to 13.5 volts (~100% capacity).Overall I am happy with this 12V 6Ah LiFePO4 battery and would recommend it to others. It meets my expectations so I am giving this 4 stars. Also, I am not going back to lead acid batteries!",
