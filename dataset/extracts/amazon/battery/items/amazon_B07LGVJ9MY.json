                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These are CARBON ZINC technology batteries and yes they are usually the cheapest and have thd shortest power-on longevity out of almost all consumer grade batteries out of box. Their shelf life is slightly longer and arent as effected by altitude.However, besides being fully non toxic, 100% completely recyclable, safe for the environment (if not fully, then semi-biodegradable compared with alkaline & lithium) much less \"leak\" prone, MUCH (200%) cheaper to manufacture because their ingredients are ridiculously common on this planet (aluminum shell, steel contacts, zinc, carbon, uneeded plastic brand sleeve) which also allow them to be lighter in physicality. Some folk refer to this physical difference as a sign of \"cheapness\" which is funny because their correctness depeends entirely on context. Although I DNR of course (even though they won't \"explode\" or leak \"acid), one can squeeze one of these flat bare handed.Without forlnowledge on the pros/cons or of correct application, the main idea is C/Zi batteies work fo special/niche purposes amazingly and not so much otherwise. One generally universal pro is that C/Zi bat. retain all or I'd say at least 75% their strength (As in brightness of a flashlight or beam strength from an IR emmiting LED like those on TV remotes) depending on useage pattern, allowing for B+/A grade & high drain reliability for their short lived life. Compared with standard Duracell or Everready batteries these last maybe 70% to 15% shorter at full output depending on device pwr. specs, temperature and atmospheric pressure (ie. HpA/PSI ) condt.I would either recommend these for low mili-Amp(mA) medium-high voltage devices like remotes, LED flashlights, hand-held AM/FM radios and clocks but on the contrary the opposote is also true. For example, for an RC Vehicle Controller, BT device or Xbox controller, no - BUT - When reliable non dimming high output ampage is required for devices that are prone to data loss or functionality like for say a Nikon Coolpix camera or even an AAA/AA electroshock stun device (of those exist most are 9v. alkaline)In conclusion for batteries I always recommend Panasonic. Their line of Carbon Zinc batteries are superior in longevity and quality.THESE did come remarkably close so they deserve praise.The other comments' negative remarks seem to be from user error or lack of knowledge on available battery technologies, human & battery history, correct batteryt technology type usage.40xAAA & 40xAA are recieved in two boxes; AAs are plasto wrapped in threes & AAA fours. This is a combo pack deal totalling 80 Carbon Zinc batteries.",
