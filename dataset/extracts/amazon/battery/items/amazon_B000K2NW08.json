                "reviewText": "Like these were purchased from the Duracell Store, I also order batteries from the Energizer Store & have been extremely pleased with the products.The only difference (other than price) in getting from somewhere else is that the manufacture date is a bit older on these. However, the battery & shelf life is at least 5 years so it's not an issue for me as I go through batteries prettyquickly, especially AA & AAA sizes. The manufacture date on these 9Vs is 2021 which is actually the closest to current year that I've ever gotten...only two years old. They are guaranteed for five years so they're fine. I don't use as many 9Vs which is why I only ordered a 4 pack.So basically I always order batteries from either the Energizer Store or the Duracell Store depending on who's got the lowest price at the time. I plan on continuing to do this as it's so much more economical than buying at a store or even purchasing through other sellers on Amazon.Would highly recommend these batteries & their seller.",
