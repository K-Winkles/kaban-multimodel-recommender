                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great 12/24V Battery Charger with Repair Function",
                "reviewText": "My 6-year-old Audi Q5 can start OK, because it has a strong starter (has auto start/off) but because of it's low state of charge, that function no longer works. I bought a trickle charger before this one which charged well on a 2019 Corolla that's being driven very little and infrequent but not on my 2018 Audi Q5. That other trickle charger charged my battery from 11.7 to 11.9V. I bought this charger due to it has a separate mode for AGM and Repair because my Audi battery is AGM. FYI, manual says you need to wait at least an hour from the last usage of your battery.So, I first charged it in the AGM mode and the display went from 50% to 100% in only 10 minutes but the voltage only improved to 12V. Yesterday I put it on repair mode, and it took 8 hours to show full. I did not wait for it to turn off by itself. The battery now has improved from 12V to 12.55V; from 50% to 80% capacity on a 6-year-old large AGM battery. I did not bother to remove the power cords due to my bad back and the battery is situated in the trunk all the way behind the backseat. Luckily it does not appear to cause any damage to my car. During the repair mode, I monitored the battery temperature with my laser thermometer; the charger nor the battery did not get warm and stayed in the low 70's.PROS:1) Has separate AGM and Motorcycle and repair mode.2) Great LCD lighted display will show the battery level when you hook it up even before you plug in the power cord. It will also show charger temperature, charging current & status, battery voltage & etc.3) Smart charger has a built-in fan to stay cool and it will alter the charging power with respect to the battery status. It will start out slow and rarely goes to the full 10A, then it will decrease the power when you reached half full then even lower at 75%. Even when it's @100% charged, it will trickle charge to the max then turn itself off (fan off but light still on) and display OFF.4) Great repair mode that reconditioned my 6 year old AGM battery from 50% to 80% capacity.5) Very good price; I paid $24 shipped.CONS:1) Very short cord, you will need an extension cord. But it's no big deal.2) Per owner's manual, in Motorcycle mode, it will charge battery to full then turn off and turn back on when voltage drops below 12.5V. But does that mean you cannot maintain your battery in the other modes? It also states not to leave the charger unattended over 12 hours. Therefore, I don't think this is a battery maintainer which is fine for me.................................................................With this battery charger, I can charge my batteries before and after I go on a vacation and let not my batteries charge level go down too low thus prolongs the life of my batteries. I only had it for a week and so far, I am very happy about this product. I will update if the charger quit or have some problems.",

                "reviewText": "The product works, and has some good features. But the instructions are not very helpful. It's hard to know which mode to use for which kind of battery. It's also hard to know how to use with a car where the battery is installed somewhere else. My car battery wouldn't charge because I was using the engine as ground. I had to figure out myself that you have to use a special ground lug to charge the battery under the hood. (The positive lug was easy to find). ALso, it's unclear how and when to use the Repair function. If you have access to the car battery, just set it for the normal mode and it should work. I also had to watch youtube to figure out why the selector times out and how to reset it. ALso, battery maintenance/trickle can only be done on the motorcycle mode. Took quite a while to figure it out.",
