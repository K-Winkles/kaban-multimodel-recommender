I bought these 4 for the price of the single ones I wanted, so screw it and I bought them. Also they take 3 AA batteries and not a ridiculous amount of D bates. So that was a big buying point for me. The day I got them, I opened the box and expected them to be bigger than they are. I actually like their size. They can even go in the car, etc. I bought them for when the power goes out at our house because we live in the boonies. They are BRIGHT. Like don't look at it if you want to keep your retinas. I think they're awesome for the price!",

Yes they do take 3 batteries which do NOT come with them, but I buy batteries bulk anyway as so much uses batteries. One on my little table beside my chair and I was able to read in comfort. I put one in my bathroom, with the top pushed down so it wasn't full bright, and one on top of my fridge again with top pushed down a little. My place was very comfortable. I did not have to carry one with me at anytime. I will be ordering at least one more package of these to have just in case a long power outage happens.",
