                "reviewText": "We ordered the RICEEL rechargeable AA Batteries to replace old betteries in a solar walk light that we have mounted on a fence post, so we can tell when our two dogs are headed to our back door. Wow! what a big difference in the brightness of the light. Much better then the original batteries for sure. It's not just a indicator light anymore, it's a bright path light.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with these rechargeable batteries. I used them to replace old batteries in solar lanterns for my yard. These came with a decent amount of charge, enough to confirm that the solar lights would work with new batteries (before they are charged up).These NIMH batteries have the right storage capacity to allow the solar lights to work for several hours after dark, perhaps even overnight. This always depends on the sunshine available to charge them during the day.Replacing the batteries is necessary for solar lights occasionally, as rechargeable batteries don't last forever. I had to be careful replacing the battery, as the electronics & wires inside the solar light are fragile.",
