                "reviewText": "Worked great as a backup battery for FIOS cable for 20 months. Trying a different brand for better longevity. I never cycled the battery, it was always fully charged, since I did not lose power, hence needing a backup. It starts beeping when the battery is weak, might try a less ah battery for that, prob won't last longer but they are cheaper. My $0.02",
