I don't really recommend It from Amazon why I ordered these last Friday. I received them today and guess what somebody stole 3 of my batteries from me. They're open and era all over the box. So I'm hoping whoever has my 3 batteries in San Antonio. Texas enjoys them in their pacman, or whatever little thing they have. Because this is not where I'm gonna stop. But the product is an excellent product so I will give them five stars",
