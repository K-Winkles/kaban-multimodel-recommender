One coated plate is positive and the other is negative. The unique manufacturing process of spiral winding continuous lead plates is far more precision-controlled and expensive than building traditional flat plate AGM batteries. Custom automated cell-winding machines are required to maintain the close tolerances required to maintain quality and performance. Critical tolerances, temperatures, humidity and automated processes are maintained and constantly monitored. OPTIMA has built over 100 million individual spiral cells since the early 1990\u2019s.",

RedTop For normal engine starting where an alternator immediately monitors the state of charge and provides energy to the battery whenever it is needed. This would describe most stock vehicles, including: automotive and RV underhood starting, heavy equipment where starting is the primary function, and diesel vehicles without aftermarket electronics. YellowTop Use this when electrical loads are higher than average, or when the discharge cycle is more than typical engine starting, such as vehicles with multiple electronic accessories and vehicles without alternators. This can also include vehicles with a lot of factory electronics such as power sliding doors and a DVD player. Examples also include: racing vehicles without a charging system, dedicated drag racers, diesel powered vehicles with aftermarket electronics, and vehicles with inverters, winches, or other accessories. BlueTop The BlueTop starting battery (dark gray case) is to be used when a dedicated starting battery is required and it should never be used for cycling duty. Use a BlueTop starting battery for marine applications and RVs when the battery's only function is engine starting. The dual purpose BlueTop (light gray case) can be used for both starting and deep cycling -- it is a true deep cycle battery with extremely high cranking power. Uses include: trolling motors, marine applications with heavy electrical accessories, and RVs.",

                "reviewText": "Super fast delivery and with good build quality. Come with 77% of battery left and now is charging. Preparing to install it to my RV.after one and half years use (connecting with a 5w solar panel and a solar charger controller), the battery dead. the battery is still able to be charged by a Black Deckor 15A battery charger but not able to hold the charge (still have cranking capability after tested with an electric battery tester). after contacting with optima, they are not able to honor the warranty (the technical said the one of the cell of the batter might dead) but i have to consult with the original re-seller which is Amazon. After calling Amazon, they can send me a replacement or a full refund. i choices a refund then to get another one from costco coz I do not want to wait. the price i purchased in the past is about 80 dollars cheaper then current price. so, i think that i got a very good deal in the past. basically, i like Optima and I like Amazon! The one fails may just because the discharging speed of the battery itself is bigger then the charging rate i provided from a tiny 5w solar panel.. i bought a 40w bendable solar panel instead. hope this time works!",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars This BS is a total scam",
                "reviewText": "This thing is a total dog compared to walmart batteries for 1/3 the price. The reserve capacity is terrible, the CCA is only 800 - yet I wanted something to last.With that said - I am not happy. I thought \"hey buy the best of the best and you'll finally be happy.\" This is not the case. An $80 walmart battery outperforms this battery in nearly every aspect. I am within my return period and I am literally seconds away from returning it. I could buy 3 walmart batteries and put them in parallel/series and see some serious business for the same price.I have some parasitic drain and my 2 year old no-name battery usually takes a week or two to run flat. This thing dies overnight. Additionally, the cheap no name battery does 950cca easily - where this POS only does 800. This company at this point is literally scamming people on name alone.There are BETTER batteries for MUCH LESS.My only saving grace IF I KEEP THIS BATTERY is that it will last for way longer. But with the results I've gotten in the past couple days I would not trust that or invest this way. I could buy a new BETTER battery every couple years and have a better outcome. This thing would have to last over a decade to be worth it. But with my current results I am not convinced the reduced performance and lackluster results are boding well for this battery.Frankly, I will most likely return this thing within the week.Be a smart person!!!If you're looking for output - there are better batteries for WAY LESS. If you're looking for capacity there are better batteries FOR WAY LESS. If you're looking for longevity - for the same price you could just buy several of the other better (and cheaper) batteries over time FOR WAY LESS.This thing is an utter disappointment overall. I regret buying it and having a hint of red under the hood is not enough to justify the cost.In conclusion if you want the name, or flare of color under the hood at any expense - get this. Essentially, \"I want red in my engine bay.\"If you care about performance, capacity, or frugality THIS IS NOT YOUR BATTERY.DO NOT BUY THIS. This company is literally running on scams.",

I have a red top in my daily driver Tacoma and another in a 55 Studebaker that is on a battery maintainer and a Yellow top in a 65 Lemans that has a ton of stereo stuff, also on an Optima maintainer. Any battery that is not in frequent use should be on a maintainer (charger) if you want it to last. Visit the Optima website before you buy to make sure you are getting the one you need, They are not cheap but they can last twice as long as a cheapo unit if they are in daily or frequent use or on a maintainer if not.",
