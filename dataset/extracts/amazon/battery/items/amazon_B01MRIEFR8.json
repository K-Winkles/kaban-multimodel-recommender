I went to Batteries and Bulbs to purchase more and was told that they were outdated technology and just use AA's. This information was incorrect. I found the batteries on Amazon and promptly ordered them. There is a difference, but I don't know what it is. The clock is beautiful, but flimsy and the hands fall off periodically. I just like the way it looks...and it wasn't cheap. I will continue to use the cz batteries as they last a decent amount of time and not expensive.",
