One coated plate is positive and the other is negative. The unique manufacturing process of spiral winding continuous lead plates is far more precision-controlled and expensive than building traditional flat plate AGM batteries. Custom automated cell-winding machines are required to maintain the close tolerances required to maintain quality and performance. Critical tolerances, temperatures, humidity and automated processes are maintained and constantly monitored. OPTIMA has built over 100 million individual spiral cells since the early 1990\u2019s.",

RedTop For normal engine starting where an alternator immediately monitors the state of charge and provides energy to the battery whenever it is needed. This would describe most stock vehicles, including: automotive and RV underhood starting, heavy equipment where starting is the primary function, and diesel vehicles without aftermarket electronics. YellowTop Use this when electrical loads are higher than average, or when the discharge cycle is more than typical engine starting, such as vehicles with multiple electronic accessories and vehicles without alternators. This can also include vehicles with a lot of factory electronics such as power sliding doors and a DVD player. Examples also include: racing vehicles without a charging system, dedicated drag racers, diesel powered vehicles with aftermarket electronics, and vehicles with inverters, winches, or other accessories. BlueTop The BlueTop starting battery (dark gray case) is to be used when a dedicated starting battery is required and it should never be used for cycling duty. Use a BlueTop starting battery for marine applications and RVs when the battery's only function is engine starting. The dual purpose BlueTop (light gray case) can be used for both starting and deep cycling -- it is a true deep cycle battery with extremely high cranking power. Uses include: trolling motors, marine applications with heavy electrical accessories, and RVs.",

I contacted Amazon who immediately sent me a replacement under warranty at no cost to me; how great is that? The battery failure was probably related to a bad alternator that I replaced after the battery died.Never had a problem with the battery before the alternator failure. I often use an inverter to run my laptop, printer, and charge items and I can do this for quite a while without running the car.Well its now Mar 2016 and the battery died again after being replaced in 2014, and again Amazon replaced it free of cost, no shipping or any other hassles.Well it's 1 Jan 2017 and the battery is dead again. Alternator and electrical system checks out. I was told at a local parts place that the Optima batteries are junk since they moved their manufacturing to Mexico. Amazon will no longer replace it or refund on the thing. Just as well, tired of having to replace it so often.",

                "reviewText": "My old car battery died right in the middle of a starter problem I was having. Batteries seem to have gotten much more expensive since I last purchased one so I decided to get the best (OPTIMA) so I wouldn't have any worries for a long while. The OPTIMA fit my battery holder with the bottom spacer that came with it installed and it starts my car much faster. Plus I think it will last longer than a standard car battery. My experience with regular car batteries is that as soon as the warranty period is up, the battery can be expected to die within a couple months. So, a regular 36 month battery seems to die right around 38 months or so. I'm hoping the OPTIMA lasts a lot longer.",

                "reviewText": "This battery has a 3-year warranty (for residential use), but that warranty is apparently only good for 30 days. If you are thinking that doesn't add up, well, I don't either. Let me explain it to you as it was explained to me by the manufacturer, and by Amazon customer service.Let me start by stating that I was a long-time Optima battery proponent. I have owned a lot of vehicles and Optima has been my go-to battery brand for about 25 years. I have probably bought a dozen of them over the years, and have had as many friends buy them as replacements for their vehicles on my recommendation. A recommendation I will no longer make. I heard from others in the automotive community that Optima is not the company that they once were and that their batteries are no longer made as well nor lasting as long. In hindsight it seems that is actually accurate.I purchased the battery a year ago (it lasted literally a few days longer than a year before it suddenly failed). I looked up my order on Amazon, clicked the \"Get Product Support\" button on the order details page which then directed me to contact the manufacturer, so I did.The manufacturer responded stating that \"warranties are handled by the original retail location\" and advised that Amazon would assist with the warranty as the authorized retailer. I responded back to the manufacturer to let them know that the Amazon site sent me to them. The manufacturer doubled down and stated that they sent a message to Amazon to request that they assist me and that they will do nothing else and that it is up to Amazon to take action.The manufacturer was even \"kind\" enough to provide a link to Amazon's \"About Our Returns Policies\" page which states:\"If you've purchased a defective automotive item, shipped from and sold by Amazon.com, that is covered by a published manufacturer warranty, Amazon honors the warranty. Amazon will either replace the item or refund the cost of the item for the life of the published warranty.\"So, I contacted Amazon customer service and detailed the steps that I have taken and what the manufacturer said. The representative then \"checked with a supervisor\" and came back to advise me that Amazon only accepts return or replacement of items within 30 days of purchase. The representative offered to have me speak with a supervisor since she was unable to assist further.After the original representative transferred me, I spoke with a representative stating to be a supervisor and rehashed everything to that point. The supervisor then regurgitated the same 30-day return policy statement. I then pointed out the return policy published on Amazon's site (that the manufacturer pointed me to) stating that Amazon would refund or replace defective automotive items under warranty for the life of the warranty. The supervisor again regurgitated the 30-day return policy. I ultimately asked point blank if the policy meant that the manufacturer's warranty is only honored by Amazon for 30 days. She confirmed that it was. A bit taken back by her response, I then asked if that meant that any items that have a manufacturer warranty longer than 30 days should be purchased from a brick-and-mortar competitor's retail location instead of from Amazon. Amazingly, she said yes to that as well.Long story short, Amazon is pointing at Optima who is pointing at Amazon who is pointing at Optima, and I am stuck in the middle holding the bill, literally and figuratively. I recommend you save yourself $150-$200 and buy a cheap battery from Walmart. At least you know that they will give you a prorated replacement in store when it fails.",

                "reviewText": "I have used Optima batteries in the past. But recently, financially, I simply could not afford one. Then I found myself and husband stranded at the grocery store. I called a tow truck and he used his jump pack to jump start the car. I was flummoxed. I had the battery *and* alternator tested previously due to some starting issues. (failure start) They both tested fine. Thankfully, my insurance coverage pays for things like that so I was not out of pocket money to the driver. That was my clue it was time to stop fussing with cheap batteries and bite the bullet. I am not sorry, not one single bit. The warranty Optima has, the durability, the reliability! The cold starting in the dead of winter. This company has never failed me. If you want a battery that will get you through the winter months, go get one! You think everything is fine, I don't need that. My car starts. Well, remember back in the day when a battery was weak and cars didn't have all the electronics in them? If you are old enough, you know what I mean. It would drag and you'd know simply by trying to start the car. But no. Not new cars these days. If your battery doesn't have enough juice to start the car, it simply will not do a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g! No clicks, no starter grrs, nothing. You think to yourself, \"I'll just drive to the grocery store real quick to get the stuff I need to do the stuff I'm doing.\" Then BAM. Nothing. Stuck. OOOORRR.... you're at the grocery store. Seriously, get your stuff tested before colder weather hits. You do NOT want that tow bill!",
