                "reviewText": "I purchase several things on Amazon and was giving pretty in-depth reviews. From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",
