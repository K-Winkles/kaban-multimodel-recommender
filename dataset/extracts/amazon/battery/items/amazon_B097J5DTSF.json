I kept the memory in my car before i disconnect the old battery, put this ACDelco in, programed it to my car so that the car can communicate with it properly and all is fine.My engine stop and go system works fine and everything else works great, put my battery analyzer on and it is reading great, when engine is off and when engine is on, also when load is applied, such as headlights, hazard lights, AC, radio etc.great product. If I get a life span of three and a half years or even three years, that would be great, would definitely purchase again.",

It's longer than the battery tray and, therefore, you cannot secure it down. The positive terminal doesn't allow room to connect. The shipping also slightly cracked the edge of the battery. The BIGGEST problem is when I request a return, it says this item cannot be returned, even though it says on this page it can be returned. Money and time wasted. Felt robbed!",

Sorta straight forward installation in a 2007 Mercedes S550, albeit a bit of work crawling into the trunk to R&R.Note: If things like comfort setting aren't working properly or your radio and climate control start shutting down sooner than expected, these are all signs of a failing battery.Note 2: Specifically on the 2007 S550, there are two batteries in the car.
