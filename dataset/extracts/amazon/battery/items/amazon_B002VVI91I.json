I was initially happy that this did fit my 2006 Big Dog. However, the happiness soon ended. I started the bike, took it for a ride, and then (because winter just won't DIE here in MN) had to put it back in storage for MAYBE 3 weeks. During that time, in the heated garage, the battery lost full charge and could not be brought back to life no matter how many times I tried charging it (it would get back to full power, but would not maintain it long enough to give more than one attempt at turning the engine over). At Yuasa's suggestion, I took it to Batteries Plus to have them diagnose the issue. They confirmed it was already dead and then told me WHY these batteries are so cheap. Long story short, I wound up leaving the store with one of their batteries that had an unlimited 2 year warranty for about $10 more than this piece of junk. Amazon won't take my dead battery back (thankfully Batteries Plus did) but at least they refunded my money. There is NO WAY a new battery should die within a month (and ONE USE) of purchasing it!",
