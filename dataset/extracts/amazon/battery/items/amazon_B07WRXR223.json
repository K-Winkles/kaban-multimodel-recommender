                "reviewText": "I bought these batteries to power my Drive Way Gate. I have used several different types and sizes of batteries along with a couple different automatic battery charger/maintainers over the last several years and the batteries have all died to the point they will not hold a charge or even take a charge on some of them. I\u2019ve used standard smaller batteries and even a larger expensive LiPo battery for this application. All of them stop taking a charge after about a year and all of them get to the point the gate doesn\u2019t work or will open part way and stop or will just beep and not move.These batteries are a good price for the pair. I hooked them together in parallel to make a larger single 12V battery. Giving me a 24AH 12V battery. I soldered the wires to the terminals so that there is no voltage drop across a poor connection from spade clips. I also used connectors on the power wire and charging wire that are weather proof as well as can handle the power draw \u201cnot that this pulls a lot of power\u201d. Everything is working great. So we will see how long these last. The size of these were small enough to have room inside the battery box that\u2019s buried in the ground next to the gate so that I could space them from all sides and even underneath as well as from eachother. This keeps them from sitting on cold ground and loosing charge and decreasing their life span. Even with the low cost these are worth it. The gate has been working great now for about a week with zero issue.",
