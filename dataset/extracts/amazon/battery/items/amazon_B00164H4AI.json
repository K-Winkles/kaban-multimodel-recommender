                "reviewText": "There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very, very thorough, erudite and insightful job of it. So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters. I am the last person on earth to demean batteries. I mean, where would we be without them? No flashlights, no little handfans. No smoke detectors. Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel? I remember those days and it was hell. No, we need batteries. Without batteries, our favorite gizmos would be useless...but how do you tell them apart?The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike. They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight, making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom. I am happy to report that they did not explode, burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior. I remember in the old days, batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you. You'd open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting. I have never seen a Duracell do this, but to be fair, I have seen no other battery do it either, not for many, many years. Obviously we have come a long, long way in terms of Battery technology.The D, by the way was plainly marked, so there could be no mistake...although the size is a dead give away. In the box with your other batteries, they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts. So were the little Plus and Minus signs, so you would know which end went in first. Although they could have been a little bigger, now that I think of it. A lot bigger. But none of the other batteries offer this large print, so I won't take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies \"Durable\" so I expected a tough battery -- but really, how tough does it have to be? I'm not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight, am I? So duration is really the only thing to measure, beyond the other factors previously mentioned. Now I know some batteries claim to last longer, the energizer bunny and all that, but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less, so it's hard to judge. I'm assuming if one really did outperform all the others, it would be common knowledge, but it's not, so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating. On the other hand, I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store. I think they were call Emmagizers, so naturally I was fooled. They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice, particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker. So, five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment, sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors, and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question: Wouldn't it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably, when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer, the flashlight that burns out requires Cs, and when you buy C cells, the next Gizmo needs Ds. And it doesn't matter anyway because when you get to the store, you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size. And those little guys, the AAs? What's the story with them? How many penlights are we carrying around already. And don't get me started on those square guys. And while we're at it, how come there are no B cell batteries? One more thing...those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery...the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery. SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious...like it's all being rigged by some international battery cartel. I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off. Good night.",

                "reviewText": "The battery performs excellently in any toy or tool for which it is designed, and its durability is impressive. Despite my kids' toy being a battery guzzler, this powerful battery continues to function well even a week later (the toy requires 4 D batteries). The batteries are well packaged, although opening the package can be a bit tiring. Overall, the quality is very good up to this point.",
