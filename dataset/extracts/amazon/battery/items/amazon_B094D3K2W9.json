They are always fresh (these are expiring 08-2033) and are handy to have when you suddelny need to replace the AAs or AAAs of a remote control or something that relies on battery power and uses these two common types. Buying a value pack makes it easier and more affordable to stock on batteries so you have them when you need them, and not having to wait on a delivery or to buy surprisingly expensive pack of batteries from a store.",
