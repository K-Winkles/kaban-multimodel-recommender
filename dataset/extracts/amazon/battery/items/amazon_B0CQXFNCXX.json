I bought these and a heavy duty 20' jumper cable (Harbor Freight). I cut the jaws with about 12 inches of wire off one end of the jumper cables. Then I stripped the ends of the wires and soldered the ends on for one pair of plugs so I can plug them back together and still use them as jumper cables. I cut the last 6 inches of wire with the battery connection ends off of the winch pigtail, put another end on those and bolted it to the battery on my tractor. I put the last end on the 3 feet of cable coming from the winch. Now I can have the winch on the back of my truck or the front of my trailer and supply power with my modified jumper cables with out bolting or unbolting the battery cables all the time. If i need it on my tractor, I just mount the winch to my fork implement and plug it into the pigtail under the hood of the tractor. Quick and easy.",
