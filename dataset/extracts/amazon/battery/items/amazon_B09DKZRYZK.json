                "reviewText": "These terminals are heavy duty and larger than most I've seen. The bolt for attaching the lugs is larger than usual (a good thing--think corrosion allowance), so plan on using 3/8-in. diameter lugs. For connecting smaller 12 to 18 gauge wires, 3/8-in. lugs are a little harder to find at some of the auto parts stores, but they do exist. You could use the smaller diameter bolt that holds the terminal to the battery, but that not considered a \"best practice\". The terminals installed easily on the battery posts without trying to creep up the posts when tightened. The terminals were different diameters for the positive and negative (as they should be), and they were clearly imprinted in the metal which was which. They appear to be high quality terminals that should hold up to vibration.",
