                "reviewText": "This IS an exact OEM replacement for my 2019 Lincoln Nautilus battery that lasted over 5 years before I noticed it wasn't holding a good charge. The OEM would drop down to 11.7 volts a little too easily, so it was time to replace before I am stuck somewhere I don't want to be. If you are installing yourself, please review a good U-Tube that shows how to remove the ENTIRE air box, which is a MUST to get the old battery out and the new one in. It's a big P.I.A. Also note one more important thing about the Nautilus battery holder - the rear of the holding box has 2-3 inch nubs on each rear side that the battery slides under and holds the rear of the battery down. So you must be able to slide the battery forward to get over the electric wire at the front of the holding box and slide the battery 3 inches forward in order to raise the battery up and get out. One other important thing is to pluck out (and later put back) ALL those little plastic electrical plugs that hold down the electric wires for the entire air box and at the front of the battery holding box. GOOD LUCK !!!!",

                "reviewText": "Since I ordered the battery during the coldest time of the year, I decided to trickle charge it prior to installing it in my 2018 Ford F150. Extreme cold weather tends to drain the life out of batteries. The trickle charge automatically shut off in just a few hours which told me that the battery was well charged and held a charge, which was a good sign. It fit my truck with no problem and took about 15 minutes to install. I turned the ignition and the vehicle fired right up. This was a win win situation for me. However, my 1999 Ford Ranger battery lasted me almost 10 years before I had to change it out. They sure don't make them like they used to.",

I'm dating myself, but at my age I need to take a Charles Atlas body building course to lug the thing around.",
