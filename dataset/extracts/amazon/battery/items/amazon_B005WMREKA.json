                "reviewText": "I bought a Wildgame Innovations feeder from another vendor because it got such good reviews. I ordered the batteries and battery charger from Amazon. Don't do it. My battery was plugged in from 3 p.m. yesterday until 5 a.m. this morning. The battery tester still reads as dead. I am a 74 year old female and have ordered products from Amazon for years. This is the first item that i have ever given a negative review. It may not let me give this battery a rating of 0, but if a battery won't charge, that is a zero. And, yes, i have put it in the feeder to see if it works. It worked long enough for me to set the time and feed time. Then when i tried to test the feeder, the battery went dead. I can't stand things that don't work. How difficult is it to plug a charger into an outlet and clip it to the battery terminals? I do it all the time. So, I have not decided what to do yet. It will make me madder if I buy another battery that won't charge. This feeder may just become a place to store corn and I will order another brand like the one i have that works. My other option is to take my 686 down to the pasture and blow the feeder into tiny pieces. Then I won't be mad anymore. I have COVID, so it will be a while before I can deal with any of this.",
