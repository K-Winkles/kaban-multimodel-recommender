Their batteries, designed primarily for use in their top-notch light (flashlights, weapon lights, etc.) products, function flawlessly in any application. Lithium ion batteries have a super long shelf-life so they're great to have on-hand knowing that they will work when called upon. I use these batteries in both my Surefire brand lights as well as the other brands that I have. They work as advertised and Amazon has the best price that I could find! Highly recommended.",
