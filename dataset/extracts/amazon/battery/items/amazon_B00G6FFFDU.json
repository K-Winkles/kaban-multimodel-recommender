List MSRP is $28.XX + ship, local stealership wanted $32 with a wait... I don't think this is an OEM part, however, everything matches perfectly when compared with the original (see pic). Paired with the Noco oiled rings for a perfect match and hopefully maintenance free for a while!The OEM piece with ~140K on it had worn away the contact coating and when the piece was cleaned after starter replacement, the copper was exposed. The original unit developed corrosion within 48 hours. Get this piece! It's half the price and is what you need. The listing pic appears to have a plastic retainer on the bottom of the unit, but mine did not come with one. The new unit does include a non-OE nut which is a nice touch. Thread pitch and size is the same on both. Hope this helps!",
