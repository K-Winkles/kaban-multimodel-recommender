I only needed one battery but the packaging was two but it was the only item specifically for my car. As it turned out I paid well over $20 for this item but several other single cr2016 batteries were available for $5 or less. I did not need a \"car specific \" battery as all the cr2016 batteries are the same and the special tool did not work and was not needed.
