                "reviewText": "Given my previous experience using this on an aircraft with a Lycoming O-360, and my battery finally failing in my RX8 Mazda, I decided to give it a try. Given that lead acid battery prices have gotten ridiculous as of late, specifically a group 35 for my car was 219 for a cheap one, over 300 for a yellowtop, both rated at 640cca. Then we have the weight savings! This battery is 6.6lbs and the AGM Lead one is almost 44.OK, on to the fitment. This battery is both shorter and narrower than the OEM one, however, the foam that was in the packaging almost filled the gaps needed. I took off the traditional terminals, which was 1 nut, and attached the leads directly to the battery. In my case I had to use different hardware on the positive terminal as I had to put a spacer under, so needed a longer bolt.The car fired right to life, even without charging. After it got a bit of charge to it, the starter turns over really fast now.For the price, this is a tremendous value.",

These batteries for the price are very good. unfortunately (that's why I left four stars) manufacturer( more than likely I probably talked to a distributor not the manufacturer) but even so said I would be contacted within 24 hours 2 Days Later nothing. Amazon resolved issue them I give five stars.",

My fault but was easy exchange.Prior battery had 190 CCA listed on the case. This one is more than double that.It has reliably started the big 1200 cc twin since I put it in.Is now winter in Colorado and the bike is outdoors on a battery tender special to LiFPo batteries.It has been below zero twice and it still works just fine.This battery was about 1/3 weight of AGM unit I removed from the bike.I will come back to this company for another battery when needed for lawn tractor and other Harley Road King.I am happy with this battery",
