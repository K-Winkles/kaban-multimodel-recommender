                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this pack of CR2032 lithium batteries, and I've been pleasantly surprised by their performance, especially considering their great price point. One standout feature for me is their compatibility with AirTags. Unlike some other batteries, these don't have the bitterant coating, which often causes issues with AirTags. This makes them an ideal choice for anyone using these tracking devices.The batteries themselves work well and provide a reliable power source for my AirTags. It's a relief not to worry about the batteries causing malfunctions or being incompatible. This aspect alone has made my experience with these batteries quite satisfactory.However, there is a trade-off when it comes to battery life. I've noticed that these batteries tend to last about 70-80% as long as some of the more premium options available on the market. Once installed in my AirTags, I found myself needing to replace them a bit sooner than I would with higher-end batteries. This shorter lifespan is noticeable, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Considering the affordability of these batteries, I still find them to be a worthwhile purchase. They strike a good balance between cost and functionality, especially for applications like AirTags where compatibility is key. While the slightly reduced longevity is a factor to keep in mind, the overall value and performance of these batteries make them a sensible choice for anyone looking for a cost-effective solution for their devices.",

These are the best value you get a pack of them for an reasonable amount. In store, they usually only offer a pack of two, and it\u2019s the same price as these. I also looked at other Amazon sellers, and again they do not sell this large of a pack for this price. I am super happy with these and the batteries worked great and they last such a long time.",

Buying the multi-pack means I'll have replacements when needed for a good while. These batteries fit exactly, have provided consistently good service and satisfied us.We also have other items around the house that use 2032 batteries so it's far more economical to purchase the 10-packs. This is my third time to buy the 10-packs and each order seems to last me almost one year.It's hard to beat 54 cents per battery for a year's worth of service.My repeat business for this produce is a testament to their dependability, value and workmanship.",

From my watch and car key fob to my medical devices and even some of my kid's toys, the LiCB CR2032s have powered them all flawlessly.Overall, I couldn't be happier with these batteries.
