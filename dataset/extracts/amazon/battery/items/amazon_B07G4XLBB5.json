                "reviewText": "Update: So... apparently the batteries work fine but the sensor they were used to power is faulty. My previous review was wrong! It WAS a faulty sensor, not the batteries! Batteries are wonderful, work as they are supposed to, outstanding price, etc. :) So, as previously stated, I'm back to right a wrong, change the rating, hang my head in shame, and admit my error in the last review. There ya have it. Batteries are fantastic. Buy them! :)Previous Review:These have not lasted. I purchased a package of 10 at the end of Sept. A bit over 2 months later, I have 5 left. 3 or 4 have lasted less than 24hrs, the other one or two lasted a week at best. I know this because the device I use them in sends me a notification when it loses connection... I don't think it's a device malfunction. As soon as I replace the battery, it reconnects. I suppose it could be the device but I'm thinking not. So, I'll get some different batteries and if I have the same result, I will promptly show up here again and update my review. If not... this one will stand. Just haven't had much power luck with these and thought you should be aware before buying. The shipping was fast though. :P",

Guess what\u2026 two of my sensors have their original batteries from two years ago and are still working fine. You might suggest that those sensors aren\u2019t being used as much. However, these batteries are being used in temperature/motion sensors not door sensors. One with an original battery is in my Master Bedroom, so it still is detecting us all night every night. Also, the original batteries for the two sensors these batteries are in lasted almost two years. Two of the new batteries started saying they were low within a day of inserting them, the third barely lasted two months. I can deal with one out of ten batteries failing, that is just bad luck. I CANNOT deal with three out of the three batteries I used failing.Do not waste your money!",
