        "description": "On the street, in the dirt, on the water or in the snow, this battery is ready to get you riding - right now. It comes fully charged. That means you don't have to mess with measuring acid, pouring it into the battery, and charging the battery yourself - a process that can take eight hours. Energizer AGM batteries are ready to install, hook up and go. Their Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) technology helps make them stronger, vibration-resistant and spill-proof. And every model is purpose-built to provide highly efficient and long-lasting power for whatever it is you ride. No measuring, pouring or initial charge required. Energizer AGM batteries come precision charged and permanently sealed from the factory. They are ready to be installed and ready to power your engine immediately out of the box. This is a huge advantage over traditional \"dry-charge\" batteries. Dry-charge batteries are not \"ready to ride\" off the shelf. They come with a kit, which requires you to perform several steps before your battery is ready to work. First, you carefully measure the battery acid (some kits come premeasured). Next, you pour the acid into the proper battery vials. Then you seal the battery. And finally, you charge the battery. Depending on the model, charging time can take eight hours. That's many hours spent not riding. Fits select models of Buell, Harley-Davidson, Honda, Polaris, Triumph and Yamaha motorcycles; Arctic Cat, BRP, Honda, Kymco and Yamaha ATVs; Arctic Cat, BRP, Polaris and Yamaha Snowmobiles; and more.

I called and was told it is not an energizer problem I have to bring up the problem with the vendor. I Emailed the vendor, Clarios, and was told I should take it up with Amazon. Amazon did take care of the problem. The ridiculous run around from Energizer and Clarios is unacceptable given that their return instructions were to go through them.",

                "reviewText": "If you've ever sat in your car at the end of a long day, rain pouring down, playing a futile game of \"Open Sesame\" with your stubborn gate, then you, my friend, know the value of a reliable gate opener battery.Enter the 12v AGM battery - the Michael Jordan of gate opener batteries, if you will. This little box of power has taken my inanimate gate and turned it into a formidable bouncer. It's more reliable than a golden retriever, and it doesn't even need walks or belly rubs!Ever since I installed this battery, my gate opener has been going through its daily motions like a caffeinated Zumba instructor, no matter the weather. Rain, shine, or an inexplicable horde of locusts - nothing fazes this tiny champion.But that's not all, it's so silent, you could hear a pin drop. I thought my gate was taking ninja classes behind my back, and then I realized - it was the whisper-quiet operation of this stalwart battery!So, if you like your home security mixed with an unexpected dash of comedic relief, the 12v AGM battery is the unsung hero you never knew you needed. It may not come with a cape, but it sure saves the day - every time you come home!And let's face it, anything that can deal with the daily grind and still make it feel like a scene from an epic castle entry every day, certainly deserves its five stars. Here's to the gatekeeping hero we all need but don't deserve - the 12v AGM Battery!",

                "reviewText": "From day 1 its worked exceptionally great. Fast delivery and as soon as it arrived I installed it into my bike no charging or adding acids required. I've pretty much used it for this riding season with no issues even with a starter with a bad jack shaft. Oh did I mention this is on my high compression custom built 1340 Evo. . I highly recommend this battery",
