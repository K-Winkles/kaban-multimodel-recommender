                "reviewText": "These are outrageously expensive compared to an ordinary 9V battery. However, I gladly pay for these to use in my smoke detectors.Even living in a small condo, I have a total of eight detectors between CO and smoke detectors. All are hard-wired but with a battery backup. Every couple of months, one would get a low battery, and start chirping in the middle of the night. It's always the middle of the night.I finally got irritated and bought a bunch of these. They claim a 10-year lifespan; I presume that is shelf life. With a small bit of electricity used as a backup power source in these detectors, I'm getting about a 4-5 year run before they start to chirp. (My advice: when one starts to chirp, rather than trying to track down which it is, replace all of them together. They're going to start to fail at roughly the same time so you're in for a month or two of random sleepless nights. It's a weird luxury of sorts to only have to deal with this problem twice a decade, and is absolutely worth the money.)There is one catch -- regular 9V batteries have slightly rounded corners, but these do not. This makes them a very tight fit into some of my smoke detectors. You might want to buy something like this 2-pack and test-fit them everywhere before buying a bulk lot of them.",
