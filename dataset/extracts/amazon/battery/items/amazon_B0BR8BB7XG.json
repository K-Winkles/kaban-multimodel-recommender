There is a small tab connecting one portion that can be peeled back with a finger nail and the package itself just has perforations. You just pull the perforation and they come out. Garbage all the way and worthless. If you can\u2019t pronounce the name, don\u2019t buy it!UPDATE: Company reached out to me through Amazon, apologizing and issuing full refund. Company may be legit but still don\u2019t recommend their batteries.2nd Update: after offering, and giving me a full refund without my asking, I received a follow up message, through Amazon, from this company. I will clarify my statement. When I put a well-known brand battery in my AirTag, it did work again. It was a lot of hassle and I absolutely recommend this company less now than I did from before. I did report to Amazon that the company had contacted me again and they are going to handle it. These people are not worth buying from. Go to the drugstore for your batteries and get a good brand. Also, make sure they really are wrapped in a way that protect your children from choking. These are not.",

I have bought durecell, Panasonic, varta and philips in the past and all didn\u2019t work with the airtags, because off the new anti child coatings. I have cleaned the battery to remove the coating. But it still didn\u2019t work. Happy I found these batteries here. 10/10 stars!",
