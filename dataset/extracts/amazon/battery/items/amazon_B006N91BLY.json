        "description": "ACDelco Gold (Professional) Automotive AGM Batteries are a high quality alternative to Original Equipment (OE) parts. These batteries have high cycling capabilities, are remarkably charge-receptive, and are necessary for 'start/stop' vehicle applications. The Absorbed Glass Mat design is 100% leak and spill proof because the Electrolyte is permanently held in the glass mat separator instead of free flowing within each cell. Oxygen recombination reduces water loss and reassures maintenance-free performance. ACDelco Gold (Professional) Automotive AGM Batteries have longer life expectancy in traditional vehicle applications, due to a maintained pressure on the plates which significantly reduces the amount of active mass lost from the grid. ACDelco Gp;d (Professional) Automotive AGM Batteries also have a 36 month Free Replacement Period. ACDelco Gold (Professional) parts are manufactured to meet your expectations for fit, form, and function, making them a smart choice for General Motors vehicles, as well as most makes and models, including special applications. These high-quality parts are backed by General Motors. Some ACDelco Gold parts may have formerly appeared as ACDelco Professional. ? PROPOSITION 65 WARNING: Battery posts, terminals and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds, chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.

                "reviewText": "This is the second time I purchased this battery, the first time was 4 years ago when I was in need for a new battery for the E350. This ACDelco is a perfect fit and the car starts just like you would expect from the actual Mercedes-Benz battery (for a fraction of the cost). As I do not drive this vehicle often, the battery often gets neglected, but it was completely reliable right up to the last day.This battery was very professionally packed and arrived faster than I expected. No damage, direct fit, and started the car and the rest is history. I have used it for a few weeks now (with a week of the car in storage and not being started at all), and when I went out to start it again, it started without any issues.If you are looking for a good battery replacement for your 2013 Mercedes-Benz E350, this one would be it.",

                "reviewText": "I feel as though this battery and I got off on the wrong foot from the beginning. I had seen another review mention long shipping times, and they were 100% correct. This battery took 2 weeks to ship out to me, missing its first expected delivery date by almost a week. I was explained that this was not normal shipping with this item, but I have a feeling it is. When the battery finally got to me, it was exactly as the listing said, however, I would've preferred that the battery came with a replacement battery vent tube.I installed this battery in my 2008 Volkswagen Touareg. As with everything else in this vehicle, the installation was made difficult as the battery compartment for the SUV is under the driver's side seat. I had watched multiple videos on removal/installation and felt comfortable with changing the battery myself, as I typically DIY most of my vehicle repairs. Ultimately, the battery was installed, but if you have back/shoulder issues, I would not recommend you install this battery yourself in this particular vehicle.As previously mentioned, this battery has worked great since installed yesterday. My vehicle sat for 6 months and started right up. I feel confident with the 36 month warranty that if I have any issues, it will be resolved. As mentioned, the lack of an included vent tube did make my life a little more difficult, but that has since been resolved. Overall, a reliable battery, it just took forever to get to me. I do not believe the $50 savings between ordering a battery on Amazon and getting it in store is worth it considering how long you have to wait to get the battery, especially with the shipping times expected with most items nowadays.",
