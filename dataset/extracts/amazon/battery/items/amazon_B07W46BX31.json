        "description": "Meet the GENIUS1, one of our most powerful, highest-performing, energy-efficient, and compact portable universal battery chargers yet. The GENIUS1 is a 1-amp (15-watt) - 100-240VAC 50-60Hz - 6-volt and 12-volt heavy-duty battery charger, battery maintainer, trickle charger, float charger, and battery desulfator for up to 30 amp-hours. It's designed to charge and maintain all types of sealed lead-acid and lithium-ion (lifepo4) batteries, including flooded, gel, maintenance-free, AGM, SLA, VRLA, as well as automotive, marine, RV, powersports, and deep-cycle batteries. Its advanced battery repair regenerator mode uses slow pulse reconditioner technology to automatically detect battery sulfation and acid stratification, restoring lost battery performance for extended battery life. It can be used and stored almost anywhere - home, garage, mobile, bench, or in car - to charge and maintain any battery - even plug in through your vehicle's 12V auxiliary cigarette lighter port. Its next-generation charging regime utilizes fast charging microprocessor technology to rapidly recharge batteries without any manual intervention. It's a completely automatic, worry-free, professional, and commercial-grade intelligent battery charger with zero overcharge. Designed to be dual purpose - both indoors and outdoors - providing weatherproof and waterproof protection from the outside elements during any time of the year, including winter. Its X-Connect battery connectors - better than SAE - allow for quick-connect permanent connection or connecting directly to the battery terminals. A digital display provides the charging status and tests diagnostics for multiple conditions such as a dead battery, bad battery, reverse polarity, and more.

                "reviewText": "So I have Drone Mobile installed in my Subaru Legacy. For those of you who don't know, DroneMobile uses a constant cell connection which inevitable drains your car battery (common complaint for those who have DroneMobile). The prior year, I left my car in my garage while I was gone on vacation and the battery got down below 12.0 volts (11.8 is what I measured on my multimeter). I figured I better get something to charge it so I ordered this device. Also worked great as a trickle charger. You can leave it on indefinitely if you want. It worked like a charm, though there were some caveats that I'll cover.1. Make sure you know which charger you got. I got the 1 amp. That's going to take a while to charge a dead battery. If you're thinking you need more, get something with a little bit more flow, e.g., the 2 amp will literally decrease total charging time in half.2. The connection to the battery is a pain. It should blink red after a few seconds. If it isn't, there's a chance that the connection isn't solid where you connected it to the battery terminals. I would play with it for a little bit to see if you can get a better connection. I thought I had a solid connection the first time I did it and it was frustrating me that it wasn't working. Take the time to readjust even if you don't think you need to. If that doesn't work, you'll need to disconnect the battery so that you can get the clips solidly on the battery terminals.3. I recommend getting a digital multimeter. You can get some cheap ones that work just fine here on Amazon. Go to YouTube to learn how to get the reading. This will help you in determining how long it should take to charge your battery.So overall 5 stars, though I would say 4.5 is probably more appropriate, but I rounded up. 5 stars for ease of use, quality, and longevity. 1 star for instruction quality. Since you can figure it out from the reviews, I didn't weigh the instruction quality as high as the other areas.",

                "reviewText": "I have a truck that mostly sits in the garage. Every time I need to back it out of the garage, the battery is dead.I know that just sitting isn't good for batteries, not to mention this battery is several years old.Now keep in mind, this is a large amp battery for a SUV, which was so dead, a turn of the key and I didn't even get lights on the dash. I stuck this little charger on it and it took a day and a half, but it charged completely. Ok, now I'm beginning to get a tad impressed.I have two of those old type chargers, you know the ones that after a while you can hear the acid boiling inside the battery, and the battery is getting really hot... you know the chargers that tell you not to leave it on your battery for any extended period of time as this might (will) damage the battery (possibly even start a fire). Well... no more.I'm a total convert now to using smart chargers, and this one seems especially good. I really hope I don't find some little something that breaks 6 months from now, cause I really like this charger! It seems very well designed and made and most of all, it works great.The only negative I can find, it has a single button to select one of several charging modes, and LED's to indicate which option you have chosen, and those LED's are pretty much self explanatory, as well as an advanced mode where you have to push and hold the single button to enter advanced charging mode. For example, if your battery is so bad, the charger cannot detect there is even a battery hooked up, you can tell it to go ahead and start charging anyway which is a really nice feature. As another reviewer mentioned, when you need to use some of the more advanced functions, if you've lost the booklet, well... good luck. The multi-language booklet briefly explains all of the options, what the LED's mean, and that's pretty much it, verbose it isn't..It comes in a really nice packaging, like you're really getting something ( and you are), the unit itself seems well made and thought out, you would think a bit more of an effort would have been put into the manual.But, perhaps the product speaks for itself... and it does. And, after all most users will hook it up to their 12 volt car/boat/motorcyle battery, plug it in, select the regular 12v battery option, and that's all most will ever need. Once the battery is charged completely, the charger senses that, and switches automatically to just maintaining the battery. If you loose power while charging (or maintaining), this charger just picks up right where it left off, so there is no worries about pushing buttons or selecting modes, it knows what you were doing before, and starts right back up with doing it again.Am I glad I got it: YesWould I buy it again: Yes.",

Tough to remove, but far better than clamps for fixed install.Also, when attaching the two parts, although it looks like you can only connect them one way, you can easily connect them the wrong way and get reverse polarity. (If you do, don't worry. No damage to charger or battery. Just reverse connection.)Also, manual pretty awful.Notwithstanding that, great unit, easy to install. Depending on your car, if you have it connected all the time, you can have the connector outside on the engine compartment as I do so you can easily unplug/plug back in when going out and coming back.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because my car wouldn't start (2020 Corolla) in very cold weather as I am old and do not drive it very much. The mechanic at my dealership did not install it, as he said it meant me hooking it up to the battery every time I wanted to use it. Suggested I buy a cable with a connection plug on it, so I could use my extension cord. I ordered the cable from Amazon and took it in the next day, and they installed it. However, I was a bit shocked to find that to connect the extension cord to the new cable I had to pop the hood every time, and then again to disconnect it. My mechanic showed me how to do it (I never had) and made sure I did it several times, so he could see I knew what I was doing. Brought it home and popped the hood and connected the extension cord and the battery charged up just fine. I have gotten used to doing it now, but anyone old, like me, should be aware of this. I never read the readings on it, so can't say anything about them, the mechanic adjusted it and I don't touch anything. I just plug it in when it's going to be very cold, or I am not using the car for a few days.",
