I use this to charge my 12.6 batteries with a custom BMS. Only odd thing about these is they never turn completely off when charging. They will always take a .14 ma. Not sure why but it isn't significant. They are very cold tolerant and I use these in a location that can get below freezing. They work great. Recommend highly. I am going to get more. Then I can sway a charged battery quickly with the spent one. Only weird thing is they give you 3 spacers that I don't use. Maybe they are for a specific motorcycle.",

                "reviewText": "I really hate writing this as I'd prefer to love the battery, but feel the need to inform fellow riders. I bought this battery in March of 2022 and returned in in May. First the good; that battery worked just like it's supposed to out of the box, cranked over the KTM 350XCW with a big-bore kit like a champ. NOCO replaced the terrible standard of nuts and bolts that you regularly drop into the bowels of your bike when trying to connect the terminals. Two thumbs up here. The battery was reasonably priced for a Lithium Ion with a 5-year warranty, which is far and above the rest of the industry. I had a few rides in and the battery was fine. In April I did a multi-day ride and in the middle of the a ride after a break the bike wouldn't start. I kick started it and rode to a place where I could investigate it and then it wouldn't start even with the kick starter. It barely lit the headlight and I assume the fuel pump wouldn't power the injector. I hiked out and got a ride to a auto parts store, bought a battery and finished my ride. Then I attempted to return the battery and that's where the \"bad\" started. I started the return process through Amazon and found out they only process returns in the first 30 days, so I started the process with NOCO. I got a RMA, took the battery to UPS, paid the $14.00 to ship it back to NOCO at the address provided when I received the RMA. Then I waited. 2 months later I still hadn't heard anything from NOCO so I started a chat session. They informed me they never received the battery. After a CSI like investigation I found that the battery was attempted to be delivered to NOCO (at the address they provided) and UPS determined NOCO had moved and returned the battery to the UPS location I shipped it from where I had to go to retrieve it. Then another chat session ensued and I got a new RMA and a shipping label, took the battery back to UPS and shipped it again on Aug 9th. Multiple chats with \"John\" over the next two months and all I could get was \"we're still testing your battery\". He could not answer the simple question, \"when will I get my battery?\" As of today, Oct 3, I still don't have a battery and have no idea when, or if, I will. I have now gone 6 months since the battery failed. His company position is that they haven't had the battery for 6 months, and that UPS not delivering the battery wasn't their fault (even though I sent it to the address they provided). A battery company that offers a 5-year warranty on a product that you can't get replaced makes the biggest value proposition of the purchase pretty worthless. I'm still running the cheap battery that I purchased at an auto parts store and it's working just fine. I'm sure it will fail in a year or so but if I keep it on the trickle charger it may last 2 years. NOCO's fine print says it takes 4 to 6 weeks to replace your failed battery. You're not going to let your ride sit without a battery for 2 moths so you're going to buy another battery for it anyway while you wait. What good is the warranty even if they did honor it if you have to buy another battery while you wait for a replacement? I'm my case I'm even outside of the 6 week window from when they received it the 2nd time, I not only don't have a replacement but I don't even know when I will. I've bought countless batteries for dozens of bikes, 4-wheelers and SXS's over the 40 plus years of riding and this experience with NOCO puts a sour taste in my mouth about them. I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I'll not do business with a company with this poor of a customer service department that won't honor a stated warranty and can't answer the most basic question of \"when\". I'll just buy batteries from Amazon (or locally in a pinch) with no expectation of a warranty. If a AGM or Li-Ion battery has a 6-month or 1-year warranty and fails I'm much better off getting a replacement through Amazon or over the counter to get back to riding, with or without a free or pro-rated replacement.",

I had to replace the short terminal screws for longer ones. But it has worked flawlessly. Even after the bike seating for weeks at a time, this battery always reads above 13 volts and the bike starts in 1/2 a second. One time I left by accident the phone holder/charger I installed in the on position and after a month, the bike showed no electrical power. I plugged in the smallest (1 amp) Noco charger and after 5 minutes, the bike started. Since then, no trouble at all.",

Cranked up you 13 year old Yamaha VX 1100 quite spritely. Pleased at the power. Much smaller than a lead-acid, it comes with little stacking \"bricks\" to make it taller to fit the battery shelf. Only minor complaint is that the bricks don't click together firmly so they like to fall off as you are sticking it down on the battery shelf. Overall, very pleased and would buy again.",
