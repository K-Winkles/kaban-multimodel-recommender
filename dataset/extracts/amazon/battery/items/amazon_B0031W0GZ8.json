                "reviewText": "I needed (3) batteries for a tire guage (not 1 or just 2). So I doubted my local hardware store would carry that quantity in one package for the price I paid here. I would probably have gotten 1 or 2 per pack but not 3. So I checked Amazon and Duracell does indeed market & package the batteries 3 to a pack. Voila, just what I needed so binga, banga, boom. Ordered them, they arrived and fit like clockwork. Device is now working again. I would recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "Where the product is described as Batteries 3 Count (Pack of 3), they were provided in packs of two (see photo). However, where I ordered 2 packs (six cells) I actually received 8 cells.These do appear to be the correct battery chemistry however Silver Oxide, not Alkaline, so assuming that this is in fact the case, then I'm happy enough.I specifically wanted packs of 3 because that's what my calculator uses (3 off) so now I'll effectively have to split a pack to get the third cell, but it's no big deal.These batteries are usually around \u00a31.50 each or so, so the price I paid was a tad high. However, I can't seem to find them at any of my local retail outlets., who only seem to carry the LR44's (Alkaline) which I wouldn't trust any further than I could chuck 'em. So ,I guess paying a bit over the odds is OK.",
