Great fit and of course I installed one in my Quite old \"Casio\" work watch, an ever so easy task for anyone who can use a small (Jewelers) Screwdriver, which are also available by dozen of choices, Sets or otherwise on Yours Truly \"AMAZON\" ! I am also going to order the Multi Selection Package of a General assortment of \"Common Size\" button batteries as they are sometimes called. Small/round disk shaped like tiny Coins !!! My particular size (number) (Not so Common) is #371 BUT also the other Number is SR920SW which is just another \"INDUSTRY\" number !!! Forgive me but I want to be Informative to some of you all who may not know these things. It's fairly easy to change a battery in \"Many\" watches !! I have \"Tackled' quite a few !!! Thank You Amazon and your Suppliers for Great Products, many selections, Great Prices and Great Deliveries !!!",
