                "reviewText": "Decided to buy these quality AAAs instead of cheapos since it was for a project I was working on for my family. They last a lot longer and have a better charge in them while they are working. The LED lights I used them for were almost twice as bright and lasted several times longer than normal. When not on sale these can still be VERY pricey, but if you see them on sale snatch some for your next project! Pay twice as much but replace them far less frequently- overall works out to a similar price point because of how many cheapos you'd go through so quickly normally!",
