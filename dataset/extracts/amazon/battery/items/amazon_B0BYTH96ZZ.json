                "reviewText": "If you're committed to recycling, these are the batteries for you. If not, you'll find these to be a bit pricey. I really only recommend these if you plan to follow through to send them in for recycling.They test out with a consistent 1.6 volts for both the AA and AAA batteries. They aren't oversized and didn't have any problems fitting into the various devices I use them for.They come in a nice box that helps you store them both before and after they're used up. The ends are a different color, so when you use one up you can place it back in the box upside down and you'll be able to see which are good and which are bad by color. When you've gone through them all, they provide you with a website address to go to in order to send them in for recycling. Unfortunately, I can't provide much information on this process because the website still says \"coming soon!\" for the service. I gather this is a brand new product and they are just getting up-and-running.They seem committed overall to using recycled materials in their packaging and production. If you're trying to live a more \"sustainable\" lifestyle and looking for a battery that can help you achieve that goal while recognizing there is a cost to being more environmentally responsible, you can't go wrong with these.",

The ends of the batteries have two different colors and once the battery is used you put it back in the box with the opposite side up.

                "reviewText": "I love anything innovative and eco-friendly so naturally i gravitated towards this amazing AA/AAA set of carbon neutral alkaline batteries. It'll definitely come in handy since my household goes through a ton of batteries fairly quickly with just the Roku/TV controller \ud83d\ude05 It probably doesn't help that we use mostly cheap dollar store batteries lol. Hopefully these do offer long-lasting and high performance power \ud83e\udd1eIt arrived in a nice, reusable storage box(made from recycled material) with 20 x AA batteries and 20 x AAA batteries along with cute, positive energy stickers. Inside the box is printed information on how to keep track of your used and unused batteries and how to return when fully depleted at no cost to you. You simply go to the website: betterbattery.co, select recycling and tap on the \"Recycle your batteries +\" bar and it'll generate a prepaid recycling label for you(not officially available yet but will be in a couple of weeks, should you require one sooner contact: hello@betterbattery.co). Located behind the box is a spot for the shipping label and according to the description each box comes with a convenient return shipper polymailer as well. I recently used 3 x AAA batteries for a domino train with steam feature and it works incredibly well so far but time will tell how long-lasting the power truly is and if it's indeed leak-proof \ud83e\udd1eOverall it's certainly pricey with a 2026 expiration date(3 years) that's quite short in comparison to other brands like Duracell and even Amazon that are cheaper with a significantly longer shelf life of 10 years. On the big upside these are sustainable carbon neutral batteries that are fully recyclable including the packaging so no waste equals a better \ud83c\udf0f for all \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "The Better Battery Alkaline AAA and AA Batteries make impressive claims of being carbon-neutral and fully recyclable, which caught my attention. I have experienced leaks with alkaline batteries from well-known brands in the past, so I was hopeful these batteries would address that issue.The batteries were well-packaged in a recyclable cardboard box with informative printed information. I appreciated the inclusion of 12 stickers and a designated space on the back of the box for attaching a shipping label to return the batteries for recycling.One aspect that concerned me was the relatively short shelf life indicated by the date stamp on the bottom, which appears to be 2026. This is notably shorter compared to other batteries that offer a longer shelf life.With a current sale price of $44.99, these batteries are pricier compared to a typical 40-pack of batteries. While the cost reflects their environmentally friendly features, it may be a consideration for those who frequently purchase batteries.In conclusion, the Better Battery Alkaline AAA and AA Batteries offer commendable eco-friendly attributes and address the issue of leaks. However, potential buyers should be aware of the shorter shelf life and higher price point when making their purchasing decision.",

I have installed them in various devices, including my smart door lock, wireless mouse, and wireless game controller, and have been using them for two weeks without encountering any issues. The battery's performance has been consistent and reliable.In my household, we always seem to have used batteries lying around, and every time when I come across battery collection boxes in supermarkets or stores I suddenly realize that I should bring end-of-life batteries for recycling. As far as collecting and recycling batteries goes, I think this product is a much better and more efficient way. After using up the batteries, you can download recycling labels online and send the batteries back to a recycling facility. No more worrying about finding a physical recycling center. I like the battery box, it is designed to avoid short circuits, prevent damage from leaking batteries and help the environment.PS: currently, the recycling labels can only be obtained by email and cannot be downloaded directly from the website or the QR code on the box.",
