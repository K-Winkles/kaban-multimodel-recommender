I have waited to post a review as several motorcycle batteries I have purchased worked great for a couple of months, then they flatlined. The oldest is almost a year, then 6 months, and a month. So far, no problems from any of them. It was sized for my 4-wheeler, the other two, the size wasn't an issue, so I just bought the same one. One runs a winch on a trailer, and the other one is running a gate controller. Both of these are on solar chargers. They all maintain charge well. UPDATE: I would estimate that they are dying between 2-3 years each. I have replaced two of them. Normally, that would not rate five stars, but since these are the only motorcycle batteries that I have ever had that lasted longer than a year... 5 stars",
