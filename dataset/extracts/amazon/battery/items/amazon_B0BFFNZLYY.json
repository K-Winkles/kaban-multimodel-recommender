At first glance, these seem pretty good. The packaging is cheap cardboard, but who really cares. The fact that these are made in Vietnam probably explains the price. It will only be in a few months that I will really know if the quality makes this a buy or great buy for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these batteries because inflation has driven the price of alkaline batteries insane. So these were purchased hoping that they would be a decent value. The only way to tell is a battery test which would show the actual energy in the battery.Using a fresh Amazon basics battery as a reference I tested both the Amazon battery and the Powermax by discharging them through a resistor (about 200 ma) until the voltage reached 0.9 volts (a common cutoff voltage for testing alkaline batteries). Imagine my surprise when the Powermax battery stopped at 2191 mah (milliamp hours) and the Amazon basics stopped at 1768 mah.Please understand that this was one test at one discharge rate and a sample of only one. Nonetheless, there's no doubt in my mind that these batteries represent a very good value. Assuming the manufacturer maintains the price and the quality, they've got a winner here!",
