                "reviewText": "I was concerned that these Energizer Industrial alkaline AA cells might be reduced in price because they were old stock. If they turned out to be I was prepared to return them. They DEFINITELY ARE NOT OLD. I purchased them in 03-2023 the shelf life date marking on the cells is 12-2032 suggesting that these cells were manufactured three months ago. Bravo!!Background: Alkaline cells experience \"self-discharge\" at a rate of 2\u20133% per year, which results in 7-10 years \"shelf life\". Shelf life for \"primary cells\" (meaning non-rechargeable) is established as the length of time the consumer can store the product at room temperature and still expect it to deliver 80% of the original amount of energy.",
