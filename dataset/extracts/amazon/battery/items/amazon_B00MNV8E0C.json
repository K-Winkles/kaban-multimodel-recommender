                "reviewText": "Ah, batteries - the unsung heroes of our modern digital & gadget filled world. The Amazon Basics Batteries, are a reliable choice that offers quality and value in equal measure. Now, I know we've all been tempted by those bargain-bin brands, but let's face it: they're about as useful as a chocolate teapot. With Amazon Basics, however, I've always found long-lasting power and a surprisingly pleasant quality \"hand feel.\"When I stock up on these AA batteries, my collection box runneth over. And trust me, that's a good thing! Between remote controls, game controllers, and countless other gadgets, there's always something in need of a little more juice. With a 10-year shelf life and leak-free design, these Amazon Basics batteries never leave me high and dry.While writing this review, I checked six nearby battery-powered items (just for kicks). Half of them were already running on Amazon Basics batteries! The other half? Well, they came with their own batteries in the product box, so I can't fault them for that. But when it's time for a swap, you can bet I'll be reaching for the Amazon Basics.Amazon Basics batteries aren't just limited to AA and AAA sizes. Amazon's battery lineup has got me covered from A to Zinc (see what I did there?), with button cells, D batteries, and more. The packaging is crisp and clear, so I always find the right fit in a jiffy, especially since they are bright orange in a sea of toned down basic colors inside of my battery surplus box.One part of Amazon Basics Batteries that I appreciate is the that they take a stand for the environment. With a longer lifespan than your run-of-the-mill disposables, they'll make fewer trips to the landfill and help reduce the eco-impact of battery production and disposal. Amazon Basics batteries leave behind the hazardous materials like cadmium, mercury, and lead, all notorious for their toxicity to humans and Mother Earth. They are crafted with eco-friendlier materials, such as alkaline and nickel-metal hydride. The packaging for Amazon Basics batteries is also green as it's designed to be recyclable, it ensures that even the final resting place for your batteries is eco-conscious.While I'm a fan of Amazon Basics Batteries, there's one minor gripe that keeps me from giving them a perfect score. I've noticed that they may not last quite as long as some big brand name batteries in power-hungry devices. However, Amazon Basic Batteries make up for that with their price, quality, quantity, shipping times, and convenience. These batteries perform admirably in devices with lower power requirements, like TV remotes and wireless keyboards. But when it comes to gadgets that rapidly drain batteries, these do not appear to be the top choice. I'm just very mindful of the amount of batteries I go through, as I'd rather not contribute excessively to e-waste, especially with batteries. Despite this minor shortcoming, Amazon Basics Batteries remain a solid choice for most everyday devices.For the power hungry devices or devices that are needing a longer lasting battery, I tend to go with the more expensive Lithium Ion batteries. For everything else these do beautifully. It's a win for my devices, wallet and the planet. I highly recommend them and they are my preferred choice for needing a good replacement to basic household batteries.Supplemental items shown here:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09364DK3P - Battery box with foam battery cutouts",

Doch mittlerweile habe ich sie vor zwei Jahren zum ersten Mal bestellt und bestelle sie nun alle drei bis vier Monate immer wieder - ich bin total zufrieden!Die Haltbarkeit dieser Batterien hat mich wirklich beeindruckt. Egal ob in meinem Fernseher fernbedienung meiner Kamera oder meinem xbox Controllern, sie halten zuverl\u00e4ssig und lange. Ich bin regelm\u00e4\u00dfig \u00fcberrascht, wie lange sie in Ger\u00e4ten halten, die einen hohen Energieverbrauch haben. Es war f\u00fcr mich eine wahre Erleichterung zu sehen, dass ich nicht st\u00e4ndig die Batterien wechseln muss.Neben ihrer beeindruckenden Leistung bin ich auch mit dem Preis zufrieden. Im Vergleich zu anderen Markenbatterien sind die Amazon Basics deutlich g\u00fcnstiger und bieten dennoch die gleiche, wenn nicht sogar bessere Leistung. Ich habe es ausprobiert und kann mit Sicherheit sagen, dass diese Batterien eine echte Alternative zu teureren Produkten darstellen.Die Tatsache, dass ich alle drei bis vier Monate neue Batterien kaufen muss, zeigt, wie langlebig sie sind. Die Batterien sind nicht von minderwertiger Qualit\u00e4t, sondern bieten tats\u00e4chlich eine starke und langlebige Leistung. Das hat mich \u00fcberzeugt.Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich sagen, dass ich von den Amazon Basic Batterien begeistert bin. Ihre beeindruckende Leistung und Langlebigkeit haben mich wirklich \u00fcberzeugt. Ich kann sie allen empfehlen, die nach zuverl\u00e4ssigen und bezahlbaren Batterien suchen. Der Kauf lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!Note: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

I went down a rabbit hole, researching batteries and trying to find out if you had to pay more for better batteries, and my findings were worrying. Expensive is definitely not better. In fact some of the most expensive batteries, blowing their trumpets loud and clear, underperformed woefully in many tests. These Amazon cheapies were by no means the best in the tests that others have performed, but they gave a very good account of themselves, and this is my experience of them so far.",
