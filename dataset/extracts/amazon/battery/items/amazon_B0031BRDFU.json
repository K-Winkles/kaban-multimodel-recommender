                "reviewText": "I am posting this mainly to give my personal experience and simultaneously try to clarify the potential context of another users review. That review said (somehow MISTAKENLY) that this YTX14H battery does not fit a Burgman 650. With all due respect to the reviewer... their review is 100% wrong... it is just plain false! I say this because (following a hunch) I ignored that review, ordered and installed the battery and found that it absolutely fits my 2006 Burgman 650 (AKA Suzuki AN650) perfectly and without any problems whatsoever. As a matter of fact... It \"fits like a glove\" & I am not sure as to why the other review says that it does not. I can only guess that maybe they did not purchase from \"ships from and sold by Amazon.com\"... In other words, they purchased from one of the alternate sellers on the right top area of the product page. I am further guessing... either those sellers accidentally sent the user the wrong battery or intentionally did so. As far as the quality of the battery... I can only say that it arrived fully charged from the factory & fresh (manufactured 5 months ago) It required zero charging before starting my bike with it. I gave it only 4 stars because I have not used it much so I can not speak to the battery life or dependability yet. Another battery note specifically for Burgman Riders (while I am at it). If you have been researching you might have come to the conclusion that a very popular Burgman DIY youtube guru, whose user name is L****e (also famous on Burgmanusa.com user group) recommends the Motobatt brand battery. I was also under that impression until I stumbled across a reference to him having a bad experience and a complete change of heart on that brand of battery. I emailed L****e directly to ask his opinion on the motobatt and he confirmed that he no longer recommended it because the Motobatt failed / went bad very quickly. I asked him what he uses now and he said Yuasa. As a result, I invite you to revisit your original research because \"smart people learn from their mistakes and ingenious people learn from other peoples mistakes\" :-) Also, (per my conversation with Yuasa tech support) please note that only the \"YTX14H\" (with no other letters whatsoever) is the high performance version of the battery and the only version that is \"factory activated\". High performance means higher cold cranking amps. I don't think the high performance is necessary for the Burgman... (but when I purchased) it only cost a few bucks more so I \"went for it\". Yuasa said that they recommend \"factory activated\" because the battery sits on an angle and thus should be sealed at the factory. That being said, my personal opinion is that you are probably good with or without a \"factory activated\" battery. But don't take my word for it, call Yuasa tech support at (866) 431-4784 and ask them. So to all Burgman 650 riders out there... If you want this battery... just be sure to order from the \"ships from and sold by Amazon.com\" supplier and you should have no worries.",

Many motorcycle will not run without a charged battery. Many times, if your battery goes dead, your bike will stop running, so even a jump start will not save the day. If you are by yourself with a dead battery, you better be prepared for a possible long walk.Every Yuasa battery I've owned have lasted four years or longer, even in a extremely Hot city like where I live where you're lucky to get 2-3 years from a car battery. When not riding, the batteries on all four of my bikes are plugged into a trickle charger, because the worst thing you can do to your battery is to allow it to become drained, regardless of the brand.Yuasa might cost a few dollars more, but when comparing the CCA's, they are far superior to all others, including their longevity.",

                "reviewText": "I would have given this 5 stars but contrary to the listing, this battery came with electrolyte in a separate container which needed to be loaded into the battery and then charged for 12 hours. The posting states \"Factory activated - filled, sealed and charged at the factory\" which was not my experience.I will say it was easy enough to load the electrolyte. The container is sealed and when you place it over the battery the seals are punctured without any risk of leakage. Luckily I have a suitable battery charger and was able to get things going but was not what I was expecting.Battery working well now that it's all charged up.",
