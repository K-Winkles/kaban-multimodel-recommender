                "reviewText": "Before purchasing this battery, I searched high and low around town to get a replacement battery for my 2018 CF MOTO 500. Every battery that I looked at around town was well over $100, and most auto parts stores didn't even have part numbers for a CF MOTO. After going through my owners manual, it did not give part number for a replacement battery. All it had was a12v 30amp battery installed. So armed with that info, all I need was the correct measurements from the old battery and a 12v 30amp. Well, behold I came across this one that gave the EXACT MEASUREMENTS and amps as my old battery, even tho Amazon says that this battery will not fit a CF MOTO 500 CFORCE. Well, I'm here to tell you that it fits perfectly. The battery came in 2 days, fully charged and ready. I installed it in minutes and my ATV fired right up! Again, this is a direct replacement for my 2018 CF MOTO 500 C FORCE.As far as reliability, all your going to get out of these batteries are about 2 yrs. give or take under normal usage weather you put them on a trickle charger or not.For the price, you can't go wrong.It's probably a direct replacement for alot other ATVs that's not listed. It's a great battery for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Only problem I have is with the warranty registration. They want the order number which is in the email notification, but, when I enter it into the form, it rejects it... WTH? Otherwise, I have no issues.After having the battery a while, I'm not so sure it's a good deal. It sat for about 2 months, on a tender, and when I got an opportunity to ride, the battery almost stranded me on the way home. Now, I'm not sure it was the battery but my '08 Electraglide Ultra had NO throttle response... I was lucky that the situation caused the idle to be much higher than normal and I was able to make the 15 mile ride home, albeit at a top speed of about 20 MPH. Once I got home and parked the bike, I needed to fire it up to move it a bit and the battery was stone cold dead. Finally, after over a week on the battery tender, it's now live and will start the bike AND I have throttle response. As soon as I can get the bike to the shop and have them go thru it to determine what the throttle issue is/was, I'm replacing the battery with one that I know will work, even though it'll cost me 2x as much as this one. I have no faith in this battery now... And I won't buy another. First the warranty registration fiasco and now this. Nope... I'll spend a little more $$ to get a battery that I *KNOW* won't leave me stranded on the side of the road.",

                "reviewText": "Terrible experience. Purchased this product, after approximately 9 months the battery quit working, I went thru the process of getting a replacement, I had to pay for additional shipping for the replacement, just to have the replacement be faulty within 3 months, so 2 bad batteries within the original 1 year free replacement period. Spent additional money on my UTV to make sure there wasn\u2019t an issue on my side. Confirmed no issues on my end so asked the vendor to replace the faulty replacement and the said that there replacement policy was to only replace their product one time. I asked them to reconsider this process because the battery they replaced the original with was faulty. No response. Poor experience and poor customer service. Would not suggest this vendor, spend the extra money and pick a different vendor, beware, this vendor has several brands of batteries, do your homework.",

                "reviewText": "In spite of Amazon insisting this battery would not fit a 2013 Polaris RZR 4 XP 900 EPS, the dimensions were correct and it was a simple drop-in replacement of the factory battery.Battery weight was just barely less than the original battery at 21lbs. I believe that's a direct check of how much lead is in it, and some 30L-series batteries are far less, at 17 or 18 lbs.The battery arrived fully charged, at 13.17V. My charger also reported it at 100%, so no preparation needed from me.Once installed, the UTV fired right up and all lights had plenty of juice.The battery terminals are not molded lead terminals like on other batteries. The terminals are stamped metal which I'm sure will be fine, they seem very secure. One thing I do like about these terminals is that they have holes for terminal screws on the side as well as the top of the case. Chrome includes double the screws, nuts, and spacers, so my main engine battery terminals are on the top, while my accessory lights connect to the side terminals.Update: May 7, 2021. It's been almost two years, and this battery cranks like new. In the past year, I was unable to drive the RZR much, but this battery didn't lose it's charge, even during one period last summer where the RZR wasn't started for a few months. The engine cranked a bit, but fired right up. I've been very happy with this battery.",

                "reviewText": "Had a problem with this product. It has an 18 month warranty however trying to make use of that warranty has been an issue. We bought the battery through Amazon.ca but it came through a third party. After using it for less than four month the battery no longer holds a charge. We contacted Chrome Battery on an online chat. After contacting them twice (didn\u2019t get an update from them the first time) we were told they don\u2019t deal with Amazon Canada and we should contact the third party. We did that and were told unfortunately they do not have another battery to replace our\u2019s. We were advised to contact Chrome Battery. Amazon basically washed their hands of it. Since shipping the battery back costs almost as much as the battery is worth we have no choice but to suck it up. So\u2026\u2026..buyer beware.",
