                "reviewText": "Many years ago I wanted to go rechargeable for all my in house devices. I started with the white and black Eneloops. The Eneloops I have back from 2015 still are working in 2022. I've bought more over the years of course too. The black ones can charge 500 or so times, the white ones over 2,000 times. Now, if you charged a battery once a week, it would take 10 years to charge around 500 times. The black ones do have a bit more 'fuel in the tank', and are better for devices like cameras; but overall, the white ones have seemed basically just as good to me for most uses. And they are like half the cost. And they can be charged 4x more. So, decide what you want / need.Both the black and white versions work great. I use the black ones in more 'high demand' devices (flashlights, portable fan, etc.), and the white ones in less demanding devices (like remotes, mice/keyboards, etc.).Haven't had a single issue. I use their 4 port charger (model BQ-CC17). I have two of them that I got with 4 packs of batteries. So, I can easily charge 8 batteries in a few hours. Very easy to keep all my batteries topped up. I have one bin for full batteries, and one for empty; and I just charge them whenever I have time.I haven't bought one time use batteries in about a decade, and I don't plan to ever again. If you are thinking of going rechargeable, these are a great way to start. You get quality that will last, which is the point of going rechargeable in the first place. I have tried many other brands as well, most had issues over time. The Eneloops just keep on going. I will say the Amazon brand batteries have also been great. All have kept working for years and they hold a good long charge and seem good quality as well.",

                "reviewText": "These ENELOOP PRO high capacity batteries are working great so far. I'm using these batteries with the Windows Mixed Reality ( WMR ) controllers & the Lenovo Explorer VR headset. I was playing VR for about 3 hrs & the battery dropped from 3.9 mA to about 3.7 mA & it only took me about 30 minutes to bring it back from 3.7 mA to 3.9 mA which is great! Sure beats waiting hours for older rechargeable batteries to charge back up again.Something you may want to know if using rechargeable batteries with WMR VR controllers.I had lower capacity SONY Cycle Energy Ni-MH AA 2000 mAh rechargeable batteries that I was using with my WMR controllers. I would let them charge for 7 hrs as instructed but whenever I tried to play my VR games the controllers would trigger an alert about the batteries being depleted within 30 minutes or less & would auto turn off haptic feedback in order to conserve battery power. Within less than an hour of use the controller would turn off & leave me scrambling for new batteries.I was under the impression that my rechargeable batteries were too weak or had gone bad so I purchased the ENELOOP PRO high capacity batteries as a replacement. After popping in the new batteries the problem persisted with the WMR controllers.Did a little research & discovered that WMR controllers are prone to false battery alerts & shutdowns when the internal & external battery contacts are dirty from small dust particles & finger oil residue. The battery clips that make contact with the controllers main-board needs to be carefully cleaned with a q-tip & a bit of 70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol.This requires the controller to be carefully disassembled so that the internal contacts which make contact between the battery clips & the main-board are properly cleaned. The isopropyl alcohol will remove fine dust particles & other debris to ensure solid contact while reducing power resistance which may lead towards false battery alerts.After going through that process, all my rechargeable batteries are working great. I confirmed that it's holding the charge with a basic multi-meter set to 1.5V ( 4.0 mA ).",
