                "reviewText": "Duracell 32-MA92-DH0O Procell Alkaline Battery, AAA (Pack of 24) is an excellent choice for anyone who needs long-lasting, reliable batteries. I've used many different brands of batteries in the past, but Duracell Procell stands out as one of the best.These batteries are incredibly durable and long-lasting, so they're perfect for high-drain devices like flashlights, remote controls, and other electronics. I've found that they last significantly longer than other brands, which saves me money in the long run and reduces the number of batteries I have to purchase over time.Another great thing about these batteries is that they come in a convenient pack of 24, which means that I always have spare batteries on hand when I need them. The packaging is also designed to be easy to open, so I can quickly and easily replace the batteries in my devices without any fuss.Overall, I would highly recommend Duracell 32-MA92-DH0O Procell Alkaline Battery, AAA (Pack of 24) to anyone looking for high-quality, long-lasting batteries. They're durable, reliable, and an excellent value for the price. Whether you need batteries for work or for personal use, these are definitely a great choice!",

                "reviewText": "I hate changing batteries in my remotes and these Duracell Procell are the longest lasting AAA batteries I've tried in my Tivo remotes. Those are the most battery hungry ones I have. That's just two of them. All my others go longer between battery changes with these too. Excellent.I have a few small flashlights that take AAA cells I keep around the house and in my car. They are good and bright but I don't use those anywhere near enough to tell if these Procell batteries last longer in that application too.I got the 24 pack because I like how it's packaged with groups of 4 cells in their own little box inside the main box. The take up very little space in the kitchen drawer where I keep batteries and other stuff I want to have handy.Some others have reported dead or weak batteries or wrong brand batteries mixed into the boxes. This is my second box and so far I've had none of these problems. The ones I've noticed seem to be mostly reported a couple of years ago. Maybe it was a previous seller of these batteries? I don't know but I've had good luck so far.Having a reliable remote for longer times between changing batteries is why I selected these Procell's from Duracell. Great batteries at a good price. I'm very happy and giving these 5 stars.",

They aren't inexpensive, but if you use a lot of batteries, the savings will be better. I think they are worth the extra cost. Plus the shelf life is excellent I would have given 5 stars except the shipping time from order to date shipped was a bit long. However the delivery company did get them here 2 days earlier than expected. Packing left a bit to be desired as the box was in a padded envelope and the inside box was broken open. Nothing was missing, just rough handling I suspect.",
