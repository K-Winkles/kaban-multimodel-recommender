                "reviewText": "If you are like me, you must hate buying batteries at the store because: a.) they are grossly overpriced. b.) most stores do not sell them in bulk. c.) most stores have a poor selection of brands available.I needed to replace the 9v batteries in all of my smoke detectors and didn't have much time to shop around, so I stopped in at the local rite-aid store that was closest to my house, and was disappointed to find that the best deal was a 4-pack for about 12$. Begrudgingly, I purchased those, went home, and immediately went online and ordered the Duracell ProCell 12 pack for about $16 which was much more cost effective.It will be hard to beat this price (~1.3$/cell) at almost any store. I paid ~4$/cell at the local drugstore. Sure, maybe walmart or a hardware store may have bulkier options at a better price than a drug store. Even if they were the same price as the Duracell Procell batteries, you still cannot beat the fact that these will ship straight to your door at the click of a button and save you a whole trip, gas and more importantly valuable time.But, are the Duracell Procell a quality set of 9v batteries, as well as cost effective?Quite honestly, this is the first time I've been impressed by a pack of batteries before, but these 9v batteries have many features that show attention to detail and prove that these batteries are of the highest quality.- The batteries are assembled in the USA (Link for Assembled vs. Made in USA http://www.nspa.com/documents/AssembledvsMadeinUSA.pdf)- Expiration Date: Every battery was rated until Mar 2020.- Size: Standard 9v Cell, Fit perfectly inside my Smoke Detectors and dimensions matched the previous energizer 9v cell exactly.- Voltage: No Load - Every battery measured 9.62v on my voltmeter.- Protected terminals: Each cell is equipped with a protective plastic cover to prevent inadvertent discharge and maximize lifetime of the battery.- Satisfaction is Guaranteed: On the side of the box is a guarantee against any material and workmanship defects, and an offer to replace any item that was damaged by these batteries. There is a phone number listed; however, based on the superior quality of this product I expect the company is losing money by hiring an employee to man phones that never ring.Overall, the price, packaging, and quality of these batteries is excellent!I've noticed a few 1 stars due to issues with the quantity received, or 1 or 2 with low capacity. My recommendation if you do happen to have this issue would be to contact the seller, see if they will resolve it, and if its an issue with capacity contact the service phone number on the box.The caps on top of these batteries make it very easy to measure their voltage with a voltmeter when you get them.",

                "reviewText": "The Procell by Duracell has the same capacity of the retail 9V Duracell batter, so don't be fooled by the name. Procell image is that of industrial or professional strength, but in reality it's not. The only difference is the lack of retail packaging and how they brand the product (looks).A battery's shelf life (without usage) varies by the material it's make from and is dependent on storing conditions.Ultra (AA/AAA) = 10 yearsCopperTop (AA/AAA/C/D) = 10 yearsCopperTop (9v) = 5 yearsLithium Coin = 10 yearsAlkaline (Hearing Aid) = 4 yearsRechargeables = 3 yearsCoin Cell Batteries = 3 yearsStoring in a cool dry place and you get the max as noted above.The procells are in the coppertop group (i.e. shelf life is 10 years). So if the current lot shipped is 2021, the batteries were produced in 2011. So what right? Well sitting idle for more than 1/2 it's life, it means you should expect some degradation to the batteries upon receipt. The worse case scenario is a full blown leak. Knowing the storage conditions may be more important than the expiration date of the current lot/batch they're shipping. But you do need both questions answered for a good read on whether or not it's a good buy or not. The printed expiration year is based on the date of manufacture, anywhere from 3-10 years depending on the type of battery.Price of 9V batteries retail for 2-3 bucks apiece. At clubs, they retail for under 2 bucks apiece and as low as 1.50 apiece when on sale.Here, on this site, they were going for 1.3 bucks apiece when I made my purchase.Whether it's a good buy or not it's subjective. The lot I was buying was had 2021, which means they were manufactured in 2016. But I also needed them in a pinch since all my smoke detectors were chiming in sync to an annoying chorus. The fact that most of my purchase would be put to use immediately made it a great buy. If I didn't need them straight away, or if my local club always stocked a fresh supply, it may be well worth it to pay the extra 20-45 cents apiece for the added shelf life...I'm giving this 5 stars because of the \"freshness\" of the lot, which really is a reflection of the sellers turnover rate.",
