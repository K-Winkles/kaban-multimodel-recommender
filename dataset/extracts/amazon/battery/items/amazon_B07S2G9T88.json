                "reviewText": "I purchased the 6-pack of these batteries. I know they're an off brand, but I'm tired of paying top dollar for the major brands and within a couple years of the batteries being put in put the smoke detectors or garage door openers, they have to be replaced. It wouldn't be so bad, but I have Vaulted Ceilings and the builder was a Mascochist. Unless, there's a law stating that the smoke alarms have to be installed at the HIGHEST part of the ceiling. 3 rooms have vaulted ceilings over 2 stories high. We have to pay a handyman to change those batteries. But, after a couple hours of CHIRP, CHIRP, CHIRP, I'm ready to pay him.It says these batteries have a 7 year shelf life and they were well dated into the future, so I feel pretty confident about their longevity.The last battery we put in a smoke detector, we had to pay $6.99 for ONE at the local hardware store. That was just a regular EverReady.These appear to be powerful in the applications I've tried them in. I do recommend these. They're strong, quality made, low cost, long lasting, well packaged for easy removal and storage. They're also backed by Amazon's guarantee. Thank you for reading my review.",
