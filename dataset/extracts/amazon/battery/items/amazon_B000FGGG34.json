                "reviewText": "The batteries are obviously lower capacity than other options but they do perform within reason against their specified 1300mah capacity. Keep in mind this is discharge capacity so actual usable capacity rather than the amount of power the battery accepts during charging. My measurements in the pictures are after nearly 2 years and probably ~30 cycles.So 5 stars for the batteries really, but the charger is 3 stars because you have to charge in pairs. Which is bad for the batteries, produces less consistent charge, and is inconvenient. Things I didn't realize are downsides when I bought it.So together the pair gets 3 stars.",

I had and still might, it could be someplace in storage, a different charging unit and it was better than this one for two reasons. The two prongs to plug in didn't rotate to hide (which is good for traveling and I understand the reason behind), which secured it in the wall better. Secondly, the batteries stayed in place better. I don't know if it's because the one I previously had was only for AA, where as this one is for both AA and AAA batteries.I use rechargeable batteries mainly for my Xbox controllers. I have 3 sets of AA rechargeable batteries and 1 set of AAA batteries. Which are used for the Roku/Firestick controllers.",
