They do not last as long as a lithium battery pack which makes no sense. I've changed\\charged the batteries about a dozen times now and one set has 2 batteries that complete the charge an hour before the other 6. The other set takes about 2 hours longer to charge.With this specific purchase, the batteries arrived dead. I was not able to locate an expiration date. It took about 3-4 hours to charge them. They must have been sitting on a shelf for a decade to have arrived dead when the batteries say they are pre-charged and ready to be used on them.When you have 8 batteries in one device and suddenly 2 of them charge more quickly than the others it means either 2 or the other 6 batteries are going bad because they should all be depleted together and charge to full together. Having one set take 1-2 hours longer to charge is also not a good sign. It could be the charger, but I marked it so that I will know next week when I charge the two sets again if one charger is taking longer than the other. Both chargers are the same correct model for these batteries.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these in hopes that they would help me be less wasteful with my batteries, especially for holiday decor, specifically LED pictures and LED light strings. During the first 4-5 hours of operation, they work great! Lights are BRIGHT. But after this time frame it's a crap shoot on whether they need to be recharged.For... and giggles I ended up putting some standard alkaline batteries in one string of LED lights and these in another string, identical to the other. The alkaline batteries have outlasted these BY FAR. While the alkalines have dimmed quite a bit, they still power the lights while I've had to recharge these 5-7, which is disappointing. While they definitely outshine the alkalines in brightness, they just don't crank out power over time. At all.Pros:+ Rechargable (half a star)+ charger uses USB power, which is GREAT. I can't emphasize this enough. (two stars.)+ when it does power my devices, it powers them at full power the whole time the device is on. (Half star)Cons:- Expensive (minus half star)- Seems to be on full blast for a much shorter period of time and then dies. (Minus star)- takes 4 hours ish to charge. (Minus half star)Other thoughts... Maybe I just don't understand how the battery works? What ever the case, it's annoying that my alkalines last longer for my specific use case, especially for the price. I used EBL batteries while stationed in Germany, without issue and is why I purchased these. I'm curious if NiCad batteries would be better suited for my use case?",

                "reviewText": "In theory, these are great; they provide 1.5v+, which is important for some devices that cannot tolerate the 1.2v that NiMH batteries provide. That said, these get really hot in camera flashes - almost painful to the touch - and they don't last very long. I think the product needs a little work yet.N.B. that the red version need to be charged in an EBL charger; they do not have USB ports.",
