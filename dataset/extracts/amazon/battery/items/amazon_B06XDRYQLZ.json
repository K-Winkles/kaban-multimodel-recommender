                "reviewText": "This battery was $30 bucks shipped after tax. You can\u2019t beat that value. My battery was packaged well and didn\u2019t have any damaged. The pamphlet states if the battery was sitting for months that it may need to be recharged. I don\u2019t get why everybody is getting upset just trickle charge it. I pulled the voltage first and it was strong reading 13 volts and my scooter fired right up very strong. The only complaint I have is the terminal screws being so short. If they\u2019re were a few mm longer this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I had to hold up the stud with a screwdriver to have the screw thread into it. My terminals are not thick at all. A longer screw would make this battery 5 stars.",

I was a little worried because the price was so low ( less than 1/4 of the dealers price ) that it may not work. He installed it and sent me a picture of the 2 of them flying around the yard having a blast. The battery is working great. I won't have any hesitation to order another battery from this company.",
