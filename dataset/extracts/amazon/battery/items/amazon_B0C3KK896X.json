This battery seems like a good choice - it has 1Ah more capacity, fits the units perfectly, and is budget-friendly. It arrived fully charged as my charger indicated full almost immediately after connecting it. The battery manufacture date is about 7 months ago, so it's relatively \"fresh\". A test run of this in the UPS with just my monitor and desktop plugged into it kept them running for about 25 minutes when I unplugged it, which I consider pretty good! The seller offers a 12 month warranty, so that will give me plenty of time to gauge the longevity and to tell if there's any degradation in capacity. As of right now I would recommend this battery, particulary since it fit the UPS just like the original, and the price is right! If it gives a few years service, I'll consider it a great deal.",

                "reviewText": "This is the only such battery that came with a leaflet with technical data and instructions \u2013 kudos for showing concern and providing detailed info on the technical characteristics. The instructions have several types of batteries listed, and this one is included under \u201c12V series\u201d. There is a typo on the \u201cAttentions\u201d section: \u201cStore the battery in a cool place (best below 20C or 68C)\u201d \u2013 they mean \u201c68F\u201d.The battery got charged on a basic 12V charger with no fuss, and the load tester shows it within the good range for its size and construction, all good.The real test for quality in these batteries, from what I\u2019ve seen, is longevity: real good ones tend to last 6 years and more under normal use, while I have seen others last for less than two years, all in the same price range. This battery has a 12 months warranty, so at least there is assurance against a total lemon. But I cannot rate it yet for longevity.",

Typically, I get about four to five years out of one before it needs to be replaced. This battery seems to an exact duplicate of others I have purchased over the years.My alarm system battery is already 4 years old, so I went ahead and replaced it with this unit. I waited a couple of days after installing it and then killed the power to our system. The battery kept everything powered up, so it seems to work well. Obviously, there is no way to gauge longevity yet, but I see nothing that would indicate it not lasting as long as others I have purchased over the years.",
