Even after receiving a replacement set, I faced the same issue. This led me to suspect my fob was the problem, but the old, nearly depleted battery still performed better.Eventually, I returned them and opted for Duracell batteries instead. These arrived in official packaging, with each battery easily accessible. To my relief, they worked perfectly as soon as I inserted one into the fob. From now on, I'm sticking with Duracell for reliability.",

                "reviewText": "Duracell quality and reliability - just don't be in a hurry to use one. I don't know if it is a part of the child-proofing, but I have never found any package so difficult to open. After a considerable time struggling to get a battery out, I found that the batteries are sealed between TWO thin plastic layers, in between TWO cardboard layers. It is not apparent that there is a second invisible transparent plastic layer and you can try to tear the carboard all day long and not get the ^%$&^!! package open. I will avoid this particular part in the future - regardless of price.",

                "reviewText": "Keeping a pack of these around for the inevitable replacements needed in key fobs, smart tags, remote controls, etc. just makes sense. Tried a generic brand's larger pack and had three dead when need the next one, only a year old. Not had that problem before with Duracell or Energizer. Going with a name brand makes a difference and this is a good value.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these batteries since I needed them and it was not until they arrived that I noticed all the child safety features. First is the packaging. These batteries are sealed up tight. No child will be able to get to them and I venture to guess it will thwart some adults as well. Not me, I am a manly man and no trouble getting the battery out in under 10 minutes time.I then noticed that they have a bitter coating. Not having children myself, I felt it was up to me to test that feature. I popped my newly freed battery into my mouth and within 15 seconds was spitting it back out again. They do not taste pleasant as all. In fact the taste lingers for a long time and should tech any child to never put one back in their mouth again. I feel that I should go ahead and test a few more to make sure that quality control is there.Overall, these batteries are the tops of pop when it comes to child safety. Do you even parent if you don't have them?",
