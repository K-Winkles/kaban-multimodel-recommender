I'm hoping these batteries are of the same quality (or hopefully better) than from 2014. Not that I'm complaining. I must have saved a ton of money versus disposable alkaline batteries. I also charge them in a high end Maha MH-C9000 Powerex charger, using the proper 1C charging variables. Will report back any problems.",
