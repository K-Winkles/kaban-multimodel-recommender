                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Works perfectly in my wife's 2012 BMW 535i Key! Bought the 10 pack so we will have many backups. These should have a 5-10 year shelf life. Because her keys are in her purse I think the buttons get pushed against other objects, thus decreasing the battery life span in her key. I told her to keep that key in a separate compartment so this wont happen. Battery installed last night worked great this morning with no more dash warnings. I'm going to put a backup battery in her glove box just in case the key dies on us while we are out and about. 10 batteries shipped and at my door the same day and cost me $11.11 is a great deal of backup safety and security. Not to mention our peace of mind. The replacement process is easy. I watched a YouTube video but just watch mine here for this style key.",
