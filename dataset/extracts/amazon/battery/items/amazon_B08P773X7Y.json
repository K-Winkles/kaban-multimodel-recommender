I have not been disappointed. I use these in so many of our kids toys from light up wands to books with audio to book lights. They are also used a lot in holiday light up items or pen lights, etc.The battery life has been excellent on these and not once have I got a bad batch out of multiple orders over the years. Compared to the energizer ones I also had these seemed to last as long if not longer that i switched completely to AmVolt for LR44 as they are usually much cheaper. The packaging is durable enough to hold unused ones in and easy enough to get out to not frustrate me.",
