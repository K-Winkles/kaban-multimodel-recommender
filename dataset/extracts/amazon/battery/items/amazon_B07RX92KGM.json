                "reviewText": "I got these batteries after watching a YouTube video where a number of batteries were tested against each other for longevity and performance. I had never heard of this brand (Voniko) prior to seeing this video but it turns out this was one of the better performing brands and priced considerably below the more well known brands (who by the way did not perform well). I've installed them in a number of house hold items now but as they have only been in service for a month I can't attest to their overall longevity however none have failed so far. If they hold up as I expect they will then this will be our new go to brand.",
