In the past we've purchased off brand or store brand batteries to save money since we need 8 AA batteries each time we have to replace them. I decided to get this package to see if they last longer. This should have been my first move. The box the batteries are packaged in is a nice sturdy one. Not a clear plastic, flexible one like a multipack in a retail store. It fits nicely into a small drawer on the end table. The batteries last a long time, they don't have to be changed every 5-6 days like other brands. This will end up being on my \"subscribe and save\" list!",
