                "reviewText": "I needed to replace the battery in my Stanley jump-box, the 55/1000A, midsized version.It came with a 19AH battery and this one is a 20AH battery, so I wasn't expecting much of an upgrade.To my surprise, it made a big difference. I'm not sure if the 19AH that the battery it came with was a complete exaggeration or the hole in bottom of my battery has been there a lot longer than I think.I've been having some problems with my Mazda rx8 starting and the jump box would say it was fully charged and after a couple seconds of cranking it would no longer even be helping, let alone be used more than once, so I figured it was time it needed to be replaced. When this battery was delivered, I took apart my jump box and that's when I found the hole in the bottom of the battery.This battery fit in there perfectly no alterations were needed, before charging it, I hit the test button and it showed two out of three lights, so I plugged it in and topped it off.It sat there for about two weeks before I was able to diagnosis I had a bad coil, replace it, spark plugs and wires. Since the battery that was in it it's only a couple months old I knew I'd need the jump pack still to start it because of all the cranking I did prior to replacing the coil.If you know anything about mazda rx8, you know that you can still flood the engine in a modern car and before I did the repairs, apparently that happened so I was cranking on the jump box a lot trying to do the clear flood procedure. After I performed the \"clear flood procedure\", it fired right up.My best guesstimate is I was cranking on it for about 30 seconds straight, then another 30 seconds, without waiting a minute in between for it to recuperate. I could tell the flood procedure that's just about to complete so I stopped cranking waited 30 seconds and then I started cranking again, for another 10 or 15 seconds before I was completely sure that the \"clear flood procedure\" was complete. This is when I initially tried to start the car want the repairs and the flood was cleared it still started the car better than the three-month-old battery when it was brand new which was a surprise since I had been cranking on the engine for so long.After I got the car started, disconnected the box I hit the battery status button and it still had three lights, showing it was a fully charged pack. I knew that it had to use some of the juice, so I took it inside and plugged it in anyway. To my surprise, the light stopped flashing but then an hour which it usually takes lot longer to charge the pack from 1 or 2/3 of lights power.Since then, it's been sitting around and I through a battery tester on it and it was still at 14.4V.For battery to replace the one that your jump box or jump pack came with and you're not trying to start a v8 (which I don't know about. this one very well could as the jump boxes original factory battery was only 19AH and it had no trouble starting a v8)Anyways, this is a great battery for your battery pack, but if I had a v8 and may have opted to spend the extra $9 and got the 22AH but seeing as how I no longer have a v8 in my life nor do I have 9, zero-turn mowers I need to worry about getting started every morning, 6 days a week anymore, I was confident the 20A battery was going to do just fine for my needs and so far so good, if anything should change I'll come back and update my review, but I am very happy spending $40 on this battery versus spending $150+ to buy a brand new jump pack with the same capabilities.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this battery to replace the 18 AH battery that came in my Schumacher XP2200 Jump Pack, which has built in 120v inverter, two 12v cigerate lighter plugs, air compressor, matress/tube pump, and LED light, awesome unit. Here is a link to it: https://www.amazon.com/Schumacher-XP2260-Instant-Portable-Starter/dp/B004EIAADG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1474255224&sr=8-2&keywords=schumaker+jump+packThe XP 2200 came with an 18AH battery and after 4 or so years of extremely heavy use and being kept in a trunk in the hot alabama sun all the time, it would no longer hold a charge. I pulled the battery out and saw that it was a pretty standard form factor. I wanted to replace it with a battery with more Amp Hours so i started research, a LOT. I finally came accross this ExpertPower EXP12200 20AH battery. It had pretty much identical dimensions to the 18AH battery. And at 38 dollars the price was MUCH cheaper than buying a new jump pack with a slightly smaller battery capacity. The only difference was the lug mounts on the top, but I was pretty sure this wouldn't be a problem (and it wasn't. I just pointed the copper L-brackets that were used on the other battery in a different direction and it cleared perfectly when sliding back in.After installing, I charged it up and ran it down with a laptop and 120v fan plugged in; I did this about 3 times. Now this jump pack lasts at least 30% longer than it did when it was new. This is obviously a battery of higher quality than what was originally included, and it has 2 more AH as well.,This battery was a much better price for any other 18 or 20 AH battery I could find anywhere else, include the batteries and bulbs store.I HIGHLY recommend this battery for any purpose, especially replacing a dated jump pack battery.",
