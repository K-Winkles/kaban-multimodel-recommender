                "reviewText": "My battery on my 2003 Polaris Sportsman 500HO stopped holding a charge about 6 months ago and I pull started it ever since until I needed to use the winch and it wouldn\u2019t work with the atv running but if I hooked a jump box to the battery it would work. So I broke down and bought this battery. It comes charged, and packaged nicely so it\u2019s not bouncing around. Comes with bolts and inserts where you can have the terminals on top or on the side which was a nice touch. Seems like good quality. Hooked it up and within 15 seconds, I let all the magic smoke out of my wire harness. Clearly I had a short up front by the winch and it smoked everything in between before I could get the battery disconnected. So make sure you know why your battery isn\u2019t working. A++ battery. Ended up cutting the fan connector out of the harness and crimped on some QD terminals so I could continue to use the atv until the end of hunting season. Then I will tackle the harness and I\u2019m sure the battery will work just fine once that\u2019s sorted out.",

You don't find many mc batteries w/18 mo warranty. My friend tried a Li-po on his Harley ($400) and got rid of it in 10 days as it would not start it like it should've.

                "reviewText": "I live with my parents, and two tools my father and I use for snow removal is an old Alis Chalmers tractor with a bucket and plow blade, and a 1993 Yamaha Big Bear ATV with a plow blade.The ATV's battery died, and after my father researched local availability and pricing, he found this battery and asked me to order it for him. This battery's dimensions matched the old battery's size, so it was a direct replacement in terms of fitment.He's been happy with this battery so far! It didn't take him long to set the battery up and install it into the ATV, and he's been able to start the ATV without too much fuss, which is an improvement over the old battery, even before it was on its last legs.Even fully charged, the old battery couldn't supply enough current to crank the engine and produce a potent enough spark to get the engine running on its own. My father or myself would have to rig a jumper battery to the ATV to get it to start. Those days have ended since we got this battery.I contemplated probing this battery with my multimeter and recording some voltage readings, but I have no baseline as I never probed the old battery or rigged the multimeter to measure current draw, and my father is not electrically or electronically inclined, so he cares little for such data.So, all I can say is for our application of this battery in our old 1993 ATV, this battery has performed satisfactorily. We aren't blown away by this battery's performance, but we are definitely happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "This was one of the suggested batteries to install into my 2004 Polaris Sportsman 500 HO. It arrived on time, fully charged and ready to install. It fit into the battery compartment perfectly and it came with all the necessary nuts and bolts to wire it up! I checked the state of charge with my voltmeter and found it to be fully charged and ready to go. I fired up my atv and it runs great. Charging system is working as designed and so far so good. I've kept this battery on a battery tender and I fire up my atv once a week to make sure everything is as it should be. Good battery, not too expensive.",
