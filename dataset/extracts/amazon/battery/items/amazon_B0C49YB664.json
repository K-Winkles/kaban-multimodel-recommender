I checked one package with my multimeter, and they're putting out 1.65 volts, so starting exactly where a new AA battery should be.These appear to be good, long-lasting, and reliable batteries, but perhaps overpriced. Amazon Basics alkaline batteries, also with a 10-year shelf life, are at well under half the price of these, for a package of 48.

Energizer batteries on Amazon are .86 cents a battery for name brand that you know is good. These are an unknown brand with no reputation on longevity of their batteries. Will see how long they last.",

While I cannot speak to shelf-life yet, the battery life is excellent. I've tested them in things like LED candles and flashlights and they do great. In fact, I've kept them in a couple of LED candles running non-stop 24/7 for the past 29 days and they only started to slightly dim at around day 20 (but are still running and lit enough to consider acceptable at 29 days).For normal use (in other words - not leaving them running non-stop for a month as I did in my test) I can tell the battery life will be great.",
