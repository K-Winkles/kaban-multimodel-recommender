Well my laser pointer is cracked out. The thing drains Duracell batteries faster than my ex wife drained my 401(k).Once they arrived (the very next day mind you) I carefully installed them inside of the laser pointer per the instructions that came with the batteries. After all safety checks were met, I engaged the switch to activate the laser beam. To my horrifying amazement, the laser burned through my ceiling up to the second floor of my condo where I had been stock piling horse teeth for a uni project. Once Russia invaded Ukraine I was approached by Ukrainian special forces whom which kindly but sternly asked for my immediate assistance. For weeks I\u2019ve been staying in a roomy 4x6\u2019 foxhole with 30 tubs of C4 pre workout, 3 crates of Raisin Bran cereal and the complete discography of Rage Against the Machine on tape and the Ukrainian government was generous enough to give me a Walkman and the 1987 summer edition of Hustler magazine. All the while I\u2019ve been lasering aircraft and missiles out of the air all day and sometimes all night and I haven\u2019t even had to change the batteries yet. Which is good because I wasn\u2019t able to bring them with me on the flight.",
