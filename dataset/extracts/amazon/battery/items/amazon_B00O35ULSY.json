Unfortunately, the battery seems to have been sitting on a shelf for a few years because it was in even worse shape than the one being replaced. It barely powers the remote (and yes, it is the recommended OEM). Not the sellers fault, than I can determine, hence the 4 stars, but a big disappointment.",

Full charge, very please and because it's a Duracell, ir should last a long, long time.Very pleased.",
