The wires go in easier, the straps are simple and workable, and the case is study. It also comes with dividers for small batteries to lock it in tougher and not just \"fit within a box\"",

                "reviewText": "Its hard to beat the price point especially with the extras. Things to know about the 24-31 size box in Dec 2023 that I had a hard time figuring out exactly in the description (look at my photos).1. It does have a divider and some grooved slats, but the divider is not solid. It should help keep a size 24 battery from sliding around. I might put a small battery maintainer in the empty space.2. It comes with a strap, but its not obvious not to tighten it down (my pictures might help). It also comes with two mounting clamps that you screw into the side of your boat/whatever that I'm assuming you pass the strap through to the the entire thing secure. This is still a nice bonus because the didn't have to include it.3. It has top vents. Probably because Hydrogen is light and will fill the top of any space so thats why almost all battery cases have top vents. It has small plastic vent covers with a spacer that will probably break off over time leave open vent slats. But still nice try to reduce water entering.Still a great deal for what you get.",
