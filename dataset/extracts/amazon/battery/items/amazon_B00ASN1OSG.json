                "reviewText": "Although I have only ran the bike once, the chrome battery works great. It gave the bike plenty of its power back. I rated a 4 rather than 5 because the battery was not an exact fit for the 1994 Honda Magna as advertised. It was shorter than the original which made it to where the cables would not fit. Easy fix tho I just folded a piece of cardboard put it under the battery to make it sit taller and away we went",
