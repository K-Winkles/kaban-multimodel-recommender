                "reviewText": "Perfect fit inside my BGE70 APC Back-UPS network back up. Works great as expected, fit perfectly, delivered quickly. Wish it was packaged better though. It was all by itself inside a USPS Flat rate box with no protection. It arrived seemingly okay, however I did wonder about it.I bought again, this time a four pack as another of my BGE70 APC Back-UPS started blinking red and blue LED under the power button. This time they came the same way, in a USPS flat rate box with hardly any padding (inadequately packaged in my opinion). All four in the same box with just a sliver of cardboard in between them. The outside package did not indicate fragile or handle with care, nor did it say which side was up (not that the carriers ever pay attention to this anyways, but at least it shows someone tried).The battery fit inside as expected and the blinking LED stopped blinking. Now I have three batteries waiting for when my other Back-UPS fail. These batteries fit perfectly inside the BGE70 APC Back-UPS and from my research, they should also fit inside the Cyberpower SL700U (even though it says the battery isn't user replaceable). Will be maybe a year before I will know for sure on those because I have had them for just under a year now. Buy these if you need, they fit as sized and work well inside the Back-UPS.",

As you can see from one of the images I posted, the actual width is closer to 1.75 inches.Time will tell about the longevity of the battery.
