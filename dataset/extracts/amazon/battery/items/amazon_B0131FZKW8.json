Fit is exact for aforementioned make and model. Why spend more ? It easily cranks the bike.I had the same understandable concerns that others would have. I had never mail ordered a battery before. I have always bought them in person before. I thought \" will they sit it on concrete somewhere in the shipping process? \" and \" will it be cracked when I get it?\" and \" will it really be fully charged ?\" I know these are the same questions others have and will have.I can say in my case that they must not have set it on concrete. It was not damaged in shipping. It did come fully charged. 5 stars categorically. It came quickly as well.",

The P.O. said it had a new battery, but the bike couldn't be started because the gas was leaking out of the carbs all over the engine. I bought it anyway. Well the battery was toast, it may have been new but that was probably a long time ago. About a dollars worth of O rings in the needle valve seats fixed the carbs. This battery brought it back to life. There is nothing better than an old new motorcycle with a new battery. Starts instantly and runs flawlessly.",

The terminals have regular clearance holes and they provide a nut that goes under the terminal for the screws to go into. Not a problem but just be careful not to drop one of those nuts before you screw the battery terminals back on.",
