                "reviewText": "The bike was easy to assemble, there are great videos online and the instructions are clear and it took about an hour and a half by myself. It rides very smooth I take it 8.5 miles to work every day. Charges in about 3 hours and can go about 20 miles distance. Hits the advertised 21 mph at full charge on flat conditions. I have seen it hit 23 mph downhill and has a top speed (without pedaling) of about 15 mph uphill on a full charge. On less then full charge the speed will fluctuate between 16-20 mph depending on the slope of the road. Pedaling faster makes it go faster uphill but doesn\u2019t do much difference downhill. You practically never have to pedal but if your bike were to die it also pedals the same as a normal bike with the power off so you wouldn\u2019t be stranded. The folding works wonderful it has fit into every car I\u2019ve needed to put it in so far. The lights are bright and effective. The bike itself feels sturdy and well made. The bike is able to ride in grass with ease making it able to go almost anywhere, just avoid large gravel patches at high speeds. Other than needing to store it inside and not riding it the rain as per the manual\u2019s suggestions I have no complaints about this bike and am considering buying a newer model for the longer range and the basket.",

                "reviewText": "Bad break switch at first? Had to wiggle the break sensor wire or it would go. I didnt realize the break light has a sensor to turn it off and on again.I contacted tech support. Email was a little too slow for me. They responded quickly, Im just impatient so I called. Phone support went through the functions of the bike and figured it was a bad throttle so they shipped me a new one, and a new speed controller?? WOW! free of charge.As stated im impatient so I wanted it to work now! I started checking the connectors. Simly disconnecting and reconnecting. I got to the break sensor in the handle bar lever. Unplugged it, tail light went out, and just like that it was off and running!I didnt think you would want break sensors like it has. then I road it and realized you certainly want the sensors working. I plugged it back in and unscrewed the sensor. Tightened it back up with a little bit of holding it in specific place. Now it works 100% as intended. Not another issue!Did I mention I love this bike? I have been sharing it with my wife. She is just over 5' tall and the mountain bike she got new was too big. It scared her. I thought she was nuts at first. Then I road it. And hated it. I remember everything about the old school style of mountain bike and just hate them. Giant heavy tire that is creepy and scary at times. Anyrate im 6' tall. I just marked the seat post hieght and adjust it for her, then for me.I plan on buying a 2nd one for me soon!Great buy, price, company, experience, great all around. Thanks Jasion!",

                "reviewText": "This review was edited Nov 21, 2023I LOVE THIS SMALL EBIKE!Have 493 miles on my baby now - so gotta share more.This bike is built ROCK SOLID!It will do an indicated 20 or 19 MPHIt will do that for 11 or 13 miles (depending on your weight) - then you will noticeat 36v battery - speed will decrease a little bit) and you want to head home.If you ride at Power assist 2 the whole time - A 130 lb rider can get 20 miles.I can BANK on 15 miles - riding full blast (130 pound rider)I love this particular bike so much - I damn near want to buy a 2nd one!OR the Jasion EB7I have owned my EB3 for 12 days and have 122 miles on it.For reference - I am 5ft 6in and 130 lbs.So far - I love it!It is well designed and well built. Assembly was straight-forward (for an ex helicopter mechanic) - but one thing the manual should have clearly stated - which I figured out in a minute or two - the black bolt that is in the front fork is only intended to keep the forks from bending during shipping - it is NOT used in the bike after shipping - it should be replaced with the long silver one with rounded ends, that is included with the parts.The speed will reach 20 mph on level pavement, and I am getting about 19 miles range before needing to charge (using throttle in a thoughtful manner).It delivers all that it promises - and I enjoy it a lot!I added some bright orange tape to the handlebar post, base of seat post, and rear monoshock to improve visibility.Changed the seat to one with springs - which helped a bit, but the seat it came with was almost as good :)And added a mirror on the left.So happy with this - I will likely be buying the Jasion EB7 soon!The one \"complaint\" I would have - the designers placed the speedometer in a less-than-perfect position.The throttle on the right grip on the handlebar is 47mm wide, and the right side of the speedometer protrudes about 10mm into/over the twist throttle. When I place my hand normally on the throttle, my right thumb knuckle is touching the speedometer. Everytime I hit a bump that makes the handlebar move up-then-down quickly - the speedo beats on my knuckle (which hurts) so I end up moving my hand slightly, to a position that does not feel entirely natural. I may just tape a little foam or sponge there.I purchased this for $309 plus shipping and that was a good deal. It is now about $299.If you are looking for a quality 14 inch tire eBike for about $300 - I think this is an awesome machine!",
