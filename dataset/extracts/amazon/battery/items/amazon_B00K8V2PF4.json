                "reviewText": "I searched for a replacement battery for a Westinghouse WH7500SE portable generator and this battery was at the top of the list. The battery in the generator was too weak to start it and I needed the generator running. When the battery arrived and I went to install it I discovered it was not the correct battery for the generator but was considerably larger. There were no visible markings on the old battery while it was installed and I assumed (I know) I had ordered the correct battery. It turns out the original battery was 14 AH and the replacement is an 18 AH. I would return it but it is essential the generator be operational. So the new battery is being held in place by tie wraps because of it's size.I have to assume some responsibility here because I should have tried harder to ensure the battery I ordered was the correct one. I suppose my beef should be with the Amazon search engine for sending me to the wrong replacement battery. Anyway, the battery comes with new bolts for the cables which is a good thing because the original ones are larger. The construction is solid and it started the generator instantly. I'm not sure how long it will last though because the top edge is touching the generator housing. So, battery = good, search = bad, and me = not so great.",

Even though generator has a built in battery, this insures that no matter what I can get it started. FYI, generator has an 11 HP engine which is almost impossible to start with the pull rope. This is the third Mighty Max battery I have bought over the years, not just for this jump box, but including my others For less than half the price of a new jump box, I can renew my existing to like new..",

Opened the package, tested open voltage which was 12.9 volts after sitting on a cold step for a few hours. I was happy with that and load tested it and it passed with flying colours. Installed in genny and fired it right up. If you need a new small form factor battery from Mighty Max ML18-12 12V 18 AH the one I received could not be better. I mention the company so there is no confusion as to what I bought and from whom since Amazon seems to mix their reviews.",
