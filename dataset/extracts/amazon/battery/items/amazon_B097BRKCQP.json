The UPS gave me no warning ahead of time.) I replaced them with these and it works just fine. And the UPS is now six pounds lighter! The only downside is that LiFePO4 has a different discharge curve than lead-acid, so the UPS doesn't really know what the charge on the batteries is. But they charge up completely, and I ran them down and got the full energy out.These should last much longer than lead-acid batteries do. That's why I bought these lithium batteries instead of cheaper replacement lead-acid batteries which are $45. These work, have about 10% more capacity, they're much lighter, and should last many years. I'm happy.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a battery from this seller, and while I initially encountered a problem with the product, their customer service team turned the situation around completely!Upon receiving the battery, I found that it had some faulty cells and a faulty Battery Management System (BMS). Naturally, I was disappointed, but I decided to reach out to their customer service team to see if they could help.To my surprise and delight, they responded promptly and with utmost professionalism. They apologized for the inconvenience and swiftly arranged a replacement. Not only did they send me a new battery, but they also used expedited shipping, ensuring I received it quickly.The new battery performs flawlessly, meeting all the specifications as advertised. I couldn't be happier with its performance, and it gives me peace of mind knowing that it's reliable and safe to use.I can't stress enough how much I appreciate the exceptional customer service provided by this seller. They turned a potentially negative experience into a positive one, and that level of dedication is hard to come by these days.In conclusion, I highly recommend this battery and this seller. Their products are of good quality, and their customer service goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.Thank you for the great experience!",

Item is eligible for return but customer is responsible for return shipping. Have you ever tried to ship a 12v lithium battery? If it's any larger than a small battery USPS won't even take it and it's a logistical nightmare with the other shippers not to mention the expense. If you decide to but this item, be prepared to roll the dice on whether you get a good one or not. At $120 a pop I'm not ready to take that chance anymore***Update*** Seller contacted me and said they were arranging for a full refund of the purchase price of the defective battery abs that I did not need to return it. I've updated my review to 4 stars",

                "reviewText": "Bought a pair of these to replace some old SLA batteries in a UPS. The batteries in the UPS are oriented such that they live on their side in normal operation. I took the pair out of the box and charged them up with a benchtop power supply using the voltage and current specified in the product description (14.4v and 6A). When finished, one battery was fairly warm to the touch. I set them in the seat of my car to take them to the installation site, and they fell over. One remained warm for the duration of the ~50 minute drive and leaked some odd smelling fluid onto some of my mail and into my seat. The fluid melted the plastic window on an article of mail.Needless to say, a replacement for a \"Sealed\" Lead Acid battery should also be \"Sealed\". A battery purported to have an integrated BMS should also not seemingly overcharge itself to the point of physical failure.The standard Replacement/Refund process offered by Amazon for this item requires that it be shipped back, even if defective. I'm not about to take on the risk of committing a felony by knowingly shipping a battery leaking who knows what hazardous material through the mail system.I guess I could give one star for the *single* working battery out of the pair, but I'm not confident enough in the QC of these to risk letting them live on their side once installed. Very disappointed.",
