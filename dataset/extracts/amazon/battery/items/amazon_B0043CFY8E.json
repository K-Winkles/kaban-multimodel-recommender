                "reviewText": "I had 2032 and 2025 batteries on hand. Still, I watched some videos about key fob replacement batteries, and the battery's thickness is super important, so I purchased these as per recommendation for my 2014 Toyota key fob. I'm so glad I did because there isn't much tolerance for a thicker battery. They work great and make replacing the battery a breeze.",
