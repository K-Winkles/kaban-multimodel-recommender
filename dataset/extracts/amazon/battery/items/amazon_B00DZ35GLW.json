I removed the old battery in my 2008 Suzuki Boulevard M50 and this battery was a direct fit with absolutely no trouble to install. I turned the key, and the bike fired right up. This battery was much cheaper than a lot of other options out there, but the cheaper only applies to the price, not the quality or performance. I am not a weekly rider, so my bike sits for weeks at a time without being touched, but I like knowing that with this battery, when I do go to start it, it will start.",

The price was very good compared to store prices. I think i paid around $70 for my last one in SAM'S and didn't last 6 months. I am only a weekend warrior so the bike has a battery tender connected everyday. I will buy another again hopefully not too soon.",
