It\u2019s better to use a carbon based battery for most clocks, or even simple ornaments like a lucky cat with a waving arm, than using alkaline batteries! The carbon based batteries give out a less powerful, longer lasting charge. Really interesting if you feel like researching. Great price and good to have on hand.",
