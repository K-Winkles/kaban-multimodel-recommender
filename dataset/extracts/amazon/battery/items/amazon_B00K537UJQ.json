                "reviewText": "I have purchased several batteries from this vendor with positive results. One time the battery was damaged during shipment (not the vendor's fault) and is was very impressed with the ease of getting the damaged battery replaced. This purchase I'm not happy with! Battery arrived timely and in good shape. It was nearly fully charged and all looked good.When I went to install the battery I found the little bolt that holds the batter cable on was too short to reach the silver block that needs to be placed at the bottom of the terminal. There was absolutely no way the battery cable could be attached with the supplied hardware. You need to find a slightly longer bolt or somehow raise the silver block up. The hardware should have either provided a thicker silver block or a longer bolt. This issue has been pointed out by a couple of other buyers but apparently ignored by the vendor. I had the silver blocks from my old battery that I placed on top of the blocks provided by the vendor and made it work. I did send a message to the vendor about the issue but so far no response.So I guess the old saying that it is far easier to lose a customer than to gain one is true. Since my previous purchases all went well I normally just go to this vendor when I need a battery for my toys. Since they have ignored my issue I will be looking at different vendor's in the future.",
