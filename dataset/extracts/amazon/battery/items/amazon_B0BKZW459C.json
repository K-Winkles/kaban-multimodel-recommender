                "reviewText": "They look exactly as pictured. Nicely package they look like a quality product. A much better deal then buying a name brand and they work just fine. I needed three of them to light up a Halloween Skull with blinking colored eyeball lights. It stayed lit for the entire party and I checked it just now and it still works. I was a bit worried because all I knew was that I needed A76 batteries. These things had all kinds of numbers and I was hoping I wasn't making a mistake. They also appear slightly larger, just eyeballing them. but they fit perfect and I think the ones I had were just cheap and maybe even a bit small. The problem with comparisons when what you're replacing is junk and the new stuff you bought is better and what you really need.",
