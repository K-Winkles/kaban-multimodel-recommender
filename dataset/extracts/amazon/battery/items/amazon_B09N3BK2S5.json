                "reviewText": "As a car ages there are electronic systems and circuits that start to develop small leakage currents.Often the cost to find and replace these leaking circuits that are fully operational - can cost more that the vehicle can be sold for.This switch turns of all these battery drains and when the car is in use the charging system generally is not impacted by these little current thieves.Important Note: On side mount lead acid batteries you have about a half inch of 3/8\" by 16 thread in the soft lead terminals.you will need to engage all the threads just as deep as the battery cable does so the threads do not get stripped out.My solution to get full bolt engagement and bottoming the bolt completely without putting the stress on the threads when tightening a bolt that may be a little too long or too short when fully tightened.I Bought a much longer (3/8\") by 16 thread (4\" or 5\")Bolt. Thread a nut on this bolt and then put on a lock washer leaving about 3\" of bolt thread to go through the unthreaded bolt hole of the cut off switch. Then finger tighten this bolt into the battery terminal making sure you have full thread engagement and a solid bottom stop.Now you can tighten the nut to fully compress the lock washer and know that the battery switch is secure.The cable position should have been established before the switch is fully tightened.I had to first remove the plastic battery cover to get the new battery switch to fit flat and mate correctly with the battery terminal ( I used the negative terminal as it was the most accessible).Good Luck.",
