                "reviewText": "I only buy Amazon Basics Batteries - they are comparable to the name brand in quality & length of life, but less expensive. I haven't bought a different brand in many years now. Definitely recommend trying them!I worked at a mom & pop camera shop as a teenager - we sold more of the lesser known brands of batteries than the name brand because they were pretty much the same quality & a fraction of the price. Lots of factories make multiple branded items that are pretty much the same, just different labels, so I usually give non-name brand items a try to compare. I initially tried Amazon Basics Batteries because of my experience at the camera store. They keep their charge well while in the package & while in use. I have had quite a few that were in use well after their labeled dates. I am just now starting to change out batteries I bought/installed in early 2020 & some are even older than that. With prices so high on everything nowadays, saving money is even more important than ever.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased on 09 SEP 2023; Received on 11 SEP 2023. Batteries' voltages tested on 11 SEP 2023.Each battery is marked with 03 2028, which I assume is the 'good through' date. The batteries are advertised by Amazon as having a 5-year shelf life, so I suppose I can complain the batteries I received only have a 4-and-a-half year shelf life. However, I am not really worried about it as I suspect I will have either used the batteries before then, or they will last beyond that date. We shall see. Because of the reduced shelf life, I reduced my review by one star. (If half star ratings were allowed, I would have rated them 4.5 stars.)Because others had complained the batteries they received were below a nominal 1.5 volts, I checked the voltage of each of the 24 D cell batteries I received immediately upon delivery. Obviously, each battery I received was above the nominal average for alkaline batteries.Of course, I cannot predict for how long the batteries will hold their charges, nor for how long each battery will last once I put them into service. However, I expect they will store long enough, and last long enough once I put them into service, so that I will not be disappointed with them.If I do experience significant issues with the batteries, I will update this review.For the price ($22.91), for 24 D cell batteries, I believe these batteries to be a very good deal. If they meet or exceed their storage life, and last decently long once put into service, I would be inclined say they are a potentially great deal.",

                "reviewText": "I use one or two flash lights as dusk approaches quite often just to double check things at the end of a day. People also have a habit of borrowing my backups for the same reason. I've taken no notes, but I'm pretty certain these are working out just as well as the name brands I've used, except for those two everyone knows of. But certainly not near the cost. Since much of the flashlight use is not overly efficient on jobs sites, these are working out very well considering their cost. I'll be getting more.",

Have I had lots of crappier, shorter lasting batteries, absolutely. Are there cheaper batteries out there, for sure, just as there are more expensive batteries. Do these arrive like clockwork without me having to think about them via Subscribe and Save, you betcha!Are these the best batteries ever? No, but they are close to the much pricier, ones. In the long run these are good value in my application, and I never have to worry about running out.",
