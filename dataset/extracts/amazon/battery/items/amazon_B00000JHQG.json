                "reviewText": "My automatic front door lock runs on battery which I'd forgotten bc I never lock the front door. Well, in early August I was leaving on assignment for 4 different jobs and as a friend was helping me load my gear into her van I was teaching her how to operate the lock with the code which I was certain I had not forgotten.What I had forgotten to do was to check the battery. It was dead. Dead dead. We had no time to look for a 9V Battery so, that was that. 2 wks later I had a chance to order this set and I popped home to replace the dead battery. The battery works fine. Realigning the inside mechanics was a royal pita. But it got done and now I have a functioning door lock and an extra battery.I wish it would operate my npw defunct Condensor which also died in August and ruined my furnace.",
