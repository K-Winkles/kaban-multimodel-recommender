                "media_text": "Customer Questions Are Allmax batteries rechargeable? Allmax batteries labeled \"Rechargeable\" can be recharged. Standard Allmax alkaline batteries CANNOT be recharged. DO NOT try and recharge standard alkaline batteries as this may lead to battery leakage or explosion. Standard alkaline batteries and specialized NiMH rechargeable batteries are NOT interchangeable. Only Allmax NiMH rechargeable batteries can be recharged. These batteries can be recharged up to 2,000 times with proper usage. Please properly identify batteries before trying to recharge. What is the capacity in mAh of the battery? The battery\u2019s mAh determines how long the battery will last, and performance varies based on the type of electronic device you use. When you use our batteries in a radio, for example, Allmax\u2019s AAA Alkaline batteries have a capacity of 1,370 mAh. This is good. Where can I find the expiration date? You can find the expiration date on the body of the battery or on the box. It is marked with a \"Best Before\" date. Our Allmax AAA Alkaline battery has a 10-year shelf life, meaning under proper storage conditions you can use it any time before this date. Will the battery fit in my device? They usually do. For example, the height of our AAA Alkaline batteries is 1.74 inches with an outer diameter of 0.40 inches. This conforms to IEC standards. So if the size of your battery compartment is designed to IEC standards, our batteries will fit. How are Allmax batteries packaged? There are 4 Allmax AAA Alkaline batteries tightly wrapped in plastic shrink packs, with 9 shrink packs per package that are well-packed in boxes that are easy to open, easy to stock, reclosable, and impact-resistant, so your batteries are always protected. Can I store batteries in the refrigerator? It is not a good idea to store batteries in the refrigerator. It is best to store batteries in a cool, dry place. We DO NOT recommend storing batteries in the fridge. This does not lengthen battery life. For safety reasons, please keep batteries away from children and from extreme temperatures, hot or cold. Do not freeze batteries, and do not expose batteries to fire. Extreme temperatures may cause batteries to explode or may lead to harmful outcomes. Are batteries affected by temperature? Extreme high or low temperature is not good for batteries. DO NOT use or store batteries at high or low temperature. Low temperature may cause battery discharge capacity to drop, while high temperature may lead to battery leakage. What should I pay attention to during use? Before using your batteries, please remove the film around the battery and check to see whether the anode and the cathode of the battery compartment look normal, without any dirt or rust. Also, do not mix old and new batteries or batteries of different types or brands together. How can I track the status of my order? If you have any questions or concerns about the delivery or status of your order, please contact Amazon through their website or by calling their toll-free number. Together we work to ensure your batteries are delivered on time and they are in perfect condition. What if I receive a broken or defective product? If your box or product is damaged in any way, please contact Amazon. Amazon is responsible for delivering our products, so they will take care of your order. If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach us through Amazon. Our information is easily accessible.",

                "reviewText": "These are awesome and some will say well they're just batteries doesn't matter what kind Not True. These last longer than the Duracell batteries we got from the store. I was shocked when the Duracell died out before these. I will give them their props these last long they're way better priced especially for the quality and none have exploded. Not sure if you know but for those of you who have a pre teen or teen in your house that swears sticking batteries in the freezer makes them last longer and \"revive\" These are your batteries! They're cheaper work longer better quality and don't explode, unless of course you decide to microwave them, Boys a house full of Boys \ud83d\ude14 prayer is needed and appreciated \ud83d\ude4f These and the AC ones are the only ones we get now.Save yourself your time and your money and part of your sanity and get these batteries (especially if you have kids that like to experiment with everything or try things they saw in videos\ud83d\ude14)",
