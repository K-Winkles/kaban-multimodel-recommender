So to the Zon we went, we found wireless cameras that worked with our Garmin GPS units.(Also found on the Zon). But standard alkaline batteries didn't last very long, especially in colder weather. So seen these, and installed in the wireless Garmin camera and they worked well. They definitely last longer than any premium alkaline battery on the market. Just based on the use for us, these batteries should double the life of many electronics that aren't used in freezing temps. Yes, we have purchased several times and will purchase again!",

They are pricey compared to alkaline batteries but luckily, I don't need to buy them as often. When it comes to longevity, in our doorbell camera, they only lasted 7 months. There is heavy use on that camera though so I can't blame the batteries for being overworked. Even still, when compared to another brand we tried, these lasted much longer so I will continue to buy them.",

Cold weather, particularly, drain alkalines to quickly.These lithium batteries are the best, longest lasting I have found. They are far better than the cheaper knock-offs, and last about a year in my applications. I'll keep paying the premium for the reduced need to change batteries.",

                "reviewText": "Blink recommends these batteries for use in their cameras. I have had my Blink cameras for over two years possibly three, armed and disarmed, but mostly disarmed and they have lasted that long. So, I just checked to see how long I've actually had these and I found on the shipping label, on the box, the date of 11/25/2018. YES!!! 2018!!! I just recently have kept them armed because my wife has been working from home and we have been getting a lot of solicitors. They interrupt her work, and she likes to be able to see if it is FedEx, UPS, USPS or just a random visitor. These batteries are worth their weight in gold.",

The 12 pack I got back in 2021 lasted 4 months. I heard the company was closing some plant and moving overseas, maybe that why the quality went down hill. 12-2048 on the battery must be the 25 years shelf life printed on the package, LOL (use life- is a roll of the dice)Up date 10-17-23 Energizer said they will send me a check within 21 days. Thank you Energizer. I did get the check.",
