                "reviewText": "I first ordered these batteries in May to help save money on my kids\u2019 battery needs. In particular, my oldest child still sleeps with his sound machine from childhood. Several years back, they discontinued the machine and the cord shorted out. The only option keeping us a float right now was (4) AA batteries. Of course, he would leave it on after waking up and so normal batteries would last for a couple of days at most.Like you are doing now, I started searching Amazon for rechargeable options. I found the Powerowl brand and was instantly turned on to all the positive reviews. Also, they were on sale! After purchasing, I found them very easy to use. A month or so later, I returned and bought more AA batteries (without the 2nd charger). We\u2019ve had zero issues with them until recently. I noticed that several of the batteries were discharging too quickly and when attempting to charge, were showing fully charged even though a multimeter confirmed they were not. I reached out to support and was THRILLED with their support. After explaining my situation to Whitney in their customer support area, she was super quick to respond back with a solution.Between the product quality and the fast, easy support, your next step should be to Buy Now and order enough for same day delivery. You will love how these batteries help your live become easier!Here\u2019s a couple of the examples of items I use these batteries in: kids toys, kids sound machine, portable work lights (headlamps, portable lanterns, etc.), front door lock, video game controllers, portable speakers, and much more!",

                "reviewText": "How can it be that these inexpensive batteries beat the best rechargeable batteries on the market? Well, they don't! 2800mAh is an exaggeration. My own test indicate that these batteries are more like 2000-2100mAh batteries. Meanwhile, the eneloop pro batteries are testing close to their rated capacity. I guess I kind of expected that so I'm not going to complain too much, but I am going to ding them a star for the deception.Even though they are only 70% of what they say they are, I still think they are a pretty good value for what you get...which is average performance at about 3/4 cost of the name brand batteries. Personally, I still use the eneloop batteries when it's mission critical. These cheaper POWEROWL batteries work fine for everyday things, and that's what I was looking for. As for longevity, it's too soon to say? In the end, you might not be coming out ahead by saving some money up front.I have encountered some devices where the battery compartment has tight tolerances. Powerowl batteries are a tiny bit bigger than standard alkaline batteries and they will not fit in these devices. I don't have this problem with other name brand rechargable batteries.",

                "reviewText": "It's been a year since I purchased these and they still hold a good charge. The only issue I found is they are slightly thicker than a standard AA battery and in some items they fit very snug so you have to be careful when installing/uninstalling them in your device that you don't damage the springs in the battery compartment. Another issue is when you install them into the charger half of them will blink red meaning there is an issue with them. Don't fret. Leave them in the charger for a few minutes then reseat them and the blinking red light will go solid and the battery will then charge. If you have a lot of battery-operated devices I highly recommend! 5 stars.",

Now it's been almost a full year and they've never been able to take a charge, so I've never gotten to use them.So, after writing this review, the company has gotten in touch with me and sent out a new package of batteries. Just put three of them into my smoke detector and they seem to work well when I test it. After that good of customer service I have to give them a good rating. Lets hope the rest of the batteries are fit to function and perhaps I just had a bad batch first time around.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good rechargeables. Not low self discharge. AA didn't fit some devices (too fat)",
                "reviewText": "These are good value for your money as long as you don't expect them to behave like Eneloops - but that wouldn't be fair since these are considerably cheaper than Eneloops. I bought a LOT of these - 36x AA, 8x AAA, 4x C, 4x D. I still have about ~40-ish combination of Eneloops and old Amazon rechargeables (when they were rebrands of Eneloops). So it's easy for me to compare these to quality batteries. I'm not sure if I would buy these Powerowl batteries again. Here are some issues that I've found: (BTW I have the Powerex-C808M charger which is one of the best and never gave me any issues)1. The AA are fatter than normal alkaline and Eneloops. So on some devices that Eneloops fit, these won't. So I can't use these on some pen lights, some of the kids laser gun toys that have battery bracket, etc.2. These do not hold their charge like the Eneloops. I'm sure they are better than the run of the mill batteries but they are not that much better. Many of these batteries are down to 70% within the first few weeks of storage.3. Some of the batteries took forever to charge while others charged at normal times. I feel like the quality is a bit inconsistent.",
