But they will work for everything else. That's why I took a star off. They work, but they don't serve the purpose that I purchased them for.

                "reviewText": "I've purchased other brands in the past and while yes they work... they don't work the same. I use these for everything from my photography gear to remote batteries. I've been annoyed by the other brand I bought because they seem to pulse the power. In my coffee whip (or anything with a motor) the other brand doesn't supply a constant flow of power, instead you can hear and see the motor pulsing fast. With these there is no pulsing. They supply a constant and even flow of power. They also seem to hold and supply a charge much longer. At roughly fifty cents more I definitely got more for my money. I'm buying a few more packs.",

                "reviewText": "Bought May 2023, charged and installed in my outdoor blink cameras in June. One outdoor camera is still working on the same battery charge, the second is triggered more often and I had to change the batteries last week. I went to charge the batteries using the supplied cord, the next morning the cabinet I charged items in was warm inside. The MAINS to USB charger itself was HOT (typical wall wart for charging), and the battery was HOT! I immediately unplugged and let cool down. Beware when you charge these. I tried to get assistance from the seller to see about a replacement, however Amazon did not allow me to get assistance for this product beyond boiler items, no returns available.",
