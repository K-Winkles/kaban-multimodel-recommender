                "reviewText": "I have been able to get these same batteries at a better price, but I have had to wait for a sale, and have a coupon, as well as have the time to drive to the store. This seller has these batteries in boxes of 4, which are inside of the larger box (all original manufacturing boxes) containing the entire amount. I liked this the most because when you buy the large clam boxes, it is bulky to store in a draw, and having the clam upsidedown with a small tear in the back to stick you hand makes it messy. You also have to lift the clam to see if the batteries are AA or AAA. One or two will roll out, and, when you get down to the last 4 or so, you have no idea, because the clear clam is facing down.This packaging was a happy surprise for me, and worth the extra couple of bucks. Not having to cut coupons and ride out to get these was nice as well.Update: 12.18.16: I Have a laptop with a wireless mouse. I have an Empi stim unit. Both of these typically have their required batteries rattling and rolling around in the case because I never want rmto not have my pain relief to run out of juice! Nor do I want to have to use a two finger scrolling method on a mousing pad on a laptop!These little boxes of four batteries each just made my tool's bags a whole lot better; no batteries falling out where I will later fall down by stepping on it.",

They have just arrived and I believe ; that even though the packaging style is old fashioned ; the battery technology is still all 100% energizer, even the packs and boxes the batteries comes in. I believe the batteries may come from another country , because of the 90's like packaging, but still very good. Companies may use older style of boxes and things for other countries outside of the USA ; even if it is the most current date. The dates people speak of on the cardboard tiny boxes... That is the day they are made. If the box has number date 2018 , and it's 2020 ? It is within the 5-10 year battery hold charge time. Cheaper made batteries will wear out just sitting in a drawer in a month, as dollar store batteries. Batteries as Duracell or Energizer holds their charge for a very long time ; years.",
