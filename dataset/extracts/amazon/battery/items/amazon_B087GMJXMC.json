In fact one of the leading brand batteries has a history of exploding/leaking in just about every case each time used. It's been found to be more cost effective when buying a device that comes with batteries and it isn't Energizer is to just not use the included and go straight to Energizer. It's nice to have this convenient pack that includes AAA and AA batteries. AAA aren't used as frequently as AA but they do get used. Usually a good deal on these comes around each time it's time to buy more. Even when a little overstocked the shelf life of these batteries have proven to be long lasting and no leakage to report. Obviously it's always recommended to remove batteries when a device is not used for long periods of time but in cases where that's happened, the compartment has been opened and no leakage! The other \"leading\" brand typically leaks during normal use. Have been using Energizer batteries for years and will continue as long as this experience holds up along with the quality of the battery.",
