Has jump starting functionality as well as built in flashlight/strobe/SOS light and port to charge other external devices. The carrying bag feels of high quality as well.",

                "reviewText": "I hate giving this unit 1 star but figure most people only read the best or the worst and so this review would be lost in the middle if I gave it 3 stars.Here's the deal: it's a great unit with lots of features, love the digital readout & flashlight, USB ports, the price is right, etc. And I expect it will work great in most situations. But it didn't work for me, and here's why...A battery usually won't start a car if it's below 8 or 9 volts so when you turn the key it goes click-click and nothing more. But understand: the battery isn't completely dead - it's probably still holding 2 or more volts. So you attach the jump-starter, it senses the battery, and provides the amps (\"CCA's\") necessary to start your car.But in some instances -- such as (a) you have an older car that doesn't automatically turn itself off if you leave the headlights on, or (b) you have a hidden electrical malfunction that \"tells\" one of your onboard computers to stay on rather than going to sleep as they're designed to do -- the constant draw brings your battery down to 0 amps. At that point, the jump-starter won't acknowlege that it's properly connected to a battery and therefore won't provide the CCAs. In that sitaution, you need to override the safety features in order to force it to work anyway... and this unit does NOT have an override feature.SO -- if you want to start a \"weak\" battery, this is a great unit. But if you've got a \"dead\" battery, this unit will refuse to cooperate.",
