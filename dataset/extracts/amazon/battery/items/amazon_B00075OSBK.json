One coated plate is positive and the other is negative. The unique manufacturing process of spiral winding continuous lead plates is far more precision-controlled and expensive than building traditional flat plate AGM batteries. Custom automated cell-winding machines are required to maintain the close tolerances required to maintain quality and performance. Critical tolerances, temperatures, humidity and automated processes are maintained and constantly monitored. OPTIMA has built over 100 million individual spiral cells since the early 1990\u2019s.",

RedTop For normal engine starting where an alternator immediately monitors the state of charge and provides energy to the battery whenever it is needed. This would describe most stock vehicles, including: automotive and RV underhood starting, heavy equipment where starting is the primary function, and diesel vehicles without aftermarket electronics. YellowTop Use this when electrical loads are higher than average, or when the discharge cycle is more than typical engine starting, such as vehicles with multiple electronic accessories and vehicles without alternators. This can also include vehicles with a lot of factory electronics such as power sliding doors and a DVD player. Examples also include: racing vehicles without a charging system, dedicated drag racers, diesel powered vehicles with aftermarket electronics, and vehicles with inverters, winches, or other accessories. BlueTop The BlueTop starting battery (dark gray case) is to be used when a dedicated starting battery is required and it should never be used for cycling duty. Use a BlueTop starting battery for marine applications and RVs when the battery's only function is engine starting. The dual purpose BlueTop (light gray case) can be used for both starting and deep cycling -- it is a true deep cycle battery with extremely high cranking power. Uses include: trolling motors, marine applications with heavy electrical accessories, and RVs.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a car and the previous owner had a cheap battery in it so I wanted to upgrade. I installed the Optima battery and went on a short run. Everything was fine until 2 weeks later when I tried to start the car. The battery was dead so dead it was difficult to get it to charge. Once charged it would go down quickly so maybe a bad cell, I tried contacting support but they never respond. The battery says 3 year free replacement but I can\u2019t get it replaced if I can\u2019t reach them. I got 2 of the batteries and one is still in the Amazon box so I could send it back or gamble that it\u2019s good and put it in the car and keep trying to return the other one. I have no faith in it since it was totally dead.",

Traditional lead-acid batteries can leak and could cause irreparable damage to the car. The previous owner was apparently clueless and had a cheap lead-acid. This red top AGM battery allows more protection. Went to Amazon because local auto supply shops did not have the needed size. Price was competitive and got a $10 gift card from an auto supply shop for bringing in the old battery.",

It's smaller than a regular battery. The base does fit well, but securing with standard long wingnut system might need to be altered a little as it's thinner. Overall, this smallest version of this product is definitely worth the $ and small adjustments as it has outperformed every battery I've ever used. Highly recommend",
