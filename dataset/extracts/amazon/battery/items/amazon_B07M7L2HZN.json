                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I thought I had done my research \u2014 matched OEM specifications, checked size and brand compatibility; however, I installed the new batteries, gave them a good charge (lights on charger indicated full), then began using my mobility scooter normally. The OEM batteries served me well for over 2 years in a variety environments, time between recharges were infrequent and the charge time was acceptable.These batteries discharge to the point of stranding me over the course of the day with normal, periodic use inside my home. Typically, I\u2019ll cover 400 to 600 feet across a day\u2019s use and these batteries are depleted to half or less charge. I even went back and unboxed the batteries I removed to make sure I hadn\u2019t done the impossible and reinstalled the old ones, which, quite frankly, I am considering reinstalling until I can get some quality batteries.Fortunately, I have 3 mobility scooters. One is very old, uses a larger battery at 24 volts and another lighter scooter that uses the newer technology, light weight sealed batteries. The frustration to me, other than the wasted money, is that the scooter with the failing replacement batteries experiences the lightest use, isn\u2019t used for travel and has the least amount of use in a controlled environment.I hope I happened to receive a bad pair of batteries from a low quality batch or something in them arrived defective. I never expect OEM performance from any batteries I use for my scooter, but I do expect the replacement batteries to exceed the performance of the 2 plus year-old batteries that are depleted. In this case careful research and comparison failed me.",
