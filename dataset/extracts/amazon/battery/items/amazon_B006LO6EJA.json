When I hooked a charger|maintainer up to it first, the green light on the charger stayed on, which indicates COMPLETELY CHARGED! WOW! It turned over the scooter's motor at warp speed, when I tried that next! I'm still amazed. What did they do, leave it connected to a battery charger in the warehouse until I ordered it!?But here's where it gets even MORE amazing! It's at a really nice price with free shipping, rigtht? Been there, done that, right? It's going to take them several days to even ship it, right? Then it's going to come FedEx super saver or some nonsense, where they hand it over to the Post Office and it takes forever, right? WRONG!! WRONG and WRONG! They shipped it while I wasn't looking, so I can't even tell you, but it was a matter of hours! They shipped it USPS two day priority <FOR FREE>! It got here (over 1000 miles) as fast as if I'd paid $23 (or more!) for 2nd day shipping!! I've never had this happen! I CANNOT say enough good things about Chrome Battery.Maybe Amazon could consider outsourcing their warehouse and shipping department to these people!?There are no words for how completely satisfied I am with everything about this purchase. I only wish it was something like a Porsche instead of just a battery...",

The electric starter was becoming very weak, and I suspected that maybe the old battery was A: weak, or B: not charging properly.Replacing the old battery with this one showed the same symptoms, so I knew the old battery was fine, and as a bonus, I now have a spare battery.Very well worth the $23 spent on this.Turns out that my starter was the problem.",

This was so small it was delivered in a Amazon bubble pack. This battery was what I might describe as an exit sign battery. This would not fit my quad, and as soon as I opened the bubble pack, I realized what it was and immediately went to return it only to find that this seller has a No Return Policy. Unable to determine if it was easily installed nor if it has longevity. Wish I could have been more help.Update: 7/20/2023 the battery no longer holds enough charge to turn over a 300cc generator engine.",
