Then we began to only buy Energizer batteries.This twelve pack of Energizer C batteries' box had one flap on a side opening sliced off from its connection to the box itself. This caused the end to not close properly. (Possibly this is the reason there was an outer layer of plastic wrap that enclosed the box.) Even though the flap was damaged, the box is sturdy. I closed the end of the box with sealing tape. Best of all, the batteries are in perfect condition. We bought these 12/27/2023; and they expire December 2033.",
