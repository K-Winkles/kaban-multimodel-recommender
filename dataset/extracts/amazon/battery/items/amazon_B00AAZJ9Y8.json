The first component of the battery is the ABS plastic shell. We then insert our very own lead plates and glass mat separators into the shell before filling with acid. The batteries are then capped, sealed, and charged to complete the process. Step 2 - Assess for Quality The next step in the process is that of quality control. We don't make great products by accident. Our inventory is carefully controlled by strict quality assessments that must be met before qualifying for shipment. Our products undergo voltage tests, weight measurement, and psychology tests to make sure they are physically and mentally sound. Step 3 - Pack with Care We've all gotten that package delivered in the mail that was clearly marked as \"fragile\" but looked like it was used as a football by the delivery man. That's why all of our items are packaged with the customer in mind Step 4 - Deliver On Time, Every Time Your order is not completed until the item is in your hands. After all, what good is a great product if it doesn't get to you in time? When your alarm is screeching \"Fix Me, Fix Me!\", you can trust that you won't have to wait an eternity for your battery to arrive.",

They look identical to the original installed batteries. Should extend the life of the UPS for another 5 years-ish. Better that throwing out a still otherwise fully functional UPS power supply. Very easy to install.",

They cannot be returned due to hazmat issues. They also refer you to the manufacturer, not the seller, to try to get support.UPDATE:I decided to reach out to Amazon Customer Service. They were able to help resolve the defective batteries for me. Thank you Amazon for you understanding and help.",
