Whenever he is having a really bad day he likes to get in the swing and just chill. These batteries last a long time and I find that I am only having to change them once a week. I will be purchasing more for all our flashlights in the house since we have tornadoes here in Oklahoma. Eventually I plan on having the whole set!",
