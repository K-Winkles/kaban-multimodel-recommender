                "reviewText": "I have a CyberPower 1500VAC Battery Backup that began throwing the E02 error. This error is indicative of the current batteries not holding the appropriate voltage.Upon investigating, these batteries appeared to be direct replacement and so I went for it.These arrived exactly as advertized and were, in fact, exact replacements for the ones I removed from my CyberPower. I tested the voltage of each prior to installation and they were both showing about 14v.Knowing the voltage was good, I quickly got them installed and powered up the device. The batteries arrived with an approximate state of charge around 90%. I have been running these for just over a week without any issues.This was a very simple and straightforward fix with a quality replacement at a fair price.I have chosen to rate this product 5 stars. It has met my expectations for the price and I would completely recommend. Although I haven't had them for very long, I have monitoried them every day and they are holding the charge as expected. Due to my immediate need for the replacement batteries, I didn't spend much time reading previous reviews, but these are definitely worth reviewing. They were exactly what I was looking for and working exactly as advertised.Criteria for Stars:1 - Total rip off, doesn't perform basic advertised functions or not product advertised. I would likely RETURN and would NEVER recommend.2 - Not worth the money. Performs some of the basic advertised functions, but likely not all, and ultimately was deemed as not providing enough value for the money spent. I would not buy again, and would likely not recommend unless the buyer had a very specific use case.3 - It performs the basic functions as advertised, and has some usefulness at the price point, but doesn't work for all of the reasons I purchased. I would likely not buy again, and would only recommend if buyer understood usefulness limitations.4 - It performs most all of the features I purchased it for, but has limitations. I would likely buy again and would recommend.5 - Completely as advertised and likely exceeded expectations. Is if high quality and well shipped. I would totally buy again and recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good \"form and fit\" replacement for the OEM batteries inside the CyberPower LX1500GU model of UPS. I'm very pleased with this purchase. And buying the batteries was MUCH cheaper than buying a whole new UPS unit.Details ...A couple of months ago -- following two brief power outages during the day -- I realized that my CyberPower UPS wasn't immediately supplying power to the connected hardware, even though the display was showing that the battery capacity was 100%. After some troubleshooting (which included me simply unplugging the UPS from the wall outlet), it was easy to see that the batteries were no good. As I was doing a search to find another UPS, I learned that the batteries are replaceable (maybe the original user's manual mentioned that ... but it's been ~3 yrs since I bought the unit). Anyway ...I did a search on eBay and Amazon, and found these batteries. On YouTube there were several helpful videos showing exactly how to remove and replace the batteries -- extremely easy process that only required a Philips head screwdriver and 5 minutes of effort.Bottom Line Results ...After replacing the batteries, I charged up the unit overnight. The next day I performed a quick test by unplugging the UPS from the outlet. Success! There was no loss of power to the plugged in devices, and the UPS periodically \"beeped\" (as expected) while it was running on battery power. Plugging the unit back into the wall socket stopped the \"beeping.\" Everything worked as expected.",

After taking out the old batteries these ExpertPower 12v 9ah Sealed Lead Acid Battery with F2 Terminals installed without problem other than one of the connectors on a wire needed to be replaced, which was not the fault of the battery. This is the second time that I have replaced batteries in this UPS. I find that these replacement batteries work well and have very satisfactory life. Their size is a perfect fit and the F2 terminals are what is needed for the connectors. When used in a Cyberpower 1500VA UPS it makes sense to look up how to remove the cover, it is very easy to do as soon as it is clear how the cover slides off.",

                "reviewText": "My Cyberpower 1500PFCLCD had been great, but eventually the UPS and AVR functionality died. I think the SLAs that came with the UPS lasted about 3 years. I have no idea if CyberPower has an OEM battery option, but batteries are batteries, so there's no reason to pay OEM prices.Though they took a couple weeks to arrive, the ExpertPower 12v 9ah Sealed Lead Acid Battery with F2 Terminals (.250\")/2 Pack showed up at my doorstep undamaged and intact. The packaging wasn't extremely protective, but SLAs aren't exactly delicate, either. The 1500PFCLCD comes apart with two small screws. The faceplate slides off, revealing a wire harness and the battery pack. Once you disconnect the wire harness, you can slide out the pack. The \"pack\" just consists of two batteries with a plastic tray in-between them. The plate has wires that put the pack into series, so it's just a matter of sliding 4 spade connectors onto the F2 battery terminals. You can tape the pack together, but it's not necessary if you hold it together when you slide it back into the UPS. Once you've done that, you just re-attach the wire harness.Really, that's it. My batteries arrived about 90% charged. Nice. I plugged everything in, got everything started, and yanked power. No issues with the UPS at ~85% load. Estimated runtime was close to what I'd calculated for 216 Wh, so the batteries look like they are the right spec. At about $40, the price is good... the only gripe was that the shipping, while advertised as Prime with ~ 1 week delivery, was about double that. Recommended",
