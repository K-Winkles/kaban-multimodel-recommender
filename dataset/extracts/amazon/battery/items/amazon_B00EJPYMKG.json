                "reviewText": "This fit perfectly on my 2001 Harley Wide glide. Im unsure of the other reviews with fitment issues but this was the exact same size as my \u201cpremium brand\u201d 20HL group sized battery. Packaging was good. Came with all new needed hardware and spacers. Did not test cold cranking amps as other users have, but it started my bike out of the box in no time as any new battery should. Terminals are kinda flimsy, as obviously posted in the ad photos, but that doesn't effect functionality, just don\u2019t crazily over tighten them, and you shouldn\u2019t have issues. What do you expect for the price.Have rode a few miles on this so far with no issues.Longevity and internal durability is the only undetermined point of this battery. Im hoping to get a few seasons out of it. I have bought value batteries in the past that have lasted just as long as the \u201cpremium\u201d ones. Will update review if failed prematurely.",
