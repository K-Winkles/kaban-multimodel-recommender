                "reviewText": "I used to buy my batteries from Costco, Walmart or Batteries Plus. This model of battery cost me between $2.50 and $3.50 each, depending where I could find them. They weren't always available where I usually shop.I decided to check Amazon for these batteries since Amazon had almost everything else and, low and behold, here they were. Not only were they available, but I could buy a dozen batteries for less than $1.60 each. I couldn't even find these batteries at Costco on my last visit (sometimes they have them, sometimes they don't) Batteries Plus sells this exact same battery, 12 ea., for $26.99 and Walmart sell these same batteries for $33.83. Amazon sell these for $18.66 and, if you're an Amazon Prime member, shipping is FREE!I use these batteries to power two different handgun laser sites and five different flashlights which are mounted to five different weapons, from pistols, to rigles and shotguns.This is just some of the equipment that I and my fellow officers use during our duty day. If the batteries that power our various pieces of electronic equipment are unreliable it could someone to be injured or killed. That being said, I have the upmost confidence in these batteries.These batteries work fine and have lasted a bit longer than the \"popular, name brand\" batteries. Because of the lower price of these batteries, when compared to what other stores offer, I can order a bunch and keep enough extras on-hand at work to not only replace my batteries as necessary, but to also provide batteries for my fellow officers in the event that their batteries wear out.Bottom line, these batteries work as well and a bit better than the \"name brand\" batteries, they cost a lot less and they seem to \"always\" be available through Amazon, unlike the other stores where I've bought these batteries where it's hit or miss that they'll be in stock. My life and the lives of my fellow officers and civilians depend on these batteries working properly to power our equipment. I would not recommend these batteries to anyone if I didn't rely on these batteries myself.Considering the dependability, superior value, equivelent battery life and ready availability, I'll be buying these and other batteries from Amazon from now on. An additional bonus is that I won't have to drive into town for batteries anymore, saving me a bunch of money in gas.So.....if anyone can find a better battery at a better price let me know. I have a feeling that I won't be hearing from anyone any time soon.",

Sometimes I need a good bright light to look inside of the molds for any residue, scratches,etc. My flashlight takes 2 of these type batteries and they work great. I get a solid steady bright stream and long life from each use. Definitely a must have if you own a flashlight that takes 5his type battery.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Canon Eos Rebel 35mm camera that I've owned for about 20 years. Since the advent of cell phones with ever better cameras and editing software, my poor Canon fell by the wayside for quite some time. I recently recovered iit, cleaned it up and ordered fresh batteries. These batteries used to be very expensive, around $6 to $14 apiece. Now you can find them for a pittance. I also have a Nikon M-10 manual camera, which uses 2 of those little LR44 button batteries,which operate the viewfinder light meter. I use the Nikon for extended night pics of the Milky-way, and for experimental infra red photography. The Canon takes really great portrait photos. \ud83d\ude0e",
