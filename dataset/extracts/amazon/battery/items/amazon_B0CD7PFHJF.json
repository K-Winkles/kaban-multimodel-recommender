These 4awg 2' cables are decently heavy but VERY flexible, I know it will be very easy to 'train' them into shape from car battery to fuse panel. Not sure about actual cable material or thickness as I will not do destructive testing, but the quality is great. Ends are neatly heat shrunk exposing only the end of the lug as seen in pics. Will definitely trust them for any more quality cables. Stated length: 24\" Actual total length lug tip to lug tip: 25.25\", wire itself not including lugs length: 22.25\", total length between center hole of lug to center hole of lug: 24.6\". Which is perfectly fine. Good automotive cables.",

                "reviewText": "This cable is excellent, with the exception of no certification besides RoHS. RoHS compliance is a European directive, which restricts the use of hazardous substances used to make products. So while it is good to know this is a cable that won't send me to an early grave due to what it is made out of, there is nothing certifying its compliance to electrical standards.I don't mind that it is not certified, but I can't rate it five stars, as that would insinuate nothing can be improved upon, or it is 100% complete. So if you don't need UL-certified, inspection-ready cables, these are great cables. They are very flexible, yet they are heavy-duty in feel. The ends are properly tinned and the heat-shrink is glued and tight to the cable. It's a great cable.4/5--if it were UL certified, it would be 5 stars. Thanks!",
