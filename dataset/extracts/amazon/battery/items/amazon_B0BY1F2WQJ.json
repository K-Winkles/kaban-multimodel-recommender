I changed out the terminals on my Mazda 6 and the positive post fit perfectly but the negative was just a tiny bit too large. The material and connection were solid but I could slip the terminal off of the negative post very easily without any loosening. My car still started but I wasn't comfortable with that looseness. Luckily I was able to repurpose one of the included bolts so it still came in handy. Overall the product is solid but I'm just dumb sometimes!",
