My family bought these for specific items. We use them for game controllers, Leap Pads, remotes and a few other items that can be used for a limited amount of time then need recharging for continued use. Here was our logic. You buy a tablet. It needs to be recharged every other day or two. So we applied the same logic to those wireless items that would most likely need to be recharged on a regular basis. The best example are XBox wireless controllers. They take AAs. We pop these in them, and play for days. Then when the controllers run low, we have another fresh set in the charger ready to go. We do a quick swap out and the gaming doesn\u2019t stop. That may not be the best solution for you but it\u2019s great for our gaming needs. Would recommend these for those items that are used frequently. We\u2019ve been using these for several years now, and just bought some fresh ones as the older ones are starting to show signs of age. It\u2019s nothing serious, but the older ones are not charging as well as they used to. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "As a professional reviewer, I've had the opportunity to put the Amazon Basics 16-Pack Rechargeable AA NiMH High-Capacity Batteries (2400 mAh) through their paces. My findings are based on rigorous testing and comparison with other brands in the market.Upon unboxing, my initial impression was that these batteries are strikingly similar to the Sanyo eneloop XX batteries, both in appearance and specifications. This led me to believe that they might be rebranded versions of the same. To confirm my suspicion, I embarked on a series of tests using my La Crosse BC1000 Battery Charger/Analyzer.Here's what I found:Pros:+ High Capacity: The batteries delivered an average capacity of 2555mAh after a few recharge/discharge cycles, exceeding the rated 2400mAh. This is a testament to their high-quality performance.+ Quality Control: The tight spread between 2510 and 2610mAh across the batteries indicates excellent quality control.+ Value for Money: At the time of writing, an 8-pack of Amazon High-Capacity AA batteries costs less than a 4-pack of eneloop XX batteries, making them a great bargain.+ Long-Term Performance: After 5 months in storage, the batteries retained 85% of their original capacity, outperforming the Sanyo XX batteries in my previous tests.Cons:- Size: These batteries are slightly fatter than typical AA batteries, which might cause fitting issues in devices with extremely tight battery compartments.- Lifespan: While they perform excellently in the short term, these batteries seem to lose their ability to hold charge after a few years. If you're a heavy user, be prepared to replace them after 2-3 years.- Country of Origin: Some users have reported a drop in quality in batteries made in China compared to those made in Japan.In conclusion, the Amazon Basics 16-Pack Rechargeable AA NiMH High-Capacity Batteries (2400 mAh) offer excellent performance and value for money. However, their slightly larger size and shorter lifespan compared to other brands might be a deal-breaker for some users.Remember, the best battery for you depends on your specific needs and the devices you intend to use them in. Always consider these factors when making your purchase decision.",

                "reviewText": "I am so glad to have these. I have lots of battery operated candles in timers in my house and feel I\u2019m always buying batteries which have gotten to be crazy expensive. I had some rechargeable ones years ago that I recall being very pricey so didn\u2019t look into getting more. Husband bought these for me and they are working great so far. Regular batteries usually last 3-4 weeks in the candles so will update when they lose charge. We are at 2 weeks now and candles are as bright as day 1. Charger has good indicator lights showing when all batts fully charged. Charges 8 at a time and is pretty quick. Worth the money and relieved to know we\u2019ll always have batteries ready to go even in power outage.",

                "reviewText": "These batteries have a deep reserve and last good while between charges. However my biggest gripe is their size, as there are several devices where the battery fit is way too tight. They won't even fit in a some AA powered Christmas ornaments. Also when charging they seem to get too hot to the touch. I have to use a slow charger like a powerowl as using a Panasonic model BQ-CC55 they get way too hot. 4 stars is a little generous but they do work well. I think Amazon basics might want to go back to the drawing boards on these batteries.",

                "reviewText": "I use a lot of battery operated LED lights throughout my house. Very difficult to run AC through the walls. (Cost). I've had rechargeable batteries for years and they have come in handy when power goes out. I have lights also in my closets. I haven't had to change them out in about 6 months. These rechargeable batteries do very well in your game controllers as well. I use these in my FLIR for work and they perform great. Also use them in my multimeters with no problems. All my remotes have either AAA, or double AA batteries. It's been years since I have bought a alkaline battery.It's very economical to use rechargeable batteries! I keep at least 45 AA's charged at all times. Rechargeables perform very well under load, and stored. It does advertise that they come charged, but they are not 100% charged. There is a reason why they do come with a charge!? If they had no charge, you could not recharge them, because your battery charger would not recognize them. You would just get a blinking light. You would have to jump start each one... (Check out YouTube for rebooting your dead batterys) do not throw them away, they still have life. The only negative thing I have to say about these rechargeable batteries that save's you money is... The climate crises zealots \ud83d\udc63... These people need to grow up! It's really a political statement. I just want to buy, or say something without it being politicized!? I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries. It is Earth friendlier, as well as cost-effective. We really don't need a stamp of approval to think that way... Do we?",
