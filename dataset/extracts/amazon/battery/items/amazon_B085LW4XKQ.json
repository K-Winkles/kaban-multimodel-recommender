The reason for the three stars here is because it is way too soon to rate that aspect of them as I have only had them for a few weeks. Hopefully the shelf life is also good because I often suspect that many manufacturers date them way too much into the future but being Duracell gives me good confidence in this area.",

I don't use it often but when it's needed it works. My flashlight was in my old duty bag for over 5 years with its old batteries and it still worked so I ordered more and that is these ones. Great for when you need long shelf life but still need the juice you get it. Only downside is the price but I got 3 sets of replacements with this package I'm set for a few more years like maybe 10 plus :)",
