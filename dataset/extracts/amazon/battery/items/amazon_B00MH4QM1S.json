                "reviewText": "These are great batteries and last as long as any of the competitors. I see numerous complaints about them being individually wrapped and it's astonishing. Being that both contacts are on the same side of the 9v battery, it's easy to accidentally discharge/drain them if not careful while storing them - if they end up where both contacts are resting against any conductive material (including themselves), they will drain to completion, possibly causing a mess or even a fire. They are shrink-wrapped to protect them from this!! If you buy commerically-packaged 9v batteries, they often come with a plastic piece that stays in place across the contacts...but they are much more expensive. This achieves the same result for much cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "Ne avevo gi\u00e0 acquistato un pacco un paio di anni fa e mi sono servite per la bilancia del bagno, i walkie talkie, il mio tester di rete e diversi giochi per bambini. Mi sono trovato benissimo e le ho riordinate perch\u00e9 in quanto sono affidabili ed economiche.Ho apprezzato molto che ogni batteria \u00e8 confezionata singolarmente, essendo avvolte da una pellicola di plastica si evita che contatti tocchino accidentalmente i possibili conduttori nelle vicinanze e si scarichino nel tempo anche se non utilizzate, situazione classica in cui si conservano tante batterie in un cassetto, essendo rivestite di metallo questo accade anche se si dovessero toccare tra di loro. In pi\u00f9 la confezione di cartone le tiene ordinate e non occupa molto spazio.Sono durevoli come le Duracel, francamente io non ho notato alcuna differenza importante tra queste e le famosissime e costose gi\u00e0 citate. Forniscono un\u2019alimentazione senza cali di prestazioni anche quando sono gi\u00e0 in utilizzo da molto tempo.La tecnologia Amazon Basics dichiara di prevenire le perdite di energia ed assicura una durata di 5 anni, garantendo una maggiore sicurezza per i dispositivi. Ho apprezzato molto questa sottolineatura, dal momento che l'ultima cosa che mi aspetto \u00e8 proprio che un dispositivo venga danneggiato da una fuoriuscita di liquido della batteria. Come dicevo non \u00e8 mai accaduto finora nonostante le utilizzi gi\u00e0 da un paio di anni.In conclusione, le batterie Amazon Basics sono un prodotto valido, garantiscono sicurezza e buona durata ad un prezzo molto accessibile.",
