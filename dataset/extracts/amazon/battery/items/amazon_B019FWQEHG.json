                "reviewText": "These batteries are the worst that I've ever experienced. Over the past 3-4 years, I have purchased several AA & AAA packages. Every single pack had leaking issues that caused extensive cleaning of the battery compartments in my electronics. I contacted the company and they sent me a $20 voucher. After continuous issues and from multiple lots, I ended up throwing the voucher away. My electronics deserve much better. Rayovac and Energizer are the same company so purchase at your own risk. I'm using Duracell now with none of the leaking issues that these displayed.",

No mention if they are getting more in. The bizarre thing is that with the AAA version of this offering they are in stock and \"more are on the way\" was the message last time inventory was low. Last time I checked, the AA version of this product offering is NOT discontinued. It is obviously a wildly popular item, therefore, my message to Amazon.ca is to PLEASE BRING IN MORE INVETORY so we can make purchases!!!",
