Being that it's in the rear of the car, installation was more difficult, but that's not a battery issue. Came fully charged at 12.87V and was manufactured the previous month. After pulse charging for a day and installation it tested at well above the rate 660 CCA (about 720 as I recall). The previous battery lasted for 8 years and still started the car fine, but the RC was probably lacking and that's important in electric vehicles as the AC is electric and not engine driven.",
