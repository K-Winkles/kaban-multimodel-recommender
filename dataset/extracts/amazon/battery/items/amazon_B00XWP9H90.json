The batteries all came intact and i got the write number of each one. The price on Amazon for these batteries is cheaper than purchasing in store, though Costco may still be a bit cheaper haha.",

                "reviewText": "Brands tested against: Duracell, Energizer (industrial and commercial/consumer types)As an electronics systems designer I work with battery powered industrial electronics extensively. Longevity and performance is critical in these applications.To test batteries they are subject to being tested on a piece of equipment called a programmable load tester. This piece of equipment is programmed so it provides a much more rigorous set of conditions than a remote control or a battery. For example, one key test that is performed is \"internal resistance\". This test indicates how readily current can flow from the battery on demand. Rayovac batteries performed better than all other brands tested. The other test is called \"constant current\". This tests the life of the battery when a specific fixed current is drawn from the battery. The longer it lasts the better the battery is. Again, Rayovac beat the other brands by a wide margin.This feedback supports others on this product page that say the same thing. Exceptional batteries for the price. Its what I specify in designed products, home and personal use.",
