That camera still showing 100%. I put 12 batteries in my other trail camera and after 2 weeks they are dead. Was trying Lithium for cold winter weather but it wasn't worth my investment. Sorry.",

I know lithium is currently in high demand but the energizer brand is just not affordable anymore. These Bevigor brand offer a better price and last almost as long. More importantly, they offer the power that you need to run your electronic devices for more than a few hours. They also make an ultra version which is more expensive but still less than the other brand. The Bevigor ultra actually are more powerful and therefore last longer too. Bottom line , they provide the same power and usage time as the big brand name lithium batteries.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a pack of the AA and also the AAA. I assume they are basically the same product with the same standards.I had the AAA version of the same brand from my first box fail prematurely while inside my Sig Romeo5 XDR Rifle Optic. The rifle was never fired with the new battery inside, it just sat in the safe. Luckily the optic seems fine. At least it didn't leave acid everywhere like Alkalines normally do when they fail.However, there might still be a place for these. I've tested the AA versions longevity directly against Energizer and Bevigor lasted very slightly longer on average (of only 3 samples) when used to power a fan continuously until they die (in about 6-7 hours). That's a long of bang for the buck for power output as far as AA's go.I suspect the failure has something to do with low power usage over a long period of time, as I've read multiple complaints about the longevity of this brand when used in trail cameras (which use constant, low power to run a motion sensor), and the first time I put one of mine into a device that runs constantly (but at low power), mine fails prematurely.I have other AA and AAA devices that I think are a lot less likely to induce the problem, and it might be worth buying Bevigor for those.",

I don't know what kind of magic sauce they put in these batteries, but we put the first two in over a month ago and still haven't had to change the batteries. These things are bussin'! And our Blink gets used constantly by people coming in and out of the biz.",

I'm not rating the longevity as I've only used them for about three weeks. I'll know better in about three months -- that is the only reason I rated them 4 starts. Also the box was opened, and my battery tester doesn't work on lithium batteries -- so I don't know the state of all the batteries.",
