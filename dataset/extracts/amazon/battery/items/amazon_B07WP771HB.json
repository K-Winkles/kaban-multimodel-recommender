It has kept making these beeping noise and sometimes I couldn't get a dial tone on my landline . Finally the battery has died and I finally found the same exact battery here on Amazon. It was delivered tonight so I was able to install it with ease. I pressed the reset button after it was installed. Lo and behold I got a dial tone. So far the new battery works. What I do not like about the battery is the price and I have to find a facility in my area that accepts used batteries .",

This battery replaced my tired FIOS battery. It can be a pain to get these out of the black plastic FIOS battery box if the box is mounted on the wall and blocked by stuff in storage, but overall, it's an easy job and takes only a few minutes. Unfortunately, these batteries last only about 2 years. They're supposed to be rechargeable, but the positive and negative poles are not actual poles; they're little metal tabs that won't work with typical automotive battery charger spring clamps. Battery tender clamps may fit.",
