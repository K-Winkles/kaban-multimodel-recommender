                "reviewText": "As a tech enthusiast and a frequent user of various battery-powered devices, I've had the opportunity to test the Amazon Basics 16-Pack Rechargeable AAA NiMH High-Capacity Batteries (850 mAh). Here's my detailed review, based on my personal experience and observations.Pros:+ Wide Compatibility: These batteries are compatible with a broad range of devices, from high to low drain, making them versatile for different uses around the house.+ Pre-Charged Convenience: The batteries arrive pre-charged, ready for immediate use. This feature is incredibly convenient, eliminating the need for initial charging.+ Rechargeable and Eco-Friendly: With the ability to be recharged up to 500 times with minimal power loss, these batteries are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.+ Low Self-Discharge Rate: The batteries maintain 80% capacity for up to 24 months, allowing for long-term storage without significant power loss.+ Frustration-Free Packaging: The packaging is easy to open and access the batteries without any hassle or excessive waste.Cons:- Inconsistent Lifespan: Some users have reported that the batteries' lifespan falls short of expectations. The batteries seem to provide fewer recharge cycles than claimed, with some users noting a significant decline in performance after about 120 cycles.- Variable Pre-Charge Levels: Although the batteries are supposed to come pre-charged, some users have reported that they needed to charge them for several hours before reaching full capacity.- Potential Fit Issues: The positive end of these batteries is slightly smaller than standard batteries, which may cause fit issues in some devices.- Voltage Limitations: These batteries have a voltage of 1.2V, which may not be compatible with all devices. Some devices may inaccurately indicate that the battery is low or half-charged, even when it's fully charged.- Inconsistent Performance: Some users have reported a decline in performance over time, with batteries needing to be swapped out more frequently after a few months of use.- Leakage Issues: A few users have reported leakage issues, with batteries discharging a white powdery substance when stored for extended periods.In conclusion, the Amazon Basics 16-Pack Rechargeable AAA NiMH High-Capacity Batteries (850 mAh) offer a mix of convenience and performance, with a few potential drawbacks. They're a solid choice for those seeking an environmentally friendly, cost-effective solution for powering their devices. However, users should be aware of the potential for inconsistent performance and lifespan, and ensure they're suitable for their specific devices and usage patterns.",

I keep charging these and it turned green to tell me that it\u2019s charged and then as soon as I put them in my lamp after a couple hours they\u2019re dead gonna have to charge them again so these batteries so far as I can see, does not hold a charge for long. I do not recommend these batteries. I have charge them overnight and I\u2019ve charged them during the day and no matter what I do they do not hold a charge.",

These batteries are compatible with a wide range of devices, whether high or low drain.The fact that they come pre-charged and ready to use is incredibly convenient. We can start using them right away without the need for initial charging. Plus, they can be recharged up to 500 times with minimal power loss, which is not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.One standout feature is the low self-discharge rate. These batteries maintain 80% capacity for up to 24 months, so we can store them without worrying about significant power loss. It's reassuring to know that they'll be ready to use whenever we need them.The packaging is also worth mentioning. It comes in Certified Frustration-Free Packaging, making it easy to open and access the batteries without any hassle or excessive waste.Although the appearance of the batteries may vary, the performance and quality remain consistent. We have been using them all over the house and even in our kids' remote-controlled car, and they have proven to be reliable and long-lasting.Overall, I highly recommend these rechargeable batteries. They offer high capacity, easy use, and long-term storage convenience. They are a fantastic investment that not only saves money but also reduces waste.
