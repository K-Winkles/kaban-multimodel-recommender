Then you can't find the one you swore you had in a drawer somewhere.These have a 5 year storage life, so if you don't need them for years, even past 5, they'll still probably come through for you. They're more reliable than most of the offshore brands and cheaper than those copper top guys.If you want to know how frequently I actually need them, I had to buy these so I could replace ONE in a door frame mounted garage door keypad we use all the time. It still had the original 9 volt it came with 20 years ago.I'm sure I needed one more recently, but I can't remember when. Usually in some ancient appliance I've been babying along.I'm gonna tape the remaining one to my front door. I figure it'll reduce the odds of me remembering where I put it in 7 years when I need one again.",
