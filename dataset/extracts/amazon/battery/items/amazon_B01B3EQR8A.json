                "reviewText": "These little powerhouses have exceeded my expectations in every way.First off, the packaging caught my eye with its sleek black, gold, and blue design. It gave me the impression of a premium product, and I wasn't disappointed. Upon opening the package, I found two compact batteries, each measuring 0.67\" in diameter and 1.36\" in height. They were perfectly sized for my needs.I inserted these batteries into my high-end digital camera, and the results were outstanding. Not only did they provide a consistent and reliable source of power, but they also seemed to last longer than the previous batteries I had used. This was a game-changer for my photography sessions, allowing me to capture more stunning shots without worrying about frequent battery changes.One thing I particularly appreciated about these Panasonic batteries was their stability. Whether I was shooting in cold or hot weather, these batteries performed consistently, without any drop in power output. It's clear that Panasonic has invested in quality and durability.Overall, the Panasonic BAT002 x 2 CR123A Lithium 3V Photo Lithium Batteries have become an essential part of my photography gear. They have proven to be reliable, long-lasting, and of excellent quality. I highly recommend them to any fellow photographers or anyone in need of reliable power for their electronic devices. These batteries have certainly earned my trust and admiration.",

Well they don't. I looked everywhere for a size CR123A battery from a known name brand because I didn't want to have to replace the battery often like you do for generic batteries. They battery was replaced a month ago and is working perfectly fine but I can't speak to longevity yet. Panasonic batteries are normally long lived so I don't expect a problem. I will update the review if I have a problem with the batteries not lasting. If you are looking for a CR123A this battery is a good price and will fit.",
