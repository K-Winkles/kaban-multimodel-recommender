Unfortunately, these batteries do not last long enough (maybe due to heavy usage in our door system). Frustrating, I opted for these lithium batteries to try on. It was costlier than Alkaline ones - no doubt. But, four months have passed, batteries are running strong till today. It is surely four times more durable over normal AAs. I am sure it would run for a few more months, too. And in comparison, cost wise, it is better too.I will go for these lithium batteries of this make, once again when needed.",
