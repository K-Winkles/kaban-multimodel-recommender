Plus with 100 at such a low price I still came out on top; Toys, remote controllers, Xbox controllers, new and old tech. I was able to power all of them up and still have enough to share with my neighbors. Over all a good buy for the price.",

I use to buy Duracell batteries at Costco but these are a much better value. They are the least expensive batteries I have been able to find and they last just as long as the other name brand batteries. They say you can store them for up to 15 years and I don\u2019t mind buying them in bulk. I always seem to use more batteries than I think I will and I like to have extras on hand. They come is sturdy boxes with the battery size printed on them so they are easy to store.",

I've used other brands in the past, but these for the price they were at the time, were a very good deal, and so far they are performing well. They also come in a very nice plastic container that keeps them stored nicely and can easily be seen what you need without having to open a box to find the right batteries.",
