Faster Charge Acceptance The strength of AGM is almost twice as high charge acceptance which means that the battery re-charges faster even under extreme conditions like hot and cold climates, short driving distances and in start and stop systems where all the electrical consumers in the car place a high demand on the battery. Extended Battery Life The strength of AGM is the up to 2X longer life. Bosch AGM perform significantly better in every day use as well as in heavy stop & go traffic with high electrical demands on the battery. HIgher Energy The strength of AGM is the increasing higher energy capacity/output over the lifetime of the battery.",

AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technology is a process by which the electolyte is held in glass mat separators between the lead plates instead of flowing freely in the case (as in a standard flooded-cell battery.) AGM batteries are dry cell batteries - meaning they will not leak if the case is split. The lead plates and glass mat separators in an AGM battery are compressed very tightly in the case. Originally developed for improvement of performance and reliability in military applications, AGM is a trademark of Bosch.",

The first thing I checked were signs of use on the terminals which was clear :) then I looked for the date it was manufactured, which was a WIN :) Starts my Escalade at the slightest turn.

                "reviewText": "This is the type of battery you want if you appreciate high quality and are willing to pay a bit extra for it. The battery market has really moved up in price for even the lowest quality. Go looking around when your battery fails and all you can find is low quality, no name batteries at prices that are less, but still too high for what you are getting. Worse yet, you may be stuck getting a \"universal\" fit that really doesn't fit anything. Because the battery market is so price sensitive, you probably will not ever see this battery on any store shelf or in any auto repair shop, even the dealer. I was glad to see Amazon is carrying this type. This design (AGM - google it) is the most modern, and has many advantages, but is more expensive to manufacture. If your car uses this size and you think you might need a battery in the near term, it would be a good decision to order and install this one before you are stuck somewhere and stuck buying a cheap battery for nearly the same cost as the best quality and design.",
