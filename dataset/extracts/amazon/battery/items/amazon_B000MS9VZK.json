One coated plate is positive and the other is negative. The unique manufacturing process of spiral winding continuous lead plates is far more precision-controlled and expensive than building traditional flat plate AGM batteries. Custom automated cell-winding machines are required to maintain the close tolerances required to maintain quality and performance. Critical tolerances, temperatures, humidity and automated processes are maintained and constantly monitored. OPTIMA has built over 100 million individual spiral cells since the early 1990\u2019s.",

RedTop For normal engine starting where an alternator immediately monitors the state of charge and provides energy to the battery whenever it is needed. This would describe most stock vehicles, including: automotive and RV underhood starting, heavy equipment where starting is the primary function, and diesel vehicles without aftermarket electronics. YellowTop Use this when electrical loads are higher than average, or when the discharge cycle is more than typical engine starting, such as vehicles with multiple electronic accessories and vehicles without alternators. This can also include vehicles with a lot of factory electronics such as power sliding doors and a DVD player. Examples also include: racing vehicles without a charging system, dedicated drag racers, diesel powered vehicles with aftermarket electronics, and vehicles with inverters, winches, or other accessories. BlueTop The BlueTop starting battery (dark gray case) is to be used when a dedicated starting battery is required and it should never be used for cycling duty. Use a BlueTop starting battery for marine applications and RVs when the battery's only function is engine starting. The dual purpose BlueTop (light gray case) can be used for both starting and deep cycling -- it is a true deep cycle battery with extremely high cranking power. Uses include: trolling motors, marine applications with heavy electrical accessories, and RVs.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this thing after my so called 80 mo battery died. Fired up my Titan with MagnaFlow Exhaust & 3 1/2\" - 4\"\" inch Tru-Flo Air Intake and the damn thing Roared like a Lion! Hmmm, maybe I'll post a video so you can hear it.... OK ok, so the battery had nothing to do with the sound, but it made the truck start really quickly - I mean it turned the thing over like it was mad at it or something. LOL - Well if you need a good starting battery, then get it... I've had it installed for about two weeks now, and I've completely drained it twice with interior lights and radio while working outside at night. It's still kickin' - I know it warns against deep cycling the battery, but I didn't do it on purpose. Anyway - so far - so good! I like the battery. I'm not gonna propose to it yet, but I do really like it. Hope this helps somebody.UPDATE: Feb 22, 2013-------OK - it doesn't roar in the winter - it clicks! it hasn't dropped below 30 degrees here, and all I get are clicks in the morning... I've disconnected my stereo turn-on lead, so the second battery and amps are not engaged by the PAC-500 solenoid, and not pulling from the alternator while driving, or coincidentally pulling the main battery (Optima) down during start. I'm using a jump-starter to start my truck when I hear the clickety-click. I will see if this clicking crap keeps up, and when I'm bored as hell, like I am right now, I will come back and update this posting!UPDATE: MAR 18, 2013-------Seems to be fine.1) My negative cable end was tightened to the max, and was still loose on batt terminal, so I squeezed it together with pliers, and tapped it back down onto the battery terminal.2) I had the batt tested before step 1 above and it was at 33%.3) I drove truck to charge batt, but had to use my jump starter a couple more times in morning & once after work4) I disconnected my stereo, drove it on the hwy, etc to charge up the battery5) Has been starting just fine, even on coldest mornings here which have been down to 31F.FINAL UPDATE: JUNE 16, 2013-------------------------I DITCHED this battery last week for a DIFFERENT BRAND, and now my truck starts every morning - no clicks!!!Fortunately I had a jump box that started my truck every time this thing decided it wanted to take a nap.I replaced it with an O'reilly Autoparts Extreme battery. The last Extreme I had lasted 3 1/2 yrs in the Georgia heat, and with the factory Rockford Fosgate entertainment and Nav package. The Extreme has a 5 yr warranty that I did not use the last time, cause I could not remember where I bought the damn thing from. - LOL - yeah I know! Anyway, seems only a small percentage of these Optima batteries actually work. Shame, because they built such a great reputation for excellent batteries, now it's ruined. - These new ones are pure crap!180 Degree turn on my initial review - This is a piece of Shieza!!! No Warranty - No Return - No Working = No Buy!!!",

                "reviewText": "Not a fan of lead acid batteries that are spillable.I have several Optima Batteries in other vehicles and they are long lasting/dependable.Amazon indicated this Optima Battery \"fit\" my 2021 Tacoma TRD OffRoad Access Cab.Although, you can MAKE it fit, it is not a OEM match for the form factor. This Optima is smaller therefore you'll need to make several modification to get it locked in to the battery tray/compartment.I bought the Amazon \"suggested\" battery-top-bracket to use to replace the Toyota OEM bracket and you will need to customize this as well. You cannot use the original OEM brackets because they do not have enough threads on the mounting post/poles to compensate for the smaller height of the Optima.Even the replacement bracket does not have long enough threads to mount and you'll have to use some type of spacers (the bracket came with two thick rubber grommet-spacer-like washers that I think are supposed to be used as spacers-no instructions).Also, the +/- battery posts are a hair smaller diameter than the OEM battery (24F) but if you tighten the terminal connectors all the way, they snug enough to make a good connection.The Optima is lighter, smaller and has substantially more CCA's then the OEM Toyota battery, and of course it won't spill and/or (hopefully) leak.After installing and connecting, fired up the Taco and no obvious malfunctions, incompatibility (all electronics seem to function the same) and my third party voltage monitor says it's holding steady at 12.8v.",

Since the battery is a bit shorter than the original one I had to make adjustments to the holding bracket. I wish it came with some sort of tray or adapter to match the original battery height. Other than that it seems to be a great battery, I was able to crank in sub zero temperatures no problem.",

I needed AGM cause I do lapping events with my car and the lead-acid batteries are unsafe in case of an accident. Especially in my case, I've changed the location of my battery, it is now in the center of the passenger compartment, right on the floor. The battery was a bit low when I received it, but it's probably just for sitting on the shelves for a while. Gave it a good charge at low amps for a couple of days and it works just fine now.",
