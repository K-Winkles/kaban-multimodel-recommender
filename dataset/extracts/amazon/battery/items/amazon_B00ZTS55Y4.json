                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the PKCELL 9V battery 10-pack for my smoke detectors, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. These batteries offer the perfect balance of affordability and reliability, making them an excellent option for anyone seeking dependable power for their smoke detectors.One of the standout features of these batteries is their compatibility. Unlike some other brands, the PKCELL batteries work in my smoke detectors. The last set I bought did not. They were the proper type, but smoke detectors can be particular about which battery types they use. They last set I bought were not compatible...and even though they were 9V batteries that fit, the smoke detectors had issues with them, causing a continuous chirp. This compatibility factor alone sets them apart from the competition, providing me with peace of mind knowing that my smoke detectors are functioning optimally, and at a great price point.Additionally, these batteries deliver consistent power performance, ensuring that my smoke detectors are always ready to alert me in case of any potential danger. I appreciate the reliability they offer, as safety is paramount, especially when it comes to protecting my home and loved ones.While I can't speak to the exact longevity of these batteries just yet, the initial performance has been outstanding. The affordable 10-pack ensures that I have enough replacements on hand whenever the need arises, making them a cost-effective choice.Overall, I highly recommend the PKCELL 9V battery 10-pack for anyone seeking reliable and compatible power for their smoke detectors. With these batteries, you can have confidence in your safety equipment and enjoy peace of mind without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "This was my original review: \"I bought this 10-pak of 9v batteries specifically for my annual smoke alarm battery replacement. I have a big house and have 10 smoke detectors. After less than 48 hours 4 of the ten FAILED (smoke alarm does the \"beep-beep-beep\" sound when batteries are low). That's a 40% failure!\"Here is an update: After posting this review I contacted Amazon customer service and they offered to replace this product with another \"no charge\" order. Shortly thereafter I was contacted by the company also offering to replace my order with another at no charge. Today I received that replacement order so I am changing my review to a \"four star\" due to the excellent customer service. I will have to wait for further comments regarding the quality of the product until they are used.",

                "reviewText": "These PKCELL carbon zinc 9V batteries are perfect for smoke and CO detectors. Their 10-year shelf life means I can buy them in bulk and always have fresh batteries on hand for detector replacements. So far, they've lasted over a year powering several detectors in my home before needing to be changed out. For an inexpensive battery, these have proven reliable and long-lasting to keep our home safe and protected. I would recommend them for any home safety product needing standard 9V battery power.",

I was flabberghasted just how expensive it is in general to replace the battery. I bought these on Amazon because of the price. It's been over 3 months and so far so good. Working without a hitch and no chirping. So glad I bought these. It's a great and less expensive alternative than buying those name brand batteries and you get these for less than half the price. Recommend!",
