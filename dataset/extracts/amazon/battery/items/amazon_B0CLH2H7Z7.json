            "\u3010Longer Lifetime, Lower Costs\u3011Dr.Prepare12V 20Ah LiFePO4 batteries offer over 4,000 cycles, surpassing the 300-500 cycles of lead acid batteries. Compared to SLA's 40-60% discharge, our lithium batteries are able to discharge 100%, extending the time between replacements, leading to significant cost savings. Higher energy density and 10 years of daily use from Dr.Prepare Lithium batteries.",
            "\u3010Built-in 20A BMS Protection, 10-Year Warranty\u3011Our lithium batteries feature a built-in BMS with six safeguards: high temperature, overcharge, over-discharge, overcurrent, short circuit, and auto balance protection. Coupled with IP56 water and dust resistance capabilities, it ensures durability in various conditions. Moreover, devoid of heavy and rare metals, our LiFePO4 batteries are environmentally friendly.",
            "\u3010Series and Parallel Connection\u3011Our lithium batteries support wiring in series to create a 24V/36V/48V 20Ah battery bank system. Additionally, they can be wired in parallel to build a 12V 40Ah/60Ah/80Ah system. Furthermore, you can connect up to 16 batteries in both series and parallel to construct a robust battery bank system with a total capacity of 4.096 kWh. Kindly note that ensure all batteries are fully charged individually before connecting in series.",
            "\u3010Cut the Weight by 60%, No More Heavy Lifting\u3011Dr.Prepare's 12 volt 20Ah lithium deep battery weighs only 5.95 lbs, equivalent to five 500ml water bottles. In comparison, a sealed lead-acid battery typically weighs around 20 lbs, resulting in a remarkable 60% reduction in weight.",
            "\u3010Wide Applications\u3011Dr.Prepare 12V 20Ah lithium battery is the perfect replacement for your less durable SLA batteries. It is suitable for a variety of applications, including fish finders, power wheels, electric scooters, UPS backup power systems, solar gate openers, solar water pump systems, home alarm systems, home security systems, amateur radios, ride-on toys, and more (Not a starter battery)."

It is supposed to be chargable and work independently of the battery. However, my experience has been that it will not charge. I have used my high dollar battery charger and it failed to charge. I also hooked directly to solar panel and it did not charge. It does not charge while on the battery. If anyone else has experienced this issue and has found a workaround, I would be very interested in hearing about it.",

I needed more, so I purchased 2-count believing I would receive two of the batteries after being very satisfied with the individual orders previously placed. What I received was one battery, not two, but I was contacted immediately of the error on Amazon. This battery has the LCD display for battery meter which is great for my parallel bank! And wow is it light!UPDATE: All 4 hooked up and testing with 1500w heater using 3000w Pure Sine Inverter. 2hrs and 42 mins still running with 73% to go. I camp in winter for big game hunts in canvas tent so this is a big PLUS for me! And again, no breaking my back taking the batteries with me. The LED was a bit higher than volt meter but really close!!",

                "reviewText": "I have a 1996 Club Car DS golf cart (36v) that was having some trouble climbing hills in my neighborhood. I noticed the lead acid batteries were leaving white puddles on my garage floor from apparent leakage. I figured the batteries were probably close to end of life and it was time replace them. I looked online for options and there are SO many options available. From new lead acid batteries to single unit batteries, to you name it. I watched several YouTube Videos and there is quite a bit of support for a single unit 36V battery but the problem is, they are all very expensive. The benefit of a single unit battery is that it stays more balanced, you don't have one battery cell out of balance from the other units. However, the price differential is substantial. I found that going with 3 - 12v batteries was about 40% cheaper then single unit. Since this is an older golf cart and I don't plan to keep it forever, I'm looking for lowest cost / best performance possible.I received these batteries via UPS Ground shipping about a week after I ordered them. They all came with exactly 89% charge in them. I used an HRTC 12v LiPo charger to bring all the batteries up to 100%. The batteries weight around 22 pounds each, so all 3 installed weigh less then 70 pounds. This is significantly less then the lead acid batteries that were well over 50 pounds per unit so instantly the cart was lighter. After getting them all balanced (fully charged) I installed in the cart and took a few runs around the neighborhood. The cart was moving so much faster, the throttle more responsive, speed pickup was almost instant. We drove around the neighborhood for 10 minutes and then parked the cart. I checked the battery health using the built-in LCD monitoring unit and they all displayed 90% capacity. This seemed a little low to me considering we only drove around 3 miles. We took the cart out again a few more times and the batteries still read 90% capacity. I'm not sure this is accurate, considering the added run time, but it could be because they are new and haven't have many recharge cycles on them yet. I'm still very pleased with the purchase, it was less then replacing with new lead acid batteries and I'm sure they will last longer then I intend to keep the cart. A bonus is if there is ever a power outage, I can easily reconfigure the wiring to provide power to an inverter and keep my house running off these batteries for an extended period. I may have to order a few more!",

                "reviewText": "Decided to convert from SLA to LFP (LiFePO4 Lithium) batteries for my UPSes. These batteries fit perfectly.I charged each with my Lithium charger and installed them, plugged into grid power, check voltage and frequency, 122 volts @ 60 hertz, hooked up to a load source and powered up at 64 watts. Pulled plug from grid and it kept running as expected. I did notice the voltage dropped from 122 to 112 volts but frequency stayed at 60 hertz, showed it would run another 55 minutes with that draw.Very much lighter as it has 2 batteries and each is half the weight of the original, so I reduced by about 4-6 pounds.",

                "reviewText": "The only reason it gets three stars at this point is when I first got the two batteries in one charged to 100% at 13.5 V, but the second battery only charge to 99% at 13.4. Then I used my inverter to run off the battery that was 99% to test things and it ran that battery down to about 80%. Then when we recharge the battery this time, it only went to 94% before the battery shut off charging. So far the company is very responsive and helping to solve the issue. They told me to run the battery completely dead, or until the battery shuts itself off due to low voltage. Then to recharge the battery and see what happens. Upon this test. The battery did charge all the way to 100% at 13.6 V. Not sure why I had to run it dead and then charge it back up to get it to hold the right capacity but it seems to be working so far. I just received my third battery in so we are in the process of charging that one and I will post on how this one charges up.",
