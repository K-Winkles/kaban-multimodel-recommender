I got this battery for a 99 Honda Shadow VT600CD Motorcycle, and it's been great, virtually no maintenance(it was a pain in the ass to install, due to where the battery goes in my bike no fault of the product itself) and has started every single time.I got my bike used months ago and the previous owner always had power issues he couldn't sort out (flickering lights, stalling out every once in a while, requiring a push start or jump start almost every cold start) and after touching up some general wiring I still had minor issues and especially the failure to start, so I ordered this battery here. I was skeptical at first due to the excellent price, but after putting this battery in my bike it has started like a champ, immediately, every time. I've now been running my bike for several weeks with this battery, as I wanted to be sure it had solved my problem before writing this review, and it's been doing great I haven't had to push start the bike a single time since.",

I took it out, charged again till LCD indicator showed full bars indicating full charge. Good voltage. My voltmeter confirmed same voltage as the included LCD indicator. I left it on bench, 3 hours later one of the bars gone indicating 60% - 90% charge. Next morning, no bars, battery is dead. I've been riding almost 50 years. First time I've had a battery out of the box that was dead, cannot hold a charge. I went to dealer and bought from them. All good now. Unfortunately dealer battery more $, plus $ of this battery plus almost a week of fooling around with it. Not going to buy from this vendor again. And not too inclined to buy battery through Amazon again.",

                "reviewText": "Update: 8/4/2020 battery still works great!Update 2: 9/26/2021 still works! I can feel the better getting weaker but has never failed to start even after multiple stalls. Always kept on tenderUpdate 3: 5/21/2022 still working! However, due to my negligence it has been fully depleted at least two times causing damage. It still starts but it\u2019s getting weaker so I took it as a sign to simply replace it. Not bad for the ~$30 it originally cost. Will definitely buy again.Pros:Came and worked great tested voltage and it was 100% charged which was nice. 2018 royal Enfield Himalayan cranked instantly whereas it was taking a second or two with the old dying battery( lasted me less than a year of use came with bike).Cons:The screw thingies this comes with suck I had to stack two nuts tall (old and new) taped together to get them to stay since there\u2019s so backstop on either side of the terminal so they slide around and they\u2019re hard to deal with .Will update review if anything changes or if the battery dies.",
