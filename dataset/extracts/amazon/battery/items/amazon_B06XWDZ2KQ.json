Product Features: The MOTOPOWER MP00205A 12V 800mA Battery Charger allows you to connect the charger to the battery and leave it for maintenance indefinitely. Once the battery has reached a 100% charge, the chargers will automatically switch it's output voltage to a safe, storage/float level (13.6V+/-0.2V) that eliminates the need to worry about the damaging effects of overcharging. Pulse Current Recovery Mode: In the Absorption Mode, the charger will give a 0.5Amp pulse current to charge and recover the battery until it's fully charged. In this stage, the charger will decrease the battery sulfation and improve the battery performance gradually. For several times charging, you will find the battery internal resistance is lower and the performance is improved. Technical Details: - Input Voltage: 100-240V AC / 60Hz. - Output Voltage: 12 Volts DC @ 800mA - Charged Voltage: 14.2+/-0.2 Volts - Maintenance Voltage: 13.6+/-0.2 Volts - Activate Voltage: 4Volts ( Do not suggest charging dead batteries ) Package Includes: - Battery Charger x 1 - SAE Alligator Clamp Cable x 1 - SAE Eyelet Terminal Cable(7.5A fused) x 1 - Instruction Manual x 1",

                "reviewText": "I have 5 of these maintainers on various pieces of equipment (generator, tractor, lawn tractor, and hydraulic dump trailer) and seasonal vehicles. I'm right now ordering another for a vehicle. I have two cars that don't get driven often, and these really help to keep the batteries in good condition. They are cheap insurance considering the ridicules prices for batteries these days.I really like having the cable for wiring them directly to the battery. I have one piece of equipment where access to the battery requires partially disassembling the machine. I was able to route the connector to where I can just plug it in when not using the machine.I also modified the cable on two these maintainers where I replaced the loop terminals with lighter plugs bought on Amazon. This way I can plug them into the lighter socket in the vehicles, and not have to open the hood to connect/disconnect. Just make sure the lighter socket in the vehicle is the \"always on\" type, or you will not charge when the key is off.Also, I accidentally remote-started one of our vehicles recently, forgetting that the maintainer was still plugged in to it. It didn't seem to harm anything.One last note. These devices, while water resistant, are not completely waterproof. I killed one by letting it get wet while plugged in. It was under the dump trailer, and I thought it was out of the weather, but apparently a puddle formed under the trailer, and it sat submerged for who knows how long. These are priced so reasonably, I just bought another to replace it (and put it up higher).I can't recommend these enough.",

                "reviewText": "We placed eight 12v batteries on these battery chargers for an entire week to maintain them until installing the batteries into APC uninterruptable power supplies. The batteries were brand new. Every battery, when installed for first time use after charging, had a reading of just 90% charged so the APC UPS units had to top off the remaining 10%. That's not a big issue for our application which is simply backup power, but if you needed a 100% charge for real time use (like a forklift or other high power demand equipment) it could be the difference between completing a job/event and not completing it. We'll keep using these as maintainers and are happy they at least get batteries maintained up to 90% constantly.",
