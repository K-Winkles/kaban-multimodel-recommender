                "reviewText": "The battery worked fine in my Yamaha XT250 but the hardware that came with the battery did not fit in the terminals. The nut was too big to fit inside the terminal in both the horizontal and the vertical orientation. Make sure you hang onto the terminal hardware from the battery you are replacing or have new hardware available. The terminals also were slightly larger those on the stock battery so I had to bend the connector pieces slightly to get them to fit. It was also a challenge to get the nut on the negative terminal to engage because of the extra height of the terminal. I managed to get the battery installed, but it was not exactly a drop in replacement.",
