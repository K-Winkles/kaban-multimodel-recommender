I've used them for remote controls and for kids toys. Obviously, the remote control batteries lasted a very long time. However, due to the nature of the toy (lights and sounds) and constant use, the battery only lasted about 3 months. For the price, these batteries are a good deal.",

Batteries like that are always needed for anything like my headlights that I use to help me do my business. I run a Christmas light company and often times and working in the dark, I\u2019ll even finish off some jobs doing window cleaning in the dark and the headlight can help me complete it. We do dryer vent cleanings and also air duct cleanings to where it\u2019s hard to see into the dark space and this helps me get a better idea of what I am looking at . Ultimately, I think this product is great and has helped me make more money for my business. In addition to that, I love rock, climbing, and sometimes we will use our headlamp with these batteries to finish off a good day of climbing. I\u2019m crazy enough to ski in the trees as well, and trust these batteries to keep my headlight bright While I ski safely through the trees, or at least safely as you can ski through trees at night!",
