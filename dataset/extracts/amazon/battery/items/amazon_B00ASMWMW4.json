It simply got cold outside, and the battery doesn't hold a charge. The customer service website does not work, the phone number is just a voicemail that doesn't get returned and Amazon won't do anything about it. Save yourself the time and do not buy this product. Buy one locally where you can take it back to the store if you have issues.",

I had to do a lot of cranking on the battery to get it going and it never faltered. The voltage and the cranking amps stayed strong and consistent. A lesser battery would have worn down before the engine finally started. Very good battery for the price. The digital display on the top of the battery is very useful.",
