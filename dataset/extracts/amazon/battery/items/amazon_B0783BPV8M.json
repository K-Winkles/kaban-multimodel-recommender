Buying them in a bundle of 40 at around $7 was a steal, and they arrived on my doorstep well packaged and unscathed. The only thing I will note (and detract 1 star for) is that they are not exactly the same thickness of the name-brand LR44/357 batteries they were replacing - So if you need to stack multiples together to complete the circuit, make sure that you have a decent length spring in the battery compartment to make up for that lost distance when using these.",
