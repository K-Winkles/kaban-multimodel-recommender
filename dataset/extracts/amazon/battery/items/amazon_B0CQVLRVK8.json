                "reviewText": "I recently had my key fob for my car die on me so these CR2032 batteries from TOPUSSE popped up on my Vine radar at a very convenient time. Almost as if Amazon knew my battery died. :)Anyways, CR2032 batteries are in a ton of stuff. I have 3 other key fobs plus two garage remotes that also use them too. And, of course, my motherboard on my PC as well. So, yeah, they're pretty ubiquitous and these will come in handy. I used my trusty old battery test to test one of these and sure enough, it popped at 3.62v - .62 volts higher than it's rated.At this price, you get TWENTY-FIVE of them which is an absolute steal. For a name brand CR2032 (you know who you are) you would only get about FOUR of these. In my experience, name-brand batteries offer the same or nominally better performance and longevity - not worth 6x the cost, IMO.With that being said, I haven't had these for long and JUST put this in my key fob, but the key fob works again with the new battery. However, I anticipate this battery to last just as long as any other CR2032. And, again, at this price you should absolutely pick these up.",

You know - the car remotes, the garage door openers, and even on most of our rifle scopes - among many other items that I can think of.So, when I originally saw this 10 item pack - that is less than 50c a battery, I was in disbelief and ordered them right away! (Twice! LOL!)They seem to work just fine, though I am not able to tell you just how long they will work for long-term.Great price and great value!",
