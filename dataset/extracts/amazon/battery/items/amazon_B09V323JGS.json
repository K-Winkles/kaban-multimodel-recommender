                "reviewText": "These rechargeable AAA batteries are labeled as having 1100 mAh of energy. AAA alkaline batteries are said to contain 1000 to 1100 mAh. These rechargeables simply do not last as long in a high-drain environment. My use is an indoor-outdoor thermometer where the outdoor sensor transmits the temperature wirelessly to the receiver-display unit indoors. Leading brand AAA alkaline batteries last for 5 to 6 weeks in the outdoor transmitter. These rechargeable AAA batteries lasted for a little less than 3 weeks, so half as long.They cost 2.5 to 3 times as much (per battery) as AAA alkaline batteries. The secret about AAA alkaline batteries is they are indeed rechargeable! Just use a recharger that has a plastic door or closed enclosure where the batteries sit. I have found alkaline batteries to be usefully rechargeable on average three times; after that they either start a small leak of their contents or they do not take a good charge (according to my cheap battery tester). Sometimes alkaline batteries leak in use without ever undergoing a recharging; this seems common in remote controls (ugh). In high drain applications recharged AAA batteries last half as long as new batteries. In low drain applications (such as a wireless mouse) they last a long time, whatever that is.The one advantage of these NiMH batteries have over alkaline batteries is NiMH batteries don't start leaking for several years and after dozens of charges. A big disadvantage of NiMH batteries is that when not used they rarely keep a good charge for longer than 3 months; as they age this time falls to 1 month.So it's a complex situation. I hate leaky alkaline batteries, such as the house brand batteries I get at a very big box store. I hate batteries that go dead while being stored, such as NiMH batteries. 3 stars to all concerned.",
