The reason is simple, the cheap batteries are cheap for a reason: they are either counterfeit or so old that they have discharged in storage. In contrast, many who got good batteries bought them directly from Amazon; so I did that, and they are all fresh and fully charged.As soon as I received my batteries in the mail I did two things. I checked the manufacture date, then I tested them.My batteries have a manufacture date from only 5 months ago, with a \"use by\" date 5 years in the future. And, when I tested them they were all fully charged. (See photographs)So yes, I will continue to buy batteries from Amazon, but only those sold directly by Amazon. The cheap batteries are cheap for a reason: they are duds, not deals.",

                "reviewText": "I change my smoke alarm batteries once a year. Don't believe you have to change them every 6 months, its a waste of money. Spring forward turn back who cares! Just do it once a year. Pick your favorite calendar month then replace all your smoke alarm batteries one year from that month. It could be the month of your birthday or your wedding anniversary whatever is special to you. Now why do I like these batteries? Because there is enough in this package to replace all of my smoke detectors and they are easy to put into my First Alert smoke detector. Should have had this before getting married! However, these batteries should work in most if not all smoke detectors. Have you ever gone to the store looking for 9 volt batteries having to buy more than you wanted because you could not get the quantity needed. This is why I now buy my batteries from Amazon. Quick and easy you don't have to waste time money and gas looking for batteries ever again. Why get charged up over batteries?. If you want to get charged up then watch the NFL when the Chargers play! So I would suggest change your batteries once a year not twice unless you have nothing else to do, order them from Amazon, pick your special month for installing them in your smoke detectors. Sit back and relax till next year when its time again. You might even include doing this with your favorite drink but will save that for another time. Just remember please use caution when changing batteries in a smoke detector especially when using a ladder. If you are unsure of yourself then get someone to help but not your wife if you want dinner that night! -MIT",
