                "reviewText": "I have had many a real, fake, and in between ring in my time, and I didn\u2019t expect anything genuinely silver or even real metal. I don\u2019t mind a fake ring at all if they look this good honestly! But they are not going to last very long if you wear them constantly or if you do any sort of moderate to heavy work with your hands.I was looking for rings that are about a size 4-6 because my hands run about a size 7 across the board, so these mostly fit at the base of my fingers or are big enough for my thumbs. The two rings that are on my left pointer and left thumb are a couple of the ones purchased, compared to 3 other types of rings. The one left middle is literally a piece of circular metal I found in highshool and have worn it since. The one right pointer is a $20 silver ring with fake stones, they fall out easy. And my wedding ring (right ring finger) is cheap but a real set of stones. All to say, these blend in just fine with any style rings just fine, you just need to know that you get what you pay for!",

Last time I spent $ 20 on finger/knuckle rings from etsy -- and I loved them, they could be stretched or tightened for a better fit in order to fit on certain sections of the fingers, problem with them is I made a habit of washing my hands with them on, which in turn would give me green rings around my finger. Anyway, these are more suited for a high school or middle school aged girl I think.",
