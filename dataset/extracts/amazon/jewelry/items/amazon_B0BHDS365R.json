                "reviewText": "I engaged my wife in this review process, so I could get an idea of how they performed. Here is what we agreed on:I examined the color consistency and overall physical build, first. I like the way these are constructed. Though they are very lightweight, they are strong and well built. The coating has an even luster, which I think separates them from \"cheap\" earrings. They look good on my wife's ears and she liked the way they looked when she viewed them in the mirror. Now, here is what was unexpected: These were so lightweight that once my wife put them on, she left them on (she does not leave earrings on, most of the time). She forgot about them, and wore them to bed (she has never done that before), and had them on the next morning. When I asked her about wearing them all night and into the next day, she said they were very comfortable and they were so hypoallergenic, that they did not irritate her ears, even after wearing them for about 16 hours or more. She has had a lot of issues with almost all earrings making her ears sore after much fewer hours. So, these errings were a win-win.I cannot think of anything that I do not like and when I asked my wife, she could not think of anything either. However, in my observation, as a man, I did not think these were very fancy, and my wife agreed. She said she considered these to be more like every day, wearing to work or shopping, type earrings, not so much for formal dress-up.Overall, these seem to be attractive, a very good value, and made to last.",

You can adjust the post if they don\u2019t close properly. These are not super heavy, but they do have some weight to them so I think they are solid. They are very shiny with a good silver color. They come in a \u201cvelvet\u201d bag. Stamped with IBB CN which is a company name and indicates they\u2019re made in China. Hope they\u2019re real silver. They\u2019re nice little hoops.",

I can sleep in these and not feel them at all just like my huggies, yet they look substantial enough that you might think I spent time deciding on earrings that morning. I\u2019ve also used them in my second hole with a larger hoop style earring in my first and liked that look as well. Overall, a very versatile earring.It should also be noted these earrings do not irritate my sensitive skin and the clasps hold tight.",

These earrings are surprisingly nice quality and look a lot more expensive than $15. The thick oval shape is a nice modern twist to a classic standard, and these earrings go with everything. I got the silver, but they also come in yellow gold so there\u2019s a match for everyone. Sometimes this kind of earrings can be difficult to open, but I haven\u2019t had any issues with these. They seem well made, but I\u2019ll update later if I have any issues with tarnishing or discoloration. My only con is that they come in a small ziplock bag instead of a box.",

                "reviewText": "For the reasonable price you are getting some nice added bling here. These are nice to wear by themselves, or with other multiple earrings. No, these are not high end earrings made out of precious materials. I am not so sure they even have 14K gold, but I think, so what?. That is not what you are paying for here! They are just a fun addition to your collection. They actually did ship with a nice cloth pouch and good packaging to keep them from scratching. A lot of care went into this from the seller for a relatively inexpensive item! If you are sensitive to metals I may be a little concerned, but I am having no problem with them... Enjoy!",
