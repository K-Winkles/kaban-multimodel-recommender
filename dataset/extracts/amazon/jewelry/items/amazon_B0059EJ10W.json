This time I was looking for a specific style to go with an outfit I was putting together for an award ceremony I was attending and nominated for. Totally worth spending more.The bracelet has some real weight to it. You can feel it\u2019s a well constructed bracelet. I love the clasp to hold the bracelet closed, it\u2019s not going to slip open. The overall design and look is it looks like a really expensive bracelet. Thank you Guess for creating such a beautiful piece. I can\u2019t wait to wear it!",
