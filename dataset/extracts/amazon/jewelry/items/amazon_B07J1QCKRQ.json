My one concern before buying this ring was that it was going to have the \"mold seam\" visibly around the whole thing but after looking at other customer pics, I went for it anyway and it doesn't have one at all. So super happy about that! And the overall quality. Super comfortable, lightweight and durable too.Only negative, and I think it's just the nature of the beast b/c Qalos do it too, it \"gives\" over time. So even though I size down slightly when buying these and they fit perfectly for the first month or two, they get a little larger on your finger over time (i.e. it rolls up my finger & comes off easier, etc.). Again, would definitely recommend overall though.",
