                "reviewText": "This was the most beautiful chandelier I was looking at my for my little girl's nursery and happened to also be the cheapest but I was hesitant to get it because of some reviews saying it was hard to put together. I actually got one that wasn't brand new perfect and got a \"very good\" spending $10 less. The chandelier arrived with all the crystals needed and extra. I have been putting together light fixtures and ceiling fans through out our house and this was by far the easiest! The directions were not horrible as some reviews say. I would sort the crystals out and then put them on the chandelier and then hang the chandelier. Because the wiring is clear silvery casings I wasn't able to easily identify the black and white wire but if there is stickers on your wires the N sticker is the neutral wire or the one that would connect to the white wore coming from the ceiling, mine was also ribbed and had small writing on it. Hope this helpful. Also if you have someone that can hold the chandelier while you wire it to the ceiling that makes it easier, that like hanging any other light fixture was the trickiest part.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this chandelier. Placed it in my hallway/foyer. It is small and just the right size. I read with interest all the complaints about putting it together. I had NO problem at all. I had the help of a teenager and we put it all together in less than 30 minutes. No hassle at all. If you have long nails or little patience for putting something together then maybe I could understand but I had NO problem whatsoever. In fact it was fun putting it together and I hate assembling things. Seller included a diagram and extra pieces. Nice touch! Installation was done by a professional within 15 minutes. Easy installation. What I don't like is that chandelier has no sparkle at all. I love bling, this has real glass crystals but doesn't sparkle at all, so I am disappointed about that. I highly recommend this chandelier, I looked at pictures from other people that bought and it seemed that some of them had chandeliers that did sparkle. Not mine. No sparkle or bling maybe different crystals but I still recommend the chandelier.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp looks a lot cheaper in person. The metal frame youll receive will be different. Instead of the flat trimming, you'll get a wire like frame, much cheaper looking and less elegant. The video on youtube shows different versions of same lap . Not all pieces are a match nor video appropriate for assembly. The panphet is useless and is not helpful. Finally worst part. THIS LAMP DOES NOT INCLUDE A LIGHT BULB!AFTER PUTTING IT TOGETHER YOULL HAVE TO RUN OUT FOR A BULB. Building it is tideous. You must unbend a very cheap version of a wire ring to attach fake looking crystals. They overbend easy so,..its a pain.",

                "reviewText": "This chandelier is awesome! I'm not really a chandelier person but wanted something modern and elegant for the entrance to the master bedroom. It's the perfect size for an entryway or hallway. It took me about 30 minutes to put together and although the directions weren't the greatest, it was pretty easy to follow the picture. My husband hated the picture online and said he was going to hate it, but admitted after hanging it that it looks great",

                "reviewText": "This is a great looking product but it has the most complicated assembly. There was little to no instruction with the product other than one grainy picture. It seems like the manufacturer is trying to save all the cost in packaging and as a result every single part of this chandelier comes separate right from the metal pieces to all the links. They have paid no attention to ease of assembly. For example, the links can be easily assembled if they have hooks at the end; however in this case they have given rings at the end that make it even more complicated to assemble. Stay away from this product unless you want to spend 2-3 hours putting this up. There are many other chandeliers that are way easier to assembly and put up.",
