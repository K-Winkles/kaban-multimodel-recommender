Staying true to the rich heritage \u2014 and authentic, all-American spirit \u2014 of denim, Lucky Brand began crafting great-fitting, vintage-inspired jeans in Los Angeles in 1990. We gave them their distinctively Lucky look by literally putting them through the wringer \u2014 ripping, fraying, sanding, patching and washing by hand \u2014 to give them true character and soul. Then, we added authentic hardware, personalized touches and playful details, and an American legend was born.",

We find inspiration everywhere, from the secluded outlooks of Big Sur, to the old-school tattoo parlors of Venice and the beautiful beaches of Malibu. We reference music, art and photography \u2014 old and new \u2014 to create truly unique pieces that you\u2019ll wear over and over again.",
