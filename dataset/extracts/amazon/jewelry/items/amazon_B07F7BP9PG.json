It took a week to arrive and when I placed it on my wrist, I was delighted! I love it!\u2764\ufe0f. Yes, it is real 925 sterling silver and it is a bit brighter in color. Looks fantastic on tanned skin. Have been wearing it for 2 weeks now and no tarnishing. It seems to be well made and I wear it daily. I highly recommend this beautiful bracelet! Now, I am going to purchase the matching necklace!",
