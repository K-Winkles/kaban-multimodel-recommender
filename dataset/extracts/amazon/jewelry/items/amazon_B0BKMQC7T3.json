Just slightly bigger than an average hoop to be noticeable and just thick enough to be classy and cool and chic instead of bulky and unattractive. I would buy these hundreds of times over. I have worn them to sleep and in the shower multiple times and they show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",

When I initially received them, I was fastening the silver closed and I must\u2019ve pushed too hard and the thin connecter bar (that goes through the ear) bent and I was unable to close the earring. I bent it back into place and it closed, but not as firmly as it should. I returned them and got a new pair. A few days in, the same thing happened. I\u2019m not applying a whole lot of force, but the material bends too easily. I\u2019m not returning them. I\u2019ll wear them when I travel and if they break or fall off I won\u2019t be heartbroken. I also noticed that the silver expands more than the gold when opened. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s supposed to do that or not\u2026.",

For the price I paid, they looked classy and chic. I was very upset when one day I went to put the earrings in, and one of them would not clasp to secure it. I continued to try to clasp the earring shut, but it wouldn't budge. I always take them out and put them in my ears the same way, so Im not sure why the earring suddenly won't clasp. For the price I paid, they were a decent pair of earrings. However, I haven't gotten to wear them all that much due to the poor quality of the item which is why I rated these 3/5 stars.",
