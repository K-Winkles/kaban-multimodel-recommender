The set comes with 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm top closures, and each stud is available in three different lengths. The great thing about this set is that each top can be used with any stud in set, giving you endless options to mix & match for a custom look. What is the difference between internally threaded and externally threaded jewelry? External threading is where the threads are on the outside of the jewelry post, while internal threading is where the threads are on the inside of the jewelry post. Benefits of internally threaded jewelry include longer lasting, easy insertion. Do you have any tips for unscrewing small jewelry parts? I just received mine but am having difficulty unscrewing them. You can try using a pair of jewelry pliers or tweezers to grip the small end of the post and gently turn it counterclockwise. Be careful not to overtighten or overtighten it, as this can damage the jewelry or cause discomfort. Is this set suitable for new piercings, and are the sizes appropriate for swollen, freshly-pierced ears or lips? Each person's healing process is unique, set of studs is designed to fit multiple piercings, it's important to make sure you select the right size for your individual needs.. We recommend checking the sizes & measurements before making a purchase.",

Only giving it three stars because the post threading is SOOO short.I bought these to use on my tragus once it healed but ironically realized i need a longer bar so I switched it out for one of these and sad that the super cute posts jewelry is too short. Id tighten it and it would come undone with very little twisting. What i did was use the longest bar which seems the best and used my Iranian stud that which works wayyy better since the threading is much longer.My tragus is only about 3weeks old and they jewelry claims to be surgical steel but I will update this if i have any reactions",

I would have preferred a smaller stone as in the picture. They are very pretty and nicely cut stones however. I did wear mine and it looked nice :)",
