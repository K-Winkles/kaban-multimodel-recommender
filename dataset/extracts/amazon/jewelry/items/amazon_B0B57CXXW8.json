This ring serves as my temporary wedding ring replacement. This is a beautiful little ring and if you are looking for a replacement for a wedding or engagement ring it is perfect and the price can't be beat. If you are not in a high income bracket, this ring is small enough to be believable while still being lovely enough to make others notice. If worn on the left hand, no one would suspect that it is not a real diamond. For a woman who wants to appear married without spending a fortune, you can pair it with a matching band and it instantly announces that you are not available. I have gotten several compliments on it and I've only been wearing it for a week. No one suspects that I didn't replace my original ring with a new diamond. LOVE this ring.",

The ring has withstood corrosive alcohol hand sanitizing, dish washing, & general daily wear for about a month now. All pics taken are after a month of wear. Minimal scratches on the surface, still very shiny as seen in picture. Cz loses it's shine from grime getting stuck, a quick brush with an old tooth brush & the stone shiny again. Prongs holding in main center stone sticks out a bit & catches/snags, tried flattening a bit with jewellery tongs but no avail. The prongs are also starting to discolour with a slight hint of copper peaking through. Honestly great product overall. Affordable enough to buy again & have different styles.",
