                "reviewText": "LONG REVIEW! I'll start by saying these earrings are exactly what I was looking for. I purchased a set for myself quite a while back, and they're really cute for adult women as \"huggie\", or just small hoop earrings. But, after receiving my pair and wearing them for a while to test their durability, I thought they would be a perfect set of small hoops for my 6 y/o daughter. And I was definitely right! As you can see in the picture, I got the rose gold plated for her, and they're absolutely adorable! They're a perfect size so you can tell she is wearing little hoops, but still small enough to suit her small frame and be manageable. They're very lightweight so they don't pull on her ears at all. However, the best feature of these earrings is probably the ease of wearing them. With a lot of hoops for little girls, the closure on them is the type where the 'post' part that goes through the ear has to go back inside the earring (like the earring is hollow) itself to be secured. These types of closures always end up with my daughters ear getting pinched because it's so hard to maneuver to close. Other hoops will simply have the post clip on the top of the back side of the earring, with a little piece sticking out. The piece you 'pop' in and out when you're putting them in or removing them. These don't pinch her ears, but that piece sticking off the back always gets caught on something and the earring falls out without anyone noticing. We have 2 seperate sets of hoops that were made this way, and both sets have one earring missing because they inevitably came out and got lost, never to be seen again. So, that leads me to why these are so great, again.. The closure on these is fantastic. The earring has a hinge in the middle which essentially let's in fold down to seperate almost in half, then the post goes through the ear and you bring the other half back up and the post clicks right in to the other half of the earring. There is NOTHING sticking out/off the back side, so it doesn't get caught on anything and become unsecured. It never pinches my daughters ear, and it's super easy to close and open. My daughter sleeps in her earrings, and these have never come open or gotten lost in the night like the others did. I genuinely can't say enough good things about these earrings. They haven't tarnished or turned, and they're a great value for an excellent price. I highly recommend!! For adults, or kids!!",

                "reviewText": "First off, I love this brand! I found them on amazon a couple years ago. I know their jewelry is well made and lasts! I got these earrings to wear everyday, even while sleeping. If you are reading this review looking for earrings comfy enough to sleep in, I think these will be for you! My \u201ccomfy earrings\u201d (that\u2019s the brand name) finally started looking not so cute. I was looking for comfortable earrings to sleep in and wear every day. These are cute for any occasion- dressy or casual. They are classy and cute. They are small! What small is varies from person to person, but to me they are small. For those who are shocked by the small size, you may want to do your research before ordering. You can see in the description the size of the earrings and also look at other customers picture reviews. On me, they have a little space between the bottom of my lobe and the bottom of the earring. In other words they don\u2019t hug against the bottom of my earlobe. It all depends on the size of your ears and ear lobes. If you have large earlobes or ears, I suppose you may not be able to close them? I don't know, I don\u2019t have that issue at all. I have seen another reviewer have that issue though. It\u2019s something to take note of. Anyways, they are so comfy I don\u2019t even feel them in my ears. I can shower and sleep with them in no problem. I\u2019ll probably order more colors! I think these would also be great for kids, toddlers or babies. I\u2019m ordering a pair for my toddler! I will update if I have any issues. The only thing I am worried about is that these could possibly fall out. Not that they don\u2019t feel secure, but I am used to screw back earrings. So far they are fine though. If you were worried about that, you could always put one of those little tiny clear plastic earring backs on. Like the kind that come on earrings behind the earring back to hold the earrings on the packaging. I personally have enough space for one of those little clear plastic earring backs (the tiny ones) to fit in the earring and still close it. I\u2019ll probably do that to the ones I order for my toddler, just in case.",
