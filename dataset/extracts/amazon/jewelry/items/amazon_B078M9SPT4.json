I cannot wait to wear this necklace with my turquoise & silver crystal earrings. I work in the fashion industry and this is a very unique and well made piece of fine jewelry. Highly recommend!! Comes in several metal wire colors and pendant colors. Love the tree of life! I actually grow the moringa tree of life here in the Phoenix desert so this necklace has a special meaning. Moringa trees grow exceptionally fast. About 15-20 feet the 1st year if well watered and rich soil. They leaves are edible and a complete protein. The tree grows 18 inch long seed pods that are also edible and delicious. One tree can feed a family of 3-4 people.",
