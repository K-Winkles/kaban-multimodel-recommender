Lightweight (which I found great for my earlobes) but I definitely would not consider the set flimsy. I actually tried to bend the earrings and couldn\u2019t. I kept the set on more than 6 hours , some of which I was pretty sweaty but there was no tarnishing . I have sensitive ears but no pain, swelling or itching during or after wear. I put it back in the box after the event, it\u2019s been months and it looks the same as day one. Definitely would say buy it.",
