The Pavoi white gold statement rings are just what I'd been looking for.It is hard to find 'white gold'/silver rings, everything out there is 'gold'. The rings are all separate and can be stacked or warn individually.They run a teeny tiny bit snug when all three are stacked. Ordered a size 7 for my actual ring finger. A full size up would have allowed me to wear them on two other fingers. But I really like the versatility of separating them for a different look each day. Pavoi suggests removing them for hand washing which I am guilty of not doing. The white gold might be just a touch darker than my white gold wedding ring set, but are very shiny and not cheap looking at all. When wearing all three rings stacked, they do tend to scoot around and need to be realigned.This is a nice set of rings that I plan to wear daily. Nice find!",

Very trendy amorphic shape and aesthetic I just didn\u2019t find them flattering or stylish on my hands (mostly size 8/8.5 finger sizes for these) but if you have long slender fingers with long nails like some of the reviewers, they are really complimentary!",

                "reviewText": "I love the Pavoi brand, their products are always quality at a very affordable price point. This is a three ring set, all separate pieces. So you\u2019re getting three rings in one package. The metal of this ring is shiny but not in a fake way. It is comfortable to wear and does not irritate my skin. When worn together, these rings make an impact and create a statement ring.The only issue I\u2019m having w this ring is getting them to stack up evenly. The curves to the rings create a nice aesthetic but, maybe it\u2019s just me, it takes some fidgeting to get them lined up like in the advertised picture. I got a size 5 which is my typical size and it is TTS, but the rings do shift a bit around the finger which results in sometimes you having to realign them. I wish they fit together just a little bit more snugly, but it won\u2019t stop me from wearing this!",
