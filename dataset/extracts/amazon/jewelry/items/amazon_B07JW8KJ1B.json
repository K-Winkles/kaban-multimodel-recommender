Companies that have their jewelry stamped 925 but missing the company mark is illegal. Miabella stamps all sterling silver jewelry with 925 Italy and either LIRM or Miabella. You can test your jewelry with a magnet. Never test the clasps of chains. Sterling silver clasps have stainless steel springs that will cause the magnet to stick-even if the piece is really gold or silver. Test the piece in the middle, away from the clasp. If the magnet sticks, it\u2019s not gold or silver.",

The benefit of choosing Miabella fine jewelry is its unprecedented quality and timeless designs. Unlike fine jewelry, fashion jewelry is typically made of materials such as brass, copper, aluminum and plastic that do not offer long-lasting use or value and can cause skin irritations. Our jewelry is made from genuine 925 sterling silver and pure 18k gold that are hypoallergenic, nickel-free, lead-free, and won\u2019t cause irritation, making it a great choice for those with sensitive skin. All of our 18k gold over sterling silver jewelry are layered in gold 5x's thicker than the industry average. Made in Italy Italian jewelry has the highest government quality standards unmatched by any other country in the world. Miabella jewelry pays homage to the authentic craft of Italian jewelry design, bringing beauty and sophistication of Italian design to everyone. 18K Gold Over Sterling Silver Jewelry Care To preserve the appearance and longevity of your 18K gold plated jewelry, you need to ensure you're gentle, avoid rubbing, and simply clean in warm soapy water then dry with a soft cotton lint-free cloth. Do NOT use an anti-tarnish cloth on rhodium or gold plated jewelry. Avoid contact with household chemicals, swimming pools and salt water. Allow perfume, spray or lotion to dry before wearing your jewelry. Store in a dry place.",
