It is hard to top it without putting down some substantial dough that I'd rather invest in other things besides jewelry. This ring pairs beautifully with it.Pay a little extra for the gold vermeil. The plating holds on well. I have very reactive skin. It easily wears off plating in days and I will break out in a rash from cheap metal. This ring has held up for over two months, but my only gripe is that it's lost a \"diamond\". I just ordered another one. For the price, whatever!",
