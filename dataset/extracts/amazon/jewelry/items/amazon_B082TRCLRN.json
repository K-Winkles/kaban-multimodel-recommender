                "reviewText": "Update at the bottom of this review*Bought the vermeil gold version hoping it would be stronger and it definitely isn\u2019t. The links are way to weak. Given on Christmas, so about month of mostly daily wear the ring near the gems snapped. This issue is mainly due to the clasp that holds the bracelet tight to the wrist. Within a couple weeks of use it already started loosening (she stated was getting annoying and almost lost it once) to today where it let something light get underneath while cooking and pulled the link right out. Very pretty but useless for daily wear. I guess it would be decent if you wear it only out for occasions and if the case go with the cheaper one because the clasp will definitely go out in it over time. Heres to hoping the vendor will replace it since it has just been over a month, conveniently for me right after the return period expired. Will update if they do.UPDATE: So after reaching out to the vendor through their email I was reimbursed by their warranty. Leaving the review at 3 starts as the jewelry was not durable due to our experience, but their customer service was responsive and quick.",

I haven't owned it long (at all, literally just had it delivered yesterday) so I can't say whether or not it tarnishes or holds it's quality. The additional dangly part of the chain may annoy some people cause it might get in the way with certain movements, but I think it's cute with it.Update: I've been wearing it almost every day since I've received it on July 2nd. And still just as pretty to look at, however, one stone has fallen off and I only noticed the other day and the closure doesn't stay tightly in place and will loosen up on it's own and will need to adjust it throughout the day. Not sure how to contact seller on seeing if the one stone could get replaced.",
