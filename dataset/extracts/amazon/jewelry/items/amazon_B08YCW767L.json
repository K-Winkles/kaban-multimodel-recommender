                "reviewText": "I really like the color of the gold finish. The chain is a nice mid weight. This is one of two necklaces I take when I travel. This works well with simple dresses as well as with shorts or jeans and tees. The chain adjusts enough to make it wearable with different necklines. Very comfortable. It's low cost means I won't be devasted if I lose it. I like that the back side of the pendant has a design so it can be flipped either way. Great, little necklace worn with simple hoop earrings for a clean, contemporary look. I'm in my 70's and try to stay current with my style without pushing it to the crazy lady level. This simple necklace strikes a good balance. I can mix this with pricier pieces and it holds its own. I like mine so much, I've purchased another as a gift. Definitely a good find. I've not worn it in the shower or the pool so I can't vouch for it under those conditions but I've worn it a fair bit and it still looks new. At this price, I'll just get another if it starts to show wear.",

                "reviewText": "I received my necklace on January 2nd and today is January 13th and I have had zero issues with this necklace! None. I take it off before bed and I only wear it when I\u2019m leaving the house. If you\u2019re looking for something you can wear forever and never take off, this isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s plated metal, so it\u2019s not meant to last forever. It is however, a gorgeous, expensive-looking necklace! It really does look like 10K gold. It\u2019s not a dark brassy gold that looks so obviously fake whatsoever! It\u2019s not a super lightweight chain either. It has a nice weight to it without it being heavy or bulky feeling. I mean, this necklace would fool me if I saw someone casually wearing it around and I\u2019m a trained lapidary artist (I cut gemstones and make jewelry)! I really like that it\u2019s 100% reversible! The heart on the back is super cute and a nice touch. It\u2019ll be great for Valentine\u2019s Day if that\u2019s your thing. I\u2019ve worn this necklace every day for the last 10 days and so far so good! No rash or turning green. I had even forgotten that I was wearing it when I sprayed perfume on me. I did immediately take a dry microfiber cloth and wipe it off and that saved it I think. I also recommend doing this after each wear anyways. It\u2019ll keep the necklace clean and prolong the life of your necklace as well. There is a little care tip card that comes with it that says to basically not move at all or you\u2019ll ruin it lol. I promise, if you\u2019re gentle it\u2019ll last! This is NOT a paid review. I purchased this necklace with my OWN money, straight from Amazon. This review is for those whom, like myself, rely heavily on others\u2019 reviews of products prior to buying them. Happy shopping!",
