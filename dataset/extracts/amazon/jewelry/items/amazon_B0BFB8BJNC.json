Miabella is your destination for high quality, accessible jewelry that will light up the face of anyone who receives it. Sterling Silver Jewelry Care To preserve the appearance and longevity, clean your silver jewelry regularly with an anti-tarnish polishing cloth and avoid contact with household chemicals, swimming pools and salt water. This is also true for sweat, so make sure you remove your jewelry when you exercise or do anything requiring heavy work. Allow perfume, spray or lotion to dry before wearing your jewelry. Do NOT use an anti-tarnish cloth on gold plated jewelry, instead rub gently with a soft cotton cloth. Store in a dry place.",

                "reviewText": "I love this rosary I think more than any of my other rosaries. I know some people have said that this is a discraise to wear the rosary as a piece of jewelry. And honestly some people want to wear a statement piece with out people asking them about it. I wore my regular rosaries and had tones of questions form people curious about the necklace. I told them about it of course, but this necklace is for those who want the power of the rosary but not the bulkieness or the heavieness. Plus if your praying in public you could possibly go around the chain instead of taking it off to pray. It will move around your neck rather than holding it in your hands like normal. The clasp is finiky even for my 30 years young fingers. But these clasps have always been difficult. If your worried about this necklace braking I wouldn't. Mostly because I was seeing if I could brake into my jewelry kit and chance the clasp to one easier to open so I could pray with it. However, all of the jump rings are solid rings, you would have to cut them off. So, I don't think that this can be broken unless someone is really going at it and pulling extra hard on it. I was worried about my cat chewing on it and accidently swallowing a part of my necklace. Even though I'm still going to supervise her, I don't think she will be able to chew it off within a few seconds. Those are just a few things that I have a complaint about is the clasp. However the design and the durability is amazing. Especially if you have a jewelry cleaner to clean all the rust and stuff off with the continual wear. I can't even tell its on my neck at all. I also have metal allergies and so far so good. No rash or irritation. I think this is a perfect piece of protection to wear and if you wore other chains with it no one would even know it was a rosary unless their catholic or like me just a person who loves the rosary.",
