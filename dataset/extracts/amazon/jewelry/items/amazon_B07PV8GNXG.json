                "reviewText": "I have had sensitive ears all my life, and when I was young I had to wear 24 karat gold. These days a lot of earrings are made nickel free so they don't bother my ears. These earrings weren't advertised as nickel free that I can remember, but I've had zero issues wearing them all day. So if your ears always get infected with cheaperings, these should work for you. The earrings are very light weight. The clasps are very secure and did not need adjustment like other hoop earrings I have ordered in the past where the clasp receiver was either too loose or too tight for the post. However, the silver earrings are not very shiny, they have more a slightly darker duller finish. Better than the gold ones though. The gold earrings are NOT the correct color of real gold. You can totally tell they're not real gold earrings. They have an orange / brassy tinge to the color.They are extremely comfortable, I totally forget that I am wearing them. However due to the color being off, I will only wear them around the house or to the grocery store. I will not wear these to work or special events.",
