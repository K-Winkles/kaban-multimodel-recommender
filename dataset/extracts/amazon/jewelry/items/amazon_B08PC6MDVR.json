This beauty glitters and shimmers and shines, almost as if it's alive. When I placed it around my neck, I felt beautiful. Perhaps it is the rose gold color or the style of the chain--most probably both at the same time. My husband has gifted me with much jewelry, from Tiffany's and others, and many were very, very beautiful; but I never felt quite the chill from looking at such a beautiful little jewelry object until now. I would urge you to consider this chain if you are in the market for one. As for me, I'll just sit here and stare at it for a moment...",

I do have sensitive skin, but was hoping, this would be good enough quality to wear for my three day meeting. I also bought the bracelet and had the same experience.",

I added a 2\" chain extender on this to make it longer as you see in the first picture. I also like the fact that even without an extender you can wear this 20\" chain at 18\" if you wanted to and layer with other necklaces. I am a Pavoi fan so anything they make you can be rest assured your getting good quality for an outstanding price.",
