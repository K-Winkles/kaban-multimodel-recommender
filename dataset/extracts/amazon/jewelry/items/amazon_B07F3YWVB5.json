                "reviewText": "This was purchased as a 2022 Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I was really surprised at how beautiful it is, well made and substantial, especially considering the VERY reasonable price. She loved it and it looked lovely on her. From reviews, I was aware that the size I purchased was quite small (7inches as I recall) but the receiver is a tiny young adult with very tiny wrists so the size was more than sufficient.I would be happy to wear such a pretty piece of jewelery myself.",
