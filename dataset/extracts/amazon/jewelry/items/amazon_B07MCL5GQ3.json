Companies that have their jewelry stamped 925 but missing the company mark is considered unlawful. Miabella stamps all sterling silver jewelry with 925 Italy and either LIRM or Miabella. You can test your jewelry with a magnet. Never test the clasps of chains. Sterling silver clasps have stainless steel springs that will cause the magnet to stick-even if the piece is really gold or silver. Test the piece in the middle, away from the clasp. If the magnet sticks, it\u2019s not gold or silver.",

                "reviewText": "Update to previous review. I was contacted by the seller about my son\u2019s experience with the chain we purchased for him. They were extremely helpful in offering possible reasons as to why his chain could be tarnishing. Some I of the possible reasons I was not even aware of. The seller expressed that they wanted us to be satisfied with our purchase and offered to send my son a new chain at no additional cost, which I happily agreed to. When the new item arrived a couple of days later, I was surprised to find that the seller had also included a special cleaning cloth as well as a special cleaning solution! I am so impressed by the fantastic customer service from this seller! They not only made things right, they went above and beyond!! Excellent customer service like this is what will keep customers coming back.We purchased this chain for my son to replace one that broke. It looks nice, but unfortunately, it keeps turning black. My son has to clean it, putting it in a liquid jewelry cleaner almost daily. Not great quality. I wish we would have bought a different one.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Miabella Italian 925 Sterling Silver 3.5mm chain, and while it initially looked great and met my style expectations, I have mixed feelings after about 30 days of use. Hence, I'm giving it a 4-star rating.Firstly, the appearance of this chain is stunning. The sterling silver gives it a beautiful shine, and the 3.5mm width is just right for adding a touch of elegance to any outfit. I received compliments on it, and it truly adds a refined look.However, my enthusiasm was short-lived. After approximately 30 days of regular wear, I noticed that the chain had snapped unexpectedly. I was disappointed, as I expected more durability from a sterling silver product. I didn't engage in any strenuous activities while wearing it, so the sudden break was unexpected and frustrating.In terms of style and appearance, this chain is top-notch, but its longevity left me wanting more. While it's possible that I received a defective piece, the durability issue is something to consider. If you're looking for a stylish accessory and are willing to be cautious with its wear and handling, the Miabella Italian 925 Sterling Silver 3.5mm chain might still be worth it. Just be prepared to take extra care to prevent any unexpected mishaps.",

The chain recieved hasvery small links, no weight to it, and the words \"delicate' and 'petite' come to mind. Lol, totally not what I was expecting!! I would never in a million years expect a man to wear this, for myself I may end up keeping it because it does appear to be silver and was not terribly expensive. But this link design is made to be more substantial, kind funny looking to be so light.",

The chain is definitely real and it was worth the money",
