I'm not sure how long it will last, but if it's like other jewelry I've purchased from them, then it will definitely give you more than enough wear for the price. Just be sure to treat it well and take it off when in water as often as possible to preserve and extend the life.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this ring so that I could wear it for a few weeks and be able to adjust the size to find the right size to use to resize my wedding ring. It was perfect for this purpose, and that\u2019s why I bought a ring that was only $13.That said, I feel like I should just alert others to the fact that these \u201c14K Gold, long lasting finish\u201d rings are only $13. For the ring to be so cheap, the gold plating must be extremely thin. This was, of course, true, and the rose gold color started to rub off within about 2 weeks of daily wear. Now I\u2019ve had it for about a month, and the front is mostly silver, the back is mostly silver, and the sides as well. In addition, whatever metal is underneath is very soft, and so it also has a bunch of scratches and therefore looks dull, especially on the side facing my palm (where it obviously comes into contact with things I hold in my hands).Again, I knew what I was buying: a temporary ring to wear for a few weeks that I could adjust larger and smaller to determine a size that won\u2019t give my finger a rash or an indentation, so that I don\u2019t have to keep paying real money to resize my real wedding ring. Just don\u2019t buy this ring thinking you are getting some amazing deal on a real, lasting 14K gold ring.The reason I am giving only 3 stars is that I feel that the description stating that the 14k gold is a \u201clong lasting finish\u201d is false advertising. I guess \u201clong lasting\u201d is subjective, but I feel like any reasonable person would assume long lasting means you can wear it for at least a season. This should really be advertised as temporary costume jewelry. If you only wore it for special nights, it would probably last much longer. I do see a 60 day guarantee, so I\u2019m sure one could try and use that, but again, I felt I got my use out of the ring. Would I have liked it to stay looking nice so I could keep wearing it on another finger? Of course! But I got my $13 worth.On the plus side, they were very honest that the ring is hypoallergenic and I\u2019m guessing it truly was nickel and lead free. I have very sensitive skin (part of the reason for needing a larger ring size) and it has never bothered my skin the way a nickel ring would. The packaging was very nice and pretty, and the ring itself looks lovely when you first get it!",
