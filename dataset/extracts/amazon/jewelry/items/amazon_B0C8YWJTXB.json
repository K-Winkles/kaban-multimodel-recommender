                "reviewText": "My favorite thing about these plastic earrings other than the fact that they are plastic, is that they have different sized backings so that they can be used on every part of the ear, septum, Medusa, etc\u2026. I have been expanding my piercing size on the lower lobe piercing from 20g to 16g using a taper shown in the photo. That is the best way to expand 20g to 16g because there is less chance of tearing. And for me, since I enlarged those piercings recently, the only way to get these earrings on was by using that taper!I cannot wear any metals. So, 4 days after I DIY\u2019d the piercings, my ear was getting so not happy despite lots of saline solution that I had to switch out my piercings with plastic earrings (no metal) at that time. It was very challenging but I managed. So, if you are like me, there is hope.I did those 5 upper piercings with those cheap disposable piercing guns in 20g just 2 months ago so I\u2019m not ready to switch out my jewelry on the 5 piercings to try these 16g\u2019s. They say that you need to wait 3-9 months until the ears are fully healed to expand piercings and before switching out jewelry. So, I took these photos of my lower lobe that has been healed for years to give you an idea on the size that these earrings are.I have been expanding the piercings because I purchase these little plastic sleeves on Amazon to put on all my earrings so that I can still wear metal but without any issues of having it against my skin. So, if you are purchasing plastic because you can\u2019t wear metal, then those plastic sleeves are great.I don\u2019t expect these earrings to last forever because these are plastic fittings.However, I appreciate so much that a seller is selling plastic earrings in 16g for a reasonable price so that people like me can wear earrings.I hope that you find the photos and information here beneficial for you and good luck with your shopping.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve bought these 3-4 times now over a period of YEARS. The very first time I bought them I remember loving them. They left a lasting impression and that\u2019s why I kept them in mine when I needed more. There use to be these grooves or ridges of some kind on the gem insert that kept them very very secure.The next time I bought them, they were different. The quality was off. Some had ridges and some didn\u2019t. They looked different. The ones that were different fell out. The old version stayed in. Fast forward to now and the quality is even worse than before. At this point, I\u2019d tell the seller to go back to their original design, or stop selling them. I\u2019d also not recommend wasting money in these by any customer till the seller changes the design to the original. They all fell out of my ears while I was sleeping and while I was at work within one day. I wanted to ask Amazon for a refund, but they required me to send the product back. If I could send them anything\u2026\u2026 it would be a note in a bag saying \u201cthey all fell out there wasn\u2019t anything to send\u201d.Imagine if I used this as a lip ring and I was eating\u2026\u2026. I\u2019d swallow the plastic pieces. Glad it was only my ears.Not worth it. They suck now. Don\u2019t buy them.",

                "reviewText": "As I was trying to unscrew these to put them on, particularly the square stone ones, I twisted the top off as one would and it wouldn't come off. You have to grip the stone itself to unscrew them, and I ended up twisting the stone enough for the metal pins to loosen and dislodged the stone before I could even get the thing unscrewed. It was that tight. The length on the ones I ordered is a bit too small and they ended up being pretty tight on my lobes.Others worked okay and they're still on there. The stones are smaller than I thought, so these could be for more of an upper upper lobe kinda thing, as they look too small on my second lobe.",

Can't beat the price.After reading other suggestions, I ordered the 6mm studs for my monroe but they are too short. It went in but was very snug. I took it out after about an hour because it was starting to dig in.That being said, I'm going to order the 8mm. I think the added length will make them perfect. The jewels are shiny and nice, the push pin design is way better than inner threading, and these seemed really secure. Can't beat the price.I gave 5 stars since the length isn't really the fault of the product, just a risk you take when you don't know the exact size you need and you order online!",
