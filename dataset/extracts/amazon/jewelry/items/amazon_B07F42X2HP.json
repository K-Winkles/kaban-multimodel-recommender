I wore it for like 2/3 weeks straight showering daily and the clasp and part that says 925 Italy is turning silver. The bracket itself is pretty and doesn\u2019t turn you green though. Today I hit my hand on my dresser drawer and it broke the clasp and fell off. Brand looks nice and reputable but it\u2019s honestly kind of a cheap bracelet, for 20$ I was hoping it\u2019d last longer",
