Arrived quickly, packaged in plastic bag, no gift box so I won't be ordering as gifts which is what I'm mainly looking for. The silver is a bit brighter in tone than other sterling items I have and I don't see a 925 stamp on the pendant or the chain clasp so I'm not sure it's really stearling. Overall it's a nice piece of costume jewelry that may or may not be sterling silver.",
