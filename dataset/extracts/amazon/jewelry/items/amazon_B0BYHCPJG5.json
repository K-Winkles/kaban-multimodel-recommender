                "reviewText": "I love the idea of these because other nose jewelry gets pulled out too easy. These stay in pretty well(as long as you click it together firmly) but the ones with little stones/diamonds stick out too much, like the jewels are larger so they stick out and look really big on my nose. The flat ones however (star, heart, etc.), sit snug to my nose, but aren't my favorite as far as style, they are obviously really plane. Over all, I love this type of nose jewelry, they are very secure.",
