These are light-weight and gorgeous to boot. I do have sensitive ears, so this is great for sensitive ears. I have worn them nonstop for 3 weeks and they have not irritated my ears. At all. I have long hair but you can still see them when I pull my hair back and they are just the right size. I am petite, so the oversized earrings that a lot of people like will not look good on me and these are just the right length.I would highly recommend these pairs of earrings. They go with everything in your wardrobe!",

                "reviewText": "The Caritate gold hoops that I ordered are the more \"basic style\". One is a slightly twisted hoop while the other has crystals. I have double piercings and one of each style look quite nice together. The twisted hoop has regular backings while the crystal hoop closes on itself. I'm always a little leery about the type the are hinged, afraid they'll break while I'm trying to put them in. If this happens, I see no reason why the post can't be straightened and used as a typical earring. So far, I've had no issues while wearing them. I will react within 1-2 hours at most, and wore them all day without any itchiness. If you're looking for huge hoops, don't order these. These are a little smaller than a penny, which is a perfect size for me. Currently, the regular price is about $14 but the sets are on sale for about $8. There are 5 different combos to decide between, or at this price, order one of each set.",

                "reviewText": "Earrings that look good, without being gaudy - a cool concept. The earrings are very pretty, with a slight shine of gold, without being glitzy. They are costume jewelry, to be worn casually, but they are intricate enough to be interesting. Their size (right around 3/4-inches in diameter) is just right to be worn as single-earrings, or as part of multiple-earrings in each ear. As the picture shows, the two pairs of earrings are quite different from each other, yet both could be worn at the same time without clashing with each other, particularly if a pearl or colored stone earring was put between them. They have the metal backs that my wife prefers.",

I did notice the back kind of poked me a couple times, but it was barely anything. They just were flimsy like they bent when taking them out and then the post would bend super easily when putting them on and taking off the backs. I like them and two for $12 is a good deal but just know they won't last forever",

Sometimes product descriptions state \u201chypoallergenic\u201d for something that really isn\u2019t, but I was so happy that both pairs turned out to be just as described! I am knocking one star off only because one of the gemstone earrings came bent at a staff which made it impossible to get inside the latch without bending it further.",
