Her commitment to remain true to her one-of-a-kind vision has afforded Betsey continued success in an industry known for its fickleness. Her ability to change with the times while keeping her designs pure has not gone unnoticed. Betsey was born in Connecticut and spent her childhood in dance classes. Her aspirations to be a dancer and her love for costumes laid the foundation for Betsey's creativity and inspiration, which is still evident in her designs today. What would soon become known as Betsey\u2019s statement look began its formulations here: sexy silhouettes, hippie inspired flowing fabrics, whimsical detailing and most importantly, a fabulous fit. Betsey Johnson, both the woman and the label, is constantly moving forward and continues to keep a strong foothold in the fashion industry with no signs of letting up anytime soon. Her love of detail and design is evident in everything she does in life and in business. Her enthusiasm, creativity and boundless talent that have kept her at the forefront of fashion for the past 45 years will keep Betsey going for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I am officially in 'obsession' with Betsey Johnson earrings! this is my fourth pair and so far, I have not been disappointed at all. This pair is even more beautiful than pictured. I'm a teetotaler but I'm totally loving this champagne serving. Sturdy, beautiful and shiny, real attention grabber. Cannot wait for the right occasion and the right outfit to launch them. Not too small or big, exactly the size I love. Please do not hesitate to buy, this pair is a keeper! Thank you Betsey Johnson, you have a new fan:)",
