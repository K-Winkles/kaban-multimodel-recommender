See pictures attached to this review. I must reiterate again how this set of U-shaped earrings are of high quality for it to be 14k gold plated jewelry. PAVOI makes me feel like I just bought an actual pair of authentic 14k gold earrings just by the look and feel of this set. \ud83e\udd79 I am loving every piece of jewelry I have received from this seller. I have to mention again that it came beautifully packaged- in a pretty box that would be ideally giftable! I really appreciate the seller for the outstanding detail of the packaging for all of their jewelry- thoughtful and caring. Thank you, once again. \ud83e\udef6 These earrings are comfortable to wear and I love the U-shaped design. Last but not least, I love the blue color enamel- another pair of earrings that are sophisticated and elegant. \ud83d\ude0d With that being said, I 100% recommended getting this set of earrings.I have finally found my favorite brand to get my jewelry on Amazon. A brand where I can 100% trust their quality on all of their jewelry and the fact that their price is unbeatable! I look forward to purchasing more jewelry from this seller soon and I highly strongly recommend purchasing your jewelry from PAVOI! You won\u2019t regret it! \u263a\ufe0f",

I took away one star as the hoop could benefit being just a bit larger to accommodate anyone with a detached (i.e. larger) lobe. The bottom of the hoop on the inside touched the edge of my lobe. Definitely adds to any outfit, especially in a work/business casual environment.",

They dip a little lower than a classic huggy earring, which I really like! They are lightweight and don't feel like they are weighing down your ears at all. The way the earrings are made, it ensures that there's nothing poking you in the back of your head behind your ear. You can wear these even while you sleep and have full confidence and comfort. :-) I chose the white color option, I'm not much of a bright color girl, and I really like that they can go with basically anything I wear \u2013 quite the versatility!My Star Rating Rubric:5 \u2b50\ufe0f - Perfect! Love it! Product exceeded my expectations.4 \u2b50\ufe0f - Great! Like it. Nothing wrong with it - met my expectations.3 \u2b50\ufe0f - Okay-ish. Not quite what I expected/hoped it to be. Some issues with product.2 \u2b50\ufe0f - Not ok. A product I will not re-order or recommend to others. Major deficits.1 \u2b50\ufe0f - \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d Product dysfunctional.

                "reviewText": "When I opened the box, it was obvious these earrings are well made. They are nicely polished and the enamel is even. The posts are an adequate length, nicely soldered, and stamped \"925\". The latch backs work well and are easy to use. They are lightweight and comfortable. However, they are quite small, approximately 1/2\" long, 1/8\" wide, and 7/16\" deep (measurement from front of earring to back). I do wish I had not chosen pink because that color tends to blend in with my natural skin tone, making them more difficult to see. They do have a dainty presence.I believe the posts are sterling silver. From a careful reading of the website it appears the rest of the earring is likely a base metal with white gold plating. That said, they are quality earrings and I will enjoy wearing them. PAVOI is American owned.",
