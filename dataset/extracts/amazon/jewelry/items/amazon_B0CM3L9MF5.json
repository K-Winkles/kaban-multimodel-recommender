                "reviewText": "Bought specifically for the crystal hoop. It took a few orders to figure out my size. The 18g crystals were too small, hardly any sparkle. The 20g had more sparkle. I started with a 8mm size but too tight, then 10 mm was too loose and moved around. I ended up with the 9mm in the 20g. See my pic to compare your nose size and your placement of the piercing. I wish the crystals looked more sparkly from further away, but closer you can see the stones. The clasp is easy to open and close, but stays shut even when showering and sleeping.Edit: ultimately I decided not to wear the ring because I felt it did not give enough sparkle. No fault of the ring, the 20g size just doesn\u2019t allow the crystals to be big enough. I can\u2019t really get a bigger gauge because it wouldn\u2019t fit through my piercing. I\u2019m back to a stud.",

The clasp on these nose rings is not noticeable at all but one side can open and the other side is screwed on. I was very impressed with the blending of the screw into the nose ring because it's barely noticeable and I cannot feel it. The clasp does not open that much but it is enough to wear the nose ring. I highly recommend getting the gold color nose rings because the silver ones look more like a great and are not too shiny. There's nothing special to these nose rings as they are very simple and are just gold and silver hoops. The smallest size is about half an inch in diameter and the largest size is about 1 inch in diameter.",
