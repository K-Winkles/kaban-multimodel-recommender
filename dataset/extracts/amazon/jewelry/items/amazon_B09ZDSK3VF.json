                "reviewText": "All of them were super cute. I got them for my daith and to replace my nose hoop. Husband helped put the daith in and it was hard to click. 8mm are smallest and had to use tweezers to click closed. Couldn't get fingers in to click it closed. The nose ring took forever to click closed. No matter how hard I pushed it, it wouldn't click closed. I noticed some of them took hardly any force to click closed and some took much more force. You get what you pay for, pretty much. I like that you can hear it click so you know it closed. I'm happy with the purchase. They look super cute in and feel comfortable. They don't hurt and I have super sensitive skin normally so Im glad these aren't doing anything to my piercings so far. Had them in for 3 days in now and still nothing bad. Put one in my mom's nose piercing too and she has even more sensitive skin and she's doing really good with it. She absolutely loves hers and says she had gotten a ton of compliments in just the first day of wearing it.*UPDATE: they are pretty comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Leave my daith in all the time and no irritation or green on my skin. Same with my nose hoop;no irritation or green on my skin (I wear these in the shower a lot). Only thing I have an issue with are the clasps. They are hard to click closed, and my one hoop has a clasp that is easy opened, so it falls out of my nose a lot, especially when i blow my nose. Great purchase for the price though and quality. I've gotten many compliments since wearing them",

                "reviewText": "I got these for my ears and they fit just right for me. They are a nice feel and weight. They look really durable and have had no skin or metal turn green yet. It been a couple weeks now and it's still going good on that front. I also have sensitive skin, it has not acted up at all.They click closed loudly, so you know it's closed. There was one that was a bit hard to close but it has not opened by itself and all the hoops came in hoops. I saw some complaints that they got some squished and luckily all mine where perfect. The package they came in was nice it came with a little booklet on the story of the company and how to care for them. Discreet package for delivery not in a bulky box just a black mailer. I love that the store puts size info on the listing. I would 100% get more from them if I want more in the future.Bit over a month update!!They are holding up really well. I have had no green skin or green metal yet. Only thing is the rose gold platings around the hinges is starting to rub off where my ear touches it. Iv kept them on all day and night and still doing grate. I would get more stuff from them in the future.",

The reason behind the low rating is the misleading quality of the jewelry. It's not stainless steel and it will turn green after a couple of days. If you're super sensitive, this may not be right for you.",
