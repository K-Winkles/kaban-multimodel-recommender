I have a picture showing what it looks like in person. It\u2019s still pretty, just not what I expected. It was also a bit smaller than expected, but that\u2019s ok. Our niece will still like it, it\u2019s just not as pictured.",

The back is polished nicely and just as beautiful as the front. i love the minimalist design of the hexagon stone on the thin gold chain. The attachment points are very delicate and almost invisible, which is rare on jewelry at this price point. The gold tone is attractive.",
