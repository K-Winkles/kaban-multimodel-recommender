I really like my paperclip figaro bracelet as it was a perfect match to the necklace gifted to me by a close friend. The 14k gold plated was what I thought would give it longevity for everyday wear, I was wrong. This bracelet was one of my favorite jewelry pieces for everyday wear... but after several months of wear, the gold plating has already begun to fade \ud83d\ude2d.

The only thing I will say is that I would recommend not wearing it ALL the time. It will tarnish over time. The gold on my bracelet has started to wear down a little bit.",
