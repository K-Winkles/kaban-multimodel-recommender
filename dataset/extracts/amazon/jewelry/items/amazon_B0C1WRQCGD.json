They\u2019re a little awkward to put in at first but once they\u2019re in they\u2019re secure and don\u2019t need constant tightening like I felt my other rings did.",

So that was a no.But I could not for the life of me unscrew the stars once they were on. It was a massive pain to get the threads to line up to put them on in first place but that\u2019s body jewelry(Still better than fighting a captured ball)But I couldn\u2019t get them loose without hurting myself and it\u2019s not like I used pliers to tighten them on!I gave up and left it in, went to work and then it promptly vanished after blowing my nose once. I found one of the stars on the floor later in the day but the ring has yet to resurface.Probably cursed.",

Unfortunately when it came to unscrewing one of the hearts, the screw part broke and basically got stuck in the nose ring... I couldn't even use a different screw part in there because the opening was completely blocked. I wasn't expecting something high end, but I never thought it would break the second I opened it. And to top it all off, the black one, the color came off the second I put it on, and then took off. So then I tried to use the other nose ring.... and none of the attachments fit. Probably pass on this listing, because it was pretty faulty and won't last you for very long.",
