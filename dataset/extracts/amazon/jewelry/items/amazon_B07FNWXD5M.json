The size of the beads are the size I would want because I\u2019m a small petite women. I think they\u2019re 1mm maybe even 2mm? Beautifully made highly recommend. I\u2019ve been looking for this exact bracelet for the exact price. Hopefully I will find an identical one that\u2019s 14k gold-but for now this one is perfect! I hope this lasts long and is durable like my other gold filled jewelry!",
