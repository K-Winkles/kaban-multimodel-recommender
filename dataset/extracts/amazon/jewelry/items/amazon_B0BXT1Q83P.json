                "reviewText": "I ordered the 14k gold plated ring. I read the reviews and I concur, it\u2019s a great ring. I love knock off styles of this particular designer who is sooo expensive I can\u2019t justify buying it for myself, never mind the thought of having it lost or stolen. This type of costume jewelry is right up my alley. I don\u2019t have to worry about cost, insurance or expensive repairs. Although I do keep a few favorites as precious pieces - they are not worn around the clock and I\u2019m careful not to shower or use powerful soaps/cleaners or lots of lotions when wearing them. Been doin this for years and get many compliments on them. So, I\u2019m not sure about the 18k vermillion gold ring, but the 14k gold plated has two things I absolutely love: it\u2019s a tapered ring where the back band sits minimally in your palm (which is much more comfortable for me). And, it\u2019s very lightweight and not clunky and not too thin with a solid inner lining (which is rare, most inexpensive rings are hollow underneath). Recommend highly. Looks like real high quality crafted jewelry for sure at fraction of cost. And way better than most other knock off pieces I own. Lucky for you to come across these! Can\u2019t find better in any local stores.",

                "reviewText": "This ring goes with every outfit perfectly! I got the yellow gold version and it is definitely more yellow than gold. I do not sleep or shower with any rings on so mine is lasting a long time and not turning my fingers green or tarnishing; but just in case I lose it, I\u2019m seriously considering getting the vermeil-plated version so that I always have a backup. Get it, you won\u2019t regret it!UPDATE: I ended up ordering the vermeil-plated version so as to have a ring that will last longer, and while it is more of a golden tone than yellow like the plated version, it is also hollow! The plated (cheaper) version is solid and feels heftier. I am very disappointed that the more expensive vermeil version is hollow. It feels cheaper. Do yourself a favor and get the cheaper plated version, and just be sure to take it off before washing your hands so the plating lasts longer.",

Only downside is that it is starting to turn red and is tarnishing, but maybe it's because i'm wearing it daily (in the shower, to work, daily activities). Definitely take it off before doing things, it lasted a good time before it started tarnishing.",
