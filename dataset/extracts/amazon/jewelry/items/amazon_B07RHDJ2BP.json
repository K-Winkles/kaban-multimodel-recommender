She took the on a trip to Europe which included boats down rivers to several countries - a lot of small towns, sightseeing, dress up dinners. She found them to be versatile and always received complements. I was a bit nervous because she's usually a yellow gold person but let's face it Turquoise is rarely - if ever in yellow gold settings.

I have to give 5 stars though because of how really good it looks. When I first took it out of its packaging I was worried but putting it on it doesn\u2019t really matter because you can\u2019t even tell it wasn\u2019t an expensive set! It has an antique- esk look and it\u2019s not heavy so it doesn\u2019t weigh down on my ears or feel super heavy, it\u2019s actually a plus.Additional information:The plastic metal was not formed well because I cut me but it\u2019s only on the necklace, the earrings are perfect.",

Normally I'd just give these a good review for being pretty and go on with my life, and you CAN go ahead and consider this a good review... with a caveat. I would be remiss if I didn't ding the seller / manufacturer over the fact that the earrings were attached to the hook backwards. I either have to take time out of my life to re-hook them or wear them with the hook facing out instead of in. :/",
