                "reviewText": "I love the way this company delivered it. Seems like such a small thing, but that alone can make or break the product, literally.You get a cute pouch and your earrings wrapped in bubble wrap. Each earring is exactly as seen in the advertising photos and looks to be good quality.I\u2019ll come back in a month or so to review how the earrings held up; whether they broke/bent easily or tarnished.I wouldn\u2019t say these are giftable just yet because Amazon jewelry doesn\u2019t have the best track record (one of those you get what you pay for scenarios), but who knows. Maybe they hold up well! For yourself, they\u2019re definitely a cute gift though just because of how cute the earrings are",
