The stones are clear and and good quality as well. The sizing is a tad bit snug. I ordered these to wear on my ring fingers and I'm a true 6. These are a bit snug, so if you're not comfortable with tighter rings I suggest getting the next size up. Overall, I really like these and particular when it comes to my rings. I highly recommend.
