Although the company recommends taking jewelry off prior to liquids, such as, skincare, showering, swimming, etc; but I am lazy sometimes, & yet, no issues. The gold looks good-not fake. There pieces are solid gold or filled. This ring is filled. Very smooth and comfortable to wear. Simple yet elegant looking. The stone looks decent and is placed in the ring real well. Glad to have this in my collection. Highly recommend this piece or any piece from Pavoi.",

This ring is so comfortable to wear, and the shape and weight of the piece is perfect. The CZ itself is a great size, the drawback is that the setting is shallow and enclosed, so not enough light passes throught to set off the stone, making it look more like cut glass than a CZ.",

The gold color is very flattering and looks real without being overly yellow. The stone is well-cut with many facets and sits nicely in the band. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the stone in my ring looks slightly yellow. There is a pale yellow hue to it and I'm not sure if it's because of the stone itself or the glue used to attach it to the band. It doesn't look perfectly clear to me.",

                "reviewText": "So items from this brand have been hit or miss for me, some items look more authentic\u2014some look artificial and lack sparkle/quality. I am happy to report that this ring delivered in every area.The stone is sparkly, and not too dull. It looks like it could be a real stone. The size is perfect, too, since it doesn\u2019t look gaudy or flashy. It also makes the ring look more real, since it is very understated.I LOVE the thick band style! If I ever get married (lol), I will want a solitaire like this, since it is so incredibly comfortable. Usually rings in this style are designed for men, and as a result\u2014are too wide or thick. This domed ring is just perfect.I like it so much that I ordered a second one in a slightly larger size (in case my hands are swollen and cannot wear it on my middle right finger, as I plan).The other area that impressed me with this ring, is that the primary material is not specified or disclosed. Typically this is because it is a less quality item (either copper, brass, or steel). I was worried I would have an allergic reaction, since I am incredibly sensitive to cheaper metals\u2014but I have had zero reaction so far, hoping it stays that way, since I love the ring!!Could not he happier with this ring and it has made me second first writing off items made by this line.For the price (so affordable!) get yourself one ASAP. \u263a\ufe0f",

I feel like a broken record, but I really do rave about the quality of Pavoi. Before I was chosen to be a member of Vine, I had bought three pairs of my own earrings from Pavoi and absolutely fell in love! I was shocked that such reasonablely priced jewelry would be so high quality and pretty.But about the ring! It's so simple and elegant. The single Marquis stone is pretty and shiny. I like how it's set into the ring, so it's completely flush with the band. The band is thick but very comfortable! You will definitely notice this!It truly looks like white gold and a diamond or white sapphire.I saw a review that said it looks cheap. I absolutely disagree. I can't speak for what the yellow gold option looks like, but the white gold is stunning.I can't recommend Pavoi jewelry enough, seriously. Every single piece I have from them is beautiful.This ring is no exception. I haven't taken it off since it arrived!\u2b50",

                "reviewText": "The band of the ring is pretty, sized correctly, and seems well made. However, the stone lacks facets and this causes the stone to show shadows and dead spots at all angles. This can happen with marquise stones, but the listing photos show a fully faceted stone so I hoped that it would not exhibit dead spots in person. If it was a colored stone the shadows may not be as noticeable, but with a clear stone it looks like a defect. Unfortunately, I do not see myself wearing this as the shadows really cheapen the overall look and are distracting.",

Very disappointed in the stone though. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve received cloudy/dull stones from pavoi. I\u2019ve actually purchased pavoi rings before, thinking they would be nice quality, and even on a free/vine review item, I am still disappointed. I\u2019ve returned the ones I\u2019ve purchased before, because I felt like they weren\u2019t worth the money spent. But seeing as this one was free, I will keep it. Just be aware that you\u2019re likely to not have quality stones when you order from this company, seeing as 4/4 rings I\u2019ve gotten from this company I\u2019ve returned\u2026 such a shame because I truly love the style. If you purchase from this company, make sure it doesn\u2019t contain stones, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve worn it all day and my finger hasn\u2019t turned green, so there\u2019s quality in the metal at least. I\u2019m sure their necklaces/bracelets/stacking rings/earrings would be fine quality.",

And every piece that I have is a nice quality weight - substantial enough that it doesn\u2019t feel like you could easily damage it. This ring fits true to size and it doesn\u2019t spin around on the finger. I do like the clear marquise stone that\u2019s embedded in the top of the ring, but I do wish it was a bit more faceted, to sparkle more.
