Despite the affordable price point, the quality is evident, and the earrings exude a sense of fine jewelry.The flat back design is not only stylish but also ensures a comfortable fit. I appreciate the attention to detail, from the secure post closures to the overall durability of the earrings.Having worn them for extended periods, I can attest to their comfort and how well they retain their luster. The PAVOI Stud Earrings have become a staple in my collection, offering a perfect blend of elegance, quality, and affordability.

I don\u2019t have arthritis or any hand issues, they\u2019re just tough. I can get one side on easier than the other but it took some time. I tried adding a plastic back piece but earring is too short. On another note, I\u2019m sensitive to earrings and jewelry, I get itchy or red and this pair does NOT do that to me. Overall I am happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Pictured on my earlobes are the 2.5mm gold ball (2nd hole) and the 3mm cubic zirconia gold stud (first), both Pavoi.Great for the price. Holding up well, even in the shower. No irritation even for my super sensitive nickel-allergy skin. The back is flat but a somewhat thick disc compared to the ultra thin stainless surgical steel backs you get at a piercing studio. It works and doesn\u2019t poke my head which is the main selling point, so does the job.My earlobes are chunky but these don\u2019t squeeze them too tightly. Wish the post was slightly longer for more wiggle room but not a deal breaker.",
