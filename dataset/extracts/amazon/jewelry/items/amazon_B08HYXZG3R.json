I did not want to re-size them, because I'd lose diamonds if I did. I purchased this inexpensive ring in a size 5 to wear on top of my other bands, to prevent them from slipping off. It's gorgeous and matches perfectly with my other rings. It looks to be the same quality, and it does not turn my skin green like other cheap metals. Highly recommend.",
