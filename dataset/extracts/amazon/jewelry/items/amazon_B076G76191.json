                "reviewText": "I really liked my necklace. I've always wanted some dainty opal jewelry - but I never wanted to pay the price. I purchased the blue/green opal with silver hardware a couple months ago. I've gotten plenty of use out of it with no problems. A feature I also like is the amount of adjustable loops on the back for the lobster claw hook to attach to. You can change this from a choker look to a longer necklace. I don't wear it every day but I haven't noticed any dulling or tarnishing.There were a couple reasons I decided to give this four stars. First, it doesn't feel very high quality (but it's cheap and I don't expect many people should be feeling your jewelry) and -at least the color stone I got- the stone looks...not natural. It doesn't look bad, but it's obviously not real. I think perhaps the white would look a bit better, but there's nothing wrong with the blue/green. Something else I rated it lower for was that it actually wasn't dainty enough. I know some people thought the chain was too small and broke easily but I haven't had the same experience. I have a couple other necklaces I switch out every day and I noticed this one probably has the biggest chain. As long as you're not pulling on it and getting it caught (or pulled on by a baby, etc.) constantly - it shouldn't break on you.Overall, I recommend this. A variety of colors, designs, the adjustability, durability, and cheap price means there's something for everyone. If you're debating on it - just get it. It's well worth the $12-ish.",
