I\u2019ve worn mine and didn\u2019t feel too old at all; in fact, I received compliments. They come in a pretty and tiny box, easy to use for travel or keep when not wearing and makes a nice presentation for gifts. I was surprised how pretty and the price was rather nominal. If I had girls in my family, I would buy one for each of them. They would make the sweetest valentine ir stocking stuffer or any little sweet yet special gift. Looks expensive!",
