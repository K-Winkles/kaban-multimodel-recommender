Probably not advised but I wore it to the gym under wrist straps and lifted pretty heavy and it withstood that just fine. It doesn't pull at the hair on my arm either. 10/10!Only wish they offered this in a 2mm or 1mm as well! The 6.5 inch fits great and usually tennis bracelets are way too big for me",

I bought the vermeil tennis bracelet, for $50 I believe it could have a better clasp, but for this price point I guess it makes sense it\u2019s not the highest quality as compared to ones sold at actual jewelry stores. This would be cute for daily wear!! I think this is such a cute basic for anyone!! I attached pictures of packaging incase someone was wondering what it was like. I also attached a video of how to use the clasp since some reviews said it was hard to figure out!!",

Eg it got knocked around pretty bad. Since then have worn it for again on and off for about 1 month.Pros -Sturdy - bracelet never fell off. Stones are all still there. Clasp is really strong* con on this laterSparkly - very sparkly. Decent sized stones too. Looks real almost. I have noticed slight dulling over the course of the 1.5 months.Wear / tarnish - the outside still looks really good. *the inside where it touches your skin has tarnished and is revealing a bronze color. I don\u2019t mind since you can\u2019t see it.Does not turn skin green or at least not meDidn\u2019t really catch on my clothes so the prongs seem to be well made.Cons- it\u2019s hard to put on and take off. The clasp is SO hard to pry open especially if you have fake nails be careful of chipping a nail- again it does tarnish. Don\u2019t expose it to water, lotion, soap, etc.Overall, highly recommend. Maybe more for short term use due to the tarnishing and dulling OR for special one off occasions. It\u2019s really pretty in person and reliable.",
