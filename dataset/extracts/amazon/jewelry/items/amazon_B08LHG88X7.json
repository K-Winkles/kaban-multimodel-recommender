                "reviewText": "I'm very impressed with this ring.As a ring: it IS stamped with 925. i've only had it for a few days, but my skin tarnishes fake jewelry very quickly, and this ring has not discolored nor has it turned my fingers green -- I do not remove it to wash my hands, but I don't shower with it on. Sizing is as expected. Quality of the design is MUCH better than expected!! I'm shocked that the seller uses such a poor quality photo. I had trusted review photos, which look much better, and I'm very glad I did. The product photo makes the design look \"smudgy\" and lacks that crisp edging, but the ring is much better than the seller photo makes it seem (as of 11/11/19)As a spinner: This is where I dock my one star. Unlike most of the 1 star reviews that find difficulty making the ring spin, I find difficulty in making it stop. I can very easily spin it. I can use the thumb on the same hand or even the sides of my nearby fingers. It makes a small noise when it spins, but if you spin slowly and with more control, the noise is so quiet that I don't think it's loud enough to notice in a classroom or meeting. My biggest complaint with the hyperactive spinning is how loud the ring can be in random activities-- it makes a \"rattling\" noise when I, for example, tap my ring finger on a flat surface or open and close my hand. Obviously, how loud the rattling is depends on how fast im moving that finger. Even as I type, I can hear the ring moving. I can live with the rattling and spinning noises, but I do worry that it is so loose that it will fall apart as some other low-rating reviews have experienced. If that does happen, I will update my review.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the bottom ring and returned it because it was snug. I usually wear a 6 and it will be slightly loose. The 6 I received was too tight and I sent it back. I ordered a size 7 and it fit fine, but it was the wrong ring. I received a replacement and loved it. My daughter and my nieces are also fidgeters and loved the ring. I ordered one for each of them. Unfortunately, I received the wrong ring several times. As you can see in the photo, the one on the bottom is the one I should have gotten. The other three were sent in separate boxes with the same serial number. I sent them back and received one ring which was the wrong ring and two of the other rings were the wrong size, but were labelled with the correct size. Quality control is on permanent holiday at this company. If you can get the right ring in the right size, it is nice. Hopefully it spins freely too! Some of them didn't spin well at all and it was work to get them to move. It should not be work to get a fidget spinner to move. One hand should be mindlessly spinning the ring while the other hand is focusing on the work that you're trying to focus on. That's the ideal for all ADHD fidgets in the end, isn't it?",
