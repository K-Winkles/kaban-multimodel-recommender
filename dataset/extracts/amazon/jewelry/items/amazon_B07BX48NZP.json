The symbol features eight directions, symbolizing the many paths that can be taken. Now has seen this Norse symbol take on a more metaphysical belief. It is seen as a powerful charm for those who have no direction in life. The Vegvisir is believed to provide you with the guidance you are seeking and helps you make the right choices for your life. It\u2019s also a reminder to the wearer that on a spiritual level, they will always be guided through the twists and turns of life and constantly find that safe harbour back to themselves as their spiritual home. The Vegvisir is similar to the compass, in that it symbolizes safety and guidance especially during travel.",
