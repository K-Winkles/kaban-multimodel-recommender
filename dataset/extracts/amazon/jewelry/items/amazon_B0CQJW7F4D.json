                "reviewText": "When I saw how beautiful this necklace and pendant are- and how wonderfully packaged- I thought this item would make a great gift for a very good friend of mine who is like a sister to me. For a long time I wanted to give her something that said how much she meant to me and when I saw this pendant, I knew it was the one.While some people may get it as a gift with a particular person's birthstone in mind, green colored stones are a favorite of her's and mine- but not a month of birth that is important to us (meaning the stone won't commemorate a birth month). However, not all jewelry stones, I think, have to signify important dates and births- some you can just get because they will look good and because you would like to wear a stone of that color- or someone else would.What I liked best about this pendant and necklace was the double heart and how the words, \"I love you,\" were very visible. Not all jewelry inscriptions can be seen and read this well. Also, how some of the heart has diamonds and then- plain sparkling gold (over sterling silver). There is a card included with the box and jewelry care instructions- that you can also fill out and give with this gift.A great item and perfect gift for a loved one in your life- also, if you like it yourself- it's gonna look wonderful around anyone's neck! Please check out my photos of this \"gem of a find\" and if you have any questions about it- feel free to reach out and ask me!Thank you",

                "reviewText": "I recently invested in the 925-heart pendant and necklace as a gift to my wife, and it has proven to be a stunning expression of my love. I like the sterling silver construction of the necklace for me it not only ensures durability but also adds a touch of timeless elegance. I feel what sets this necklace apart is the customizable birthstone feature. Being able to personalize the pendant with my wife's birthstone added a unique and sentimental touch. I love the overall design and detailing of the necklace are simply amazing. While the price was bit higher than expected. I feel that despite the slightly higher price, the emotional value and sheer beauty of the necklace make it a treasure.",

                "reviewText": "The females in my famile are hugh fans of birthstone jewelry. My sweet cousin, who is like a sister to me, was born in October, the same month as my mother. So, when I spotted this twisted heart shape necklace on the Amazon site, available in the October birthstone, with the unique feature of having the words \"I love you\" engraved on the side of the heart, I decided to order the necklace. The twisted heart is a nice size at approximately 1\" across measuring from the widest point from side to side. The heart pendant is just a bit shy of being 1\" from the top of the heart to the bottom. The chain is fairly substantial and drops to approximately 10\", but can be shortened to about 8.5\". You can also switch out the chain to a more substantial one if you would like to do so. The month of October has two birthstones; opal and tourmaline. This pendant has the tourmaline birthstone. Per the description provided by the seller, the heart pendant is 925 sterling silver, which means it is 92.5% silver mixed with additional metal(s) designed to improve the strength and durability of the overall product. The pendant and chain are a rose gold color, making them quite attractive. The sizable pink tourmaline stone is set towards the bottom of the heart and really stands out against the rose gold color. This 5 star ensemble includes a jewelry box, a cleaning cloth, a gift card and instructions for the cleaning and care of the necklace.",

If you are giving it as a gift, you might want to open it up and remove the plastic. It also comes with a little gift card, a cleaning cloth and care instructions (see my photo). Apart from the plastic, it is a nice presentation. Looking at it up close, I had some issues with the quality, mainly edges not as smooth as I\u2019d like. The middle stone is very sparkly. It looks nicer in the product listing photos than it does in person. The lettering on the pendant in particular looks nicer in the product listing. It has a cleaner, crisper font than the one I received.Overall , it is a nice necklace and would make a nice gift.",

If you are going to be gifting this to someone special make sure to open it up and remove the plastic so it seems a little classier.
