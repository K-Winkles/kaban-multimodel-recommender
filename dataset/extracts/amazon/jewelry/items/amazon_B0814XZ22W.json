If possible, clean after every wear to remove any dirt or other signs of daily wear. *A lint-free cloth is a special type of cleaning cloth that does not release any fluff.

It must be strict California standard but hmmm.... Actually, I've asked about it at a Swarovski store at a mall before I ordered this on Amazon, and the store clerk didn't know about cancer harm or anything (it's Florida here.) and said only that it was plated with pink gold. This sticker is the reason for 3 stars. Otherwise, it could have been 5. But I can't find any cancer related articles about pink gold or rhodium with my quick search. I might keep this but hmmm...",
