These flat back earrings are exactly what I was looking for. They are beautiful, comfortable and easy to wear. And I love the price! I definitely recommend them!Things to be aware of: I did need a little help screwing the back on and the posts are a little bigger than your average earrings, more like studs that you pierce your ear with.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for post earrings with a back that covered the end of the post so that I could leave them in all of the time. My one earring hole keeps \u201cclosing\u201d up on me because I don\u2019t wear earrings all of the time. I wanted something small and comfortable. These were perfect. The only issue I had was trying to get the backs on the earrings - they screw on and are super tiny. It took me a good five minutes or more to get the back on one earring! I think they could be slightly bigger so they\u2019re easier to grab and twist. Otherwise, these are perfect!",
