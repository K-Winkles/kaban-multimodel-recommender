I wear it in the shower everyday, and it hasn\u2019t dull yet. If it does, I usually use toothpaste and brush to clean it, and it becomes sparkly again.Size 5 fits me perfectly. Usually, I\u2019m between 4.5 and 5, and I\u2019m glad I ordered 5! It didn\u2019t rotate around my finger. It\u2019s almost too hard to take it off. I wear it with my other ring, and you can really see the size different. Great price, good quality.",
