I ended up wanting a spacer ring so it would be more flush. I love Pavoi and have multiple pieces from them so I knew the quality was good and I was excited to see their spacer ring had stones to add some sparkle to the set. It looks so perfect! I even sent it to my BFF and asked how much she thought I paid for my new band and she said minimum $250! I highly recommend getting this ring!",
