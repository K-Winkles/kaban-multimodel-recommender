It looks great with my real 24K gold earrings and I love it, especially with it being my current birthday month.No tangles. It's easy to adjust up/down depending on wearing preference. Easy to put on and take off. I love daintier jewelry so its a perfect thickness for me.",

So far the stone seems in well, maybe the fixed the issue since last those reviews. I also have mostly real 14k and 18k gold earrings and rings I wear so I was nervous about it looking fake when placed near them. It doesn\u2019t at all. Some fake gold has that too gold too shiny look but this has the deeper gold hues that my real gold has. Wanted a dainty necklace for daily wear and this is perfect and the price can\u2019t be beat.",

It would be a great gift, if you repackage it and you don't need it to be delivered on time. Prime what is happening to your delivery time? You're failing. Other than the delay in shipping this product would get five stars.",

As with any costume jewelry, this necklace is not to be worn while you're working out, bathing, swimming or wearing perfume near it. I wipe it every few days with a damp cloth and dry it carefully. I have several pieces of Pavoi jewelry, and all have exceeded my expectations in quality and value.",
