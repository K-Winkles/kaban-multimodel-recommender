                "reviewText": "I love these earrings. They are so cute and perfectly sized for my ears. I have the upper portion of my ear (cartilage) pierced and I am always looking for fun and cute earrings to change out from time to time.I do my own piercing so I tend to start out with a smaller gauge. After about 6 months I will go up in size of the gauge. These are 16G so they are about average thickness. There is a nice variety and they are small enough to wear with any outfit and not be gaudy. As a suggestion to anyone who are new to the Helix (or the same area in the cartilage section of the ear) if you are going to lye on the ear you just pierced, either use a barbell type earring or a huggie sleeper hoop. It hurts really bad and it will take forever to \"heal\" if you use a stud earring or an earring that has a piercing post. Had I known that prior to doing my first Helix piercing. Make sure to twist your fresh piercings as well. The cartilage heals so fast that you really have to really be quick if changing out the earring.However, this pack from Briana Williams is sure to go a long way. There are plenty of earrings and styles in this packet, you wont have to wear the same one for long. They are not gaudy and can be worn with any outfit or uniform",
