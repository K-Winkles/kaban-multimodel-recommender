                "reviewText": "Love the size, I got the 70mm. I have very long hair and wear it half up (top bun) half down flowing. These earrings look so good with my boho global style. I LOVE the way they swing and move - they are not stiff and stuck in one position. They look expensive. They are shiny silver and look like sterling 925, I think they are sterling plates, not sure. Anyways, they are not at all stainless steel with the gray tone silver and overly shiny, they are bright silver and look move like a pair of $300 James Avery sterling hoops. Not sure how a smaller size would move and sway, but I would think they would perform nicely. These sit straight forward and do not turn out to the sides. These are fantastic quality. If something changes, I will update this post review. So far so good - exactly what Ive been looking for, for the price point.",

They look much shinier in the pictures advertised. The earring is a graduated hoop. It's thicker near the bottom portion of the hoop. Although they do have some weight to them, I would describe them as lightweight which is a good thing.",

They are a definitely a great purchase. 10/10.",
