I wear this usually on my right hand but when I don\u2019t want to wear my engagement ring and wedding bands I wear this on my left. I rose gold is so nice and the stones are absolutely stunning. Of course the photos never do any justice but in the sun it\u2019s like it\u2019s real! I always order from pavoi and I\u2019ve loved them since day one when I ordered my wedding bands from them. Nothing I own from them has ever tarnished but of course with time and wear it isn\u2019t as shiny as day one. I have noticed that if you take care of it and don\u2019t wear it while cleaning or rough handling, the jewelry stays in pretty good condition. I will say I am more of a fan of minimal jewelry so that way it doesn\u2019t feel a thick on my skeleton hands but this one doesn\u2019t bother me as much. So just a heads up if you have a sensory think about chunky jewelry. I love this ring and I want to wear it on every finger!",

I heard RAVING reviews that swore up and down that they don\u2019t tarnish despite the fact that they \u201cliterally never get taken off.\u201d Well I do take mine this ring off when necessary such as when I\u2019m showering, washing my hands, etc. But I have still found that it has tarnished quickly after purchasing. Could I just somehow have sweatier hands than every other girl here?! I don\u2019t think so. I think the quality is just not there. I bought a set of 8 rings for the exact same price as the Pavoi ones and they have not tarnished despite having the exact same amount of wear time. Just very disappointed with the brand overall.",
