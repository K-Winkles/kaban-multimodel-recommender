The whole thing is silver/white, that's as sparkly as it gets.I literally just got it tonight and she hasn't seen it. It arrived in a plastic baggie, in this pouch, in another plastic baggie. I transferred it into a more presentable box. No tangles in the chain, nothing broken, no missing jewels.I'm definitely going to update my review in a few months.
