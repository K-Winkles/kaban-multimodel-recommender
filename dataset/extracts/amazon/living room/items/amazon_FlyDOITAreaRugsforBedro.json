The color, texture and everything matches perfectly for the holidays but if you have a lot of traffic or kids it captures a lot of dirt and it's very hard to vacuum. My lightweight handheld vacuum as well as my robot vacuum was not able to collect the dirt but this could be because of the \"fluffy\" hairs. Also washed it and hair and dirt (crumbs) were still captured in the hairs.",
