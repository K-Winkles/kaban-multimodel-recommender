                "reviewText": "This is a great little table. Shorter than I expected but that's my fault for not looking at the height measurements closer.I needed to free up some desk space and wanted a narrow side table to park my laptop on while I worked (my desk already holds 2 large monitors and a Dell Mini).When it arrived I was surprised at how small the box was. It was super easy to put together, less than 10 minutes tops. It has a beautiful looking finish I do like that it actually fits nicely Under my desk which not only frees up desk space but also floor space.The bottom shelf is a bonus for me. I decided to purchase a sleek little file holder for that space. It works perfect.",

These were a good deal for 2 and are good quality for the price. Easy to put together (lots of label stickers) and lightweight enough to move them around when needed. Not sure I would trust a lamp or a vase on them but they do the job for a water bottle, remote, cup of coffee, etc. Cat for scale and cat approved!",
