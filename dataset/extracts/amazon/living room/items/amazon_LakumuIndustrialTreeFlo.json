It went together very easily and quickly and is a very attractive lamp.The first problem was the bulbs were too bright. They glared at us across the room. The one beside our chairs cast shadows. We had two pole lamps we were replacing with these but the glare was just too much.We decided to try other bulbs because we liked the light fixture so much. We went with a 250 lumen, cool white bulb. It was waaaay too dim. We went with a 450 lumen, soft white bulb but the glare was back.We very sadly boxed both fixture back up to return. If it was in a room that was only used occasionally it might be fine. We wanted to put them in the room where we are all the time. We read, work on computers and I do needle handwork and we just couldn't handle the edison bulb glare without a shade to diffuse the light. Made me very sad they didn't work for us.",

As you can see you from the pictures it feels like it should sit taller. We did go purchase some 3W Edison bulbs as the ones that came with it were a bit bright for the space.",
