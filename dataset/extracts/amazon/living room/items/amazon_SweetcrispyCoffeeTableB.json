As there are few predrilled holes it's easy to put something into the wrong hole and you're stuck. I had to personally drill extra holes to 'fix' a wrong move, so the top isn't perfectly secure but looks fine.Recommend as long as you're okay being frustrated with the building and recognize the lower height - once done it looks and functions great and is a great price for what you get!",

However, the arms that lift the top are not that sturdy, and opening and closing are not as easy as it seems,NOTE: Tt has sharp corners (not safe for households with children).",

                "reviewText": "The table was easy enough to put together, a little confusing at some parts. The color is nice and the feel of the board is sturdy. Not as tall as I thought it would be after measuring my old table for comparison (more than once). Going to buy adjustable feel for the legs. And the legs would be my actual complaint, in the directions it says solid wood legs and they are plastic which kind of throws the whole look off (if you're paying attention) My guests won't notice but I will. And the lift top itself is a little wonky. Doesn't glide up with ease, worried about this for the long run. It's fine for the $55 I paid for it and I got it delivered earlier than expected....you get what you pay for!",

The person who sells this sent the item past my expected due date, Amazon adv that if I didn\u2019t get my order by 10/6 I could get a refund . The table was shipped out on oct6 lol when I finally did get it I went ahead and put it together . Instructions are easy. Some parts you might have to stare at the pick to get it lol but it\u2019s fairly easy just tedious. The lift part of the table works great , you\u2019ll have to really pull to get it to lift but once you get it up it goes with ease. It\u2019s the part on the side with no lift that I had issues with . I can get it to lay straight. Also some screws on the bottom didn\u2019t want to screw in the wood. I ended up just taping it on lol they were screws that didn\u2019t really apply to the foundation just more of a filler I would say. But yea as long as you don\u2019t care about shipping time for the price it\u2019s worth it I guess",
