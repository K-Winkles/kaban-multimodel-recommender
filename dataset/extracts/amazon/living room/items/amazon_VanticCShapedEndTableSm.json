Extra screws included is thoughtful in case one rolled away or something. The fake wood looks good, with wood grain texture even. Hey no rings will ever mar it. The pouch thing is slim, room for only 1-2 magazines or files which is good (no piling up). Other little pouches good for phone, glasses, pens, password book sized stuff. Better than a shelf that could be bumped with wall mounted pouch under it that I\u2019d overfill. A 4\u201d slimmer top would have worked for me, preferable even, but this one is less wide than any others I saw. Price is right and came fast.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to stack three stereo components on it. They fit perfectly, but if I gave it a push, I was afraid that I could tip it over as it was top heavy. Yes, it could probable hold 60lbs, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you have kids or pets. I repurposed it for something else. I ordered another piece of furniture for the stereo stack. If you have a small lamp and an alarm clock radio at bedside, it should work fine.",

And now I dont have the frequent search for my tv remote which always seemed to disappear between my sofa cushions. And there is still space to rest my arm between the table top and sofa arm. Couldn't be happier with this purchase and definitely recommend. And the assembly instructions are very easy to understand and follow.",

I love that I can neatly tuck this table under the couch and it\u2019s just the right size to set my drink and book. The side pouches for the remotes helps with not losing them. I bought for my mom and will be buying one for me.",
