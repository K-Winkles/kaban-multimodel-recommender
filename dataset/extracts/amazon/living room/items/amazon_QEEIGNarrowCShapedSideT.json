For this price point they are actually quite good looking & well made! Easily put together with the directions ! Nothing was damaged when I received them & they even slide under & over my bed so if I\u2019m in bed & messing around on my laptop I can put my mouse on it or a drink or whatever! Same goes with the couch! Just very versatile small tables! Highly recommend!",

Just a nuisance to start assembling the product and to find wrong parts. Then have to go through the entire process of re-packaging and returning while waiting for a replacement.",

I like the fact that the tables can be placed in the middle of a couch with their \"C\" - shape form. The directions were very clear. This was the first time I assembled furniture - so simple! There were just enough parts - not a multitude of extra screws (Yaaa) I did not use the bottom screw in circular feet - but appreciate the option. The tables are a light, be aware they could be knocked over by small children or dogs - *BUT* that comes with all things that include dogs or small children. I am very happy with this purchase.",
