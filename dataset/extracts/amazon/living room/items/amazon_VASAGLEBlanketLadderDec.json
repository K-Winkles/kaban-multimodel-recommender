                "reviewText": "I never ever leave bad reviews on anything but this is just awful!! I got this one because a lot of the comments said it was easy to assemble. And a lot of picture reviews I saw made it look like it was good quality, especially for the price point. It is not. It took me 2.5 hours to put together. And the side bars are uneven, it sits crooked against the wall. Most of the rings don\u2019t line up right. The stickers used to label each piece do not come off easily and leave residue and white paper on the pieces. So once put together, it\u2019s covered in sticker pieces and glue that I cannot get off. I\u2019m very upset with it. It looks very cheap and I wish I would have gotten a different one, but there is no way I\u2019m gonna take apart to return it at this point after fighting with it for 2.5 hours just to set it up.Only positives about it is that once you put blankets on it, you can\u2019t see the sticker pieces that badly. And they provide extra pieces in the box which is nice to have on hand. But overall, don\u2019t waste your money on this one.",
