                "reviewText": "Okay these lights are pretty darn cool but there are some things that could make them better and some things you should know-- why? because the instructions are just meh.First, the package states that it has 3 rolls of the LED lights. Mines came in one. You can separate them and add the extra connectors that they've provided. Don't connect them immediately. Unravel the strip and put the USB into your tv. This will allow you to see where you want to place the light strips for the best effect. This is important because it will make the difference. The instructions for my 46 inch says to wrap but I actually placed mines on the sides of my tv. They aren't as discreet but you can only see them when you walk really close to the sides. This gave my tv the best lighting because my tv is mounted pretty high. I can't stress this enough because if I had placed the strips similar to the instructions then I would have thought these weren't bright. Everyone's tv to wall ratio is different.This may be common sense, but also install while in a dark room or dim lighting. Top of the morning is not going to give you the true effect of what it may look like and thus you may place the strips too far back on the tv or too far up depending on your wall to tv alignment.Once you've decided where, add the connectors one buy one leaving the end strand without a connector. I also kept the lights plugged in (idk if that's safe) to make sure that all of the lights were lighting appropriately. Glad I did because one of the connector strips didn't work and effected the light output. The first strip was pink, the other strips were blue. If you attach the adhesive first, then you will have to pull off, risking the strength of the stickiness, to put back on correctly. It's doable but not worth the hassle.The brightness adjustment on the remote matters. So I bought this because I wanted the pink light-- and solely the pink light. When I had the brightness all the way up, I could not see the different colors. I thought it was defective because even the pink color looked blue (which makes sense given color spectrum etc). So, make sure when you turn on the remote that you dim the brightness as much as possible so you can see all the colors.Now it's time to remove the adhesive! My adhesive was pretty darn good. The USB part also has an adhesive part. Make sure that you place the USB and adhesive to wear it is easy to pull out without messing with the adhesion (will make sense later).It is BRIGHT y'all. There is no \"dim\" feature. What I mean is although you can adjust the brightness, you cannot adjust the volume of light. By adjusting the brightness you are adjusting the color's brightness (ie from dark pink, to hot pink, to light pink) and not the light's strength/intensity. I thought i would be able to adjust the strength for nights that I don't necessarily want to feel the vibe but no. A minor flaw but I have a diffuser with a LED light so this doesn't necessarily bother me but may bother others. It's also $14 (at the time of this review) so I mean I couldn't ask for more.Here's what I DO NOT LIKE. There is technically no \"off\" position for the lights if your tv is on. If you turn \"off\" on the remote, the lights go red. It isn't until you turn the tv off (or power source) that the lights completely shut off. You can also take out the USB cord to cut the lights off while still keeping your tv on. This is why it's important to place the adhesive part of the USB cord where you can easily remove without having to mess up the adhesion. This is honestly minor but good to note when installing as to make sure the position of the USB is easily accessible and/or to appropriately place the lights for 24/7 viewing.All in all-- the product is great. The price point is great for what you get even with the \"off\" situation. The quality is also great. The color variations are great, as well. A couple reviewers stated that the white is not white but rather a blue and this is true. I would buy another just for keepsake-- that's how much I love them. It is definitely a vibe and elevates any room, any watching experience.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this TV light strip for over a year and a half now, it\u2019s survived a move from South Carolina to Washington state on the back of our tv and being handled by countless movers, and still works flawlessly. Changing the color behind our tv to kinda fit the vibe of the show/movie we\u2019re watching us a really fun touch, and the light being the tv honestly helps with my eyes feeling less strained since it\u2019s a nice gradual light against the wall.But what made me write this review 1.5 years later, was the customer service. One of my dogs got ahold of the remote to change the lights (she didn\u2019t swallow the coin battery, thank god, just chewed up the edges). So after almost 2 years of having these lights, I no longer had a way to work the remote. I was bummed and considered just taking down the lights but then decided to give customer service a go. I emailed the email account they provided asking if they would be able to send me just a replacement remote. They replied within 24 hours asking for a shipping address. They didn\u2019t ask for any payment for the remote, question anything, and were very polite.Just 3 days after sending the email, I just got my new remote in the mail!!! It connected to my lights right away, and now I can continue using them.AMAZING customer service and because of that, I would buy from this company again. Thank you!!!",

                "reviewText": "What I DON\u2019T like:It came with corner connectors so you can cut it on the dotted lines where needed and add corners, but the directions said not to cut it. I believe it said \u201cNEVER cut.\u201d Soooo we ended up with funky corners (pictured). I would have cut it and used the connectors it came with, but the directions said not to and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it and be out the money for it. It\u2019s also not as bright as I\u2019d like. In these pictures (one with the overhead light off, one with the overhead light on), the brightness is all the way up. That\u2019s as bright as it gets. The brightness is very underwhelming, but the color covers enough space I guess. It barely covers outside the perimeter of the TV, but it works. With the LED lights around the walls, these are almost unnoticeable. It was also hard to install without cutting, because I had to figure out how to get it all the way around without blocking the HDMI ports. I ended up just doing three sides of the TV instead, because I couldn\u2019t even use the corner connectors to make some corners to go around the HDMI ports. Instructions were also very lazy and unclear. There\u2019s pictures, but virtually no words. It does, however, list the warnings\u2026. Like don\u2019t cut the lights.What I DO like:It is very sticky. I unstuck and restuck several times during installation and it still stuck great. I like that it changes colors, you can pick the colors, and the remote seems to work very well. MAKE SURE you leave the receptor hanging towards the bottom though, because the remote does not work unless it is pointing directly at the receptor. If you have the receptor behind the TV, it will not work.For my seven-year-old\u2019s room, it works. He\u2019s thrilled to have it. But if it were for my room, I\u2019d go with a different brand honestly. I like them, but there are way more cons than I\u2019d like.",
