The application is pretty straightforward. If you have a larger tv I know that you put the lights a little closer to the center of tv. Other than that pretty easy. I used gorilla black tape to just reinforce the ends that don\u2019t have the adhesive. One thing I do have a complaint about was peeling back the paper from adhesive, it was not cut right so you could not feel where to pull off the paper backing, so what I did was use some gorilla tape and taped the paper part to pull off and separate from the sticky side, if you\u2019re not careful you will pull the whole thing off. Just be careful. The remote is a little confusing to work but you get it after a while. Overall rear lighting and makes it easy on the eyes.",
