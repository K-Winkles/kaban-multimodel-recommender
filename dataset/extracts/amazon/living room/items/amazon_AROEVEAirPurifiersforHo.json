            "Efficient Particle Filtration: AROEVE air purifier utilizes a HEPA filter that can effectively filter out particles such as smoke, pollen, dander, hair, and more, potentially improving air quality and promoting better health and well-being for you.",
            "High Circulation Rate: With dual-channel and 360-degree air inlets technology, AROEVE air purifier refreshes the air per hour in rooms up to 215 ft\u00b2 / 20 m\u00b2, covering every corner of the room to promote better health for you.",
            "Low Decibel Operation: AROEVE air purifier operates quietly, especially when the sleep mode is activated, which reduces the fan speed to the lowest setting, effectively eliminating any noticeable sound. The filtered air noise is as low as 22 dB, making it ideal for creating a peaceful and relaxing indoor environment while still providing effective purification.",
            "Enjoy Fragrant Air: It features an aroma pad located below the air outlet that allows you to add 4-5 drops of your favorite essential oil (not included). As the purifier circulates fresh air, the fragrance spreads throughout the room, creating a pleasant and healthy environment for you and your family to enjoy.",
            "Notice: To ensure the health and safety of you and your family, our AROEVE air purifiers are equipped with a 2000-hour cartridge replacement reminder. Once the purifier has been in use for more than 2000 hours, a red indicator light will turn on to remind you to replace the filter cartridge. For optimal performance, we recommend replacing the filter cartridge once every 3-6 months. (Note: The voltage of the air purifier is 120V and is suitable for use only in the United States.)"

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for an air humidifier that is relatively small and is not way too expensive, this is the one for you! I was looking for one because I have two cats and a litter box, and the fumes from litter boxes are not good for your health. I did not want a huge one, because I have a small living space, and this is perfect. I have had it for a few weeks, and I can tell there is a difference in the air quality! Sometimes I would walk in and I feel like it would smell musty, but since having it I have not smelled that at all! I also used to use a small diffuser for essential oils, but this purifier has a place where you can put essential oils and I have not used my diffuser since. This air purifier is amazing! I would recommend it to anyone with a litter box or just anyone wanting an air humidifier. The only reason I would not recommend it is if you are wanting it to cover a whole house. It works perfect for the camper I live in.",

The look is sleek and the lighting mode is perfect for a night light, you can turn on one light or both lights and they are nice looking. The fragrance spot is handy as well. I've not ventured to get scents to test out so I'm not sure how powerful the scent release is. I had a left over pine scent oil that I put in it but it's not much of a scent. The size had me worried when I unboxed it but the power is really impressive so I don't regret this purchase at all. Would buy again!",

                "reviewText": "To make a long story short, I have new neighbors who are avid Mary Jane smokers, and my townhouse always ends up smelling like reefer when they light up. I bought this to help with the stench, and it works pretty well for small rooms\u2026like my bathroom, where the scent tends to be really strong due to the ventilation system in the building. I found that it didn\u2019t work as well as I\u2019d hoped in my bedroom, which is about 150 square feet. Since it claims to filter up to 215 square feet, I thought I would be good to go. I decided to keep it anyway and just use it in the bathroom, but I did end up ordering a larger, more powerful unit for my bedroom. If all you\u2019re looking for is mild scent removal and decent air filtration, this one might be just the thing for you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s powerful enough to really filter the air in a 200 square foot (or larger) space.",

It\u2019s crazy the amount of dander and dust this thing sucks up. There is a sleep mode and it\u2019s insanely quiet but I actually run it on mode 2 nonstop and have no issues sleeping, it\u2019s easy to get used to.",

I couldn't wait to plug it in and see how it worked. Within 40 minutes my apt was so fresh and clean NO odors. I'm sold. I've mentioned this one to several neighbors. The price is excellent too. Comes with extra filter. The size is perfect for top of a side table and it's whisper quiet. Even on the highest setting I now sleep well without odors. Love this product!",

This works great for my room, until someone opens the door. Then it's like the unit has to start all over again. So I was hoping when I bought this that it would solve my problem. What I didn't realize is that I need to buy I guess 2 or 3 bigger units, so the whole house's air can be purified to where when I open my door the one I have will work. Then I can't help but wonder what will happen when one of the doors to the outside are opened. We have no pets, so that's not a problem, the only one I see is dust. I'm hoping I can talk to someone about how many units I would need to solve this problem. A whole house purifier on our furnace is not an option. So I try now to keep my door closed as much as possible. The problem is not with the unit. It works great & I really like how easy it is to use.",
