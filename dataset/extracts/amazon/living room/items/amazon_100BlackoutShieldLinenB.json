In the pictures, it looks like more of a blue-gray to me. But in real life, they are a true gray with no blue. But luckily they still match my room so I\u2019m keeping them. Just be aware :)",

They\u2019re pretty easy to install and you get two options of hanging them for different looks. The color was a bit warmer than I wanted but I still think it looks great. My only two complaints are that they came with a big black stain on them and that they are insanely wrinkled and removing the wrinkles is very hard. Because of the thickness of the curtains, a steamer won\u2019t cut it. You need to take them down and actually iron them.",

                "reviewTitle": "Beautiful Total Blackout Curtains - brand name dupe!",
                "reviewText": "These blackout curtains are beautiful and look like the same material as the ones from Pottery Barn, West Elm and other high end stores. I bought the oatmeal colour to compliment our BM Revere Pewter bedroom walls, and I am super happy with them as they have different thread colours in the weave with good texture. They are a true oatmeal colour with no grey or pink tones. They were a bit wrinkled out of the package, but I popped them in the dryer for a few minutes (be careful, though, as the label says not to do that) and then ran a warm iron over the fabric side. This removed most of the wrinkles and the remaining ones should fall out with time. I am a shift worker so having a dark bedroom is key, and these curtains provide 100% total blackout for our east facing bedroom. I purposely purchased rod style mounting to prevent any light sneaking in at the top as it does with grommet style curtains. The only thing I'll do now is update our actual curtain rod to one that bends towards the wall to allow the curtains to be flush with the wall at the sides. The back is light grey, and even though the packaging says the backing is rubber, it is soft to the touch and doesn't make noise when moving the curtains. I absolutely love these curtains, and they have elevated the look in our room. NOTE - I purchased four panels total to cover our large window, so there are two panels depicted in the room photo.",
