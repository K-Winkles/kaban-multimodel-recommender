                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the wine-red plush rug runner for my home, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Not only does it add a touch of warmth and comfort to my space, but it also serves as the perfect decorative accent.The soft high fluff material is incredibly inviting, providing a soft and comfortable touch that is perfect for lounging or even sleeping on. I absolutely love the feel of it on my feet. I especially appreciate that it's free from any unpleasant smells or shedding, making it safe for both my family and pets.Upon receiving the rug, I followed the instructions to spread it flat and allow the fluff to recover \u2013 and within just 2 days, it looked as fluffy and inviting as ever. The 2x6 feet size is ideal for various rooms in my home, including the bedroom, living room, and even my daughter's room. Plus, the solid color design adds a touch of elegance that effortlessly complements any decor style.What impresses me most about this rug is its durability. The 1.8-inch pile, memory foam, and dotted bottom are seamlessly constructed, ensuring that it stays firmly in place without damaging the floor. I have wood floors, so it keeps my feet warm, and I no longer have to worry about slipping or injuring myself while walking on the rug.Cleaning the rug is a breeze as well. I can easily vacuum it for a quick clean or use a moistened towel to wipe away any local stains. For a deeper clean, follow the suggestion to hand wash it with cold water and hang it outside to dry, ensuring that the color and softness are preserved for years to come.Overall, I highly recommend the wine-red plush rug runner to anyone in search of a cozy and stylish addition to their home. It's the perfect blend of comfort, durability, and easy maintenance, making it a must-have for any living space. It won't disappoint. Get it and let me know how you like it.#TA217 - A customers review you can count on.",

The padded bottom isn\u2019t too thick and it stays in place, but is also easy to move if I need too. It is light and super easy to wash- right in the machine and the dryer! A great product for classy decorating on a budget.",
