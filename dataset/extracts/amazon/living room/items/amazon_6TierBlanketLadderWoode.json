                "reviewText": "I don't know what I was expecting with this. It comes in a small box and you have to built the ladder. It doesn't seem super sturdy. We had been looking for a blanket ladder at multiple places. My wife wanted this white one though. For a little more you can get a blanket ladder assembled and study from your local stores. The ones we look at looked better and of better quality. This one gets the job done, but I wish we would have spent a little more and got a preassembled ladder from our local stores.",
