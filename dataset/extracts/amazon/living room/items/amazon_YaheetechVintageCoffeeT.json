                "reviewText": "I'm 71 years old and not as spry or bendable as once was. This table is sturdy, attractive and well designed. It looks and works just as depicted on Amazon. Packaging was strong enough to fight back from normal FedEx shipping processes. 'A' grade.I had 3 issues assembling - all age related. First was getting the 64 pound box into the house. Second was installing the last 2 legs. Either the directions are wrong OR I simply assembled them incorrectly. After a few minutes, decided to disassemble and swap parts between the 2 sides and issue resolved. Third was assembling the top to the spring brackets. Instructions say to install brackets to top first. But I had no help so opted to do the opposite. I got it. 'A' grade all the way!All holes for everything were perfectly aligned and of proper size. Used a handheld screwdriver and even at my age and arthritic hands, was able to screw them in comfortably. The person(s) that designed the assembly process should be rewarded quite honestly. Bags of hardware were mostly labeled and all wood pieces were labeled. Nicely done! 'A' grade.Instructions were just OK. Pages were not in order but may be because there are two versions so the bottom shelf can be at 2 different heights. I give these a 'C' grade.Hope this review helps some folks not used to assembling their furniture. Again, Kudos to people who design for do it yourselfers and to the manufacturing company that kept the tolerances to design!",

                "reviewText": "For as cheap as this was I wasn't expecting much but I couldn't be happier. Very high quality, looks nice, and was not that difficult to assemble. Granted I have put together plenty of this stuff before but it only took about an hour and I did it with no help. I was expecting it to arrive damaged but to my surprise it was packaged very well even had corner guards on the top edges. Wasn't a single mark on it. Only suggestion would be for the legs there are a total of 8 holes, 4 are used and 4 are not. They give you wood colored stickers to put over top of the 4 unused holes which leaves the other holes exposed. Just send 8 stickers so there are no exposed screws.",

                "reviewText": "Finally got this put together by watching a YouTube vid. The PDF instructions that come for this... I'm not even sure if they were for this item. LOL!Now that I have it together:PROs:- Great for small spaces. My apartment is under 700sf & the living room takes up half. This table looks great, plus I can store all kinds of stuff to keep things looking neat.-- The black one is gorgeous. Very high-end (or at least not cheap) looking.CONs:-- Mine came with a blemish. Looks like a melted burn??? Thankfully, it is on the far underside & not visible.-- The black one is a fingerprint magnet. The surface is easy to clean with a soft cloth but...-- This might be my assembly but the lift-top tends to be a bit loose. When I lift the top, one side wants to move easier than the other. I will have someone tighten things up later. I didn't have a drill so I used hand tools.-- I thought this was missing parts & had holes in the wrong spot. Nope. That was just bad instructions & diagrams. I bet a lot of the reviewers who thought parts were missing saw those bad assembly notes. By the way, the instructions don't come in the box (mine didn't). I had to access a PDF file shown somewhere on the product page.As much as I love this now that it's assembled, I would not have bought it if I knew the hassle it would be.",

The manual doesn't have words but if you don't rush it and look at the details of the pictures you will have no trouble building it. It's a sturdy and beautiful table. The only thing I'm not a fan of is that when rising the table top, it doesn't rise straight together. You have to use both hands on both ends to get it to come up together otherwise one side may rise a little more than the other side, giving it a wobbly feeling even tho that's just how the table is. Great table to eat on and play games on. My games and books are stored nicely and it's overall great quality.",

When we eat, we can pull the coffee table close and push up the extendable tabletop - its' great! Love the color.Building it was a PAIN. I'm not that handy, but I definitely took a wrong turn with the directions somewhere, so just take it slow and cross check everything.",

The instructions were clear and easy to read. Great table for the price. If you're short 5\"4 like me this is the perfect table, when it's lifted it doesn't hit my knees. My daughter 5\"7 hits her knees on it. Other than that I can't complain. It's very sturdy.",
