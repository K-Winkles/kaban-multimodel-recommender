Also, I thought the beige one would have the RGB capability but I guess I looked at a different color lampshade. But that\u2019s okay! The lamp itself is a little wobbly/not that sturdy. The lighting itself is really nice though, I love being able to dim it and change the temperature of the light to warmer or cooler! I also like that it has a remote. My main complaint though is the smell of the box/product itself. I\u2019m not sure what the company uses to package these, but I absolutely hated the smell! Otherwise, I\u2019d probably purchase a second one for my bedroom lol. But for now I\u2019ll just keep the one in my living room.",

I picked the lamp out and was excited for the remote control dimmable and timer features because I\u2019m a big in bed reader. However, with the Fresh triple A\u2019s that we temporary borrowed from our tv remote, the lamp remote did not work for us at all. It is pretty disappointing since this review is being written on the day of receiving in the mail. Hoping we can get a replacement remote. Will update if so! ~AYUpdate: Got the remote working now and we are really enjoying the lamp! The hues are interesting, (there are about 3 versions of green it seems), we\u2019re adore it!!!",
