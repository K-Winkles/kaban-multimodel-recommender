                "reviewText": "I absolutely love how these shelves look in my office and are currently holding all of my Funko Pops, books, and some decorations! I can say the installation was a bit easy, all I did was place the supports in the middle of each angle and screwed them into the wall. I did use a stud finder just to make sure I wasn't close to any wires in the walls, and I used a drill instead of a screwdriver only to make the process quick. I didn't use the drill full force and did not over tighten only because it can break the shelf itself. Also, make sure the supports are facing the correct way as said in the instructions because some of mine are in the inside or the outside, which I don't care personally since they still look good, but definitely pay attention. I'm thinking about getting more for another room because of their slim width, but they can sure hold a ton of stuff!",
