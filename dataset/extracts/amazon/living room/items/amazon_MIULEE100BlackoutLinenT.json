                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Super happy with these 52\" x 90\" blackout curtains in the ivory color! They're very well made, great quality, and the color is perfect. I was hoping they wouldn't have any yellowish tones (as some beige/ivory fabrics do) but they don't. Just a nice, crisp, neutral color. They're thick, and block out the light very well. They're a bit heavy so make sure you have a strong curtain rod. Mine didn't come too wrinkly, so I'm not going to be ironing them. Plus, I'm lazy. I'll let them settle and the fold wrinkles should work themselves out. I also bought these in copper brown but didn't like the color so much (not for this room anyway). They were darker than I expected. But I'm thrilled with these and going to buy more for my living room. 10/10 happy with this purchase!",

Haven\u2019t had time to paint the master but I knew exactly what shade of grey curtain I wanted. My boyfriend sometimes works late, which means he sleeps late. He needed black out, I needed something that looked nice. These were great! 10/10 black out quality. Nice weight- slides on the rod nicely and looks top dollar. Hope to order more for other rooms as we continue to renovate.",

This one does not suffer from any of these problems. It should be mentioned that you should heed their advice and get a heavier curtain rod, these are definitely heavier than some of the other products I have usedIt's not cheap compared to some of the other items but provides great value",

                "reviewText": "I love the color and the faux linen look. It definitely darkens the room and the color is true. They are a little short width wise for my window and they do not block all the light, but still works well. Taking away one star because the seller doesn't seller doesn't have anything slightly bigger!The backing is kind of rubbery and seems to help with the heat from what I've noticed. Upon hanging them up there were some wrinkles which I'm sure could be washed and dried away. I used a handheld steamer and it sort of helped, but I don't care about the wrinkles too much.Overall great purchase and recommend them :)",
