I didn\u2019t realize it at first, but the bags of screws have numbers on them if you can\u2019t tell from the picture which your using. The board for the portion that hides the outlet is the only part I needed some help with. I had to have someone hold it up until the screws were partially in, then I could hold it with one hand and screw in with the other.Feels sturdy and looks nice.",

Easy to assemble and a good price! Plus I especially love that it has the built in outlets to better hide cords! I bought cheap little baskets at Marshall\u2019s to put on the shelves and I think it totally tied the look together :) They also have great customer service!! One of the pieces of wood had a crack through it and I contacted the manufacturer and they got back to me the same day and resolved the issue super well!",
