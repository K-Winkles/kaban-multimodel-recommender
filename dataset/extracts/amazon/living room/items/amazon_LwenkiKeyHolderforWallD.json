                "reviewText": "In my household, we own four cars and consequently four keys. My family and I would leave our keys on the counter as we used them, leading to occasional misplacement. My mom kept asking me to look for a key holder on the internet. I finally began browsing the internet and decided Amazon was the best bet in finding something that would get here quickly, was affordable and good quality. I stumbled on this one and I thought it was cute so I began reading the reviews that were mostly positive! I decided to purchase it. I had high expectations, some that were met and some that unfortunately were not. At first glance it looked perfect- just what we were looking for. it was visually appealing, the hooks and the screws seemed sturdy as well. It was the right color and size, perfect for the space that we wanted to mount it on. but as I unpacked and read the instructions to set it up I began encountering errors that left me discontent.There\u2019s two main pieces, the key holder and then a second piece that was shelf-like but I was not able to put the pieces together because there were missing screws and pieces. I tried to attach the shelf to the main piece by tightening the screws into it but I wasn\u2019t able to because the screws were too skinny so they just kept spinning. It was extremely frustrating. There were also drywall anchors and an L shaped screwdriver that were supposed to be in the box but of course those weren\u2019t present either. My first thought was to return it, but we improvised and mounted it without the shelf and used the leftover screws to stabilize the key holder. While it wasn\u2019t ideal, and we would've enjoyed it more with the shelf attached, it was still able to serve its purpose and we continue to use it.In conclusion, I will definitely not be buying from this seller in the future. I was disappointed by the missing components because It\u2019s a great product but the missing pieces really turned me off. If you don\u2019t have the right tools, I would not recommend you buy this and encourage you to explore alternative options that would satisfy your needs and wants.",
