I am not sure what the shelves are made of but they almost seem like a balsa wood, extremely cheap and really lightweight. The color seems fine, and the mounting screws are a meh not the strongest. When I built the wire rack shelf, you can't tighten the screws too tight as they will strip because the wood is such low quality.They look fine just remember they extremely light duty and cheap.**Update!The company did reach out and offered a refund because of my review. I am not going to take the refund as I did pay for them AND they are doing the job as intended. I added a star for the support and the offer! I applaud the customer service!",
