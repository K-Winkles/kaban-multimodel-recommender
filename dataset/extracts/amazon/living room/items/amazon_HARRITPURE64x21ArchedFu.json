                "reviewText": "Overall I really do like this mirror - perfect size, love the thin frame and the oval shape. My gripes about it are about the stand and the angle in which it leans back. The stand feels a bit cheap and doesn\u2019t fold up flat behind the mirror - however if you decide to use the stand, it is NOT crooked when in use (which is why it\u2019s annoying to me and part of the reason it loses 1 star but still has a 4 star rating). The other issue I have is the degree in which the mirror leans back - I feel like it leans back too far for the size of the mirror. I wish this had different degrees and angles to which you could adjust how far back you want to lean the mirror pending on your preference. For my use - I ended up leaning it against the corner of a wall and more upright than the actual stand intends and it works great but I do worry it\u2019s a little unstable ! However other than those 2 issues - love the aesthetic, price, and overall quality of this mirror !",
