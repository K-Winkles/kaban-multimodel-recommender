I was actually thinking about replacing my carpets but then I was like I can save it for another time because this was a quick and easy fix. I cannot be happier if you\u2019re thinking about it, go ahead order the rug.",

If you you are looking for something thick and soft this is not for you. It is made with some kind of duck/canvas material and thin. I put a rubber waterproof floor pad underneath to protect wood floors. Had on of our dogs vomit on it already. It was dry by the time I found it when I returned from work. Cleaned off the large debris, used a toothbrush and some Dawn, cleaned up beautifully. If you are looking for something attractive and are a pet owner would recommend.",
