            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cI want to stay in the pages of this book forever. . . . Whimsical and swoony with unmatched banter, you\u2019ll be rooting for Will and Annie from the very first page.\u201d\u2014B. K. Borison, author of the Lovelight series About the Author Sarah Adams is the author of When in Rome and The Cheat Sheet. Born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, she loves her family and warm days. Sarah has dreamed of being a writer since she was a girl, but finally wrote her first novel when her daughters were napping and she no longer had any excuses to put it off. Sarah is a coffee addict, a British history nerd, a mom of two daughters, married to her best friend, and an indecisive introvert. Her hope is to write stories that make readers laugh, maybe even cry\u2014but always leave them happier than when they started reading. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One AnnieI am convinced dating was created by an evil villain to torture humanity. Dramatic? Not in the least. For introverts like me with social anxiety, the process of dating is equivalent to waxing yourbikini line. Menstrual cramps on day two of your cycle. An emergency dental procedure you weren\u2019t expecting\u2014and guess what: they\u2019re fresh out of novocaine.\u201cAgain, I\u2019m so sorry about the beer,\u201d I say to the man sitting across from me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says in a clipped way that means it\u2019s absolutely not fine.This is not going well. Not that it has ever gone well for me in the past, but this time it really isn\u2019t. I think turning a man off in the first ten minutes of a date is my new record. Because John, the man sitting across from me with a sopping-wet, beer-stained polo and khakis from the drink I accidentally knocked across the table onto his lap, looks ready to bolt. Can\u2019t blame him.Why did I think I could do this? It\u2019s been years since I dated, and even back then I never liked it much. I\u2019m a person who avoids attention at all costs. Who can\u2019t think of a single thing to say when a man sitting across from her is intently staring at her. Again, I ask myself, Why are you here, Annie?! Oh right. It was the brownie. Well, first it was the realization that even after opening the flower shop my mom had always dreamed of, the nagging something-is-missing feeling still pesters me. So I decided it\u2019s time to put a plan in motion to settle down with my perfect someone\u2014because that\u2019s the only box left unchecked in my life. And since I\u2019ve been drooling over John (the man my sisters and I always refer to as Hot Bank Teller), I thought he might be the perfect candidate for the job. The job in question has very strict criteria based on the bursting-with-love marriage my parents had. One, he must live in town and have roots here in Rome, Kentucky; two, he must have a stable job; three, he must be kind and also be supportive of my career; and four, he must want a family. Those are the only things that matter to me. So the last time I went to the bank to deposit a check, I used up my Once-a-Year Extroverted Moment and asked him if he\u2019d like to go out sometime. He miraculously said yes, and I spent the next week recuperating from the stress and anxiety I suffered in asking. Anyway, when I proposed meeting somewhere a little outside of Rome to have fresh scenery (and keep our nosy, single-stoplight town out of my business), he suggested Peppercorn, a nice restaurant about thirty minutes away. And when I looked it up, Yelp said this place has an excellent giant brownie. It doesn\u2019t get better than that. The dessert is literally the only reason I\u2019m still sitting here on this painfully awkward date. I wish I could text my sisters right now and ask them what to do. But that requires them actually knowing I\u2019m on a date, which would open me up to the sort of attention I\u2019ve been trying to avoid.The very minute my sisters find out about my quest to find a husband\u2014everyone else will know too. I would really hate to have Mabel (the woman who\u2019s like a grandma to me) attempt to set me up with every eligible bachelor she knows. So I\u2019m keeping it a secret\u2014like most things in my life. The only reason I\u2019m pushing through my terrible social anxiety now is because I\u2019m fully confident that marriage is the Thing that\u2019s missing. I wish I could call my parents to get their opinion, but because they died when I was three, that will never be an option. So instead, I\u2019m following in their footsteps. Happily married by the age of twenty-eight. That gives me just under a year to find the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Too bad I have to date first. I smile up at John, hoping that\u2019s going to lessen his annoyance at wearing my drink. But I\u2019m Annie Walker: shy, socially anxious, introvert extraordinaire who senses this man doesn\u2019t want to spend another second in my company. And that makes my smile feel like a wobbly grimace. I imagine it resembles a snarl. My nostrils might even be flaring. I can\u2019t do this. John clears his throat and tries his own attempt at a casual smile. Admittedly, his is better than mine. \u201cSo . . . what\u2019s it like owning a flower shop?\u201d He sounds bored. I want to unzip my skin and run my bones all the way to Mexico. My heart is racing, and this swanky restaurant is too loud. I don\u2019t belong here. My sisters, Madison and Emily, however, would love it. \u201cAnnie?\u201d John prompts again when I don\u2019t answer right away. Right! Conversation. You can do this, Annie. No need to clam up because the man asked you about a topic you actually like. Flowers. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. I swallow and prepare for my answer. \u201cUm\u2014it\u2019s fun.\u201d John waits a moment and then tips forward slightly, clearly expecting me to say more. \u201cReally fun,\u201d I tack on to appease his desire for a sentence with a higher word count. I would elaborate, but now the only thing swirling around my brain is the reproductive cycle of flowers (which I find deeply fascinating), but I have a distinct feeling that John is not the type to marvel at life science. So I clamp my mouth shut again. \u201cSo it\u2019s . . . really fun?\u201d he asks and I nod. \u201cWell, good.\u201d He breathes in deeply and then settles back in his chair and looks away. We bathe in uncomfortable silence. This would prompt most people to say something\u2014anything\u2014but not me. I freeze up even more. The weight of carrying on a conversation is too heavy for my shoulders. I am the quiet one in my family. The one with her nose always in a book because she prefers worlds where she doesn\u2019t have to interact with other humans. It\u2019s so much easier to read about relationships than to foster them. Less dangerous too. I can\u2019t offend anyone written into a book. I can\u2019t say the wrong thing. And book characters don\u2019t make judgments about me. When John pulls out his cell phone and starts scrolling, I realize I have to take a stab at some sort of conversation, or this night is going to be over before it starts. \u201cSo, John,\u201d I begin, and then during the next ten minutes I pretty much black out as I blabber nonstop, only regaining consciousness as I\u2019m finishing up with, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the primary purpose of the flower is reproduction.\u201d \u201cWow. Okay. That was . . . a lot of information about flowers,\u201d he says with an expression resembling something close to haunted. Clearly my stab at conversation went right through him, and he\u2019s bleeding out. I smile timidly and glance around for our waitress. It\u2019s so busy in here she hasn\u2019t been around to take our order after getting our drinks. I could really use an interruption right about now. Nothing. \u201cSo\u2014uh\u2014do you at least have any hobbies?\u201d he asks. Oh geez, \u201cat least.\u201d I\u2019m already so far off his dating radar that he\u2019s looking for an at least to redeem me in some small way. I clench the fabric of my dress under the table. I do have a hobby\u2014but even my sisters don\u2019t know about it, so I sure as crap am not going to share it with this man who looks like spending time with me is causing him physical discomfort. \u201cFlowers sort of are my hobby as well as my career.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d he says blandly because I\u2019ve once again shut down any conversational avenues. Why am I like this? I need to talk. Ask him questions! Why can\u2019t I think of any? My brain is a whiteboard, polished clean. But he\u2019s tapping his finger on the table now and looking away from me. In a fit of panic, I blurt the first thing that comes to my head. \u201cI want to get married.\u201d Read more"

                "reviewText": "The author is obviously a good writer. Deft at expressing thoughts and feelings of the two characters, Will and Annie. Terrific inner monologues throughout. If I was thinking about what I would say to the author about future endeavors after this one, I would point out a few things about this one that grated a little. Just my opinion--a lot of people like the tropes and such that I find tiresome. Like those formula love stories on the Hallmark Channel. Yeah, they have their place but after you watch one, don't you sometimes think, \"are you kidding?\" The bad date in the beginning is cute, but perhaps too cute. Spilling the drink on the guy--YES, I did that. At least twice. The point of this part of the book is that Annie is socially awkward. So are a lot of people. You can be this way for a number of reasons, but being socially awkward doesn't have to mean you appear to have no brains in your head. Or be completely ridiculous. And Annie engages in behavior here that does not match up with the intelligence we see in her later. Also, the small town characters were rather one-dimensional. A petition about Annie and Will's relationship? What idiots would tolerate such an invasion of their privacy? A couple of busybodies with nothing better to do than be interested in Annie might be funny, but the WHOLE TOWN?? And the harassment by the sisters of Annie sometimes borders on mean. I didn't find some of this \"cute\" at all. But overall a fun read, just too much of the wacky country-folk. Really--is everyone over forty or fifty a voyeuristic idiot with nothing better to do? Anyway I still liked it, but I would lose the cartoonish nature of the townsfolk. And the behavior of Will and Amelia crashing the date with the Vet at the Little League game. That made me say 'Oh Brother,' and most of this stuff did not illicit the laughs I know the writer was going for. So I would say, next time make them more real. Your story is good without them. On the socially awkward part, I kept thinking about a nice, nerdy guy who asked me to dance at a party when I was in college. We were both freshmen, and I was definitely socially awkward myself, knew it, and didn't care. I didn't pretend to be anything else. This guy came over to me, and tried to act cool, using words that didn't fit his buttoned up (but nice looking) self. Examples of this were \"wanna mix it up?\" And I wanted to slug him when he called me \"babe.\" I even tried correcting him by saying, \"are you asking me to dance?\" And in response to \"babe\" I told him \"I don't answer to that. Try using my name, which you know from when we introduced ourselves.\" While I knew this guy was an engineering major, math whiz, really smart, and probably nice under this coolness act, he reminded me of Steve Martin on SNL in those old sketches of the \"Wild and Crazy Guys.\" Look it up. Video is on Youtube. I had to give up on him when he refused to be himself, even though I had no problems with nerds, even dorky ones (being one myself) as long as they could smile and laugh at themselves. I also think of him when I encounter (or write) characters who are cartoonish, stereotypical, one-dimensional, or otherwise just too fake. Revision time. Cheers.",

I\u2019ve read all of Sarah Adams\u2019 novels and have loved them all. This one is a departure. There\u2019s something different about it, a different rhythm. For one thing, after having read When in Rome, it was surprising to see how Annie really felt about herself and her dynamic with her siblings and the town. There\u2019s so much more to her than initially meets the eye.I didn\u2019t realize why the rhythm was different until I got to the second half of the book. Will and Annie are both protecting themselves for their own reasons, and don\u2019t really even admit to themselves what they want until the story gets further along. You can feel that, especially with Annie, in the beginning. She thinks she knows exactly what she wants, but maybe it\u2019s not actually what she wants or needs. These onions have layers, folks.Both Annie and Will are guarded initially, but they also can\u2019t seem to stay away from each other, so it makes for an interesting dance between the two characters. There\u2019s a remarkable mix of vulnerability and honesty while they both try and convince themselves that they\u2019re all wrong for each other. Experiencing the growth of these characters (both individually and together) was cathartic.This book is fun and lovely and warm, but it\u2019s also real. There\u2019s some angst to the characters\u2019 backstories, but it\u2019s not stressful, it only adds to story\u2019s depth. And don\u2019t get me wrong - it\u2019s not all emotions. There\u2019s plenty of humor and banter. I laughed out loud more than once (the scene at the kids baseball game really got me). Plus, I love the townspeople of Rome, Kentucky, and that we got to see Noah and Amelia/more of Annie\u2019s sisters.For those that take this into consideration, this is a closed door romance. However, it\u2019s more PG-13 as there\u2019s still some spice leading up to the fade to black. There\u2019s also some light cursing, but no f-bombs.",

                "reviewText": "Read this as a standalone without knowing there was another book. Practice Makes Perfect was deemed \u201cspicy\u201d in the reviews, but it isn\u2019t. Super cute story, loved the characters and their arcs and humor. The author is a fantastic writer. If that\u2019s your jam, this book is for you. However, I was so excited to get to Annie and Will\u2019s epic moment, even stayed up late reading, when their first time together was only *implied* rather than described. Like, are you kidding? We don\u2019t get to know what very-experienced Will is like in bed? What a disappointment. Again, cute story but I probably would\u2019ve chosen something else had I known how mild this romance was.",

This book is an amazing opposites attract romance with dating lessons that turn into fake dating, which of course turn into falling in love!I love Annie and Will, they are perfect together! Annie is an introvert, book lover, awkward, and has such a sweet heart. I actually love when she babbles and the fact that throughout this book she finds herself.Will is a bodyguard and has never believed in love but he feels an instant connection with Annie. He serious about his job but he\u2019s also very fun and is a big softie at heart. He\u2019s totally protective and has a habit of denying he gets jealous. Plus he has flowers tattoos so I think with Annie having a flower shop they are obviously meant to be. \ud83e\udd70This book takes place in Rome, Kentucky again so we get to see all the lovable and hilarious characters in the town again! This is so much fun to read and made me laugh a lot but there are some serious and sad moments that makes your heart hurt for the characters.Like her other books this is a fade to black romance but the chemistry between Will and Annie is incredible and they have many swoon worthy moments! I also have to mention the baseball game scene because I was laughing so hard!I\u2019m hoping we get more books in this world!",

                "reviewText": "**4.5-5 Stars**This is book two in the \u2018When in Rome Series\u2019 it was a brilliant, cosy and hilarious read. I enjoyed it so much that I found myself re-reading chapters for the fun of it.Rome in Kentucky seems to be filled with a bucket load of hilarious characters. I also recommend adding the audio I laughed so much about this town and the people who get so much into your business.This for me pipped book one as I fell in love with Annie, she is the youngest sister of Noah from book one. There are 3 sisters and she is the one who owns a flower shop and virtually blends into the background. Her Sister in law to be Amelia is a pop star and has requested her usual bodyguard Will to be with them leading up-to and including the weddingAnnie has never had a good date and the one she is on is no different. She is not used to saying much and cannot find the words to connect with him. Yet, she finds it so easy to relate to Will but believes he is out of her league. Will hates commitment due to the upbringing he had with his parents and their serial cheating and constant arguments making his and his brother\u2019s life hell.There are so many laugh out loud moments and Amelia her sister in law to be spots a spark between the two. So she comes up with a plan to get Will to be Annie\u2019s practice date, the idea is that Will has to show Annie where she is going wrong and give her tips \u2026\u2026\u2026Both think of it as a bad idea and then all the fun begins. What a hoot and I absolutely loved how Annie came out of her shell and how Will wrestles with himself that he will never fall in love trying to convince himself that he will finish this job and leave the town by keeping Annie at arms length. I just sat back and enjoyed the journey with the outrageous busy bodies thrown in lol",
