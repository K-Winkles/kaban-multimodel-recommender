                "reviewText": "I LOVE a good small town romance!! Throw in a good ol cowboy and I'm gone! This entire series is one I will always recommend when asked about small town romance. This is about Rhett, a 32 yr old pro bull rider and Summer Hamilton 25 yr old law school grad. Rhett has a PR situation paired with a cocky bad boy reputation and has to have basically a \"babysitter\" to keep him out of trouble with the media for awhile. Rhett's agent just happens to assign his own daughter, Summer to keep Rhett in line.Problem is, the moment Rhett sees Summer he wants her, but knows he shouldn't have her. It doesn't take long for Summer to see that Rhett is actually so much more than the media portrays him to be. As they start working together it becomes clear that they are growing on each other, but Summer feels it isn't for the best. They dance around this attraction for awhile before ever crossing that line. This is very character driven, you get to see the softer side of Rhett and always see the side of Summer that cares so much about what others think of her.I loved the attraction that was there between these two! It has some of my favorite tropes; Small town, close proximity, one bed, opposites attract.Also love a series that includes other characters from the family and gives you good development on wanting more of their stories too!",

                "reviewText": "A bull rider and his agent\u2014how did I not see this coming?Summer (h) is the \u201cother child\u201d of the family, conceived from a quick romp with a maid, and feels like she has something to prove, be it loyally following her father or nurturing those around her because \u201cI\u2019m an empath\u201d (and no, not in the actual way, more like the Tumblr way).Rhett (H) is the youngest cowboy in his family (save his little nephew) and has built an unsupported career off the adrenaline rush of bull riding at the risk of worsening his injuries and running his mouth.When Rhett\u2019s jokes and less-than-graceful handling of nosy journalists nearly tank his career, Summer is sent out as his glorified babysitter.And that\u2019s how our small town, enemies to lovers story kicks off.I found the term \u201cenemy\u201d was a very, er, <em>inaccurate</em> way of describing our H and h. They are both victims of circumstance who don\u2019t get along and have their little scuffles, but that doesn\u2019t make them \u201cenemies\u201d. I\u2019d say this is more of a <em>strangers to lovers</em> phenomenon than enemies.Enemies to lovers for me needs to be all about the mockery, the hurt, and one attempt of legitimately murdering the other (be it in body or in mind).I enjoyed this book subverted several tropes in such a <em><strong>natural</strong></em> way. For example, Summer may be unapologetically city girl, but she can ride horses, she\u2019s not embittered at her father\u2019s infidelity, she\u2019s better at endurance training than the guys <em>without</em> monologuing about it, and she understands when she is hurt.I was very worried when Rhett got hurt that Summer would make up with him then. But when Rhett went all, well, <em>Rhett</em>, I was pleased she walked away and rightfully ignored him.I also very much liked she was unapologetically city girl and very brilliant without monologuing or exacerbating her differences between her and the country folk.I had a bit of an issue with all the \u201cnibbling on her lips\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m an empath\u2014a nurture\u201d. The verb <em>nibbling</em> requires both lips and picturing it (because, as some of us do, we create an entire feature film as we read) made me gloss over any of her \u201canxious tells\u201d.I also liked how this was a subverted babysitter trope to a degree. I get annoyed at the whole agent/PR x athlete trope because the agent comes off as snarky and childish as they <em>literally</em> treat the athlete like a child who knows nothing or a \u201cdumb jock\u201d and refuse to apologize for it.The antagonism between these two were realistic, and I\u2019m happy Summer knew better than to embarrass anyone while on the job and also took Rhett\u2019s own emotions into account.I <em><strong>did</strong></em> like Rhett more towards the end than at the beginning. I especially loved when his father shut down Rhett\u2019s \u201cpossessive Alpha\u201d act with advice almost every MMC needs: stop focusing on the person eyeing your lover and focus on who your lover is eyeing.When people gawked at two of my previous partners, I felt pride because that means others were besotted with their charm as I was. And I felt so lucky someone so well-sought after was with me and I got to know them under all the vanity.Possessiveness and jealousy are actually darkly thrilling to read <em><strong>within the context of the story and/or character</strong></em>. Some authors make cinnamon roll MCs aggressively jealous as a way to \u201cshow a whole new side\u201d but it feels shoehorned in.Rhett\u2019s jealousy actually felt like one small part of his personality, and his father\u2019s quick word of advice was perfect. No soapboxing. No shoehorning. No signing. Two sentences and we\u2019re done with that ish.What prevents me from 5\u2b50\ufe0fs is the use of family and the best friend. I\u2019m sorry. I <em>hate</em> the \u201cI have one sole bestie in this world\u201d trope. Willa was nice, sure, but I didn\u2019t vibe with her.Family as an external conflict away from the couple\u2019s own issues is fine with me. The naming (Summer and Winter) was a little too much. And also, Kip might\u2019ve been great in <em>some</em> aspects, but if his wife and daughter are causing so much distress to his much more beloved daughter, it begs the question why he never sought divorce.I do like, however, that Winter stayed cold until the end. Honestly, I\u2019d like to see her with Caleb. I love the grumpy/grumpier trope which is a <em><strong>rare</strong></em> breed of story. But it\u2019d be fascinating to see how even a grumpy Caleb manages to thaw Winter out of her ice queen persona and also help provide much more of a natural insight to Luke\u2019s mum.Unfortunately, I have a feeling it\u2019s Willa x Caleb and Winter x Beau.<em>Le sigh</em>.Anywho: good read. References to OW with a fake out and some good OM drama too. I\u2019m not sure how the steam was. Little miscommunication outside a singular stupid moment. The main strife came from words spoken shots fired.4.25 \u2b50\ufe0fs.\ud83d\udc9c",

The characters are great, the story is fun, the spice is spicing. I needed a little breather after this one. The tension and banter are great throughout. Banter is one of my favorite parts of a romance book and this one had tons of it. I love when characters have relatable issues and development points throughout, and Flawless had internal struggles for both main characters. It was emotional without getting sappy, spicy without feeling redundant, funny without feeling cliche. All in all, it was a fabulous read!overall 5 starsspice 3 stars",

The first book sets the tone for an entire series and I am so excited to keep diving into this world Elsie Silver has created in Chestnut Springs Series. The book flowed to easily and I just wanted to keeping reading. Every character introduced had a purpose and no one felt forced or like a filler. I got more excited as I kept reading about the books to come.The connection between Rhett and Summer was undeniable with the perfect balance of push and pull to keep you hooked. I really related to Summer and her struggles of pleasing everyone around her. Rhett was the perfect compliant to Summer bringing out the best side of her she was afraid to show too many people. There was so many twists and turns that kept shocking me which I really enjoyed. I highly recommend this book and can\u2019t wait to dive deeper into this world!",
