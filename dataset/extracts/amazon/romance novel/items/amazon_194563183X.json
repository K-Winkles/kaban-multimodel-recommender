Unless you count his basset hound, Waylon.Knox doesn\u2019t tolerate drama, even when it comes in the form of a stranded runaway bride.Naomi wasn\u2019t just running away from her wedding. She was riding to the rescue of her estranged twin to Knockemout, Virginia, a rough-around-the-edges town where disputes are settled the old-fashioned way\u2026with fists and beer. Usually in that order.Too bad for Naomi her evil twin hasn\u2019t changed at all. After helping herself to Naomi\u2019s car and cash, Tina leaves her with something unexpected. The niece Naomi didn\u2019t know she had. Now she\u2019s stuck in town with no car, no job, no plan, and no home with an 11-year-old going on thirty to take care of.There\u2019s a reason Knox doesn\u2019t do complications or high-maintenance women, especially not the romantic ones. But since Naomi\u2019s life imploded right in front of him, the least he can do is help her out of her jam. And just as soon as she stops getting into new trouble he can leave her alone and get back to his peaceful, solitary life.At least, that\u2019s the plan until the trouble turns to real danger.",

WHY DIDN\u2019T I START THIS SOONER!!!I ADORED this book!!! I love the storyline so much! I connected with Naomi on so many personal levels. I truly felt for Wayway and what she had to go through with her mom. And Knox?!? UNFFF! There\u2019s so many things I could say but the way he looked out for her and Wayway just melted meee. Also the relationship build up was amazing!!! The ending was the cherry on top!!!I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride reading this book (that\u2019s a good thing) Had me laughing, crying, angry, happy all the thingssss! I was so full of emotion I felt like I was there watching it all happen. I love reading books like this that really pull me in! YES YES YES!!I highlighted so many quotes and things that made me laugh, angry etc! Theres a thing Naomi says when she first met Knox that absolutely cracked me up.\u201cI sighed. \u201cGet out of my way, Leif Erikson.\u201d \u201cThe name is Knox. And why are you here?\u201d What the hell kind of name was that? Was it a hard Knox life? Did he tell a lot of Knox Knox jokes? Was it short for something? Knoxwell? Knoxathan?\u201dA quote that really hit home for me:\u201cYou\u2019re the one who has to live your life. Don\u2019t apologize to other people for the decisions you make for yourself.\u201d",

I loved how unrealistic and cheesy it was at times and it proved to be such a fun escape. I don't think it's peak quality but I can't doubt or complain about how much I enjoyed reading it. I try to base reviews off of how the book made me feel while also being realistic about how good of quality the book objectively is.Make sure that going into it, you know that this is supposed to be an unrealistic, feel-good book. Now there are some emotional and intense scenes in it but that just makes it all the more intriguing! I honestly was on the edge of my seat with how invested I was in these characters. A couple of them felt like cliche characters but Lucy Score still managed to make them interesting and enjoyable. The situations she came up with just made me laugh and they did a good job of showing off the characters and how they behave.One thing I did find annoying, however, was how back and forth Knox was with things. And I know that's the point of things... man says he doesn't care or want to help and yet still does anyway even though he wants not commitment. But I felt it was slightly too constant and obvious. That didn't stop it from making me slightly giddy every time though...Honestly, if you know the purpose behind the book and what you're signing up for, this is an amazing storyline. I'm super excited to read the rest of the Knockemout books because I'm WAY too invested in this small town!",

                "reviewText": "5 STARS for Book 2 of Lucy Score's wonderful exciting Series: Knockemout. This is my first book by this author & I was impressed by her well written storyline with its excellent tempo cadence style of words & put together so smartly it made the reading of it as if singing a wonderful song. Great BLURB provided.Characters are terrific, you know if you pulled up to a gas station in that town that you would recognize everyone of them. Plus you wish they were real people so you could meet them & be friends with these crazy loyal stand-up people.This is Naomi & Knox's story which begins with him mistakens her for her twin sister, Tina. Boy, let me tell you, she hasn't had her caffeine yet today & sparks fly both ways. The sexual chemistry between them is charged in the air & people can see it, but they act as if they don't. Later the sex is highly electrifying.Crime, attempted police chief assassination, break-ins, a 6th grade teacher with a grudge against a child because of an adult affair, bikers, tattoos, hair salon, homeless shelters, & so much more. This is a sit down dinner with full courses of love, childhood drama, physical abuse, the full emotional gamult, and then for desert laughs that will do your heart good, tender moments with a young child to let her know it's not her fault because of who she is, and just a rip roaring good time.I read this author for the 1st time all the way through, could not put it down & as an avid reader that speaks volumes. I'm going on to Book 2 & maybe a little sleep, first to prepare for another marathon read.RECOMMEND.WARNING::::::::: SEXUAL EXPLICIT ACTIVITY",

Not OTT, making it eye-rolling incredible but in a mix that actually makes sense.Naomi is also very interesting, yet super funny and with the best BFF in the world. Also, her Sloane addition was cool.Anyway, jumping straight into the next one!",

                "reviewText": "I was hooked as soon as I read a few chapters. I couldn\u2019t put it down, it\u2019s funny, uplifting, spicy but without loosing a great storyline with some wonderful characters.The characters are witty ;) fun, so opposite but small town living with all their lives intertwined slowly but surly your routing for that love story, you know the one which seems an odd match but perfect. And this one is definitely a rollercoaster of a story with a mess going on that is sad, laugh out loud funny and some super spicy scenes that keep you hooked.I don\u2019t like to put any spoilers in, as me myself hate them when looking at reviews, I\u2019d rather have the enjoyment of reading the book to find out why the reviews say just how good it is. Let me tell you it\u2019s definitely worth the read!I finished this book so quick, I couldn\u2019t wait to read the next two in this series! I\u2019d highly recommend this book.This was the first book I\u2019d ever read by Lucy Score and I know she will become one of my favourites now that\u2019s for sure!",
