                "reviewText": "\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6 4/5This was a compelling suspenseful thriller that I did not see coming. I am a thriller and suspense lover so at first I wasn't too interested in this story thinking it was focusing on romance. However, as it built over the first 50 pages, I started to become attracted. I was pulled in by the mystery behind what really happened to Melanie. Nothing is ever as it seems. I really appreciated how the author built the suspense around the characters and the drama being unpacked. Thrillers are not for the weak so if you are triggered by cursing, drugs, violence, etc. This book is not for you.The twists in this story are not seen or predictable at all and I love how Shanora reveals them and allows us as readers to dissect them with explanation, but not over the top. This allows us to connect the dots and really hone in on the story getting deep into it. I like to put myself in the main character's shoes and while I didn't agree with many things that Samira chose, I really enjoyed the ending and was talking to the book in the end like she could hear me \ud83d\ude05.Pros: Quick read, unpredictable twists, intriguing plotCons: Uneven chapters, action held until the endFavorite Character: Yadira",

There were a lot of Secrets in this book. Dylan had that much hidden hatred and Jealousy of his cousin and Melanie seemed delusional.

                "reviewText": "Gosh this book keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the last sentence. Shanora really knows how to write an incredibly absorbing thriller, with some extremely dark hidden secrets. The characters are so believable, and the heroine so determined. Samaria a young lady finding it difficult to focus on the necessities of life is forced to stand on her own to feet and not rely on hand outs from her brother Kellan and her friend Sheila. Jell is soon to be a Dad, and his fianc\u00e9e does not get on with his sister particularly well, and Sheila, wants space when her boyfriend moves into her flat. A chance encounter whilst Mira is waitressing has her meeting Roland a professional golfer with a sinister past. A widower, who although walking around freely fell deeply under suspicion when his first wife committed suicide, whilst under the influence of heroine. He was never proved guilty but everyone had opinion that reflected on his career. The two start a whirl wind romance and finish up married and moving into Roland\u2019s home. The one he built with his first wife. Journals that Mira finds written by her hand, the first wife, cast shadows of doubt, and so the incredible journey of deceit, encounters and plots unfold. It is so well written that when the end does arrive the reader is most definitely wanting more. Cruel characters weave in and out. Those you thought you knew you didn\u2019t, and those you thought were fair left you realising that perhaps you only saw what they wanted. The heroines sheer determination, continues throughout the book, and is basically the total backbone of this exciting novel. One not to miss. One to digest and ponder. Some topics are difficult to absorb, and some are quite macabre, but all essential for a phenomenal story. Well worth more than 5 stars. This ladies work always is. Totally excellent.",
