Generally, I am not a big novella fan until this one; so much excitement and suspense was packed into a short time. I would have had no problem reading this story if it was longer, but it was perfect the way it was and was so good.The gargoyle story theme was brilliant, sweet, and quite dreamy. The way that they were able to overcome financial difficulties was clever. I will definitely read this story again and again.I switched between the Kindle and Audible version. Narration by BJ. Harrison is always enjoyable.",

The story grabbed my attention and made me want to read it in one sitting. I didn\u2019t expect the reveal of the \u201cbad guy\u201d but I thoroughly enjoyed it!

All of the things that make Nocturne Falls and Shadowvale pleasant escapes are here. It was a lovely Valentine gift to myself.Interestingly, Annaleigh is a bit dense but very kind hearted and overly trusting. Her lack of forethought is the reason that I rate this at a 4.5 stars rounded up to a full 5. Typically our KP ladies are a bit\u2026um smarter? Annaleigh comes across like someone you\u2019d have to help navigate life. I think it is fortunate that she finds Vasmir so they can guide each other.As always, there are other surprises that are woven into the story to keep the reader from guessing too much and Vasim is such a sweet and unexpected hero that he makes up for the Annaleigh eye rolls. I definitely recommend this! You will have a smile on your face for hours after reading.",

I'd definitely recommend this book to those that love the Paranormal and Fantasy. Vasmir was more knowledgeable about certain things than I thought he initially would be. I loved the certain detail to a few of the smaller things. I can't go into more detail about them without giving away too much. But things that I thought were later answered in the book. Great job Kristen! I hope to read more about both charaters in the future.",
