Sebastian hadn't really paid much attention to her until he caught her reading a book and she quoted Plato. I was surprised that he wouldn't inquire further into her reading habits since she was a maid. The two strike up a friendship and, unbeknownst to each other, they start to fall in love. But there is a woman who is working hard to get Sebastian for herself and Evelyn has a secret the Duke doesn't know about.I liked getting to know the characters and seeing how the Duke's friend helps Evelyn out near the end. Nice ending and I enjoyed reading more in the extended epilogue.",

                "reviewText": "This is a sweet, clean romance between a maid and a duke. As the duke chooses to live a quiet life away from the ton, he begins to seek out one of his maids, as he is attracted to her intelligence and independence, unaware she holds secrets. As their bond deepens, inferences and pressure come from his sister and the ton, that he needs to begin attending balls and procuring a wife. Secrets, drama, heartbreak and self-appraisals weaves throughout the story until the well deserved HEA. The author does a great job in creating detailed primary characters that the reader feels empathy for, and interest in knowing their outcome. And she created enough theatrics with the use of supporting characters that produced dilemmas between the couple. It\u2019s a great read, with a few minor issues. The book needed another run through by an editor, as there were major word errors. And, I was somewhat disappointed by the extended epilogue as it left me with a few questions, versus a snug ending to the story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

More intimate kisses between Sebastian and Evie to really seal their romance. It would have taken this story from 3 to 5 stars.Listen, I love a clean read but I hate how these authors are so scared or intimidated of incorporating kissing in their plots, and I don\u2019t mean chaste kisses. Two people in genuine love with each other naturally kiss as a way to communicate their emotion and love for each other. Even the epilogue that I read, was devoid of passionate kisses which is crazy because Sebastian and Evie are married in the epilogue. This story has romance but the romance is lacking because it doesn\u2019t have the heartfelt kisses that would complete it.Otherwise, this book was fairly good.",
