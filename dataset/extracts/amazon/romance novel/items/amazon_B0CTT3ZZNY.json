Then, it immediately switches to our current characters that threw me off a little bit. But, that history becomes integral to the mystery as a whole. Both main characters are artists whose families have feuded in the past (prolouge) and meet by chance due to having their galleries shown together in London. This fated Romeo and Juilet pair have to figure out if true love is worth rocking the boat, and if some mysteries are worth solving. I love how both characters grow within the story and learn what is truly important to them. All wrapped up in an HEA it is a quite sweet finish to the whole ordeal.",

I love that this is not all about balls and the pressure to marry even though there is a great romantic aspect to the story of course.Great characters, both main and minor ones, that you can relate to, smile at and sympathise with. I like the way the exhibition brings the main characters together along with the painting of the necklace encouraging the solving of the past\u2019s mystery.The hints of danger, the creepy elements and somewhat reckless behaviour give pace to the story too.I still have a little issue with how long certain \u2018trips\u2019 would take (I know it is one of my foibles!) Watford is 20 miles from what, today, is Central London and would take half a day\u2019s travel to get there in the Regency period. Also the trip to Norwood in South London \u2026All that aside a great story that I will read again.I am an ARC reader and this my honest review.",

John was the son of the Duke of Hamilton but had been disowned because the Duke did not approve of his son being an artist. Molly was the daughter of Earl Norton and she was also a talented artist. They met at their joint art exhibition and found shared interests. In their families the story of the missing necklace had caused many disagreements between everyone.
