                "reviewText": "As a young lady of the 1800\u2019s, Cassia Dowding had to do whatever the men in her life dictated. Her father raised her to believe this way although she felt it wrong that her brother, Edwin, and friend, Frederick, could live such carefree lives while she must stay locked in her home, taking lessons privately and being offered in courtship to only the elderly wealthy men of the Ton because her father needed to pay off his gambling debt. She accepted her fate of marrying not for love but for convenience of wealth but she had made a list of things she wanted to do before she was forced to marry. As fate would have it, her list falls into the hands of her brother\u2019s best friend and her childhood teaser, Frederick Crawford, now the Duke of Seymour. Yet. Frederick doesn\u2019t wish to use the list against her but wants to help her accomplish it because behind all that childhood teasing was a young man smitten with his best friends\u2019s sister but unable to act upon it while her father was alive. But Frederick has just recently lost two important people in his life and he feels he is cursed, keeping him from allowing anyone else into his life. The two will come to a mutual agreement to fake a courtship to help each other out but as all such romances go they soon find it not so fake as they work at crossing off points on Cassia\u2019s list and keeping two unwanted suitors away. The storyline is attention grabbing from the start with wonderful characters to keep the reader emotionally bonded and has several secondary characters involved in different scenarios to make the reader want to continue turning pages to see the outcome. Frederick is a bit of a rake with protectiveness when it comes to Cassia and their interactions together are all delightful. I did question the accuracy of the the man\u2019s clothing on the front cover. He appears to be wearing too modern of a suit to fit the time period of the book. Book covers matter to me but for most probably not and it doesn\u2019t effect the wonderful storyline of the book.I received a free Advanced Readers\u2019 Copy of this book but was given no monetary compensation. I read for the enjoyment and voluntarily review so that others may know what to expect and authors may be helped by critique and encouragement.",

Then they all grow up and go separate ways, until a ball has them meet again. Only this time the girl is older and can hold her own against the friend. Thus is the story of Frederick and Cassie. Great banting takes place between the two. There is of course a villain and sudden turns in the story and it all leads to a fully engaging story filled with all types of fantastic characters. Another hit for this author.",

Lady Cassia has a voice, a list of want to do\u2019s\u2019 hidden in a locket. Little did she know that she could actually make them happen. Re entering her life, Frederick, a childhood friend of her brother Edwin, interacts with her like oil and water. As they interact that voice, so long squashed starts to come to life. Lady Cassia and Frederick decide on a \u2018ruse\u2019 of courting. No surprise, nothing really goes the way either of them expect. They both have issues that need to be resolved. They find their strength together but so many voices are working to keep them apart. I was glad when Lady Cassia finds her voice to help another young lady find hers. Here\u2019s to finding your voice and having someone by your side to support you on the journey. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",

After the death of his father Frederick became a Duke and met Casia at a ball where she was having a difficult time against an aggressive Lord Stanhope and seeing her distress he stepped in and rescued her. We see a lot of banter back and forth between Frederick and Casia and she does not know what to make of it as she still was holding some resentment against him for how he treated her when they were young. Frederick was being followed around and pursued by Lady Agnes so he proposed to Casia that they fake an engagement to help her with the aggressive pursuit by Lord Stanhope and his issue with Lady Agnes. The story does have a number of twists and turns and one is drawn merrily along as all the developments unfold.",

A fun read, with a hero who is fun loving and not much of rake, but just enough to know he could be dangerous. The heroin was interesting and understandable in her plight. I loved the way these two came together and the author kept the story moving at a good pace but gave you all the details and moments you could want in a story and couple like this. Highly recommend!!!",

With the help of Frederick her brother\u2019s best friend she managed to cross out her list and eventually realised she loved him. I Loved both characters as well as her siblings. The story is full of twists and turns, funny, sad at times and full of passion. Highly recommended.",

When Frederick and Cassia decide to start a relationship of convenience, they never would have thought it would bring them true happiness in the end. I liked how their romance put a little optimism in my life. I received this book as a review copy.",
