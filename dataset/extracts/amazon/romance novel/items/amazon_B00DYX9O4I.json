                "reviewText": "Catherine Anderson has done it again~~stolen my nights, my sleep, my thoughts~~and left me wishing the next book in this series was already ensconced on my Kindle. This is an expertly drawn historical romance with strong elements about faith, hope, and the endurance of love.This story opens with murder, the murder of the Gabriel Valance, a gunslinger, having killed many during the course of his short life. Prone on a snowy boardwalk in Random, Colorado, his last cogent memory is seeing a beautiful 'Christmas Angel' standing in the candlelit window of her millinery shop across the street.That's when fate intervenes. Now standing before the pearly gates (in this instance, a table in a crumbling shack), Gabriel is given an opportunity to live life over. He has a month to save a lost soul in Random, and is provided the names of three individuals who fit that bill. One of them is the milliner he glimpsed as he died: Nan Sullivan. Gabe chooses her, and so begins the spiritual journey of a very bad man named Gabriel Valance.Armed with information provided by the angels at the gates of heaven, Gabe is redeposited in Random, not only burdened with his responsibility toward Nan, but also with a host of rules by which he must abide. He knows, too, that at the end of his do-over-month, he will again die at the hands of his killer, his only hope for heaven being his successful redemption of Nan.Nan Sullivan has secrets of her own. Believing she has murdered a despicable suitor, Nan is on the run. With her is her much younger sister, Laney, whom she passes off as her daughter. The two have been living successfully, however fearfully, in Random. But terror comes knocking when Gabriel Valance shows up on their doorstep, and he wants only one thing~~marriage with Nan.During his month, Gabe finds it increasingly more difficult to abide by the rules the angels at the gates have mandated. Complicating the situation is the fact that he's fallen in love with Nan and her 'daughter', Laney. The idea that he's preordained to die again on Christmas Eve is almost more than he can bear.This is a magnificent, heartwarming, heartbreaking story that had me laughing and crying, sometimes simultaneously. The characters are so well-drawn I keep hoping any or all of them will show up on my doorstep. The plot elements have kept me thinking about my own life, my own comfort zone, and how often I cast a blind eye on the circumstances of others.Ms. Anderson has written a love story featuring the personal redemption of a very bad man.We should all be so lucky.",

                "reviewText": "The storyline starts off as many with a gunslinger's death, but from that point on, everything changes! The Heavenly Angels intervene on Gabriel's behalf and offers him a second chance to change his lifestyle and to make a difference in others. However, when given the choices of who he wanted to change, he let his lustfulness make the decision for him and chose Nan, the dressmaker. As he works through the various scenarios with the Angels, he realizes that taking on an obvious spinster might just test him; but nevertheless, he takes on the challenge, while still remembering the boy he found under the staircase.Gabriel is given 30 days to turn Nan's world upside down, more or less, to allow her to see she can love again and find that special someone she wants to spend the rest of her life with. She has a \"daughter\" Laney, that she tries to protect. But Gabriel is given insight into Nan's and Laney's pasts, and immediately comes to the rescue. Her \"daughter\" is actually her sister and is attempting to stay hidden from their father and what Nan believes is a murder charge against her.The 30 days goes by faster than Gabriel thought possible, but because he had been shown future events that can change other's lives and he finds it so difficult not to get involved in order to make sure others don't suffer losses before Christmas; even though he believes that he is going against the Heavenly Hosts' original plan and will eventually be the end of his life for good this time.Gabriel is constantly reminded by Gabriel, the Angel, to \"follow your heart\". and as he does, his life becomes so much more better than he could ever imagine. The little Valance family grew from just Laney to include Christopher, the boy huddled underneath the staircase and even to a beautiful golden retriever the kids have named Jasper. One last piece is to include a bitter old man who has seen his wife and 8 beautiful children die from sickness a long time ago and who continues to live in the dilapidated family home.All in all, without giving too much of the book away, it was a cute story, providing gentle reminders that many of us could do well if we also followed our hearts/listened to our hearts.I can't wait to see what the next book will be like, since this is a Valance Family novel. I'm sure Catherine will ensure good reading as well and help us to believe in God and miracles.",

A cowboy that is a quick draw who loves his alcohol and women.my kind of cowboy. But someone just happens to want to make a name for himself and kills him..that's where this story gets good..he gets to the pearly gates and meets 2 angels who goes through his life (hilarious) then he gets 30 days to save his soul, back on earth to help someone else in need. Let's just say this book is really good and funny and also makes you think about your own life. Like would you help a stranger in need, or a starving animal or do what most people do look the other way.. this books was well written but not in a preachy way. Great job!",
