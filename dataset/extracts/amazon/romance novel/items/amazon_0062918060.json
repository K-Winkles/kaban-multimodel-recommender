It is a fake dating trope that goes from friends to lovers. I would definitely recommend this book for ages 13/14 and up. It is a good teen read and doesn\u2019t have anything explicit in it!

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars You can definitely tell this is Wattpad",
                "reviewText": "When I first saw this book I didn\u2019t expect much from it. I figured it was going to be a cute, light read not an intense romance type book that I\u2019m used to reading. But this book was still pretty entertaining and definitely had potential but you can tell that this is a Wattpad book just by the writing. You have to read it to really understand what I\u2019m talking about but there was barely any character descriptions like at all, how the author went with their background stories was weird like every aspect of the book it was brought up unnecessarily but there was no resolutions or any character development or growth. Like for example Beca\u2019s dad left her and her mom when she was young and throughout the book all she complained about was how her mom never talks about it and how she wants an explanation but it never happened like you would think it would\u2026I mean the author brought it up so many times you\u2019d think we\u2019d get to a point where she sits down with her mom and talks about it but no. Also she found out that her dad started a new family and he literally lives down the street (which is pretty sad) and for the past couple of years she just walks to his house and watches him pull into the driveway from work and his new wife greet him\u2026well some point in the book she just marches to his door and the wife invites her in (knowing she\u2019s his daughter) they previously had an encounter sometime before that btw anyways she goes to his house and basically ends up just telling him she forgives him and stuff and she doesn\u2019t want his apology or him in her life. Beca did that to \u201cmove on\u201d I guess but she didn\u2019t even get an explanation of why he did what he did even though he wanted to tell her. In my opinion she should have let him, I didn\u2019t expect her to forgive him but it would have been nice and added something good to the book if she did. It just made all the complaining, questions, and back and forth dialogue about it in her head seem all for nothing. Now let\u2019s move on to Brett this really bothered me lol\u2026basically Brett\u2019s family is supposed to be this rich perfect family but spoiler alert they\u2019re not. In the book you can definitely tell something is off especially with the mother she\u2019s always so emotional and down about something especially when it comes to the dads work. The dad is always going on these long work trips but turns out they weren\u2019t all work trips Brett while with beca ends up catching his dad having an affair (he was just at dinner with another women) but you get it and after some useless investigations that him and beca did he finally just confronts him after seeing his dad with her again at this big party for his dads hotel. Turns out the mom already knew for a couple of months and Brett ends up kicking the dad out of the house. They go to some family therapy sessions and obviously the dad is saying he\u2019s sorry but he\u2019s only sorry he got caught, anyways later the mom says she wants the dad back and Brett let\u2019s it and they go on like normal kinda. But this is exactly what I mean by no resolutions like so much of the conflict and drama that went on it the book was for nothing because they were never resolved. Now the two characters end up getting together in the end but that was really the only good part. I feel as if I wasted my time with this book and if I could go back i probably wouldn\u2019t purchase it and I won\u2019t be recommending just not worth it in my opinion. It definitely has potential like I said before if another author were to pick up this book and rewrite it but intensify the romance, the overall storyline, and characters this would be a great book but for now it\u2019s a no for me.",

The in-depth look into life after divorce, Becca a senior, deals with her father leaving to create a new life, and she reads about romance because she just doesn\u2019t think true love exists.Her best friend blooms over summer and shuns her when she becomes popular in sophomore year and teases her about not having experienced love.After dealing with the disillusionment, Becca invents a secret boyfriend. Overhearing Brett impulsively comes to her rescue.He is the ultimate high school jock, Captain of the football team. His focus on sports doesn\u2019t lend much time for dating or meaningful relationships, and it seems a good solution for him as well.It is a learning curve when this couple who are basically strangers figure out who the both are and how to relate.Brett\u2019s world hits a snag, and Becca helps him get through by sharing how she dealt with her experiences.An excellent read I couldn\u2019t put down.",

                "reviewText": "Very similar plot to Better Than The Movies by Lynn Painter which I read recently. I bought this book before a flight home and absolutely powered through it, I was done with it 10 hours after purchasing.I really enjoyed the alternating points of view the story is told from. The author did a great job of differentiating between Becca and Brett and it felt like most moments in the book were told from the 'ideal' viewpoint.I had a big smile on my face whilst reading most of this book, it's incredibly heart-warming and the story doesn't seem too unrealistic.I think the only thing missing was some truly unlikeable characters. Even Jenny seems nice early on, her and Becca come across as friends that drifted apart. Maybe the author could have included some of her new friends and made them far more unpleasant to Becca. I don't really know, I don't want to be rooting for everybody, I want somebody to get some comeuppance!I'll definitely be following Alex Bright from here on.",
