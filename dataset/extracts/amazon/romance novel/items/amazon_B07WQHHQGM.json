                "reviewText": "Nora Roberts has scored again with the latest release of \u201cHideaway\u201d, a multigenerational and richly layered family saga featuring Caitlyn Sullivan, already at age ten an accomplished actor in her own right with a presence and wit that is astounding at such a tender age. Cate, as she is called by the family, is the victim of a botched kidnapping. Botched because she\u2019s smarter than her would be kidnappers, who snatched her out of the tree where she was going to hide in the game of hide and seek she and her cousins were playing at the life celebration of her late great grandfather. She manages to escape by tying bed sheets together to lower herself from a two story window to drop the rest of the way and take off running through the woods before her captors returned. Cate runs blindly through the night until she stumbles onto a farm house with a light in the window shining like a beacon, guiding her to safety. Finding the front door unlocked, she slips into the kitchen, grabs an apple off the counter and tries to hide when twelve year old Dillon Cooper decides to raid the refrigerator for some leftover fried chicken. His family is astonished by the account of her ordeal.And thus begins a tale of family betrayal by the person that society says should always, always put us first and protect us from outside harm. But through it all, her father, grandparents and other family members were there, watching out for her and doing their best to make her feel safe again. First in Ireland, back to L.A., then living in the relative anonymity of New York City and finally back home to Big Sur. A real homecoming where Cate has found her voice, or voices that her calling requires. She\u2019s happy to have reconnected with Dillon and his family and she\u2019s content with her life. Until the evil that had shaped and shaded so much of her existence raised its ugly head and again threatened her peace and tranquility.As a long time Nora Roberts fan I\u2019m delighted to see her dialogue come back to a smoother, less sharp and cutting style than her last few novels exhibited. The plot is complex and intriguing but the pacing is a bit plodding for the first half of the story. I\u2019ve dubbed Roberts the Queen of Romance but \u201cHideaway\u201d doesn\u2019t really hit the romantic mark. It\u2019s honestly more of a romantic thriller with the romance decidedly low key, almost an afterthought. That said, the story is rich with characters and backstories that buttress and strengthen the familial bonds that guide Cate and the Sullivan clan through the generations. Four stars.",

                "reviewText": "I love Nora Roberts. But Hideaway isn\u2019t her best. Why? I wanted more romance and the ending was rushed. In a nutshell, Cate, the daughter and granddaughter of a famous movie star is kidnapped. Pretty soon, we realize that everything is not as it appears and someone close to sweet Cate was behind the entire scheme. As the culprits are arrested and the truth comes to light, we find Cate heartbroken. The very person who should have protected her, masterminded the entire things. As the years go by, Cate finds it difficult to trust, yet still sets out to blaze her own path, turning to voice work. To be honest, I did not bond with Cate, like I do other Roberts heroines (like Eve Dallas in the In Death Series) that she has introduced. I understood that she was traumatized, and that only time could heal old wounds, but when she should have been worried, she wasn\u2019t, and when she wasn\u2019t, she should have been. She was a little all over the place. The bad guy(s) were predictable and unimaginative. Instead there was a lot of focus on her changing hairstyles (i.e., hair color, style choices). There was no real \u201cmeat.\u201d Even her relationship with her best friend seemed a little forced. I guess to me her character was missing something and I\u2019m not sure what it was. I did like her love affair with Dillion but wanted more romance. We just got brief glimpses of that. I don\u2019t know, it all just seemed a little rushed and forced. Dillion was always giving, willing to compromise, make amends, while she always seemed to be looking for more or confused. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were some great concepts/storylines there, but they were poorly developed. The mother/daughter relationship could have been more, versus just telling us bits and pieces in hopes of garnering some sympathy. I felt like the father should have been more prominent in the story. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he was there, but always in the periphery. Maybe a little romance with him, giving him a happy ending would have been nice. The only redeeming storyline was Cate\u2019s relationship with her grandparents and maybe the housekeeper. They were both super sweet. In the end, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t really enjoy \u201cThe Hideaway.\u201d It was missing that normal Roberts magic. There wasn\u2019t enough suspense (you knew what was going on the entire time); there wasn\u2019t enough romance; and the main character (Cate) isn\u2019t lovable. Overall, I\u2019m still a BIG NORA ROBERTS fan, but this one left me disappointed.",
