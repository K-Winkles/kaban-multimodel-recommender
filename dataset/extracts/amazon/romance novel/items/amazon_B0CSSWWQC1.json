Ruby brought so much life to this story as well. One thing this book had was tones of PTSD of disabled veterans, and as a parent of one, my heart swelled with the attention to detail Ms. Gray provided (however minor) on that issue. I can not say enough good things about this story and highly highly recommend.",

Tate no longer has to work because of his inheritance. On his way to the hardware store he almost hits someone on a skateboard. That\u2019s his first introduction to Ruby. Ruby has a little sass to her, a little sarcasm but right now she has a broken wrist. Tate is a take charge kind of guy. He is taking her to the ER. At the ER Tate needs to call Ruby\u2019s sister Kenzie. Kenzie is her guardian. When Tate meets Kenzie he feels something - tingles, a spark, a connection something he has never felt before. It\u2019s going to get very interesting! Does Kenzie feel it? Does Ruby notice? This story is filled with emotions - caring, tenderness, sadness, playfulness, deception, passion, romance and the ultimate - love. A complete story filled with everything you would want. I really enjoyed this story there was so much happening with the characters you just want them to succeed! It\u2019s good!.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

                "reviewText": "Kenzie lost both her parents at 19 and became the legal guardian to her 8 yr old sister Ruby. 5 years later she\u2019s struggling to make ends meet. She is constantly harassed by her father\u2019s friend Mac, who \u201chelped her\u201d after her parents death. What he really did was manipulate her into bad financial decisions with the inheritance so she would be dependent on him and pressured her to marry him, which she refused. Her boss at the fast food restaurant refused to help her when Mac showed up harrasing her and he constantly held her job over her head. Tate was an Army Major who had no real relationship with his father. When his father died Tate was left a small fortune and several properties. One of which was in the small tow Kenzie lived in. He met her after Ruby wiped out on her skateboard in front of Tate and he rushed her to the hospital. Kenzi is very independent and won\u2019t ask for help after dealing with Max but the connection between her and Tate is instant. They start seeing each other and he offer for Ruby to work for him helping clean out the workshop on his property building a connection with her as well. One of his soldiers comes to stay and when his PTSD gets to crisis mode Tate ends up yelling at The girls to keep them away and get Allen help and not having the time to explain. There is a lot of emotional baggage they each have and it\u2019s a struggle to get everything figured out. Definitely have a few tissues lying around for this one!.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",
