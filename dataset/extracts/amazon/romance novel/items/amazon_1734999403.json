Chase and Alina\u2019s met when Chase was 13 and Alina was 11. Chase just moved into a house down the road from Alina. Alina and Chase\u2019s little sister became best friends. Throughout this part, readers see Chase and Alina\u2019s dancing around their feeling for each other. At the end, Chase ends up moving and would not return to home for the next eight years. Part two is of the present. Chase finally returns home after finding out that his adoptive father needs to retire early. Chase ends up working for his father\u2019s construction company. The first project that Chase works on is renovating a dance studio. This is where he sees Alina for the first time in eight years. Alina is not pleased to see Chase. With Chase in town, old feeling arise in both of them. Love how these two end up together",

But then the book kicked into gear. And boy am I glad I stuck with it. I think this story resonated with me because I could really relate to the characters in terms of their healing. And the story did a great job of handling that within the story itself.Additionally, I LURVE Hooked. I didn\u2019t realize this was the same Emily McIntire until I was finished with this book. \ud83d\udcd6 so , obviously, totally different kind of book, but love this author, so stick it out. I think the pay out is worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm pretty dissapointed with this book. It started okay, some filling pages that could've been skipped and a really long part one when it should have been focused in the future instead of the past. Then part 2 started good, you could feel the angst and the chemistry, but then again, there it seemed shorter and dramatic. I really found it annoying that the whole drama was around cheating. Did he cheat? No, but he had some pretty unbelievable explanation as to what happened (even though it arrived eight years too late). Then the second almost break up was, once again, because of a woman because obviously he was so incredible that girls go crazy for him. Isn't it exhausting to put girls against each other and make some stupid girl drama so they can \"build trust\" in each other? I didn't even get the point of the kiss she saw. She already had a lot on her plate so it was completely unnecessary and the situation was fixed in 0.5 seconds. Boring! Also, the best friend/brother drama is crap. His fiance seemed so nice and they decided to cheat on her and the best friend decided to lie about it. It gives me zero impulse to read more of this weak story line. On the other hand, we also have the best friend who is in love with her and gets mad when she starts to spend time with her big love again. Come on, man, she never raise your hope, she was a friend to you, she didn't own you a damn. It's not her fault she doesn't love you. Then we have the idiotic brother again, leaving all the family drama on her hands and acting stupid. So annoying. The only things I liked were the H going to therapy to work on his issues even though he still kept doing stupid crap like stringing his girlfriend along for three freaking years even though he knew he didn't want something serious. Yes, he told her so, but he was still acting like a crappy boyfriend. She deserved better. Overall the story was just boring, annoying and dissapointing. It had a lot of potential with all the messages about addiction and mental health issues, but that got lost in the middle of the unending drama.",

A m\u00ed s\u00ed me gust\u00f3 la historia y el libro es s\u00faper f\u00e1cil de leer e imposible de cerrar.Los protagonistas son Alina y Chase. Hay mucha historia entre ellos y sus personajes tienen perfiles complicados. Lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 es que la hero\u00edna fue mi favorita. Confieso que muchas veces el rol femenino cae en lo que considero clich\u00e9 y bobo, pero jam\u00e1s sent\u00ed eso con Lee. Me encanta su personalidad, c\u00f3mo se conduce, que dice las cosas como son. Ama profundamente pero no es un tapete. Fui fan.Chase, de repente inspira mis ganas de darle un zape, porque se involucra con pura psycho y no es firme en sus negativas. Pero aprende sus lecciones, busca redimirse y en realidad no es un pat\u00e1n. La relaci\u00f3n tiene momentos de angustia pero contamos con un HEA inconcluso, que da pie a la siguiente historia: Becca con Eli. \u00a1Me urge leerla!ENG ::I was almost persuaded into not reading the book thanks to some reviews, but decided to judge by myself and I\u2019m really glad I did! I liked the story and loved that it\u2019s easy to read and a page-turner book that was impossible to put aside.The main characters are Chase and Alina. Their story starts when they are 13 and 11 and they have lots of depth and complicated life stories. My favorite part? I loved the heroine. Lots of times I roll my eyes at the way authors describe female leads (doormats, pathetic at some point or bit clich\u00e9) but I never felt like this with Lee. She\u2019s amazing! I loved the way she acted, she thought and she expressed herself.Chase at some points made me wanna slap him, for being blind and somewhat naive where women were concerned. He relate himself with psycho profiles. However, he works on himself, he grows and learns. He\u2019s not a jerk and that was cool. Their relationship has angsty feelings and swoony moments. Their HEA is not over and gives us the perfect way to start they new story: Eli and Becca!",
