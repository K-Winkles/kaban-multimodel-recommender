This book was the perfect Christmas read. I was expecting something different when I started reading, as from the summary of the book, I thought it was going to be all about Lucy and her romance with Ross. But it turns out that Lucy is one of four narrators of this book, and each one had an involving story of her own. Really terrific. And one I will be rereading in a few days.",
