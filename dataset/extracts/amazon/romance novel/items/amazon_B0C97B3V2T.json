                "reviewText": "This sweet, but turbulent romance involves two main characters who are each dealing with their own personal adversities, and find that fate brings them together. The story primarily occurs in a secluded estate where three people\u2019s lives unexpectedly meld together. A strong bond forms, but when a nefarious character has his own agenda, separations occur as each looses the necessary trust they had each established. This is a great story, and had an interesting amount of strife that each character brought to the story. Though I found the Duke compassionate and kind, I also thought he lacked courage and grit to fight the necessary battles to find solutions and happiness for all characters. I really liked how the author created the heroine, with her strong temperament, intelligence and selfless acts of kindness. There was plenty of drama, intrigue and secrets that kept the story flowing smoothly. Never let it be said, such a strong villain will ever disappear. The author did an outstanding job in deliberately creating this character in such a way, that it is easy for the reader to despise, and dread every scene he was in. A must read.First major error, typo on book cover in where the title misspells \u201cdukedom\u201d. Also editing issues of missing words, incorrect names for characters, and missing punctuation. Also, it would have been helpful if there was a bigger space break between paragraphs when moving to a new scene. With no space between paragraphs when changing scenes was confusing. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Ralph given his brother\u2019s personal effects when he took the body for burial at their estate in England including his brother\u2019s diary. That is a twist of fate presented in the book Ralph: The Diary prequel to this story, so the spare became the heir. At estate Ralph approached by Conner Edge, the steward of the estate and also a man Ralph\u2019s brother did not trust, although they were all reared on same estate. Trust needs to be earned.Miriam\u2019s father is baron on nearby estate that became financially destitute. Miriam is an altruistic woman that would not let reduced circumstance put her into self-pity, nor stop her efforts to help her family. She applied for employment as a maid unaware it was where Ralph took up residence. Love begins to develop, but Conner, corrupted by bitter envying and blackened heart wants of cause as much difficulty as possible using division and conflict. Conner approaches Miriam and the other maid, who also had a secret, at this cottage intimidates them generating fear in order to succeed at his final goal. Ralph needs to step-up into his title and responsibilities, but his mourning for his brother is major obstruction. Tie in characters from this author\u2019s book Henry helps the flow of the story. Extra chapter leads into next story in series. The Dukedom\u2019s Secrets is a captivating subtitle for this series.Received ARC copy of story and voluntarily posting a review. Thank you Edith Byrd",

I get he was mourning his brother and had no desire to be the duke but running away wasn't the answer.I'm a visual person and I hate it when the author tells you nothing about the characters looks. One of the reason this book grabbed my attention was because of the pictures of the beautiful pictures of the characters. When I have to use my imagination, I lose interest and the story becomes hohum to me.I gave it a 3 even though there were type's but not too bad but it was an easy read but I've read so much better!",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed that this book, is different to the usual historical romance. Unfortunately, I found the hero was not very hero like. He was a weak man couldn\u2019t make decisions and questioned everything. He had had no backbone, but the heroine was really good.She made up for the fact that he was hopeless. There is a lot of repetition, repeating the storyline quite often which was annoying .",
