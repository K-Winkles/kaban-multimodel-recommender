        "description": "From USA Today bestselling author L.J. Shen comes a passion- and angst-charged story about a woman caught between a secure relationship and a once-in-a-lifetime spark with her muse.They say first loves are oftentimes the end of one\u2019s innocence.Those words couldn\u2019t ring truer for Everlynne Lawson, whose first brush with romance came with a heartbreak\u2026and the thing that seems to follow her everywhere she goes. Death.After a great tragedy, Everlynne loses all she cares about\u2015her dreams, her family, and her soulmate, Joe.Guilt-ridden, Everlynne decides to isolate herself in Salem, Massachusetts. A shell of the woman she once was, she takes her days one at a time, careful not to allow herself the joy she believes others in her life were robbed of. But when the mysterious, handsome Dominic storms into her life, it becomes more difficult to stay in solitude. Dominic is different: adventurous, joyous, with lust for life and a passion to make her his.Everlynne is on the cusp of reinventing herself once again when the old wounds of her past are resurrected, rawer than ever. There is nothing worse than being in love with two men.Especially when one of them hates you. Read more",

About 65% in I wanted to quit because the FMC was making me mad. However it was like an episode of greys where I could actually hate mcdreamy, and the FMC came to her senses and eventually moved on. Yes everything I said above could be negative and I gave it 5 stars, but I was so absorbed in this book that I could not put it down\u2026 and I\u2019d totally read again. I loved this book with a love hate passion of emotions that I have not felt before.",

Let alone the other turns it took after that, wow just wow \ud83d\ude2e I must admit some parts had me rolling my eyes because it felt like beating a dead horse (how many times can we have the same battle Ever \ud83d\ude12) but overall I still liked the book & couldn\u2019t put it down so I would definitely recommend it. In my opinion this book is about loss, fear, insecurities, second (& third & fourth) chances, how we can be our own worst enemies & obstacle to living a happier life. We accept we love we think we deserve right?Now as far as the characters\u2026. Joe, oh Joe, how every girl deserves to experience a Joe AT LEAST once in her life (preferably permanently but hey I\u2019m trying to keep it a humble ask). The way this man speaks at 19 leaves a lot to be desired from fully grown men \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 Joe at 8% of the book & barely 19 years old is the epitome of why we have book boyfriends & why we love to read. (After reading the whole book this statement was only solidified even more x1000!)Ever, my dear girl, she had it ROUGH \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 i must admit her character truly lived through some of the worst experiences. I truly don\u2019t know that i could go on had I been in her shoes especially at that age. However, as much as my heart broke for her there was also aspects of her that were so frustrating & annoying to me that it made her a bit unlikable at certain parts.~~~~ Potential Spoiler ~~~~Honorable (or dishonorable \ud83d\ude12) mention to Dom. His introduction to the story was \ud83d\ude19\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd perfectly written in my opinion. He literally made me fall in love with him but turned out to give a whole new meaning to the whole love/hate situation because I really went from loving him to hating him. HOW DARE YOU DOM! \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc94",

It was like she was crawling into darkness and refusing to really live. Even when she met a handsome young man who found her lost cat, EverLynne wasn\u2019t interested in taking him up on his invitation to a date. Not until she met him a few weeks later when he looked like he needed friend, Ever decided to be that friend. She took Dominick out for a burger and let him tell her about his day and didn\u2019t ever correct him when he shortened her name to Lynne.Ever and Dominick eventually started dating and he was the first guy in six years as she still missed Joe, but Dominick was so nice and patient she eventually gave in to him. So what they had nothing really in common, they had fun and Dom was sweet to her.Then we find out that the long lost Joe is the brother that Dominick called Steph as in Joseph, and Ever and Joe have to pretend they don\u2019t know each other. Do you think this will be the worst and most complicated pain that Joe and Ever have to deal with? Not by a long shot, so if you are a fan of dark dramas, this is for you. I have no idea how I got here until I was too invested to bail. Not my cup of tea.",

                "reviewText": "LJ Shen always finds a way to amaze me with her honesty in all of her characters. I loved this book. There are themes of death and insecurity throughout the book, it was such a different and honest take on how people experience life. I cried three times but just couldn\u2019t put the book down - ending up reading all night. Whether you like the characters or not, they all had depth and were 100% themselves. There are so many morals in this novel and it\u2019s still making me thing hours after I\u2019ve finished.Spoiler:There were so many emotional twists and turns that it was hard to keep up. Some of the twists in the plot were a little obvious but the emotionally wrenching feelings that the characters felt were completely real. The guilt and just self blame for so many scenarios that are completely out of peoples control was so real.Leaving Seph and coming back. So frustrating that he kept taking her back. So many of the relationships in this book were so toxic of people hiding secrets and not just coming out with it and speaking their mind. That\u2019s what makes the book ofcourse because it\u2019s what people do in real life - hide away from their feelings, feel entitled, and give their family members a pass on the bs they do even when it\u2019s wrong.",

The first interactions were so cringe... Like taken out of Wattpad or Tumblr. Not what I'm used from this author, and as the book progressed I was wondering were she was going with this, specially when the love triangle appeared, It reminded me to teenage drama in the early 2k. Definitely not my cup of tea. I skipped half of the book but it was well written, cohesive and had great characters.",
