        "description": "True love never fades - and old secrets never die....Nora hasn\u2019t looked back. Not since she fled Texas to start a new life. Away from her father\u2019s volatile temper and the ever-watchful gaze of her claustrophobically conservative small town, Nora has freed herself. She can live - and love - however she wants. The only problem is that she also left behind the one woman she can\u2019t forget. Now, tragedy calls her back home to confront her past - and reconcile her future.Sophie seems to have everything - a wonderful daughter, a successful husband and a rewarding career. Yet underneath that perfection lies an explosive secret. She still yearns for Nora - her best friend and first love - despite all the years between them. Keeping her true self hidden hasn\u2019t been easy, but it\u2019s been necessary. So when Sophie finds out that Nora has returned, she hopes Nora\u2019s stay is short. The life she has built depends on it.But they both find that first love doesn\u2019t fade easily. Memories come to light, passion ignites, and old feelings resurface. As the forces of family and intolerance that once tore them apart begin to reemerge, they realize some things may never change - unless they demand it. Read more",

                "reviewText": "The Secret of You and Me is a retelling of Persuasion, one of my favorite Jane Austen novels. The main characters, Sophie and Nora, fell in love in small town Texas when they were in their late teens, but were separated when Sophie\u2019s conservative mother and Nora\u2019s hard-nosed father found out about their forbidden amour. For almost twenty years, Sophie has remained closeted, playing the dutiful wife to a man with political aspirations, while Nora has been out in the world, making a name for herself. When Nora comes home to bury her father, she must face the feelings she\u2019s thought she\u2019d left behind long ago.I\u2019m so impressed by the complex web of relationships that Lenhardt creates in Lynchfield, and by the time we\u2019re a few chapters in, I was thoroughly immersed in the world-building. I\u2019m not surprised though, as I\u2019ve read a lot of Lenhardt\u2019s other books. There\u2019s a full cast of intriguing secondary characters, including the lingering shadow of Nora\u2019s tough-as-nails father, and Sophie\u2019s tattooed, long-haired AA sponsor. By the time you finish this novel, you\u2019ve got a whole society in your head, and the author does it without taxing the reader.Lenhardt also has a knack for intense dialogue that often reveals the nastier side of the antagonist. This, of course, means that it\u2019s more satisfying when the main character gets the best of them.Then there\u2019s the love story. The relationship between Sophie and Nora was full of the conflict that often comes with a lot of baggage, and it was quite a ride to see them figuring out situations that, from the reader\u2019s perspective, seem impossible to navigate. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how hard it is to come out in small town Texas, this book will give you a glimmer of an idea.The Secret of You and Me is a \u201ckeep you up late at night\u201d page-turner that will stay with you long after you've finished the last page.",

                "reviewText": "I have waited a good while for a lesbian romance novel that I could really sink my teach into and this did not disappoint. So I\u2019ll just make a list of why this is amazing.1. The novel is LONG. So you get an adequate backstory and get more out of the characters. You can feel their emotions and personalities which can we harder with shorter novels.2. It deals with real issues and doesn\u2019t feel far fetched.3. Yes there is infidelity which for some reason a lot of readers are turned off by. I am not one of them. I felt as though there were genuine justifications to the characters actions which were not taken lightly. The author didn\u2019t make me feel as though anything was callous4. It was extremely hard to put down!! I stayed on the edge of my seat the entire time.I probably could go on and on. But this book is at the top 10 of my favorite books in the genre. Kudos to the author for an amazing job!",

I was rooting for the couple up until Alima came into the picture.Alima, Nora's secondary love interest, is infinitely more likeable than Sophie (who I liked less and less as the story went on.)I had to force myself to chew through the last third of this book.

The Secret of You and Me is my first f/f read, but do you know what?! The Secret of You and Me was one of the best second chance romance stories I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reading!Nora and Sophie\u2019s story had me on a rollercoaster of emotions. My poor heartstrings were being pulled left, right and centre. In fact, scratch that rollercoaster analogy \u2013 it was like being on the waltzers. And I hate the flipping waltzers but call me a masochist (shut it!), I loved every heart stopping word of their journey *sighs*.Has ever a love story been so hard fought?! But if anything is worth fighting for it\u2019s love. Sorry, my sap level is currently set to high *palms face* Fair warning, I may start gushing soon. (Hormones have a lot to answer for, don\u2019t they?!)Secrets and lies abound in TSoYaM. I may say I don\u2019t, but you all know I love a bit of angst and, boy, did I get it! I wanted to do some head knocking (quelle surprise). I may have also threatened certain pieces of a character\u2019s anatomy *shrugs*. I apologise for nothing. It was very much deserved...Yet doesn\u2019t the truth always find a way to be revealed? At the end of the day, don\u2019t we at least have to be true to ourselves? I\u2019m all about the questions today, aren\u2019t I? Oops! *snorts*I cried (a few times!). In fact, the end of Chapter Twenty One had me sobbing my heart out. I\u2019m such an ugly crier *rolls eyes*.As you can imagine, TSoYaM tackles some sensitive issues and the tricky subject of prejudice. *sighs* I hate that is still a very real issue in our world today. I keep my fingers crossed for one day, one day, when who we love no longer matters.Yes, *nods* I agree. This is definitely one of my most cryptic reviews to date. I just want you to go in blind and let Nora and Sophie tell you their story their way. Are they without flaws, heck no, but doesn\u2019t that make them all the more relatable? Oops, I did it again *giggles*.I was amazed at how quick I read this book. I just got lost and didn\u2019t want it to end.My first Melissa Lenhardt read, and I hope, by no means by last.",

It didn\u2019t take long before I was invested. Personally I liked the conflicts, the secrets (and even the angst) but I LOVED Nora\u2019s dialogue battles (especially with the dreadful Brenda) and her feistiness. I really didn\u2019t know how it was all going to be resolved (which is a pleasant change in lesfic!) but ended up feeling happy at the outcome. Proof also that not giving vivid gynaecological descriptions of sex can pay off...and even add to the sexiness!",
