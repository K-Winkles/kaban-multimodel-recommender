                "reviewText": "A phone call from Krysset, Minnesota, hundreds of miles and several years away from Sophia Lancaster\u2019s current life, lures her back home. Sophia is stunned to learn her grandfather has just passed and has named her in his will. All she has to do to inherit his lake resort in Krysset-the place Sophia called home until she was eight years old-is live on the property for a year and run the resort with her childhood friend, Jackson Cooper. If they turn a profit after a year, they will be coheirs.Though Sophia decides to throw herself whole-heartedly into the challenge issued by her grandfather-Jackson\u2019s longtime boss and friend-she quickly learns success will not come easily. First she has to fight through the sorrow the memories bring; she\u2019s been gone from the resort for twenty-one years, and walking back into her childhood home is much harder than she\u2019d thought it would be. Then there\u2019s Jackson, childhood friend turned angry and bitter for how she walked out on her grandparents. Jackson\u2019s all grown up, and he\u2019s pretty easy on the eyes. Oh, and it seems someone in Krysset doesn\u2019t want Sophia and Jackson to succeed with the resort.Kate Carley\u2019s debut romance, Challenged, is a scorcher. Kate describes the resort in such beautiful detail that readers will want to call Lancaster\u2019s and book a week\u2019s vacation in one of the new A-frame cabins Jackson built. Her characters are well developed, with their own pasts and motivations, and Carley builds the sexual tension higher and higher, until finally bringing the heat. Readers who enjoy sweet, but smoking hot romance, and a little mystery besides, are going to love this one! Tracy Broemmer, author of the Lorelei Bluffs series",

She did a great job with developing the backstory of each character, Sophia and Jackson, as well as creating their distinct character identities. There was something in this book for everyone - drama, intrigue, romance and a happily ever after ending. I'm looking forward to her next book in the series.",

                "reviewText": "Challenged is quite a good read.It\u2019s a blend of romance and suspense with a touch of mystery. When her grandpa passes away, Sophie faces the challenge of a lifetime. Work together with long-lost friend, Jackson, to prove they can run the resort successfully, or bow out and give him the resort, passing on an opportunity to rediscover her past and forge a new future. She takes the challenge.What I like most about this story is the mystery. There\u2019s someone out to get Sophie and Jackson, or at least to get their inheritance, but it isn\u2019t obvious. Not only do the two need to figure it out, the stakes get higher and higher the longer it takes them. We get some glimpses into their opposition, and at one point it seemed like the villain was named, but I think maybe I just misinterpreted it, staying up too late to read.Another thing I liked was how the budding romance plays out between Jackson and Sophie. They fight their instincts and attraction, holding out for a real connection, but when they finally give in, it\u2019s all fireworks and playful banter and sweetness rolled together. Their intimate scenes are detailed, but tasteful and realistic, and I love how the emotions don\u2019t play second.I\u2019m not completely sold on the perspectives switching off, especially during the intimate scenes, but it does let you get into the heads of both Jackson and Sophie. Still, I think it was pretty well done overall. Each character\u2019s voice comes through so you aren\u2019t left guessing who\u2019s thinking what. There are a few times where the story kicks into full third person, but for the most part, it\u2019s limited third person, covering either Sophie or Jackson.Overall, I really liked this story. It\u2019s a great blend of suspense, mystery and romance in a modern, small town setting. Folks who dig romance with a good story backing it will likely either really like or even love this one. On the other hand, folks who don\u2019t prefer a lot of focus on attraction and intimacy might not find this a good fit, as those are a huge part of this story.I received a copy of this book from the author in return for a non-reciprocal review.",

The external world intruding on their private reckoning adds tension to the novel, and lifts it.The cover does not do it justice. There is more to this book than the boring and terribly cliched 'shirtless man' would suggest. Indeed, the plot develops nicely, and it goes beyond the usual cardboard cutout characterisation one usually encounters in books with such a himbo on the front.",

She does a wonderful job writing where you feel like you are right there in the story with the characters and living their lives with them.

Well developed story line and strong characters make it even more enjoyable.
