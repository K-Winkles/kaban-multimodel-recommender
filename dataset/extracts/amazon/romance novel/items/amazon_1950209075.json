I cried. I screamed. I had to take a breather multiple times. I was frustrated. I was THERE.Dallas was quite frustrating but we have to give her a break. I mean she didn\u2019t have much choice in the beginning!However, her still causing fusses and being unreasonable AFTER Romeo gave her the option to LEAVE was incredibly infuriating.Nonetheless, I adored the way Dallas and Romeos story unfolded.\u201c\ud835\udc18\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\u2019\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d.\u201c^ Yet another beautiful quote from this book.My husband and I actually use a similar quote for our relationship \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite risk.\u201dSeeing this small quote pulled at my heart strings.

                "reviewText": "I started this book expecting the usual mafia style romance. What I discovered was the antics of the not-as-crazy-as-she-appears Dallas and the cold Romeo Costa, the man who becomes her husband through a bit of social manipulation (literally being caught with his hand in her pants). Two stories run in parallel: Romeo's revenge against his father and his desire to break the wild child Dallas for no other reason than association with a rival and that she fits his father's superficial template of the perfect wife. Dallas' antics escalate as Romeo tries to use intimidation and head games to bend her to his will, and I enjoyed more than a few belly laughs at the craziness of it all. However, there is also a serious side with death threats and betrayal that add the bit of grounding needed in the story. The characters could be a bit farfetched at times, but the personalities needed to match their actions. Simply did not expect the book to be as funny as it is.",

                "reviewText": "SPOILER FREE REVIEWThis book was pretty good, I liked Romeo's character and the way he was written a lot. I didn't like the main character very much, though, which knocked this book's rating down. She's not very interesting, and quite annoying at times. It's rare that I read a book and not like the character whose perspective the book is written from. I feel like Romeo was extremely well written and the small changes in his demeanor leading up to the end of the book are subtle but easy to pick up on towards the end of the book. I liked Romeo's friends a lot and the way he's more relaxed with them throughout the book. I did, however, find the basic plot of the story to be just that- basic. A rude rich guy marries a hot, but annoying woman because of his enemy and then falls in love with her. A lot of books are written with this basic plot, but they add to it, making it more interesting and less cliche. Take King of Wrath, same basic storyline, but the author added so much to both main characters that the book was impossible to put down. I think the author of this book was so focused on Romeo's character that she forgot about the main character. She simply made the main annoying, with no depth. She's like a beautiful pool that looks full of promise, then you try to jump in and it's only a few inches deep. Also, the smut is awful. It's poorly written, and downright weird in some chapters. I don't usually read much of it anyway, I usually just skip, but I noticed that some of the scenes the author wrote are just weird and grossed me out.I think the author could do so much with this book if she added more depth to the main and the plot, and took out some of the poorly written inappropriate scenes.",

                "reviewText": "Obsessed with this story, in love with this couple and there are some steamy moments that will linger in my mind for a while!My Dark Romeo written by Parker S Huntington and LJ Shen starts with a debutante ball in a small town in Georgia in which Dark, Powerful and Larger than Life Romeo catches the attention of everyone, everyone's except for Dallas'. Dallas is more focused on the sweet treats (English Shortbread) in Romeo's table which peaks Romeo's interest in this wild creature. Romeo offers Dallas a quick escape, an adventure before she has to fulfill her commitment with her selected fiance Madison. What starts as a fling ends up being Dallas' worst nightmare as she gets caught and is treated as damaged goods being promised to Romeo, a husband she doesn't want and is shipped to DC, away from her family and her friends. Would cold Romeo warm to sweet, smart Dallas or will Dallas wilt under Romeo's care?My Dark Romeo is definitely one of my Top Readings of 2023: we have a marriage of convenience (or inconvenience due to its rough start) between a dark, broody and secretive Hero looking for revenge and a sassy, super smart and even vengeful heroine that will stop at nothing until she gets more than Romeo's attention. Not only everything she does to catch it, but Romeo's reaction to her actions are definitely super fun to read. Romeo was a Hero like no other, his inner conflict was amazing. Dallas stole my heart! Also there are some amazing side characters that definitely need their own story. I can't wait for what these two authors have prepared for us, this literary world is ready to shake us all readers.What to Expect:Dark RomanceMarriage of Convenience (or Inconvenience? Lol!)Vengeful HeroSassy and Super Smart HeroineAmazing Side Characters (we need their story asap)",
