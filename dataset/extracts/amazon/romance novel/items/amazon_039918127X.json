            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cRomantic, warm, and a breeze to read\u2014one of Macomber\u2019s best.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews\u201cMacomber never disappoints. Tears and laughter abound in this story of loss and healing that will wrap you up and pull you in; readers will finish it in one sitting.\u201d\u2014Library Journal (starred review) \u201cMacomber\u2019s patented recipe of idyllic small-town life with a touch of romance is sure to result in a summer best-seller.\u201d\u2014Booklist \u201cMacomber\u2019s story of tragedy and triumph is emotionally engaging from the outset and ends with a satisfying conclusion. Readers will be most taken by the characters, particularly Annie, a heartwarming lead who bolsters the novel.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly About the Author Debbie Macomber, the author of It's Better This Way, A Walk Along the Beach, Window on the Bay, Cottage by the Sea, Any Dream Will Do, If Not for You, and the Rose Harbor Inn series, is a leading voice in women's fiction. Thirteen of her novels have reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, and five of her beloved Christmas novels have been hit movies on the Hallmark Channel, including Mrs. Miracle and Mr. Miracle.

All rights reserved. CHAPTER 1Annie Marlow hated to disappoint her parents, but she simply wasn\u2019t going to fly home to Seattle for Thanksgiving. She\u2019d already made the arrangements for Christmas and it was too late to change everything now. She had plans.Working as a physician assistant, Annie didn\u2019t get many four-day weekends, and Trevor was cooking a turkey and had invited her over for the day. Steph would be there, too, and they were both anxious to meet a cute young doctor who had recently joined the clinic at another site.What her mother really wanted, Annie realized, was a family photo for the Christmas card her parents routinely sent out each year. For all she cared, they could photoshop her in. There wasn\u2019t any need for her to change her plans, especially now, less than a week before Thanksgiving.Gabby, her cousin, was flying to Los Angeles to join them. Giving up time with Gabby for a Christmas-card photo? Not happening. Besides, Annie had a new pair of four-inch designer heels and a dress she intended to use for a girls\u2019 night out on the town.Her mother tried again, laying on the guilt. \u201cAnnie, please?\u201d\u201cMom, you can\u2019t change everything at the last minute like this.\u201d She glanced at the time and inwardly groaned. Much more of this conversation and she\u2019d be late meeting Steph for their yoga class.\u201cYour brother is coming with Kelly and the baby.\u201dThis was her mom\u2019s best inducement? Her brother? The favored son? She had already seen Mike and his family twice this year. \u201cHe was planning to be there for Christmas, too, remember.\u201d Mike was the one who needed to change everything around. It was unfair that she should rearrange her entire life to suit her brother\u2019s schedule.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been together as a family since August.\u201dPressing the phone to her ear, Annie became impatient as her mother continued speaking.\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the baby in a while. Did you know Bella is walking already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see Bella when I drive up this Christmas. I\u2019ll make sure to stop in Portland on my way through,\u201d Annie protested. \u201cMom, please. We\u2019ve been through this already.\u201dHer phone dinged, indicating she had a text message. Putting her phone on speaker, she checked the text to see that Steph had sent her a selfie. Her friend was gorgeous, with her purple-tinged hair. She\u2019d made a pouty face and looked like she was kissing through the phone.Annie laughed.\u201cAnnie? Are you laughing at me?\u201d\u201cNo, sorry, Mom,\u201d she said, squelching her amusement. \u201cSteph just sent me a text.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d so hoped you would change your mind.\u201d\u201cSorry, Mom, really I wish I could, but I simply can\u2019t.\u201d Well, she could, but not without ruining her own plans. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me,\u201d she said, trying to soothe her mother\u2019s disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019ll be involved with Kelly and the baby, and Dad will spend all of his time with Mike.\u201d Bella would command all their attention; they cherished this first grandchild. To be fair, Bella was adorable. It was hard to believe she was walking already.\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t change your mind about Christmas, then, will you?\u201d her mother asked. Annie had been given the chance to work last Christmas, and with money so tight, she\u2019d jumped at the chance at double-time. Her parents had no idea what the cost of living was like in southern California, and how hard it was to make ends meet.\u201cI\u2019ll be home for Christmas, Mom, I promise.\u201d She hated it when her mother doubted her. One time, one measly time when she didn\u2019t get home for the holidays, and her mother refused to forgive her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to harp on you,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment is all.\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, too, but Gabby and I have the entire weekend planned. If I\u2019d known sooner I could have made other arrangements, but it\u2019s too late now. It\u2019s only a few weeks and I\u2019ll be home for Christmas. I have my own life, you know.\u201dHer mother\u2019s frustrated sigh came through the line. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, honey.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cStubborn,\u201d her mother countered. \u201cFamily is what\u2019s important. I know you have a lot going on, but your father and I are getting up in age. We won\u2019t be around forever, you know.\u201dAnnie couldn\u2019t believe her mother. This was a new low when it came to making her feel bad, reminding Annie that at some point in the future her parents would die. It was ridiculous, seeing that they were both healthy and in the prime of their lives. Biting down on her lower lip, she resisted the urge to tell her mom that she was being absurd.Her mother seemed to sense that she\u2019d gone too far with the guilt. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d she quickly rebounded. \u201cInvite Trevor.\u201dWhat her mother didn\u2019t understand was that she wasn\u2019t romantically interested in Trevor. She\u2019d happened to mention his name a time or two, and she had yet to hear the end of it ever since then. Inviting him to Seattle would only perpetuate the idea that they were involved. He was a friend, and besides, Steph had set her sights on him. There\u2019d never been any sparks between him and Annie. She liked him, though, and he was fun to hang out with. It didn\u2019t hurt that he was a terrific dancer and being on the floor with him generated her a lot of attention.\u201cYou like him, right?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a friend, Mom, nothing more. Besides, you\u2019re forgetting about Gabby. She\u2019s already purchased her ticket. I\u2019m picking her up at LAX early Wednesday afternoon.\u201d Annie had already mentioned her cousin\u2019s visit a dozen times or more.\u201cOh right.\u201dHer mother had yet to recognize how unreasonable she was being. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely sorry to disappoint you, Mom, but this whole family Thanksgiving just isn\u2019t going to work this year.\u201d\u201cOkay, honey, I understand. We\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\u201cMom, I really need to go.\u201d\u201cOkay. Just one more thing. I wasn\u2019t going to tell you since I thought you\u2019d be home for Thanksgiving, because I wanted to surprise you.\u201dTime was ticking away. Grabbing her yoga mat and her bag, Annie headed for the front door of her condo.\u201cDad and I remodeled the kitchen. We bought all new appliances and countertops. You won\u2019t recognize it!\u201d Her parents loved their home and had saved thirty years to build it. It was on a hillside that overlooked Puget Sound. The views were stunning. Her parents had purchased the property years earlier and then diligently saved and sacrificed to build the home of their dreams.\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom. I\u2019ll see it at Christmas. Love you.\u201d\u201cLove you, too.\u201d\u201cBefore you go, your dad wants to say hi.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not going to pressure me about Thanksgiving, is he?\u201d\u201cNo, silly.\u201d She must have handed off the phone because the next voice Annie heard was her father\u2019s.\u201cHow\u2019s my daughter, the doctor?\u201d her father asked. He\u2019d wanted Annie to continue on to medical school.\u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, Dad.\u201d Annie had grown tired of school. The breakup with her college boyfriend had devastated her, and she\u2019d been eager to be done. Instead of continuing school to get a medical degree, she\u2019d opted to become a physician assistant.\u201cSomeday,\u201d her dad said. He never seemed to lose a chance to remind Annie of her dream of working in medicine. What he didn\u2019t understand nor seem to appreciate was that she did work in medicine, just not as a physician.They spoke, and Annie found herself glancing at the time. \u201cDad, I\u2019d love to chat more, but I\u2019m meeting a friend.\u201d\u201cBye, sweetheart.\u201d\u201cBye, Dad.\u201dAnnie pulled into the gym at the last minute and found Steph impatiently waiting outside. Together they rushed into their class. Afterward, Annie felt worlds better, relaxed and in good spirits.They stopped for a smoothie at the juice bar, and while Steph wasn\u2019t looking, Annie snapped a selfie of the two of them and tweeted it.\u201cLet me see, let me see,\u201d Steph protested and then laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re bad.\u201d\u201cHey, we both look great.\u201d\u201cIs it Gram-worthy?\u201dAnnie laughed. \u201cLooks like it to me,\u201d she confirmed, and posted the photo on Instagram, so Gabby would see it. She couldn\u2019t wait for Gabby to arrive on Wednesday; Annie had looked forward to cousin time for weeks. The two were close in age and had been best friends nearly their entire lives. Gabby had recently ended a six-month relationship, and Annie intended to do everything she could to make her forget Geoff, starting off with a pre-Thanksgiving party with friends from the clinic at a popular night spot.Thanksgiving morning, Annie woke with a killer hangover. Her head felt like someone was inside swinging a sledgehammer, and her mouth was as dry as an Arizona riverbed. The incessant ringing of her phone, which was sitting on the nightstand by her bed, made it even worse. Caller ID showed that it was her aunt Sherry, Gabby\u2019s mother. Why, in the name of all that was decent, was she calling Annie at this time of the morning? Gabby had checked in with her mom when she landed. She was more than ready to hand the phone off to her cousin, who rolled over and grumbled at the interruption.\u201cHello,\u201d Annie barely managed to say, holding her hand firmly against her forehead, hoping that this would appease the tiny men inside her brain, so they\u2019d stop hammering.\u201cAnnie.\u201d Aunt Sherry\u2019s voice was breathless, as if someone had knocked the wind out of her. \u201cOh Annie . . . Annie.\u201dSitting up in her bed at the sound of tears in her aunt\u2019s voice, Annie asked, \u201cAunt Sherry, do you need Gabby? She\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cNo . . . no. I need to tell you.\u201d\u201cTell me what?\u201dA gasping sob escaped her aunt.Annie tensed and keeping her voice steady and low, asked, \u201cAre you okay, Aunt Sherry?\u201d Seeing how serious the conversation was sounding, Annie put the call on speaker for Gabby to listen in.By this time, her cousin had sat up and was rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The two exchanged looks and Annie shrugged, unable to decipher what was happening.\u201cDo you . . . Do you . . . television . . . Is it on?\u201d her aunt asked, barely getting the words out.\u201cNo. Aunt Sherry, for the love of heaven, just tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d As Annie spoke, she reached for the remote and turned on the television, switching channels to the twenty-four-hour news station. She tuned in, and the first thing that popped onto the screen was a Thanksgiving Day advertisement from Macy\u2019s, which told her nothing.Instead of answering, her aunt started sobbing. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, Annie. I . . . I don\u2019t even know how . . . I don\u2019t know . . . how to tell you.\u201dAs a physician assistant, Annie had often dealt with people in crisis mode. \u201cTake a deep breath, count to five, then take another breath, and start at the beginning,\u201d she advised her aunt in a calm, soothing voice. Her immediate suspicion was that something had happened to Lyle, the man her aunt had been dating for the last fifteen years. That didn\u2019t make sense, though. She would have called Gabby if that had been the case.\u201cI\u2019m . . . trying.\u201d Aunt Sherry counted softly, out loud, and sucked in another breath, just as Annie had recommended. \u201cYour mom . . . and dad . . .\u201dAnnie tensed. \u201cMy mom and dad?\u201d\u201cThey . . . invited me to breakfast.\u201dHer mother had always made a big deal about breakfast on Thanksgiving, inviting family and friends over.\u201cI . . . wanted to see . . . the baby . . . Bella.\u201d Her words were staccatolike between sobs; she was having trouble even getting the words out.\u201cAunt Sherry,\u201d Annie said softly. \u201cHas something happened to my parents?\u201dHer aunt ignored the question. \u201cWhen I got . . . close . . . just . . . two blocks away . . .\u201d She continued in the same jerky speech. \u201cThe police . . . they . . . stopped me.\u201d\u201cThe police?\u201d Annie repeated, her mind whirling. \u201cWhat were the police doing there?\u201d\u201cThey . . . had . . . It was barricaded.\u201d\u201cA barricade?\u201d Annie hated that she sounded like an echo, but her aunt wasn\u2019t making a whole lot of sense.\u201cIt\u2019s . . . been raining . . . and raining.\u201d\u201cWell, that happens in Seattle quite a bit.\u201d Annie impatiently added, \u201cEspecially around this time of year.\u201d The Seattle area was known for its rainfall, which was another reason Annie chose to live in California.\u201cAnnie,\u201d her aunt said, sobbing hysterically, while sucking in deep breaths between her words. \u201cYou . . . You . . . don\u2019t understand, the entire hillside . . . is gone. It . . . simply . . . gave way, taking . . . taking everything with . . . it.\u201dGabby gasped at the news.Annie slowly rose out of her bed, standing with one hand pressing against her forehead while the other pressed the phone to her ear. \u201cAre you telling me Mom and Dad\u2019s house slid off the hillside?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Aunt Sherry said and gasped. \u201cTheir house . . . and . . . twenty . . . other homes.\u201dAnnie froze and glanced at the television screen. Breaking news had just interrupted the newscast. A helicopter was flying over the water, identified on the screen below as Puget Sound. A single home was breaking apart in the mud-caked waters below the helicopter and sinking into the water.\u201cMom and Dad?\u201d Annie pleaded, as her heart pounded at the seriousness of what had happened. \u201cDid they get out?\u201d\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know . . . I don\u2019t know how they could have. Everyone said it happened so fast, and so early . . .\u201dAnnie fell back onto her bed, her legs shaking so hard they wouldn\u2019t hold her up any longer. Her entire body began to tremble. \u201cHow early this morning?\u201d\u201cThe officer said . . . it happened around four . . . They think . . . most everyone was still in bed. No . . . notice. No . . . warning.\u201dThe tightness in Annie\u2019s chest made it impossible to speak. It was highly likely that her entire family had just been wiped out in a mudslide.Her mother.Her father.Her brother.Her sister-in-law.And her baby niece.Annie\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t absorb what she was hearing and seeing on the television. Her aunt\u2019s sobs echoed in her ear and seemed to be reverberating against the walls of her head.\u201cAnnie?\u201d her aunt sobbed. \u201cAre . . . Are you there? Say . . . something.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Annie managed to whisper. She inhaled and followed her own advice, counting to five and then breathing in again, hoping the technique would calm the rising sense of panic that threatened to overcome her. \u201cI . . . I need . . . I\u2019ll get there as soon as I can.\u201d\u201cGood. Have Gabby . . . make . . . Have her do . . . the flight arrangements.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d How calm she sounded, Annie thought to herself, but her voice wasn\u2019t her own. It seemed to come from across the room somewhere. Her cousin placed her arms around her, hugging her closely. \u201cFind out what you can before I get there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll . . . do what . . . I\u2019ll see what I can learn.\u201d\u201cThere must be survivors,\u201d Annie insisted, doing her best to think positively, convinced her parents had somehow found a way to escape. She had to believe they were alive, because anything else would be impossible to accept.\u201cI\u2019ll do . . . what I can. I promise, but . . .\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Annie demanded, her voice gaining in strength.\u201cBut . . . Annie . . . there\u2019s little hope for survivors. I\u2019m so sorry, so very sorry.\u201d Read more"

Rocked by tragedy, she heads to the one place that makes her happy: Oceanside in the Pacific Northwest, the destination of many family vacations when Annie was a teenager. Once there, Annie begins to restore her broken spirit, thanks in part to the folks she meets: a local painter, Keaton, whose large frame is equal to his big heart\u2014and who helps Annie fix up her rental cottage by the sea; Mellie, the reclusive, prickly landlord Annie is determined to befriend; and Britt, a teenager with a terrible secret. But it is Keaton to whom Annie feels most drawn. His quiet, peaceful nature offers her both comfort and reprieve from her grief, and the two begin to grow closer. Then events threaten to undo the idyll Annie has come to enjoy. And when the opportunity of a lifetime lands in her lap, she is torn between the excitement of a new journey toward success and the safe and secure arms of the haven\u2014and the man\u2014she\u2019s come to call home. In this heartwarming tale, Annie finds that the surest way to fix what is damaged within is to help others rise above their pain and find a way to heal.Praise for Cottage by the Sea\u201cMacomber never disappoints.

                "reviewText": "Debbie Macomber delivers a strong and emotional story that will tear at your heart in more ways than ever in COTTAGE BY THE SEA. With her trademark writing style, she delivers a story that is full of heart and at times lots of pain though tinged with hope. I loved this new release by one of my favorite authors. She created a story that is at times quite emotional, loving and with a sweep of her pen, romantic as well. When I first met Annie, she was full of life, hope and delight, determined to have a four-day weekend with her friends, to have fun without family obligations getting in her way. In all reality, a typical twenty-something who thinks she has the whole world to get to the heart of things later. As many know, life sometimes doesn\u2019t deliver all rainbows and sunshine, especially when tragedy strikes. Annie made me love her and I in turn loved how she was able to finally breath, find peace and a chance to love once more. The small town of Oceanside worked its magic on Annie and I found it so irresistible. I was longing to see if this special town was real just to visit it one day. With each page I read, I was sucked not Annie\u2019s story, of her coming to grips with her loss and finding her new normal; grieving yet also finding peace that has eluded her for over a year. The story flows so smoothly I didn\u2019t know I was at the end of the book until I turned the page and saw there was nothing left of Annie, Keaton and their friends story.Ms. Macomber delivers a story that is at once powerful yet charming. A story that will stay with you long after you are done with the book. The characters made me laugh, cry, smile and sigh. I loved meeting Annie, Keaton and the residents of Oceanside so very much. Ms. Macomber has a knack to creating a story that leaves you breathless and longing for more. If you haven\u2019t tried one of her books before, this is a perfect introduction into her writing. I do want to point out you may need a box of tissues at times as you fall into Annie\u2019s life and loss. COTTAGE BY THE SEA is a fast-paced story that will leave you with a smile in your heart and on your face. I look forward to seeing where this author goes next as I know I won\u2019t be disappointed with her next story.",

I just think personally it was her writing style...too sweet...too cheesey. The story had a good plot but at times rushed a lot, the timeliness felt off. She tended to repeat herself a LOT! I didn't feel as connected to the mc as I wanted. The sub characters had better personalities in my opinion.It wasn't a bad story or even written bad...just simply not my taste. Her work definitely has a home but this work did not for me. In time I may try another.",

                "reviewText": "Debbie Macomber\u2019s newest book, Cottage by the Sea is a sweet romance. There is no other description that works better. She takes characters that have been thrown curves in life (Curves that would take most people down.) and allows them to find a home with hope. This skill is highlighted in her newest novel.Annie was enjoying life as a young person. She had a great career, friends and had a fun time. When she was asked to come home for Thanksgiving, she declined having made prior plans. It was that simple plan that changed Annie\u2019s world and now she needs to find a way to move on. It is hard to start again, so she goes to her last happy place, a small beachtown in the Pacific Northwest.Keaton has always known what it is like to be an outsider. He was big, ungainly and didn\u2019t speak. He knew he was unloved and unlovable. He has a few friends and a life in the seaside town, when he saw the woman who was the girl he fell for so many years ago\u2026Keaton and Annie have a chance to change their hopes and expectations, but along the way they bring Mellie and Preston. The ability to move beyond the past and start again. The story takes many twists and turns and each step allows you to fall deeper and deeper in love with the characters and their plight.This sweetness in a story is not my usual level of enjoyment. I like books that are a little edgier, but I will take a Debbie Macomber novel like this any day! It was a fast read, the characters, stories and problems to resolve. I was all in from the first.Thank you NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book. A Cottage by the Sea by Debbie Macomber is a great read.",

She goes back to her happy place and sets about finding her place in that community.I loved the characters and setting, one day I'll get to the Pacific Northwest to see what it's like for myself!Could there be another story about Annie in this?
