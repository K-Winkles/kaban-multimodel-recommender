The author did an amazing job of switching back and fourth from past to present I loved getting to see the friendship and romance blossom between the two main characters during those summers when they were growing up. You could see and feel the love they had for one another. I had every intention of giving this book 5 stars until the end. I didn\u2019t love some of the choices made by some of the main characters and I felt like there were a couple holes for me in the ending for me but overall I did enjoy this book and would recommend picking it up and giving it a read!",

                "reviewText": "Persephone is thirty years old and she just got dumped. She didn\u2019t really care, he didn\u2019t mean much to her and she never really let him in, even after seven months. She gets a phone call that has her racing back to her past, the small town of Barry\u2019s Bay, and back into the life of the one who got away\u2026 Sam Florek.For six summers Percy and Sam were inseparable. The friendship naturally blossomed and grew into something more and he became the man she never wanted to live without, until it fell apart in a splash.Percy returns for Sam\u2019s mothers funeral and all the feelings come rushing back, their connection burning as brightly as it had twelve years ago. But Percy has a secret, a reason for why she broke up with him, and until she tells him, they can never be together.Told in dual timelines, we unravel the mystery of the once in a lifetime love story between two people who were as fated as a couple could be.First and foremost, there are not one but TWO John Candy references in this book. He is a late Canadian actor who was popular in the 80s. Most will know him as the Polka Player from home alone but I know him from so much more. Trust me, he deserves this paragraph of recognition and I praise the author for including him as he is slowly being forgotten.Now onto the story.I loved it. No ifs ands or buts about it. I absolutely love this story. It is a dual timeline, second chance romance and I think it got me out of my reading slump. I finished it in less than 2 days and couldn\u2019t put it down.The history of the characters, watching them slowly fall in love and come to terms with their feelings. Seeing how they struggle over the long distances and other romances that pop up. It was so well written and it felt like I was watching two people I knew in real life fall for each other. It was so realistic , even the lows had me tearing up but remaining hopeful.The twist, the reason why they broke up, was predictable. I saw it coming not long into the book but it didn\u2019t take away from the heartache I felt when it was revealed.I enjoyed that we also got to explore relationships outside of the main love interest. We got to know Percy\u2019s friends and how they interacted with Sam too which was a nice break from the romance and gave depth outside of the love interest.Great book and I\u2019m so thankful it got recommended to me.",
