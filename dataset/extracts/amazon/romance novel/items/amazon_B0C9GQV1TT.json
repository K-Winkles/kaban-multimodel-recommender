        "description": "#1 Indie Next Pick!A Hall of Fame LibraryReads pick!One of People\u2019s Best Books to Read in FebruaryA dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha Werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love, Theoretically and The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast\u2014again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange\u2014again... Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It\u2019s clear from the way he tracks Misery\u2019s every movement that he doesn\u2019t trust her. If only he knew how right he was\u2026. Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what\u2019s hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory\u2026alone with the wolf. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Words cannot describe the absolute ecstatic joy I felt when I found out that one of my all time favorite authors Ali Hazelwood was dipping her toes into the Romantasy/Urban fantasy/Paranormal romance genre with Bride. I went into this ARC with so much hope because I literally couldn\u2019t imagine anything better than my favorite STEMinist leaping into my favorite genre and boy did Ali come prepared to knock my socks off! We get the beloved wit, charm, relatability and honesty that she injects into everything she touches while seamlessly stepping into the omegaverse. There\u2019s nothing heavy handed or new feeling here, it\u2019s like she\u2019s been writing Fantasy her whole career. She nailed the pacing, world building, explanation of complex magical and political systems without feeling like an info dump. She masterfully played out the tension until it\u2019s just ready to snap and has you furiously turning pages because will they or won\u2019t they?! Our girl knows what she\u2019s doing and does not belong stuck in just one genre, fling the doors open Ali is here to deliver!Bride is quite literally everything I had hoped for and so much more! I didn\u2019t dislike a single thing. We get some of my absolute favorite tropes like he falls first, forced proximity, found family and touch her and perish. We get a FMC who you just can\u2019t to scoop up and love and remind that she is so incredibly powerful even if she doesn\u2019t know it yet. I altogether felt seen and heard by Misery in ways I haven\u2019t felt since I read Love on the Brain last, (which is a constant reread for me) and as always Ali Hazelwood will have you closing this book feeling that much less alone in this world, even if ours isn\u2019t filled with the paranormal. I just hope that this isn\u2019t the last of her ventures into this genre (and others, go for it Ali!) because I\u2019m ready to devour anything and everything she has to offer after she came out of the gate with this triumph. Can Ali write a bad book? I\u2019m pretty sure the answer is a resounding absolutely not!Thank you so much for the opportunity to read for Berkley. My views are entirely my own.",

                "reviewText": "As others have remarked, it\u2019s a great book with occasional laugh out loud moments. Hazelwood has improved her writing again, with a lot of creativity so the book feels fresh (and not just another vampire romance) and a book to return to again and again.I hope that she improves on her world building and that she continues the vampire/were/human series - there\u2019s so many questions that aren\u2019t answered and I feel that would draw us in further. Of all her books, Lowe was my least favorite male lead - I think he treated the female lead terribly in one scene (and felt lukewarm in a bunch of others) and the commitment conflict was resolved in a way that seemed detached (Misery has to confront Lowe after Lowe just leaves Misery in vampire land and returns to his territory <<and he doesn\u2019t tell her he\u2019s leaving??? Not acceptable..>> ). These points aside, the other scenes in this book make up for it (e.g., the heartwarming scene where Misery meets Lowe as a wolf). I can\u2019t wait for the next one!",

But I can't stop there. Y'ALL. EVERYTHING ALI WRITES IS GOLD, but this book was SO FUN.Misery agrees to a forced marriage of convenience in order to enter Were territory to find the only friend she's ever had, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. What she never expected was:1. A thoughtful \"husband\" who tried taking care of her, despite her \"smell\"2. Ana, whom she comes to care for quite quickly, and whose relationship had me LOLing any time the two conversed3. To find her sense of humor4. To find people who like her for her for the first time in her life and DESPITE the fact that she's an enemy to them in the rules of the natural worldThings I LOVED about this book:- THE BANTER and joking between the two main characters was so fun and flirty yet dry and clever- THE TWIST... to say I GASPED at the third act drama would be an UNDERSTATEMENT- Ana, Sparkles, Ana's shenanigans, Ana's replacement of words that *almost* make sense, all of Ana's existence in this book- Lowe's softer, gentler, more loving side (which is in no way saying he's a soft or gentle lover for Misery... but he is those things at the same time and it's MAGIC)- Lowe's obsession with Misery's fangs- Lowe \"reading Misery's file\" but also just his general need to know things about her- HONEY- Scenting- Feeding- Mates- Misery seeing Lowe as a wolf *woof*- Misery's obsession with baths that leads to Lowe's obsession with baths ;)- The way Lowe makes Misery feel like she BELONGS to someone, finallyThis book took me through all of the emotions, but mostly I just ENJOYED this book SO MUCH. Ali stan forever. Can't wait for book two! :)",

Misery es lista, divertida, independiente y genial. La trama me enganch\u00f3 y el romance pues ya sab\u00eda que me iba a gustar, del estilo de la autora. Algunas cosas previsibles, pero no me quitaron disfrute",
