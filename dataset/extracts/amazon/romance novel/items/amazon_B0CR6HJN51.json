                "reviewText": "A tale about a feud between two families, happening over several generations. An arranged marriage with a member from each family is decided, to help the reputations of both families in the ton. Albina, an independent thinker who prefers to not follow the expectations of the ton, causes hurdles for Noah, a rigid, rule follower driven to keep his dukedom elevated in the ton, and conduct a marriage of convenience only. Drama, betrayals, murder, secrets, and nefarious characters all play a role in reaching the major characters\u2019 HEA. Eventually, clarity brings forth answers to the mysterious feud, nearing the end of the story.I did have concerns about major editing errors that includes missing words, misusing genders and stating someone was a sister versus a cousin, caused annoyance. It disrupts the flow of the story when I have to back up to re-read portions. I\u2019m a huge fan of Ms Hamers, and the editing errors are usually a rarity for her. As I eagerly wait for her next book, I will hope she finds a better editor. :-) I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I'm hoping that rivalries like these two families in the nobility occurred in the Renaissance, not in the Regency or Victorian era. Dueling was banned in 1844 and the last duel recorded was 1852. Otherwise, this story is well written and the climax is exciting. Although the epilogue is too long and makes it worse with an extended epilogue available to read online. The characters are well developed and it is established which family has the evil pushing the others in the family to behave with hatred. For Noah and Albina the union of their marriage takes on different aspects, until Albina makes him realize that whatever feelings are between them are real and override the family feud.",

                "reviewText": "The general concept of feuding families settling their long-time disagreements with a marriage intrigued me. Characterizations were well-developed and I liked the development I saw, especially in Albina. I found many of the couple's conflicts infuriatingly stupid - though it explains why the 2 families have been feuding for so long. Very promising tale with all the elements of a compelling readHowever, major editing is needed to fix the many grammatical errors, missing words, typos, and confusing sentences which grew more frequent as the book progressed. (One wrong name had a character making love to his cousin, not his wife!) Greater attention to detail is needed. (Man completely undresses his wife at the top of the stairs!?) More research into the regency era's law enforcement procedures and attitudes toward titled nobility need to be done... An untitled noble \"accidentally\" harms a duchess and he's merely fined? A duke and a marquess sent outside England in the protective custody of the crown??? Frankly, the final 3 chapters AND the extended epilogue should be eliminated and replaced with a few paragraphs that tie up the story and provide a quick happily ever after.A story with much promise, but not quite ready for prime time, IMO.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this story. It had a lot of unexpected twists and turns. A feud between two families had lasted for over one hundred years. Could they find a way to end the feud? Albina and Noah marry to try to settle the tension between the famiIies. However, their own feelings of tension threaten to keep them apart. Other family members find it hard to forget the feud and tensions run high. The story has stabbings, abduction and a lot of danger before Noah and Albina are able to find a settled life and happiness. There were some typing errors but not enough to detract from the story. Read on and enjoy.",
