                "reviewText": "First off, I just gotta say\u2026that author note was hilarious & definitely set the tone for the book \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude1d This was an entertaining short story that is all about reaching out & grabbing the unexpected opportunities that come our way. That\u2019s exactly what the Sweet brothers do when they run into the older woman (by almost 10 years) they\u2019ve all had their sights on while going to graduate school together. While Emily may be focused on her goals, she\u2019s noticed the guys too, but she certainly didn\u2019t think they had any serious interest in her. Well, guess what\u2026after finding each other during a special Valentine\u2019s event at a sex club, they\u2019re all about to give into how they\u2019re feeling, but can this new level to their feelings last in the light of day? This may be a short story, but it still gave enough character background to feel like I could connect & root for everyone finding their HEA, with the added advantage of a realistic timeline for that HEA to happen. There was also plenty of spice, but it didn\u2019t overpower the storyline so that it felt like there was no plot. I love how Joya does such an amazing job of giving us full length novel feels in such a short time period. Can\u2019t wait for what we get next \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "The author's note definitely sets the tone for the wild ride you're about to endure! Finding Her Sweet Spots is short, steamy, and to the point. Emily is focused on her goals and her future. She is determined not to let anything stand in her way. That is until the Sweets brothers have other intentions. Can Emily let down her walls and let the Sweets in?I loved how even in a short novella Joya Lively gives us a story line sprinkled with tons of spice. Emily goes to a sex club for research and ends up diving into a new and fun adventure that she hopes will never end.If you're looking for something short and fun to read then definitely give Finding Her Sweet Spots a try! I loved this and read it in one sitting. It isn't often that you find an older female character who is driven. I was rooting for Emily to let her walls down and the Sweets brothers in! Definitely a fun read!",
