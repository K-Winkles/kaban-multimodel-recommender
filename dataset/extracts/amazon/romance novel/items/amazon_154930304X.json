I wish I could live inside this book.\u201d \u2014 New York Times bestselling author Casey McQuistonA story of love and demons, family and witchcraft. Nova Huang knows more about magic than your average teen witch. She works at her grandmothers\u2019 bookshop, where she helps them loan out spell books and investigate any supernatural occurrences in their New England town. One fateful night, she follows reports of a white wolf into the woods, and she comes across the unexpected: her childhood crush, Tam Lang, battling a horse demon in the woods. As a werewolf, Tam has been wandering from place to place for years, unable to call any townhome. Pursued by dark forces eager to claim the magic of wolves and out of options, Tam turns to Nova for help. Their latent feelings are rekindled against the backdrop of witchcraft, untested magic, occult rituals, and family ties both new and old in this enchanting tale of self-discovery. 2019 Goodreads Choice Award Finalist 2019 Cybils Award Finalist 2020 Hugo Award Nominee A 2020 ALA Rainbow Top Ten Book",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking for representation, this is a great book for you!- Nova has hearing aids, and the book does a pretty good job of being accurate without making a big deal out of it! The color of them also matches Tam\u2019s hair :)- Nova lives with her two grandmas, who are wholesome and badass witches!- Tam is somewhere under the nonbinary umbrella! When meeting Nova\u2019s grandmas again, Tam lets them know that their pronouns are now they/them. The two correct themselves casually and it\u2019s nice to see changing pronouns flow so smoothly. Tam also kept their birth name, which is nice to see since there\u2019s not much representation for trans people who don\u2019t want to change their names!- There\u2019s a decent variation of body types among the main cast, so that\u2019s nice too.Overall, I adored this book and read it in one sitting. If a love story between a witch and a werewolf isn\u2019t enough to draw you in, there\u2019s also themes of childhood best friends, found families and accepting life changes. If you enjoy fantasy creature design, I won\u2019t spoil it but oh my god the forest spirits are the cutest little bunch I\u2019ve ever seen! The magic theme is very captivating, but underneath it I think everything can be read as metaphors that are very relatable to lgbt people and/or teenagers. I think Tam\u2019s character as a werewolf and the way it affects their life is very symbolic of what it\u2019s like to be a trans teenager in the real world. Mooncakes is a coming of age story that touches on queer identities and experiences with a fun twist of witchcraft. It can be lighthearted and taken as purely fantasy if you want to, but it can also be deeper if you\u2019re looking for fantasy characters that you can project onto as a queer person. I highly recommend this book to any lgbt person or ally, especially if you\u2019re younger and just discovering your identity. Outside of the story, I also recommend this book for its fun character and setting design, the art was lovely and engaging. I\u2019m definitely inspired to make fanart..It\u2019s a pretty quick read, but 100% worth it in my opinion!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to read this book for over a year now. Ever since I first heard about it on booktube and then saw the cover I was hooked. And I wasn\u2019t disappointed either. The story was wonderful and the characters just so well-done. While it wasn\u2019t a 5 star for me as I felt like I wanted a little something more from the ending? It\u2019s still a solid 4 star and definitely a graphic novel I\u2019d recommend as it has beautifully done D/deaf and HoH as well as LGQBT+ representation. I was also happy to see old characters as well. And while I want to give a warning for the following sensitive material such as mentions and discussion of parental loss, grief, depression, and abuse? I also have to say that I felt it was handled well. Though a quick disclaimer that you should look up the content warnings for yourself in case I missed any. Last, though certainly not least, the art was lovely and just absolutely jaw-dropping at some parts especially in the depictions of magic. Hopefully one day soon this will grace my shelves cause I\u2019d love to own a physical copy of something this beautiful.",

                "reviewText": "This is a cute, witchy graphic novel with an intriguing art style.I really liked Nova, a witch who uses hearing aids and non-verbal spells and lives with her grandmas in a small town. She works at the Black Cat bookstore, and there are plenty of eponymous black cats. Tam is a werewolf and an old friend of Nova. Their relationship is super cute.I liked the story and loved the LGBQTA representation.Recommend for people who liked Tara and Willow from Buffy.",
