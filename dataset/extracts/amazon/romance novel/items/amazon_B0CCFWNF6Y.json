The pacing threw me for a bit, so that was the hardest part of the story.Overall, the story was interesting and fun. I liked Edward and his complex background. I liked it enough to look for the next book and see what happens to the other characters.",

                "reviewText": "I just finished the book Seven Nights with the Duke and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I first found the link in Facebook to learn about the book\u2019s description and after reading the description I really believed that this would be a really great book for me and a story line I would thoroughly enjoy. Even though I hadn\u2019t read any other book by Loretta, I wanted to take a chance and I\u2019m glad I did. It was a book that once I started I had to finish and not read any other books, which I have done in the past. I really did enjoy this book as it had Great characters with Edward being the Duke and Emma the lady that he gives the option of spending the Seven nights with him to receive her inheritance back. But only if she went along with being with him the Seven nights and then they will go their separate ways. This book has a Cinderella feel to it, as Emma has some relatives due to her father\u2019s death that she is is forced to live with and go by their rules. I love stories about rogue Dukes and as you read further into the book you understand why he only wants to spend only Seven nights with women, that is until he met Emma. I will definitely be checking more books by this author! The descriptions of all of the characters plus the clothes they wore was really something I enjoy also. 5 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f for this book! And also there is a great Epilogue and an option for getting the second Epilogue which is so worth it. I loved the cover of the book also.",

She was rescued by him and he was trying to take advantage of helping her. He doesn't want to admit that he wants more than 7 nights with her, and she doesn't want to admit that she wants the same after a bit. Buy it, read it and get in on the fun of seeing of seeing how things turn out. You won't regret it, a great fun summer read. Grab a glass of ice tea, put phone away and snuggle in a comfy place and read it.",

                "reviewText": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fThis is a debut from L. Levine. The story is written so well it attests to the author's gift in writing. I think it is loosely based on a Cinderella story, with a strong twist. There's no 2 ugly step-sisters, but an ugly stepsister and stepbrother. Still, the operative word here is Ugly, whether physically is not mentioned, but def in personality. The book has different layers that takes the reader through humour, drama, hot sensual romance, suspense, intrigue, crimes and misdemeanours, and of course a Happily Ever After.The characters were well created and believable. There was no overdose of sensual narrative, just enough to establish the sizzling chemistry between the hero and heroine. It was also spaced out in sections throughout the pages, not just lumped all at the end. Then that would be really boring and tedious for me. I am no prude, but I also draw the line at erotica. This author has managed to balance out all the essential requisites of a successful historical romance novel with an adept stroke of her pen or keyboard.I hope there will be another book soon. I will definitely buy it. I totally recommend this book.",

It felt like the author was plucking bits from Bridgerton and Pride & Prejudice and didn't really make anything unique.The writing felt basic. Though it was technically all proper grammer and punctuation, it didn't feel creative.This had a lot of potential, and it wasn't bad enough that I couldn't finish it. I would like to see where this author ends up in the future, given time to develop their skills.",
