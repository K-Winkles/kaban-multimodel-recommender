            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201c\u2018Hating someone feels disturbingly similar to being in love,\u2019 says Lucy Hutton, who can\u2019t stand fellow executive assistant Joshua. There\u2019s only one place this could go\u2026but it\u2019s good fun getting there.\u201d \u2014 People\u201cSally Thorne satisfies hearts longing for laughter in their love stories\u2026.Their battle of wits is tremendously fun\u2014acerbic and sexy and filled with tension. The result is a wicked, witty romance that will capture readers\u2019 hearts long before Joshua manages to capture Lucy\u2019s.\u201d \u2014 Sarah MacLean, Washington Post\u201cFive feet tall and a total oddball, [Lucy] carries the plot by being engagingly self-deprecating, quick-witted and funny. There\u2019s not even an infinitesimal flicker of doubt about where the story is headed, but along the way Thorne reveals an astute command of office politics and the often demeaning realities of workplace dynamics for women. The chemistry between Lucy and Joshua is also gratifying, with both seeming like fully conceived characters rather than passive stereotypes. If there\u2019s nothing new to discern here, it\u2019s at least a vibrant take on an old standard.\u201d \u2014 New York Times Book Review\u201cIf you miss romantic comedies, the kind that were so funny, you would pay $15 to see them in the theater\u2014plus the cost of popcorn and candy\u2014this novel will make you very happy indeed...The rising tension and Thorne\u2019s biting dialogue will make you wish for the romantic comedies of days gone by\u2014or just more books like this one.\u201d \u2014 NPR Books\u201cA breezy tale perfect for a day at the beach, this one\u2019s a real winner.\u201d \u2014 Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\u201cA brilliant, biting, hilarious new voice.

The irrepressible Lucy and her starchy, growly counterpart Joshua will win you over from the opening page.\u201d \u2014 Elizabeth Jane Howard, author of the Cazelet Chronicles\u201cSome of you might have traveled to the beach for the sole purpose of escaping the office, but we think this funny and romantic workplace comedy just might change your mind\u2026. we know you\u2019ll find their story entertaining and sexy.\u201d \u2014 Bookish\u201cRomantic comedy is harder than it looks. \u2026[The Hating Game's] sharp, sexy\u2026 candy-like in the best way\u2026it\u2019s a very good quality romantic comedy.\u201d \u2014 NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour\u201cIf your reading catnip includes dialogue that crackles, cranky heroes with hidden depths, and vivid, self-assured heroines who take exactly zero crap from said hero, find yourself a copy of this book immediately.\u201d \u2014 Sarah Wendell, Smart Bitches, Trashy Books From the Back Cover Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeman hate each other. Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. Hate. And they have no problems displaying their feelings through a series of ritualistic passive-aggressive maneuvers as they sit across from each other, executive assistants to co-CEOs of a publishing company. Lucy can\u2019t understand Joshua\u2019s joyless, uptight, meticulous approach to his job. Joshua is clearly baffled by Lucy\u2019s overly bright clothes, quirkiness, and Pollyanna attitude.Now that they\u2019re up for the same promotion, their battle of wills has come to a head and Lucy refuses to back down when their latest game could cost her her dream job. . . . But the tension between Lucy and Joshua has also reached its boiling point, and Lucy is discovering that maybe she doesn\u2019t hate Joshua. And maybe he doesn\u2019t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game. About the Author Sally Thorne is the USA Today-bestselling author of The Hating Game. She spends her days climbing into fictional worlds of her own creation.

                "reviewText": "The Hating Game tells the story of Lucy and Josh, both are executive assistants to co-CEOs and we could say that they are complete opposites. They were working for different publishing houses before both companies decided to merge. Lucy is always full of life, she does everything to really create good relationships with people and she is always called nice, she also very much enjoys wearing bright colors and is often very bold with her color choices for clothing. On the other hand, Josh is extremely good with numbers, which makes others see him as brutal when it comes to the reports that he often receives and sends back because of the many mistakes that other workers make, he can be described as cold and lonely, always believing that relationships with others aren't as important as one's job. As you can clearly notice, their personalities are bound to clash. It is clear that Lucy and Josh absolutely hate each other, yet everything in their lives seems to circle around the other. For instance, they are always so anxious to make the other suffer without making the other co-workers notice, they are always planning to get in the plans of the other and they are always looking for ways to make the other stress, which is why when the announcement regarding the new position as CEO is made, Josh and Lucy are more than ready to compete against each other. Yet, both seem to know so much about the other that it may seem like they have spent a lifetime together, although they do utilize that information to make fun of the other.I just loved everything about this book! I fell in love with the plot, the scenes, the words and the characters!I want to start by talking about the book overall. I loved how funny it is! Everytime that I read it (which I have done about four times now), I laugh so much that my family thinks that I am crazy since they were quite used to me crying all the time while reading. The way the scenes are constructed are brilliant, they are so easy to imagine and be part of and you are able to feel all of those crazy emotions, like the shame, the warmth, and the laugh.I mean, the plot is one of those that most of us have either seen or read already several times because it follows the usual romantic comedy storyline, yet the way everything is narrated is so fun that I didn't even mind the fact that I knew how things were going to be, I was so trapped in this story that I was simply lost in this world.Regarding the characters, I was simply charmed by both. They were so good at their jobs, yet they were so childish, and from time to time they were so cruel to each other, yet they were so humane and they had such a heartwarming relationships with themselves that it really made them seem real and overall well-rounded characters with whom who could cry and laugh. I loved reading about their struggles, especially with family, and the way they reacted to those problems. I believe that by having such traits, the characters really reminded me that even people in real life have personal struggles that they hide and that those could be potentially limiting them in some sort of way.One of the things that I liked the most about this novel is the way the relationship progressed as a whole. It was interesting to understand how their feelings started changing with each other and how even though we don't get to read both points of view, we can start noticing their changes in character, which made their relationship more significant and in this case, Josh's actions and words much more special. Also, I loved how slowly things changed, in the sense that they didn't just become friendly with each other from night to day.Lastly, I absolutely loved the details! The small things were what really made this novel outshine others because it truly demonstrated how much the author cared and how much thought she put into the story. For instance, I absolutely loved the shirt's pattern and I still think about it almost every day.I can truly recommend this novel because it will bring you a lot of laughter, yet it will also bring you a little bit of warmth in your heart. Sally Thorne truly takes the rom-com genre and takes it to the next level in this hit-novel.",

                "reviewText": "The Hating Game by Sally Thorne5 stars!!!\u201cMy hostage. My blackmailed, unwilling captive. Stockholm Shortcake.\u201dThere is nothing like a good hate/love book to get your reading mojo well and truly pumping and that is exactly what The Hating Game delivered. Sally Thorne captured everything about those office relationships where competition takes on a whole new meaning and to think that this is her debut novel, I was totally blown away.Enemies to lovers is one of those tropes that literally has me salivating. You learn more about a person through their actions in that kind of environment, especially in the work place. It is harder to hate than it is to love and there is often a very fine line between the two. Sometimes there is that genuine hate, because let\u2019s be honest, there are a lot of douches and b****es in the world, but more often than not we hate as a veil of our true feelings and that was definitely the case with these two.\u201cShortcake, if we were flirting, you\u2019d know about it.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019d be traumatized?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019d be thinking about it later on, lying in bed.\u201dTwo publishing houses struggling in the economic climate merge to ensure the viability of at least one of them, two CEO\u2019s, two assistants. One male assistant, one female assistant who knock their a**es out week after week to be the best. This was all about one-upmanship. Who could work the longest hours, who was more efficient, who has the best ideas etc.: Their competitiveness was the source of many hilarious scenes, yet so relatable having been in a similar environment myself. But they loved to hate one and other, their inter-office games of \u201chate\u201d had me laughing so many times and this book was written so well their story effortlessly flowed from page to page. This was an easy read, a real page turner.\u201cThe trick is to find someone who\u2019s strong enough to take it. That one person who can give it back as good as they get.\u201dLucy Hutton was working in a place that she had dreamt of since she was a teenager. For her, publishing had always been her dreams albeit maybe not as a PA to the CEO. Her position had left her friendless because of everyone\u2019s \u201csnitch\u201d mentality and her only source of enjoyment in her working day were her battles with Joshua. These two sat in the same office where daggers were drawn from clock in to clock out. Where juvenile staring competitions were the norm and trying to decipher codes and logins were their speciality.\u201cI feel like your Easter egg.\u201dJoshua was a whizz with numbers, he kept himself to himself and was definitely a closed book. He was an ornery man of rituals and order and was as predictable as they came. But who was Joshua Templeman? With a new position being made as COO, a promotion for Lucy or Joshua, battle lines are well and truly drawn as both know that neither one could work for the other. This was a fight to the death in more ways than one. Lucy begins to see a different side to Joshua when little chinks in his armour are slowly revealed, could this be who Joshua Templeman really is and god forbid Lucy for actually\u2026falling in love.\u201cThe energy that usually lashes ineffectively inside each of us now has a conduit, forming a loop of electricity between us, cycling through me, into him. My heart is glowing in my chest like a bulb, flashing brighter with each movement of his lips.\u201dThe humour and banter in this book was contagious from start to finish, the dialogue was spot on and the chemistry was seriously off the charts. Even in hate mode you could feel those flickers of electricity and you were constantly on edge just waiting for them to ignite into a raging inferno. These two as enemies were hilarious, as lovers totally swoon worthy. I adored EVERYTHING about this book. I made the mistake of starting this late in the day and then read into the early hours of the morning, I couldn\u2019t put it down. The characters were infectious, the plot was riveting and as each layer of Joshua Templeman was revealed my heart just got mushier and mushier. For those that love enemies to lovers this is a must read and the story will speak for itself.\u201cThis is the best game I\u2019ve ever played in my entire life.\u201d",

What I loved in it the most is that the whole story is a gigantic cliche, however, the way it\u2019s implemented felt fresh and entertaining. In other words, some parts of the story managed to be non-cliche still.Some elements are annoyingly repetitive (Lucy being short and Josh being big and having a good body), but ultimately, it makes sense in terms of the dynamic between them and both of them protecting each other in different ways and in different situations.The two major plot-twists towards the end were completely predictable for me but the story and the characters were enjoyable and engaging notwithstanding.I give 5 starts in any case, cos in its category, this book stands for what it is meant to be: a captivating, enjoyable and entertaining easy read.",
