                "reviewText": "This is a book that doesn't mince adult words or feelings, and sometimes hits a bit below the belt when you aren't quite prepared.It's deep in higher education, lawyers, bankers, might class artists who make six+ figure incomes and the leading lady in this book is very busy climbing that corporate ladder. But she still has time for her best childhood friend, is madly confused about marriage to her long-time fiance, and working 14 hour days to become junior partner. Without spoilers, I will say, the story lands in some hard, sad places. That was edit ouch for me, because I've been there, and after 20 years, I still don't get the why's. But there is one more complicated, mysterious element to this book that will reel you in and keep you guessing. As cluttered as it may sound, it all works and comes together in a strange way that some of us will get. Others may not. Give yourself 5 years.",

                "reviewText": "At first glance, you think this is just another romantic novel, but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s about finding something to hang onto in the midst of tragedy. You ever see those flowers and plants that somehow sneak through the crack in a sidewalk? This is the book version. I don\u2019t know if I can explain it.After Dannie\u2019s dream, you think the worst. What actually happens is the worst, but in a different way. A completely unexpected way.The author has managed to sneak in some profound realizations along the way, and when those realizations are expressed, they are expressed in the most beautiful way. Many of those realizations left me in awe. The concepts are seemingly simple, but the author has a way with words that I can\u2019t even explain.I\u2019m not usually one to look this deep into a fictional book. But for some reason,it\u2019s happened with this. The ending of this book feels like it\u2019s left open to the present. It\u2019s full of anticipation and not knowing, and being ok with not knowing. I will definitely be thinking about this book for a while and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read this multiple times.",

I was hooked from beginning to end, so much so that I had to put actual effort into going to sleep, unable to put the book down. The story comes full circle and the ending was perfect, in my opinion. I'm honestly so happy I found this book. Can't wait to read the sequel!Also, no problems regarding the delivery of the actual book for me, it came in perfect condition and arrived earlier than expected. :)",

Secondo me, questa \u00e8 una storia che parla di amicizia femminile e di quel momento nella vita in cui gli amici si sostituiscono alla famiglia. Detto questo, l'ho amato moltissimo e l'ho trovato scorrevole e ben scritto. La storia mi ha appassionata e ci sono stati vari colpi di scena che non mi sarei aspettata. Mi aspettavo decisamente qualcosa di diverso quando l'ho acquistato ma, nonostante questo, non mi sono pentita affatto di averlo letto.",
