                "reviewText": "This book has some likable and interesting characters that you do become invested in. There is a very long drawn out section about the past that doesn't seem justified. It sort of meanders through the past and takes a long time to get to anything that is revealing or that matters much in the end. The modern storyline is much more interesting and compelling. I would have liked to hear more about those characters and less about the 1950s characters.",
