                "reviewText": "EXCERPT: It (wasn't) the first time she had been caught off guard by a book's echoed. It happened quite often, actually. Secrets so scandalous, they singed the tips of her fingers. Sadness that felt like a stone lodged in her throat. Joy so fierce, it made her scalp prickle. There wasn't much she hadn't come across. But she had never experienced anything close to what she felt while holding Regretting Belle.Her eyes slid to the book. Even closed, she could feel the pull of it, the allure of its anonymity, its careful, inscrutable prose, beckoning to be read after who knew how long.And the echoes.Over the years, she'd come to think of them the way a perfumer describes the notes of a scent. Some were simple, others more complex - subtle layers of emotion combined to create a whole. Top, heart, base.With Regretting Belle the notes were complex, heavy, and slow to lift. Against her better judgement, she placed a hand on its cover. It was bitterness that came through first, hot and sharp against the pads of her fingers. That was the top note, the initial impression. Next came the deeper and rounder heart note, betrayal, which carved a hollow place beneath her ribs. And finally, there was the base note, the most resonant of all the layers - grief. But whose grief?How Belle?ABOUT 'THE ECHO OF OLD BOOKS': Rare-book dealer Ashlyn Greer\u2019s affinity for books extends beyond the intoxicating scent of old paper, ink, and leather. She can feel the echoes of the books\u2019 previous owners\u2014an emotional fingerprint only she can read. When Ashlyn discovers a pair of beautifully bound volumes that appear to have never been published, her gift quickly becomes an obsession. Not only is each inscribed with a startling incrimination, but the authors, Hemi and Belle, tell conflicting sides of a tragic romance.With no trace of how these mysterious books came into the world, Ashlyn is caught up in a decades-old literary mystery, beckoned by two hearts in ruins, whoever they were, wherever they are. Determined to learn the truth behind the doomed lovers\u2019 tale, she reads on, following a trail of broken promises and seemingly unforgivable betrayals. The more Ashlyn learns about Hemi and Belle, the nearer she comes to bringing closure to their love story\u2014and to the unfinished chapters of her own life.MY THOUGHTS: What a great read to end the year on. I have a book hangover and doubt I will be able to look at another book for several more days. The Echo of Old Books is a love story. Not a romance. A love story. And a mystery spanning decades.Barbara Davis tied my hearts in knots. She wrung every emotion possible from me. I plunged from the heights of joy to the depths of despair. I am emotionally bereft, quietly excited, and absolutely satisfied.The story is told over two historical timelines, aided by alternating chapters of two books: Regretting Belle written by Hemi, and Forever and Other Lies written in reply to Hemi's book by Belle.I couldn't stop reading. I cried. I smiled. I felt frustrated, angry and ultimately, satisfied.This was my first book by Barbara Davis. It won't be my last.A Few Favorite Lines: We develop a particular fondness for our favorite books, the way they feel and smell and sound, the memoires they invoke, until they begin to exist for us as living, breathing things. - Ashlyn Greer, The Care & Feeding of Old BooksWe never think of our parents that way, as people with dreams and passions. They're just parents.\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50THE AUTHOR: I\u2019m a Jersey girl raised in the south, now living and writing in New England. Confused? Constantly. Happy? Deliriously! But then, living your dream will do that! After fifteen years of wearing heels and schlepping a briefcase as an executive in the jewelry industry, I traded in my pinstripes for a little peace of mind, and decided to follow my dream of becoming a women\u2019s fiction author. And what a ride it\u2019s been! Six books later, I\u2019m still pinching myself, and I\u2019m still as much in love with writing as I was the day I began this journey. Maybe it\u2019s because I believe in miracles, in happy endings and new beginnings. Heaven knows I\u2019ve had my share.I\u2019m blessed to be married to my best friend and soul mate, Tom, who I must say, sets the bar pretty high for my on-the-page heroes. We also have a lovely ginger cat named Simon, who is twenty years old, wretchedly spoiled, and doesn\u2019t give a fig if I\u2019m on deadline or not. When I\u2019m not making up stories, you\u2019re likely to find me reading, cooking, watching college football, (Go Gators!)DISCLOSURE: I own my copy of The Echo of Old Books by Barbara Davis.",

So emotional!2 books within another book, the story is fantastic.Also, it has moments where it's none of those things. The writing is amazing until a line comes along that is cliche and cheesy and doesn't fit. But it's still a wonderful read.And then the plot does something... amateurish. But it's still a fabulous read.And then the details maybe don't line up, maybe there are plot holes? But you still are obsessed.And the characters are really and relatable and then you hate them and feel like they do things wildly out of character. But you don't care, you still care about every wrinkle of face and dress.I kinda feel like the author and the editor bumped heads and the weird bits are the author giving in to the editor's incorrect changes.It's really, really good though, and I thought about this book every time I wasn't reading it. I woke up in the night to finish it.",

Lately, it is making good choices, not wasting precious time, and being assertive and direct.Once again, characters within this novel realize how much time has been lost due to pride, ego, assumptions, bad communication, and inappropriate behavior.I love it when books make me think.

                "reviewText": "This riveting dual time line story was both captivating and intriguing. The premise of the book; two mysterious very similar books from the 1940\u2019s found in a box of donations in 1984, was inventive and unusual. One of the found books was written by a woman and one by a man and both detailed their failed relationship. I couldn\u2019t wait to find out what would happen next in both the past and present timelines. An Echo of Old Books is part historical fiction and part romance with betrayal, secrets and family playing an integral part of the story. The author does a very good job of handling sensitive themes in this book and creating a very appealing atmospheric story. This was my first book by Barbara Davis. I will definitely be checking out other books by this author.",

This one however is one of the very best examples of how to really do it right. The story is so engaging and well written with such interesting characters it was very hard to put down, even when it kept me awake in the early hours! I have just this minute finished it and loved everything about it.I look forward to reading more books by this author.",
