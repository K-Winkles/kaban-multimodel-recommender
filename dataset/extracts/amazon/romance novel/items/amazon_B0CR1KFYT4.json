I always enjoy your extended endings,like to know about children,other unions like Carol and Simon,I'm glade you didn't go into the parents of Charlotte they were to pushy and needed to back off.As always Bridget I love your books but hate when I read that last page!Looking forward to my next fantastic book of yours!!",

                "reviewText": "Two childhood friends, reunite as adults, each regretted not sharing their true feelings with the other. Charlotte is being forced to marry a man her parents have selected. Alex, now a duke, dislikes balls but knows the obligation of finding a wife. This is a clean romance with two independent individuals that are fearful to be rejected by the other, so as they are losing precious time in professing their love, others are trying to stop them. The plot has drama, murder, spies, treachery and treason, all elements making this a compelling story. Nefarious characters are also woven throughout to aid with the twist and turns, until the author finishes her story with surprising drama.On the con side, there were quite a bit of errors, missing words, and grammar not of that time period.Also, some scenes immediately ended, and then another scene began. I felt like the first scene wasn\u2019t finished, and that I was therefore missing something. To avoid spoilers, I will just say I thought the extended epilogue lacked information to totally complete the drama in the book. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "There's plenty of suspense and mystery in this book. Without giving away any of the story, there is a character (or 2) who is more evil than anyone had counted on. It gets really suspenseful before it is all resolved.I especially like Charlotte. She is very respectful of her parents, but when she is pushed too far, she gets enough courage to push back. She had several friends, male and female, who supported her 100%.Her brother Simon is turning things around to be a good person, and he finds his happily ever after, too. It goes to show we shouldn't give up on people who are unlikable; sometimes people do change for the better.",

                "reviewText": "Bridget Barton has been one of my favorites for a few years now. This book was not as up to her standards. Some parts were almost like someone else was writing it. There were also errors like \"she\" when it meant \"he\" and one of the characters answering \"Tough\" as a negative response. I don't think that would have been a response back then. Also, in her other novels, one did not kiss until they were engaged. That was not the case in this one. I also could have shaken both of them when, after hugging and kissing, they wondered if the other felt for them more that friendship.",

Duke Alex and Lady Charlotte had been childhood friends and had regularly kept in touch, even though Alex had to go to America for five years to look after his business affairs. When he returned he was immediately drawn to Charlotte again. Charlotte felt the same but neither of them had the courage to speak of their feelings. Could their friendship turn into something more? If they spoke of their feelings, would that damage their friendship? In the end, both of them realise they need to tell each other of their feelings but is it too late? When Charlotte is in danger, will Alex be able to rescue her? this story with twists and turns. There is sibling rivalry, a forced courtship, kidnapping, French spies and murder. will love win through? Read on and enjoy.",
