Finding out that most important person as in your mother, decides to run off and leave you to provide for yourself. Living in Apt at the age of fourteen. Anna working at a store to pay for rent, electricity and not enough food. Going to school to finish her high school classes plus some college credits so she could go to to a college. But, Gabe found out when they were working on assignments. She couldn't hide anymore because he knew and he promised she wouldn't be turned into foster care and be lost in the system. His parent stepped in and told her, you're living with us from now on, what a blessing. This story was heartfelt ad I absolutely loved reading it. ENJOY IT! The author did a excellent job in writing this book!!!",
