                "reviewText": "A humble orphan forced to live on the streets pick-pocketing in Victorian England meets the Earl of Bradford when she, Della Rose tries to steal his watch. He immediately sees more in her and eventually enlists her help in a covert operation to expose a traitor to the crown. This is wonderful plot that was enticingly written. It is part spy novel, part My Fair Lady where the Earl is Della's tutor and a wonderful rags to riches story. I thoroughly enjoyed Della's success in winning over all those who met her because it was the first time in her life that she was valued for herself and supported and loved. It was unputdownable until a certain part where it slightly went off the rails.This novel could be a top ten best seller and appeal to fans of Downtown Abbey, if the author didn't stoop to inserting chapter after chapter of endless sex scenes complete with heated loin references and seemly unending references to the Earl's amber eyes. The extremely graphic sex scenes were too much and they really cheapened the story with no real gain. It almost seemed like two novels: a historical fiction and a bodice ripper. A little heat between the Earl and Della was fine, but several chapters was way too much. It was a chore to get through and delayed the plot twist which was written so well. Their budding romance of intellectual equals was enjoyable to read. A bit of back story into why the Earl chose to be a spy and how his Dad got involved with spying could have replaced the sex chapters.All in all I enjoyed Della and the Earl's story and it could have been a 5-star book with the the sex toned down. The book still held my interest and I am glad I read it.",

She was witty, smart, and went through an amazing arc along with Cole.Cole was a great spy with an ice heart that melted because of Della\u2019s quick wit and feisty spirit. The plot was so well done. I enjoyed the take down of the Duke and how he was a villain through and through. Not just a rake but a terribly evil person.The characters all went through their own character arcs, had amazing chemistry, and lines. The writing kept you so throughly engaged and the plot on the edge of your seat.",

                "reviewText": "3.5 stars coz I didn\u2019t like the ending'The Lady Thief of Belgravia' is a wonderful and fun Pygmalion-meets-heist historical romance.Orphan Della Rose, nicknamed Rosie Diver for being the best diver (slang for pickpocket) in London, is a plucky, well-read and resourceful woman with dreams of academia. Her skills come to the attention of Cole Winthrop, Early of Bradford, who needs to transform her into a well-bred woman so she can retrieve important papers stolen by the Duke of Salisbury.There is an instant and palpable chemistry between the two who try to fight their attraction to focus on the mission. Della surprises Cole with her sharp intellect and sense of adventure which he's sorely after a broken engagement due to his job. I loved how well they complemented each other and just how supportive Cole was of Della.This book was thoroughly enjoyable as I enjoy a good adventurous historical romance. However the pacing got lost from the repititious steamy scenes at the expense of the upcoming mission. I don't have an issue with steamy scenes, but I found that it belaboured the point - they can't stay away from each other but they live two different lives, etc.The biggest let down for me was the baffling final conflict and outcome. Della's ultimatum to Cole was unreasonable especially since knew he was nursing heartbreak from a woman who demanded the same. There was alternative outcomes for the two of them to get what they wanted, including becoming partners in work as well as life given Della's talents and sense of adventure. Plus it would've opened up for a series. A real shame.Thanks to Storm and NetGalley for the ARC.",

                "reviewText": "It was 1879 and Della Rose was on the look out for someone affluent on whom to use her skills. She was the best pickpocket in London and had never been caught, so her confidence was high. But Cole Winthrop had an agenda and had been watching Della for some time, so when she approached him, he was ready. Cole needed a thief to catch a thief. When his father's papers had been stolen, Cole was determined to carry on his father's work, and he needed to get the papers back. So Della had a new job; one she was prepared to work for as the end result was good.As Della slowly learned to be a lady, she was prepared by Cole - who was an Earl - about the person she needed to get close to; the person who she needed to steal from. And she wasn't impressed. But she was determined to do her job, and do it well...The Lady Thief of Belgravia is the debut novel by Allison Grey and I quite enjoyed it. The cover is gorgeous and the premise was intriguing. Della was a strong character - she had to be in her situation - while Cole was a \"nice guy\", kind and caring, but hard and cold when necessary. My only quibbles were the use of the \"f\" word, which, when I googled, wasn't around back in 1879. And the over use of the fully described sex scenes - after about the 5th or 6th time, the tone of the story was changed for me. Oh, and the \u00a310,000 agreed on for Cole to pay Della converts to \u00a31,532,390.16 today - so perhaps not!",
