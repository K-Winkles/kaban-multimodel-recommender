Lila\u2019s comment to Rosa about the town \u201cmost folks round here are nice from afar, but far from nice.\u201d Certainly, telling not only the hearsay about Rosa, but also about Clay when he arrives in town with his business partner, William. Something drew Clay to the area he wasn\u2019t sure if that is about the water or Rosa. Clay\u2019s statement to Rosa \u201cMy world would be poorer without meeting you.\u201d Rosa is drawn to Clay love grows.Pine Ridge is site of murkiness about prior events in the town leading to lots of superstitions, poisonous water, Victor Harland\u2019s role in it and how Rosa and Clay join to discover the truth.

                "reviewText": "Once I got started on this book, I couldn't put it down. Difficult circumstances and superstitions hit head-on in this story making Rosa's life miserable and lonely. She can't even go to town without people calling her names and mumbling prayers to ward off the curses they are convinced she can cast. However, she isn't the only one they focus their attention on. When a water diviner comes to town, attention is diverted to him and when the people in town begin to get sick, accusations start to fly. It looks like the only way to solve the problem is to enlist the help of an unlikely ally and in the process solve the mystery of what happened in the town many years ago.",
