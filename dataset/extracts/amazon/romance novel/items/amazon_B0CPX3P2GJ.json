Her anger and determination reminded me so much of myself at that age! And the sense of not knowing where the performance ended and her true self began is something I still struggle with to this day.Valen is the most unique hero I've ever read! He gives off ALL the Gaston vibes but in only the best ways. Yes, he's completely self obsessed, but he is so genuinely head over heels in love with himself that it's disturbing and shocking to him when he sees Cici and she cracks open a part of him he had no idea existed. Every moment in his head was a trip! But I truly loved every minute of it!And the creme de la creme was a lovely cameo by my favorite psychopath of all time! Pax! I should probably be evaluated for how much I love that crazy killer.Spectacular novella from a spectacular author who very very quickly has become an insta buy for me.",

He is narcissistic, self involved star quarterback and frat president.Valen wins the title for their division and an awards ceremony is scheduled for the same day Cici\u2019s play is (hers gets cancelled). When she finds out she immediately blames him and goes to his frat party to give him a piece of her mind.That back fires, as he apparently has an epiphany that he is obsessed now because she is \u201cprettier\u201d than him. And he needs to know more about her.He eventually fixes the date w the play vs the award ceremony. Cici finds out her BFF Corey only was around to try to get with her, which breaks her heart. They get into an altercation and she leaves, then Valen comes in and unalives Corey.Valen shows up to play Romeo in the play (since Corey doesn\u2019t show, obviously) and in the middle of the play\u2026 a priest appears to marry Valen and Cici\u2026 I heavily eye rolled at this part. The audience were hand picked (people that wouldn\u2019t protest when Cici fights the situation) and he forces her to say \u201cI do\u201d.THEN\u2026 he totally consummates the marriage right on the stage in front of everyone\u2026 super weird. Of course Cici is fine with it.I like the story and meat of the book but was really disappointed in Cici\u2026 she was very much no this is wrong then immediately changes to ok I\u2019m good with it.All this takes place over 4 or 5 days\u2026It was a lot\u2026The story line / plot is good / cute but the whole dynamic between Valen and Cici is super weird.Valen is superficial and only concerned with himself but now all of a sudden he is being obsessed with Cici.Overall Rating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fPlot: \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1Burn: \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Darkness: \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4Red Flags: \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9Kinks: \ud83e\udee6\ud83e\udee6\ud83e\udee6Heat: \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0fRange of Emotions: \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude15\ud83e\udd75\ud83d\ude15\ud83e\udee3Ending: \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb {HEA}POV: \ud83d\udc6b\ud83c\udffb {Dual}",

I devoured this book in one sitting. It was so hot.The characters are twisted but so entertaining, and the use of a plus-size FMC that refuses to take up less space is perfect. The MMC talks about her body without fetishism or negativity and \"defends her\" when somebody else does.A great valentines Day romance for dark romance lovers.Now let's hope we get a book for easter too \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "It was okay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll bother reading it again. The character development and plot felt kind of juvenile. I think it would do better as a full length novel where the characters can actually be developed and it\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s a novella cause it can be done really well in novellas but the characters are portrayed as complex characters but without the development of their complexities. His preferences are complicated and it would\u2019ve been nice to explore that more. As well as more in depth chemistry building. The spice was good that was probably the only redeeming quality. The lead up was lacking thou cause the chemistry was lacking. The dark romance aspects that were trying to be portrayed just kind felt thrown in there to try and make it darker but it didn\u2019t enhance anything really, it just felt disjointed. I also was not a fan of the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it so much as say it wasn\u2019t necessary to go that way like it wasn\u2019t realistic by any means. The spice in the moment was good but the actual event made no sense, it had been I think like 4 days, his fascination could have easily fizzled back to his base desires. It felt a lot like they didn\u2019t see any other way for it to be a hea without that happening, like they couldn\u2019t just be together without it. Spice was good I\u2019m going to put it at a 3.5/5. It was frequent and descriptive. Overall, I gotta put it a 2/5. It really could have used some fleshing out and some more in depth development. I think the bones of the story are great but it really needed to be built up more to become everything it should have been.",
