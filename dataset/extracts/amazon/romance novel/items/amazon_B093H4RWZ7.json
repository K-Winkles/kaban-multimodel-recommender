                "reviewText": "The book opens with Claray MacFarlane being dragged to the chapel to marry. She was visiting her cousin when her uncle proceeded to force her to marry her father\u2019s neighbor Laird MacNaughton, in a plan to obtain her father\u2019s estate. But thankfully she is saved from that fate when she is rescued by the warrior known as the Wolf \u2013 Conall MacDonald. He tells her he has been sent by her father to bring her home. And they set out immediately to avoid a confrontation with the MacNaughton. What Claray doesn\u2019t know is Conall is actually Bryson MacDonald \u2013 her betrothed, whom she has been led to believe died 22 years ago. Something that is a bit a tender subject, since her father has refused to consider any other suitors for her.When his entire family and most of his clan were murdered, he escaped and made his way to his uncle Ross MacKay who changed his name and sent him to be raised by the Sinclairs. For years he has been working as a mercenary, intending to return to his family home Deagh Fhortan. Only a handful of people know he didn\u2019t die with his family, Claray\u2019s father among them. For years he has been asking Conall to marry Claray, and for years Conall has put him off. But now that she is in danger, he knows the time has come. During their travels back to her father\u2019s house, he has come to know her and is very attracted to her, which is evidenced by the heated kisses they share. But he also admires her and is amused by her and her proclivity to find wounded/abandoned animals.They reach her father\u2019s home and they are met by the MacKay and two of her Buchanan cousins. They marry and set off to reclaim Deagh Fhortan. They arrive and have their work cut out for them, but things are going well between them and it seems like they will have their HEA. But it is soon clear that someone is still trying to kill them \u2013 but is it the MacNaughton or the person who killed Conall\u2019s family?This was a fun addition to the series and the book was classic Lynsay Sands. The book is chock full of humor, steamy love scenes, wonderful characters, more than one deranged lunatic, a great supporting cast, several rescued animals, a couple of surprising twists, and finally a well-deserved HEA. I will admit that book did have a bit of a \u201cDisney Princess\u201d feel to it, but with steamy love scenes instead of bursts of spontaneous song. But it was fun and I enjoyed it. It is the tenth book in the series, but this book is very loosely connected and can easily be read as a standalone title.*I am voluntarily leaving a review for an eARC that I requested and was provided to me by the publisher.

So, twenty-six years later, Lynsay Sands blessed this Historical Romance fan with Lady Claray MacFarlane.\u2763\ufe0fClaray's sensible-nonsensical personality will make you - simply... happy... She doesn't dwell on the negatives. She is strong but quiet, thoughtful but engaging, tenderhearted and strong-willed. Claray is a mood lifter!In Highland Wolf, Claray's underhanded uncle attempts to force her hand in marriage to a scoundrel who has land appropriation on his mind and a no-means-yes mentality. Thankfully, a mercenary for hire does a grab-n-dash before the vows are spoken. Set on an alternate course, Claray rolls with this newest life-changing event like the strong Highland woman she is, but for the love of all woodland creatures, this kind-hearted woman is a trouble magnet - danger stalks their group, especially the mysterious mercenary. Brilliant offering in Sands' long-running Highland Brides series!KrisWhiskey & Wit Book Reviews",

                "reviewText": "If you have read a historical romance book you know you'll find drama, drama, passion/bedroom scene, drama, and then more drama. What I love most about Highland Wolf by Lynsay Sands is that there is drama, passion, and amazing comedic relief.Our hero rescues our heroine minutes before she marries an evil man. While on the way to her father's home she manages to find and rescue a bunny, a baby stote, and a baby fox. She also has a horse that follows her around like a dog and a wolf that is the largest anyone has seen. All this leads to many, many moments that literally made me laugh out loud. Mixed into these moments is sincerity, passion, love, and revenge.The book was wonderful and I highly recommend it just like I would any historical romance written by Lynsay Sands; just don't read them in public because when your laugh your head off people look at you in a very weird manner.I just reviewed Highland Wolf by Lynsay Sands. #HighlandWolf #NetGalley",

Overall a great story teller.I liked the hero of this novel a lot! He was patient and kind. He was protective of the heroine and a bit possessive at times.The heroine is an animal lover and definitely caused a few chuckles over her escapades.This story held my attention easily with lingering questions from the hero's youth. His family was murdered and he lived with a target on his back his entire life; forced to take on a different identity. He rescues the heroine from an unwanted marriage and soon reveals he is actually her betrothed. Of course once he comes forward the enemy does too!No cheating or ow/om dramaDescriptive bedroom scenes",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the best stories that I have read in truly a long time! I love to read historical romance novels. Novels set in the castle days exploring knights and their fair ladies. As well as novels portraying a time when Native Americans roamed the earth freely. Only a handful of authors such as Lynsey Sands has the talent to write so exquisitely detailed, real-life and beautiful!!",

The characters were so well written and it was easy to care about them and want them to succeed against all odds. A surprising twist ending tied up the storyline perfectly. Loved all of the 4 footed characters too, they really added to the story. 5\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 rating! Read this book and enjoy!",
