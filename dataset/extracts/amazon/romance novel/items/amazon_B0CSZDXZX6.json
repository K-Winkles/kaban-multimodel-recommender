                "reviewText": "A nice book with a good plot, very likeable characters, battles of wills and words, some steamy love scenes, unexpected twists and a touch of suspense, but in my opinion also with some lengths.After her father's imprisonment and her brother's escape to the continent, Penny and her sister are shunned by society and left destitute.Rhysand is called the Cruel Duke and lives in obscurity - literally. Traumatised by the murder of his family and consumed by hatred and rage, he prefers a secluded life.Now he has finally got the revenge he has been waiting years for.When Penny comes to him for help, he offers her a marriage of convenience. A debut for her sister in exchange for an heir and she agrees.They are both attracted to each other right from the start, but Rhysand doesn't want to change his life for her, until Penny provokes him and slowly draws him out of his shell...If you enjoy historical romances with brooding heroes, defiant heroines, some spice and a touch of suspense, you will like this book.",
