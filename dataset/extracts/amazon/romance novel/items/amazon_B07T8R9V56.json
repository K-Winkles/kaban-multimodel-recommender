                "reviewText": "Would have given it 5 stars, but it had some very gratuitous, trashy sex in places, almost as if the author left the room and some hack snuck in and wrote a couple of really horrifically bad porn scenes. That accounts for for no more than 4% of the entire book.The rest of the book is so well written and so beautifully done with characters that you can relate to from the \"get go\".Feudal Japan was like the rest of the world in its treatment of women. They were chattel, to be used by their families and then by their husbands. It was rare that a woman or a a man ever really had a say in who they married.Many of the poorer women were sold into prostitution when they were just out of diapers.This book shows a past way of life for a \"noble\" woman of birth to go, but it was so rare, you could probably count on one hand how many made it happen.I'm moving on to the next one in the series.",

It is based on true facts, and I appreciated being taught Japanese terms to better understand the main character, Keiko, and her world. FYI: There are some intimate terms and scenes described that are certainly not for children. The writing is sharp, passionate, and sensual. Keiko, a noblewoman in ancient Japan, had few choices for true happiness in life. I enjoyed reading how Keiko tried to find better ways to live. I eagerly away reading the next book in this remarkable series.",

The only qualm I had with it was how easy it was for the heroine to master fighting styles that take others a lifetime. Think the difference in training between Rey and obiwan in starwars.I appreciate the brother sister dynamics esp when the brother swooped in to claim credit for the eagle.I know a few people were appalled by the sex scenes but considering how non straightforward Japanese culture is, the words used felt appropriate.Overall I found it to be an enjoyable read.",

                "reviewText": "This is a novel. It is make believe. Prepare to suspend your disbelief. It takes place in Japan, during the Tokugawa Shogunate. That\u2019s about the only time frame we get for the book.Keiko is the third child of her father and is not as beautiful nor as spoiled as her older sister. Her older brother is becoming Samurai and takes her along for the ride. She learns martial arts quickly, and soon is teaching the teacher. It\u2019s a novel. Go with it.Yes, there is sex in the story. Some might consider it gratuitous, but from what I\u2019ve read of Japanese stories, and what I\u2019ve seen of Japanese movies, it happens.I think what grabbed me the quickest was the introduction to some of the Samurai women of old, in particular, Tomoe Gozen. I hope she shows up in future books.I enjoyed this story. It may not be historically accurate, but the key word is \u201cnovel.\u201d A novel is a piece of fiction, it is made up, one reads it to escape one\u2019s current world, if only for a few minutes, and for that, it was wonderful. If you want accurate history, get out of the fiction department.I have already downloaded Book 2.",

It certainly prompted me to read more history on the subject. I only really noticed one mistake in use of English language which was \u201clied\u201d rather than lay. Also what a shame authors insist on splitting books up into book 1,2,\u2026\u2026ad infinitum, I find it really irritating. Otherwise I quite enjoyed the novel and may read the next one at some point.",
