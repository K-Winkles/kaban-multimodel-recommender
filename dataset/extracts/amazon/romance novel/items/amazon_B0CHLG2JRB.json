                "reviewText": "Have you ever met anyone who seemed cranky at first but was really a wonderful person once you got to know them? I worked at my local Dime Store in high school with an older woman named Ann. She seemed very cranky when I first started working at the Dime Store, but as I got to know her, she turned out to be a wonderful person who has a reason to be cranky (her beloved husband died young).Jack Frost is this type of story. Lindsay Calhoun\u2019s family is on a cruise, and she will be spending Christmas alone. She volunteers to organize the office Christmas party. The office scrooge, Jack, is not happy about an office Christmas party and always seems grumpy. When the power goes out as the two are tying up things at the end of the party, they find themselves trapped together in the office. As they get to know each other better, they begin to really understand one another. Will love blossom between these two?Jack Frost was the November pick for the Brenda Novak Book Group, but I didn\u2019t get to it until December. It was a perfect light and uplifting Christmas book, perfect for the season. I think this one would make a great Hallmark movie. Lisa Negron was a good narrator.",

He is sarcastic and mostly has a bad attitude about just about everything.Lindsey volunteered to organize the office Christmas party. Jack was told by his boss that the party was mandatory. And the boss planned to hand out Christmas bonuses at the party. So, everyone at the office attended. The office was virtual, and the bosses had let the lease expire without renewal. So, weekly status meetings were the only contact the coworkers had. Lindsey planned a lot of ice breaker games, and the coworkers felt more familiar after the games. The building Lindsey rented for the party had been a bank. After the party, Lindsey stayed to clean up. Jack lost his keys. He offered to help clean up. She said she was going to come back and clean the next day. As they were about to leave, the lights went out and the doors locked. They were stuck together for the night.Debbie Macomber always gives her readers an early Christmas present\u2026a wonderful Christmas book. This year it was a novella. I love her Christmas stories so much that I wish it had been a longer story.",
