Her reaction to him was immediate, strong and confusing. Wanting a little adventure before she was stuck in an arranged and loveless marriage, Keira asked him for a kiss. So he made a deal with her. He would kiss her, but she needed to stay at his castle for two weeks as his guest. At the end of those two weeks, she was to leave and never see him again. What follows is a story wherein conflicting emotions abound. Lies are told, feelings are hurt, hearts are broken, danger lurks and lives are endangered. There are close calls, steamy kisses and multiple surprises, not the least of which is Raphael\u2019s past profession. The story flows at a good clip, is full of emotional ups and downs and reminds us that \u2018Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u2019! As always with this author, I found that once I started reading, I could not put it down! Loved it!",

In payment for this, he asked her to stay in his castle with his family for two weeks. He hoped her presence would discourage his mother from trying to marry him off.
