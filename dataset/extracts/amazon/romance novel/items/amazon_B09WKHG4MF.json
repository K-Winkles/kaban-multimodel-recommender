After meeting on the plane, and then again on the way into Magnolia Lakes, and then again in his medical office, it\u2019s clear these two are destined for each other no matter how much Chandra attempts to resist.I loved the chemistry amongst the main and sub characters (Chandra\u2019s family is a hoot, especially the twins), the maturity of Julian facing his issues with his mother head on, and finally all the Valentines mixing with the Abbott family from the Bourbon Brothers series.",

They both had family matters, jobs to consider, and matter of heart to handle, as they navigated this attraction and love for each other. Her brothers were a trip and I truly enjoyed her sister, Naya.This was a sweet drama free story",
