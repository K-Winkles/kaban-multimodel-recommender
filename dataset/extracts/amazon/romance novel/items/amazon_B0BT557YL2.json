She's human and doesn't know the way Sean feels for her.After trying to contact her and failing, he resigns himself to not seeing her again, but then she re-appears and he hopes for a second chance, but that would be far too easy.I really liked Sean's character, he wanted to be with his mate, but wasn't going to chase her too much and frighten her away. Sam seemed to have some big issues she needed to deal with, and was extremely lucky that Sean was willing to give her another chance as her go-to for dealing with things is to run away.- fated mates- PNR- bear shifter- he falls first- steamy- standalone with HEA",

Really enjoyed the way she brings the characters together and still slips in their personal stories. It would be nice to have an epilogue. Highly recommended. I'm going to see what other books I can find of this author and stock up.",
