All rights reserved. 1NowI make it as far as the front desk without anyone noticing me. It\u2019s a striking piece, carved from a large tree trunk\u2014 \u00adrustic but not shabby, the epitome of Mom\u2019s aesthetic\u2014\u00adand there\u2019s no one behind it. I hurry past, to the office, then shut myself inside and lock the door.The room is more fishing hut than work space. Pine walls, two ancient desks, a small window trimmed with a flimsy plaid curtain. I doubt it\u2019s changed much since the lodge was built in the 1800s. There\u2019s nothing to suggest how much time Mom spent here, except for a photo of me as a baby pinned to the timber and a faint whiff of Clinique perfume.Dropping into one of the worn leather chairs, I switch on the plastic tabletop fan. I\u2019m already sticky, but it\u2019s stifling in here, one of the few spots in the building without air-\u00adconditioning. I raise my elbows like a scarecrow and swing my hands back and forth. Pit stains are the last thing I need.While I wait to cool off before changing into heels, I stare at a stack of our brochures. Brookbanks Resort\u2014\u00adYour Muskoka Getaway Awaits, declares a chipper font above a photo of the beach at sunset, the lodge looming in the background like a country cottage castle. It almost makes me laugh\u2014\u00adit\u2019s Brookbanks Resort I\u2019ve failed to get away from.Maybe Jamie will forget I agreed to do this tonight, and I can sneak back to the house, slither into stretchy pants, and douse myself with a bucket of cold white wine.The door handle rattles.No such luck.\u201cFernie?\u201d Jamie calls. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the lock? You decent in there?\u201d\u201cI need five minutes,\u201d I reply, voice pinched.\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna bail, right? You swore you\u2019d do this,\u201d he says. But the reminder is unnecessary. I\u2019ve been dreading it all day. All my life maybe.\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m finishing up some paperwork.\u201d I clamp my eyes shut at the mistake. \u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d\u201cWhat paperwork? Is it the linen order? We have a system for that.\u201dMy mom had a system for everything, and Jamie doesn\u2019t want me messing with any of them.He\u2019s worried. It\u2019s peak season, but many of the guest rooms are vacant. I\u2019ve been back for six weeks, and Jamie thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before I shake things up. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s right. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m staying.\u201cYou can\u2019t shut me out of my own office. I have a key.\u201dI curse under my breath. Of course he does.It\u2019s going to be embarrassing if he has to drag me out of here, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll do it. I haven\u2019t made a scene at the resort since my senior year of high school, and I\u2019m not about to start. Being here sometimes makes me feel like I\u2019ve regressed, but I\u2019m not a reckless seventeen-\u00adyear-\u00adold anymore.Taking a deep breath, I stand and smooth my palms over the front of the dress. It\u2019s too tight, but the ripped jeans I\u2019ve been living in aren\u2019t appropriate for the dining room. I could almost hear Mom when I changed earlier.I know you\u2019d rather wear pj\u2019s all day, but we have to set the tone, sweet pea.I open the door.Jamie\u2019s flaxen curls are cropped short and styled into obedience, but he has the same baby face from when we were young and he thought deodorant was optional.\u201cIs it the linen order?\u201d he asks.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I say. \u201cYou have a system.\u201dJamie blinks, not sure if I\u2019m teasing. He\u2019s been the resort\u2019s general manager for three years, and I can\u2019t get my head around it. In pressed pants and a tie, he looks like he\u2019s playing dress-\u00adup. In my mind, he\u2019s still a lake rat in swim trunks and a bandanna.He doesn\u2019t know what to make of me anymore, either\u2014\u00adhe\u2019s torn between trying to please me, his new boss, and trying to prevent me from wreaking havoc. There should be a cosmic law against exes working together.\u201cYou used to be fun,\u201d I tell him, and he grins. And there, with his deep smile lines and sky blue eyes, is the Jamie who once sang the entirety of Alanis Morissette\u2019s Jagged Little Pill stoned and wearing a purple caftan he\u2019d nicked from Mrs. Rose\u2019s cabin.The fact that Jamie loved attention as much as he loved going commando was one of my favorite things about him\u2014\u00adno one looked at me when Jamie was around. He was a good boyfriend, but he was also the perfect diversion.\u201cSo did you,\u201d he says, and then squints. \u201cIs that your mom\u2019s dress?\u201dI nod. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d I pulled it from her closet earlier this evening. Canary yellow. One of at least two dozen brightly colored sleeveless shifts. Her evening uniform.There\u2019s a beat of silence, and it\u2019s all it takes for me to lose my courage. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not feeling\u2014\u00ad\u201dJamie cuts me off. \u201cNuh-\u00aduh. You\u2019re not doing this to me, Fernie. You\u2019ve been dodging the Hannovers all week, and they check out tomorrow.\u201dAccording to Jamie, the Hannovers have stayed at Brookbanks for seven summers, tip like they\u2019ve got something to prove, and refer a ton of guests. From the way I\u2019ve caught him frowning into his computer screen, I think the resort needs good word of mouth more desperately than Jamie\u2019s let on. Our accountant left another message today asking me to call him.\u201cThey\u2019ve already finished dessert,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cI told them you\u2019d be right out. They want to give you their condolences in person.\u201dI scrape my nails across my right arm a few times before I catch myself. This shouldn\u2019t be so hard. In my real life, I manage a trio of indie coffee shops in Toronto\u2019s west end called Filtr. I\u2019m overseeing the opening of our fourth and largest location this fall, the first with an on-site roastery. Talking to customers is second nature.\u201cOkay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can do this.\u201dJamie lets out a breath. \u201cAwesome.\u201d He gives me an apologetic look and then adds, \u201cIt would be extra awesome if you stopped by a few tables to say hello while you\u2019re there. You know, carried on the tradition.\u201dI do know. Mom visited the restaurant every single evening, making sure this person liked the rainbow trout and that person had a restful first night. It was bonkers how many details she could recall about the guests, and they loved her for it. She said being a family-\u00adrun business didn\u2019t mean anything unless you put a face to the Brookbanks Resort name. And for three decades that face was hers. Margaret Brookbanks.Jamie has been not-\u00adso-\u00adsubtly hinting that I come to the dining room to greet the guests, but I\u2019ve shrugged him off. Because as soon as I go out there, it\u2019s official.Mom is gone.And I am here.Back home at the resort\u2014\u00adthe last place I planned to end up.Jamie and I make our way to the front desk. There\u2019s still no one behind it. Jamie pauses at the same time I do.\u201cNot again,\u201d he mutters.The desk clerk who\u2019s on tonight started a few weeks ago and tends to disappear. Mom would have fired her already.\u201cMaybe we should cover the desk until she\u2019s back,\u201d I say. \u201cJust in case anyone comes.\u201dJamie raises his eyes to the ceiling, considering. Then he narrows them on me. \u201cNice try, but the Hannovers are more important.\u201dWe continue toward the French doors that lead to the restaurant. They\u2019re propped open, and the clinking of cutlery and happy hum of conversation drift into the lobby along with the smell of freshly baked sourdough. There are soaring beamed ceilings beyond the entrance and windows that look over the lake in an impressive semicircle. It\u2019s a renovation my mom choreographed after she took over from my grandparents. The dining room was her stage. I can\u2019t picture it without her walking among the tables.Taking a quiet breath, I tuck my white-\u00adblond bob behind my ears, her voice in my head.Don\u2019t hide behind your hair, pea.As we\u2019re about to pass through the doorway, a couple exits arm in arm. They\u2019re in their sixties and swathed almost entirely in beige linen.\u201cMr. and Mrs. Hannover,\u201d Jamie says, hands spread by his sides. \u201cWe were just coming to find you. Let me introduce you to Fern Brookbanks.\u201dThe Hannovers give me their kindest smiles, the facial equivalent of a there, there pat on the shoulder.\u201cWe were so sorry to hear about your mother\u2019s passing,\u201d says Mrs. Hannover.Passing.It\u2019s a strange word to describe what happened.A dark night. A deer through the windshield. Steel crushed against granite. Ice cubes scattered across the highway.I\u2019ve been trying not to think about Mom\u2019s last moments. I\u2019ve been trying not to think of her at all. The daily barrage of grief, shock, and anger can make it hard to put weight on my feet in the morning. I feel a bit wobbly now, but I try not to let it show. It\u2019s been more than a month since the accident, and while people want to express their sympathy, there\u2019s a limit on how much suffering others can tolerate.\u201cHard to imagine this place without Maggie,\u201d Mr. Hannover says. \u201cAlways had that big smile on her face. We loved catching up with her. We even talked her into having a drink with us last summer, didn\u2019t we?\u201d His wife nods enthusiastically, as if I might not believe them. \u201cI told her watching her run around was making me dizzy, and boy, did she laugh.\u201dMy mother\u2019s death and the future of the resort are two topics I\u2019m not prepared to discuss, which is the other reason I\u2019ve avoided the restaurant. The regulars will have something to say about both.I thank the Hannovers and change the subject to their holiday\u2014\u00adthe tennis, the beautiful weather, the new beaver dam. The small talk is easy. I\u2019m thirty-\u00adtwo\u2014\u00adtoo old to resent the guests or worry about their judgment. It\u2019s her I\u2019m furious with. I thought she\u2019d accepted that my life was in Toronto. What was she thinking by leaving the resort to me? What was she thinking by dying?\u201cWe\u2019re terribly sorry for your loss,\u201d Mrs. Hannover says again. \u201cYou look so much like her.\u201d\u201cI do,\u201d I agree. Same small stature. Same pale hair. Same gray eyes.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you want to head up to your room to enjoy your last night. You\u2019ll have a great view of the fireworks from your balcony,\u201d says Jamie, rescuing me. I give him a grateful smile, and he sneaks me back a wink.We were a good team when we worked together as kids, too. At first, we used a code word when one of us needed rescuing from an annoying or overly needy guest: Watermelon. The elderly widower who wouldn\u2019t stop telling me how much I reminded him of his first love: Watermelon. The bird-watcher who gave Jamie a detailed description of every species he\u2019d seen in the area: Watermelon. But after a summer spending every day together down at the outfitting hut, hauling canoes and kayaks out of the lake, we began communicating silently\u2014\u00ada slight widening of the eyes or a curl of the lip.\u201cNot so bad, was it?\u201d he says once they move toward the elevator bank, but I don\u2019t reply.Jamie extends his arm to the dining room entrance. Many of the people inside will be guests of the resort, but there\u2019ll be plenty of locals. With my luck, someone I went to high school with will spot me as soon as I step inside. Blood roars in my eardrums like a transport truck on the freeway.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to the house. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201dIt\u2019s not a lie. The insomnia began as soon as I got back. Every day, I wake in my childhood bedroom underslept and a bit disoriented. I look at the dense tangle of tree branches out the window, reminding myself where I am and why I\u2019m here. In the beginning, I\u2019d put a pillow over my head and go back to sleep. I\u2019d rise around noon and stumble downstairs, filling the rest of the day with carbohydrates and episodes of The Good Wife.But then Jamie started calling with questions, and Whitney popped by without warning often enough to give me a talk about how much time I was spending in my pajamas\u2014\u00adthe type of tough love only a best friend can provide\u2014\u00adand so I began getting dressed. I began leaving the house, visiting the lodge, wandering down to the family dock for a swim or to drink my morning coffee, the way Mom used to. I\u2019ve even gone out in a kayak a few times. It feels good to be on the water, like I have a shred of control, even if it\u2019s just steering a small boat.I\u2019m still greeted by a procession of grief, anger, and panic when I open my eyelids, only now it passes quietly instead of clanging like a marching band.Over the last couple of weeks, Jamie has patiently updated me on everything that\u2019s changed in the many years since I\u2019ve worked here, but what\u2019s wilder is all the stuff that hasn\u2019t. The sourdough. The guests. The fact that he still calls me Fernie.We knew each other long before we started dating. The Pringle cottage is a couple bays down the lake. His grandparents knew my grandparents, and his parents still come to the restaurant for fish and chips every Friday. They spend most of the summer in Muskoka now that they\u2019ve retired, venturing back to Guelph in September. Jamie rents a place in town, but he bought the vacant lot next to his family\u2019s to build a year-\u00adround home. He loves the lake more than anything.\u201cIt\u2019s Canada Day,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cIt would mean something to the guests and the staff to see you. It\u2019s the start of summer. I\u2019m not asking you to get up on the stage and make a speech before the fireworks begin.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to add, The way your mom did. \u201cJust go say hello.\u201dI swallow, and Jamie holds my shoulders, looking me in the eyes. \u201cYou can do this. You\u2019re so close. You\u2019re already dressed. You\u2019ve been in there a million times.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in there, remember? Booth 3.\u201dI let out a huff. \u201cOf course you know what booth it was.\u201d\u201cI could draw you a map of all the spots we desecrated. The outfitting hut alone . . .\u201d\u201cStop.\u201d I\u2019m laughing now, but it\u2019s slightly frantic. Here I am with my ex-\u00adboyfriend, talking about the places we\u2019ve had sex at my recently deceased mother\u2019s resort. I\u2019ve been punked by the universe.\u201cFernie, it\u2019s no big deal. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201dI\u2019m about to tell Jamie that he\u2019s wrong, that it\u2019s a very big deal, but then I see an excuse in the corner of my eye. A very tall man is wheeling a silver suitcase up to the front desk, and there\u2019s still no one behind it.The skyscraper\u2019s back is facing us, but you can tell his suit is expensive. Custom made, probably. The black fabric is cut to his frame in the kind of impeccable manner that requires precise measurements and generous room on a credit card. I doubt an off-\u00adthe-\u00adrack number would be long enough for this guy\u2019s arms, and the cuff of his sleeve is perfect. So is his slicked-\u00adback hair. Inky and glossy and as meticulously styled as his jacket is tailored. He\u2019s overdressed, to be honest. This is a beautiful resort, one of the nicest in eastern Muskoka, and the staff is always well put together, but the guests tend to keep things casual, especially in the summer.\u201cI\u2019m going to go help him,\u201d I tell Jamie. \u201cI need practice with check-\u00adins. Come make sure I do it right.\u201dThere\u2019s no arguing. We can\u2019t just let the fancy man stand there.As we round the desk, I apologize for making him wait.\u201cWelcome to Brookbanks Resort,\u201d I say, glancing up quickly\u2014\u00ad even with me in my heels, he\u2019s got almost a foot on me.\u201cDid you have any trouble finding us?\u201d I ask, punching a key to wake up the computer. Tall dude still hasn\u2019t said anything. The last stretch of road is unpaved, unlit, and has some wicked turns through the bush. Sometimes city people find it stressful, especially when they arrive after sundown. I\u2019m pegging this guy as a Torontonian, though he could be from Montreal. There\u2019s a medical conference starting next week\u2014\u00adsome of the doctors are arriving early, making a holiday of the long weekend.\u201cNo.\u201d He runs a hand down his tie. Says nothing more.\u201cGood.\u201d I type in my passcode. \u201cAre you with the dermatologists?\u201d I navigate to the main menu, and when he doesn\u2019t answer, I clear my throat and try again. \u201cDo you have a reservation with us?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d He says the words slowly, like he\u2019s scanning them for errors.

She spent just twenty-four hours in her early twenties with the aggravatingly attractive, idealistic artist, a chance encounter that spiraled into a daylong adventure in the city. The timing was wrong, but their connection was undeniable: they shared every secret, every dream, and made a pact to meet one year later. Fern showed up. Will didn\u2019t.At thirty-two, Fern\u2019s life doesn\u2019t look at all how she once imagined it would. Instead of living in the city, Fern\u2019s back home, running her mother\u2019s lakeside resort\u2014something she vowed never to do. The place is in disarray, her ex-boyfriend\u2019s the manager, and Fern doesn\u2019t know where to begin.She needs a plan\u2014a lifeline. To her surprise, it comes in the form of Will, who arrives nine years too late, with a suitcase in tow and an offer to help on his lips. Will may be the only person who understands what Fern\u2019s going through. But how could she possibly trust this expensive-suit wearing mirage who seems nothing like the young man she met all those years ago. Will is hiding something, and Fern\u2019s not sure she wants to know what it is. But ten years ago, Will Baxter rescued Fern. Can she do the same for him? Read more",

When it was announced it might be turned into a movie and why and by whom, I wanted to see for myself why it was believed it was similar to another couple's story. I don't see the connection, and hope that it remains as a book only, as I don't think it can be approved upon, as a movie. Ms. Fortune wrote it, as it should be and not muddled to fit any particular actress.As for the story itself, it is well worth the read. It is also educational, particularly after the \"Behind the Book\" chapter.I enjoyed the story thoroughly and read it in one sitting. The characters are well developed, the story is intriguing, and the conclusion will give you pause to think about when to give up on something and when to fight for what is important, and what it means to be truly vulnerable.",

                "reviewText": "3 starsDo you ever feel bad for the author when writing a less than perfect review? Because that\u2019s how I feel right now especially after having read the author\u2019s notes in which Carley explains that she really struggled to write this one.But I swore to always be honest in my reviews so here we go, no matter what.Is that book bad?No.There are plenty of things that I loved like:-The set of side characters. From Fern\u2019s best friend looking like an overenthusiastic puppy to the Roses, the old eccentric guests making cocktails, to Peter\u2019s solid and discreet presence, they all helped me see that world, make it real.-The setting. A resort alongside a Canadian lake. I could see myself swimming or hiring a canoe. I heard the birds in the trees, saw the dining room with guests etc. It felt like being on holiday.-The pacing. It was just right for the story. We switch between past, when Fern met Will and now, ten years later. It was steady, not too fast nor too slow and fitting to have the story unfurl slowly, recounting past events and present traumas.-The meet cute. Fern and Will\u2019s day in the city ten years ago was the perfect romantic meet. It felt like a bubble in time where everything is ripe with possibilities. Will was the promising and handsome artist, Fern was prickly and undecided yet about her future. Both on the brink of a new life.-Fern. I think Carley Fortune wrote Fern very realistically. She is full of doubts, is looking for her path in life. Past Fern had her demons, understandably so and went through a wild phase. New Fern is more mature but still struggling after her mother\u2019s death. She will grow a lot in the story.-The ending. Thank god we had these last 10 percent! That helped explain a lot about Will\u2019s decision and had me feeling a smidge better.ButI am a reader and reviewer very much driven by my emotions and feelings.And what I felt very often was extremely frustrated!I was angry with Will. He never showed up nine years ago and now that he is back, he gives no explanation, no excuses. And Fern chooses to go with it???Sorry but if you don\u2019t show up and you make a mistake, you GROVEL!You explain and hope it\u2019s a fantastic explanation to beg for forgiveness.Not knowing what happened had me keeping Will at arm\u2019s length. I didn\u2019t trust him and didn\u2019t warm up to him, even if he was kind of a baby whisperer. And I didn\u2019t understand Fern in her decision to take a risk, knowing that her heart could be crushed again. Even if at the same time I admired her bravery.As a character driven reader, not liking Will really dampened my enjoyment and is the main reason for my low rating alongside the lack of groveling.What I would have liked to see more of was grief.Fern just lost her mom. We get passing mentions that she misses her mom and see her reading her diary but I think the story would have gained even more depth if we focused more on the grief stages. I don\u2019t mean to make it a sob story or the core of the book but it was nearly brushed under the rug. Or at least, that\u2019s how I experienced it.As you can see, that book has a lot of assets but also missed the mark for me.Does that mean that Carley Fortune is a \u201cone book\u201d author like she feared? Certainly not as she has proven that she can write. I just hope for her that her next story will \u201cspill out\u201d of her like Every Summer After did.Also, I haven\u2019t looked at any review yet so I might be in the minority here. So go check other opinions (like I\u2019ll do now \ud83d\ude09 ).",

                "reviewText": "When I love a book (or anything, really) I cannot shut up about it. Enter: Meet Me at the Lake by Carley Fortune. In her sophomore release, two characters meet by chance in Toronto and spend the day together, making plans to see each other again one year later. When Fern shows up and Will doesn't, she's left heartbroken and wondering what could have been \u2014 until he shows up 9 years later at the resort she's taken over from her mom.Meet Me at the Lake is equal parts funny and tender. I loved the way Fortune brought the characters to life, giving each of them quirks that complicated their relationship and, ironically, drew them together in the end. Both characters are loyal and committed to the things and people they love, and it's these characteristics that almost threaten their HEA. (Don't worry! You'll get one!)Fortune's descriptions are also worth mentioning, as she has some truly great one-liners that made me giggle alone in an empty room:\"I don't know why I find his ankles so compelling. I'm like a Regency Era viscount hoping for a flash of flesh.\" (As a historical romance reader, I CACKLED)\"'You are officially cut off,' I say, trying to act like it doesn't bother me that Will's ex is as hot as a Jonas brother wife.'\"So far, I've posted all about this book on my socials, texted my friends about it and bought it as a birthday gift. I loved it so much that I'll probably read it again before the year is over. I bet if you give it a shot, you will too.This book is for anyone who loves:\ud83d\udc59 Vacation reads\ud83d\udd25 Steamy open-door scenes\u26fa Summer camp resort / Dirty Dancing vibes\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Dual timelines, including a day-long, love-at-first-sight meet-cute\ud83c\udfa8 \"A business dude with the soul of an artist\"\ud83d\udc95 Mutual pining, second chance romance, and men in aprons (IYKYK)\ud83d\udc8a Mental health visibility\ud83d\udc51 A satisfying happily-ever-afterNote: As a trigger warning, please be aware that this text has a storyline that includes grief, anxiety and an off-page death of a parent.Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for allowing me the chance to read and provide an honest review of this book!

                "reviewText": "Following the sudden death of her mother, Fern's life is turned upside down. She finds herself back at Brookbanks Resort, the family business that has now been left to her, but that she had never wanted, and even worse, it is now in trouble. Still it is the final straw when Will Baxter turns up to announce he is here for the summer, as arranged with her mother, to offer his expertise to help with the business. Will and Fern met ten years ago, shared one glorious day together, after which he failed to show up to meet a year later as arranged. It was enough that he broke her heart all those years ago, such that she couldn't possibly stand to have him around now, and yet it turns out she might just need his help enough to have to put up with him.I loved Fortune's debut novel, Every Summer After, and was very much looking forward to her follow up. I will say from the off, that this for me at least, was not a patch on the former. It did share certain similarities with Every Summer After, in that for the most part the story alternates between past and present, and much of the setting is at a Canadian lake-side resort, giving the book a very summery vibe.I did for the most part still enjoy this book, though the pace did rather drag at times, especially in the present day setting, and one of my main gripes was that I didn't really find the situation between Will and Fern believable. Their day together in the past is fun to read, and I did think they had great chemistry, however, it was a bit too insta-love, and frankly a bit hard to believe that Fern would be so hung up over him for so long when he didn't show up a year later, after just that one day, not to mention that neither ever made any attempt to reach out to the other on social media at any point.Then in the present day, the author's reasoning for why Will is now so changed and mysterious, and why he continues to keep Fern at arm's length just lacked conviction for me. The mental health aspects I could understand and appreciate, however, I don't necessarily think they were explored as well as they could have been. Will just comes across in the present day as blowing very hot and cold a lot of the time, and to be honest the author's reasons came across as somewhat forced.Much of the book, both in past and present time frames, deals with life choices in general, the complexities of pleasing those you love and yet also living the life you want. This particularly applies to Fern, but also to Will in the present day. I did generally appreciate this theme, and the way that, at different times in their lives, Will and Fern are able to help each other when they are struggling with these choices. It did, however, at times feel a bit repetitive and as if we were going around in circles, as in the past and present Fern is very much facing the same question, does she take up the business at Brookbanks or live her own life in the city?There were some fun side characters such as Jamie and Whitney, and I liked Peter in particular, however, their roles were quite minor.The book also looks at coping with loss, and there is a thread throughout regards to what was Fern's often complex relationship with her late mother, which I thought was rather bitter-sweet. I'm not sure how much actually having her mother's diary entries added for me personally though, nor the focus on her relationship with Peter. It wasn't that I didn't like the idea, it was just the execution that fell a little flat and overall just felt somewhat clunky.Overall, this book probably had a more melancholy and reflective vibe than Every Summer After, that I could appreciate, however, aspects of the pacing let it down, and whilst parts of the romance were sweet, it didn't have me as invested as her debut.",
