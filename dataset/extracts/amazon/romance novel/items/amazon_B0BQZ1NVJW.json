                "reviewText": "CHRISTMAS AT THE SHELTER INN by RaeAnne Thayne is a heartfelt emotional holiday romance/women\u2019s fiction story set in an inn turned senior apartment complex in small town Idaho during the Christmas season. This is a standalone story.Natalie Shepherd suffered several losses during her life and it has her leaving her small hometown as soon as possible to travel the world as a freelance writer and travel blogger. She also works as a pet and house sitter for wealthy clients. She never stays in any one place too long and while she has acquaintances, she never lets anyone into her heart. When her younger sister messages her for help at home at the Shelter Inn, Natalie immediately returns. She is helping with her two young nieces while her sister is on bedrest during her pregnancy and will leave again after the birth. What she does not expect is to discover the father who left the siblings after their mother\u2019s death is in town for Christmas and her dead brother\u2019s best friend is back in town and working as a local family practice doctor.Griffin Taylor always planned on returning to his hometown when he finished medical school. He is surprised when he runs into Natalie and is happy to see her, but he is also holding a secret about the day her brother died. Griffin\u2019s grandmother lives at the Shelter Inn and so Griff and Natalie run into each other frequently as everyone gets ready for the holidays.There is an attraction and chemistry between the two, but Natalie is used to everyone leaving her and she does not want to open her heart to the pain of loss again, so she refuses to let anyone completely in.I really enjoyed getting to know all the characters in this story. Natalie and her sister have such a tragic back story and yet each moves forward in completely different directions. Her nieces are absolutely adorable, and I loved that all the residents at the Shelter Inn were like extra grandparents to them. I felt at times the story was predictable, and yet I was still very interested in how Ms. Thayne could bring such disparate main characters together. The romance is slow burn because both believe there is no happy ending if Natalie won\u2019t fight her fear, open her heart, and stop always leaving. There are no sex scenes in this story. The relationship, or lack thereof between Natalie and her father is the emotional tearjerker subplot in this story. This holiday story is full of family love, growth, and forgiveness, friendship, community, laughs as well as emotional tears.Overall, an emotional and enjoyable holiday romance/women\u2019s fiction read to curl up with over the holidays.",

                "reviewText": "As usual, Raeanne's Christmas book lives up to expectations. A lot of good family values and quite a few tears. I just couldn't put it down until I had read it, although I did have to take a break to sleep halfway through. If you have never read one of her books before, once you have read this one, my bet is on you looking up her other books to read- try the Haven Point ones as they are all just as good, or then again anything that she has written, because I haven't read a bad one yet.",
