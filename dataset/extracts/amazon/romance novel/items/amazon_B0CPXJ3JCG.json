                "reviewText": "Pros:Good character development. The plot is not complex (which is good because it\u2019s a novella), and all plot points are resolved by the end.\u2b50\ufe0fThe spice is indeed spicy. This is one kinky couple\ud83e\udd75. Like, it\u2019s a darn good thing they don\u2019t have neighbors. There are a couple of scenes where either I misunderstood the positioning as described or the FMC had some completely dislocated limbs that she wasn\u2019t complaining about, but I\u2019ve found that to be very common in written porn. \u2b50\ufe0fConsent!!! So many dark \u201cromance\u201d authors try to pass off torture and SA as CNC, but I am happy to report that clear consent was given between the MCs before they got down and dirty. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI am a bloodthirsty soul, so I enjoyed the violence as well as both MCs\u2019 acceptance of their own enjoyment of it. I hate when the woman is written as forgiving everyone instantly without even a little torture. \u2b50\ufe0fCons:Some errors in grammar and punctuation, but nothing egregious and only a couple of them made me pause to figure out what was meant.In the dialogue, some of the turns of phrase seemed rather British, which always throws me off when the characters are American. I had to get used to the word \u201cas\u201d being used in place of \u201cbecause\u201d in all of the explanatory statements.*Slight spoiler: I noticed one mistake in continuity where the FMC was shocked to learn that the MMC knew about her sketchbook even though he had previously told her he had spied on her while she sketched in it.This was my first time reading one of Selena Winters\u2019 works, and I will now go look for more.",

I do think the instalove stuff is a bit much and the way they meet is honestly bizarre. But like, what do you expect from a weird book? Lololol. Overall, I would say it\u2019s pretty unique. It\u2019s a little much and can be overwhelming for some reasons. Definitely check the trigger warnings.",

If you\u2019re looking for a quick read, primal kink, mask kink, etc., this is for you. It\u2019s a simple story line, the plot developed just enough to be enjoyable but not drag on and on.",

I honestly wanted to stop after the first chapter and I probably should have.54% I had to stop, literally could not take the nonsense anymore. I will get back to it, but for now\u2026 really? The high ratings and the #1 short horror has me befuddled.The very first chapter was so so stupid. Like logistically so dumb and made zero sense. The MFC left their shared apartment for a yoga class sometime between 7-10am based on flight time frame.. came home what, an hour later because the boyfriend didn\u2019t come pick her up, to find him in a threesome giving and taking it up the butt with two women. Uhm \ud83e\udd28? No matter how stupid the man is, there is no way he could think \u201cGee, she just left, it\u2019s 7am and I know I\u2019m leaving on vacay in an hour, let\u2019s call some b****es over and do this on our white couch, lose track of the already extremely limited window and be shocked gf shows up\u201dI was so excited to read this after it showed up on my FB feed. Storyline is right up my alley, but wow. What a disappointment. The book continues much like the first chapter and just has you scratching your head. First Maddox used to be a dom in a smex club, then he\u2019s a notorious bank robber/murdered so many people he\u2019s lost count, who has been hiding out in Alaska for seven years, yet he can\u2019t be older than 35.. so both of those things happened in his early to mid twenties???? Wow. Busy boy. Even the much awaited spicy scenes were such a letdown.",
