While at first when reading about this book, I wasn't sure how it could turn out well with a happy ending but I loved how author Rachael Bloome tied everything together and gave everyone the ending they deserve with smiles.",

Clean romances, so very Enjoyable! I Will read these again, especially books 1-5,7. Books 6 & 8 seemed lacking somehow, even though the characters were Nice, \u2026 with plenty of sweetness in the stories albeit with sadness mixed in, but there was still something missing- although, In book 8, the hidden clues & poems and search for the diary were an unexpected high point; making It seem more like book 1 in that regard, and I was hoping for a prequel or a story spin off of that man\u2019s friendship with Penny\u2019s dad. He seemed as Likable as Frank!",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting to get most of this story from Cassie's troubled mother but I enjoyed her redemption arc, as well as her little love story. It was nice to watch her overcome being a drunk. I lived vicariously through her and Cassie because some of us never get that in real life. *le sigh*Watching all the previous characters go through mini trials and overcome personal obstacles was cathartic. A particular couple that is my favorite in this series really worried me for them. The way things worked out for them was a relief because I really wanted this man to have his chance at a do over since he missed his first one.I can't say I was shocked by the big reveal towards the end because I'm very perceptive on small details but I did like the way it panned out. I would've liked to see more of a comeuppance moment for this nasty character but Ms Bloome doesn't do vengeful for good reason. Too much love and forgiveness going around.It doesn't feel like the end of this series for me. I feel as if there could be some cross over moments in new endeavors down the road, so I'm not sad about the end. Especially because everyone had such a beautiful end to the story arc.",

All the characters come together, there was weddings, love, hate, secrets, triumphs, tears, twists and turns! It kept me interested and guessing throughout and most importantly every character had closure in this last book. I love a book that gives a happy ending for all the important characters!",
