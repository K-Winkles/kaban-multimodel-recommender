Swipe Right for Romance takes the world of dating apps and puts an adorable, entertaining spin on them. I loved the references to classic romcoms like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, and Sleepless in Seattle. Junie gave me major Phoebe Buffay from Friends vibes with her eccentric fashion choices and quirky personality and I loved how hard AJ fell for her despite being such opposites.

I love a good side aching rom com, and this book's wonderful meet cute truly sets that stage, but it has so much more with its comic tone that left me smiling throughout the book and presented me with many wonderfully humorous and insightful lines. AJ and Junie will steal your heart and their story is something right out off the silver screen. With wonderfully paced action that never misses a comic beat and dialogue that simmers with tension and banter, AJ and Junie's story will stay with you long after you close the book. Also, I can't say enough about the secondary characters like Henry, Olivia, and Maxine, AJs Mom, who were as carefully written and real as the main characters themselves! I am thrilled to see this is the start of a new series and I will be there for the Olivia's story as soon as it is available!Just a little teaser of what you will find\u201cThink of yourself [Junie] as a rare gem. Not quite a pink diamond, mind you.... But something like an alexandrite\u2014complex, shifting, requiring the right light to truly shine. AJ can be your light.\u201d\"I am not a priceless stone coveted by the world.\u201d\u201cHe believes you are.\u201d Maxine gazes into my eyes, searching for something only she knows. \u201cMore importantly though, you have to believe it. Set the standard for how people treat you. Don\u2019t be a pearl when you can be a diamond.\u201d\ud83d\udc96That last line IS this book in a nutshell! \ud83d\udc96",

                "reviewText": "This is a standalone opposites attract rom-com.When Junie enters her Love Bug app into a contest run by AJ's company, they meet and have an instant attraction. There is an element of fake dating, but I don't think anyone truly believes they are fake.I loved Junie, she was sassy, quirky, klutzy, funny and unapologetically her - she didn't change or adapt for anyone she knew what she wanted and went for it. AJ was more reserved, he clearly wanted someone to fall in love with but hated the dating apps from past experience.I enjoyed reading about Junie, she was the complete opposite of AJ and they complimented each other - there were lots of funny moments between them. The concept of the app was intriguing, having a different kind of connection before meeting was fun to read.My only bug-bear is with AJ being so professional I couldn't understand why he was so OK with dating someone in the competition, surely it would have caused instant problems with all the other competitors - the issue is irrelevant towards the end, but I kept thinking all the other competitors would have not been happy at all.- standalone- rom-com- opposites attract- fake relationship- grumpy / sunshine",
