I'm glad I did. The story did not rush and had a very good conclusion; I even shed a few tears. I loved all of it. The way the story developed, the way the author described everyone's emotions. The only problem I seem to have is that I am disappointed at the end because this is not real life. Not all the girls are beautiful and not all the men are tall and strong and handsome. Very few men pay attention to details the way Cowley did in the story. Most men Don't even notice, let alone take the time to be that kind of a man. At least not in my world. It gives me the warm fuzzies to be a part of this make-believe world for a time, but I am just disappointed when I come back to reality.",

                "reviewText": "Y\u2019all, here is one of my top favorite authors ever! I discovered Ms. Lowe a few years ago when I read Lulu\u2019s Cafe as an Indie published book. I have since read it countless times. It was one of the first contemporary Christian fiction books I had read where I felt like an author had done \u201creal\u201d and done it in a way that truly showed the gritty reality that life sometimes is. Her writing is some of the most grippingly real and honest I\u2019ve read. She\u2019s not afraid to address some of the deepest hurts we might face in this life. There\u2019s no playing down of that pain, but she also shows a real and lasting hope with each of her books.Just as Ms. Lowe is one of my top favorite authors, Lulu\u2019s Cafe is one of my top favorite books. Because Ms. Lowe doesn\u2019t hesitate to show the raw reality of life, the abominable evil that exists that many have to face, there are portions of this book that are devastatingly hard to read. They hurt. But they are some of the most real moments I think I\u2019ve ever read in fiction. Be prepared for your heart to break. It\u2019s a tough read at points, but there\u2019s a beautiful peace and a hope filled joy by the end. It\u2019s a story that will touch you in the deepest of places.This real, raw grit of life accompanied by a quiet, but powerful beauty of healing and restoration points to something only God can do. He\u2019s a master of redeeming the pain and the hurts this broken life on earth deals out. His power to do so, as well as His tender love as He does it, is clearly shown in this book.Leah is a woman who is truly strong. What she survives and endures is horrifying. And yet, she does indeed survive, and God directs her steps to the place where she can finally find what home, family, and love really mean.Crowley Mason gives heart melting new meaning. The way that he takes care of Lulu and so many others around him is quintessential southern gentleman. How he comes to care for, reach out to, and fight for Leah and their relationship is heart capturing and satisfying to the soul.And then there\u2019s Lulu. Lulu is discerning. And wise. And the kind of love that is both tough and gentle at the same time. She\u2019s a true treasure.In the midst of all the pain and the hurt, Ms. Lowe provides us with some real southern fun and humor and I love the voice that adds to the story.While I have found other authors out there who write \u201creal\u201d and do it well, Ms. Lowe has a unique voice to hers that I haven\u2019t found anywhere else. She does real without glossing it over, showing the far reaching consequences of the evil that exists in this world. But she also demonstrates the beautiful restoration that God can bring about in a life, changing devastation to hope and the ashes of this broken world to something beautiful.PS: I do feel like I should add that some of the events in this book could be a trigger for victims of abuse, so please proceed with caution if that\u2019s you and you choose to read this book.**I previously purchased this an Indie published book and again as traditionally published book. But I also received a complimentary copy of Lulu\u2019s Cafe from the publishers. I was not required to provide a positive review. All opinions expressed are mine alone.",

                "reviewText": "Lulu\u2019s Cafe\u2019 by T. I. Lowe was originally released in 2014. There are some things in this life that are worth repeating, with some updates by the author, Lulu\u2019s Cafe is most definitely a story worth the reading, again and again and again.This unforgettable story will touch your heart like few other stories will; it has taken me weeks to contemplate and digest it. I\u2019ve finally decided this is not a story one can fully understand, I can only embrace it and love it.Leah Allen has suffered horrific abuse at the hands of the man who calls himself her husband. Finally escaping her captor, Leah flees to a small town in South Carolina. In Rivertown Leah finds rest for her battered body, mind and heart when Lulu, the owner of a small cafe\u2019 takes Leah in, offering a place to live and a job. Terrified of being discovered, Leah does not provide her real name and though Lulu tries to befriend the obviously distraught young woman, Leah keeps everyone pushed far away.Meeting the towns most eligible bachelor, Crowley Mason, an attorney and Lulu\u2019s friend does nothing to quell Leah\u2019s fears. As Crowley begins to put bits and pieces together, he finds that he repeatedly lets down his guard when it comes to the haunted and beautiful young woman.As time passes, Leah begins to hesitantly respond to the loving care of Lulu and Crowley. Slowly, walls come down and tiny bits of healing begin, but trust, especially trusting a man, is most impossible; those protective walls are not coming down anytime soon.Leah\u2019s story is mind boggling for me, yet I know there are women who daily face horrible abuse at the hands of the one who should protect them, their husbands or significant other. I mentioned in the beginning how difficult it was for me to contemplate that many are living this horror every day. Even harder for me to understand how these same women, as in Leah\u2019s story, are able to come to a place of any level of healing. Yet, I do know love and patience can provide a path to healing. It can take a tremendous amount of time.There is one thing I\u2019ve no compunction about in Leah\u2019s story...it is the endless love of an understanding God, expressed in the hands of his people that can lead even the most devastated of persons, to a renewed life.I highly recommend Lulu\u2019s Cafe, I suspect it is a story the reader won\u2019t soon forget, and maybe, just maybe spur all of us to be a bit kinder for we have no knowledge of where the next person we meet has trod.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher and am under no obligation to write a positive review. All thoughts and opinions therein are solely my own, and freely given.",

                "reviewText": "(NARRATION COMMENTS: I own the paperback-fabulous cover-but I saw it listed as an audio book. I decided to listen to it. The vocal artist is fantastic, especially the creepy husband\u2019s voice. The only voice that I didn\u2019t care for was Crowley\u2019s. He sounds like a older gentleman. She did an excellent job.)The story is heartbreaking & moving, joyous & wonderful\u2014all at the same time. I want to move to that town! It\u2019s not an easy read because of the abuse component, but it is something that is real and prevalent in society, unfortunately. We can\u2019t hide from it but we can learn and be more aware. This is a reminder how important it is to be watchful and to reach out when someone needs help. Action, not apathy.I will look for other books by this author. Her character development is really good and her style appeals to me very much. This is a book that will stick with me and always be a favourite. I only choose five stars for books that strongly impact and resonate with me.MY BOOK RATINGS:\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fThe book was PHENOMENAL! It caused me to be impacted, challenged, and made me think. The book resonated with me and I didn\u2019t want to leave the characters. It blew me out of the water so much that I told everyone and their \ud83e\uddae to read it!\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fI loved the book! Excellent work! I will read more of their books, without a doubt, and recommend the author to others.\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f I liked the book but I wasn\u2019t as immersed as much as I wanted to be. I will likely try other books by this author to see if different books resonate with me more. Sometimes it\u2019s simply personal taste, subject matter, or other circumstances.\ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f I struggled to read the book and I didn\u2019t enjoy one (or more) of the following: the storyline, the quality or style of writing, or the characters didn\u2019t resonate with me. I likely wouldn\u2019t ever read the author again.\ud83c\udf1f I didn\u2019t care for it at all but managed to skim through it, or finish, but barely. Definitely not for me.",

                "reviewText": "I loved it and read it from cover to cover in just one day. The book quickly draws you in, then you find yourself putting everything else to one side in order to find out what happens next. The DV scenes were written with particular care, and I cried several times at the level of cruelty and violence being described. The fury I felt at the haters was real, as was the overwhelming rush of relief when Leah finally met someone kind and prepared to listen.My only criticism, if you must call it that, was that I felt the final chapter (epilogue) was a bit superfluous. I could have left it quite satisfactorily at the penultimate chapter, and therefore would not have found myself stumbling over so many new names and characters. I got what it was trying to tell me - that our character had found her happily ever after - but it wasn't really necessary. Highly recommended.",
