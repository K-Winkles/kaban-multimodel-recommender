                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed it, loved it at times it had me page turning getting nothing done for hours .Yet at the same time I wanted less description of everything and all the surroundings and more character dialogue .This book delves so deeply into such major life altering and life shattering experiences and issues yet you never really get the full feel of all the characters reactions that you so deeply want and need to read about .At some points I felt cheated by the author's storytelling. It's like you are allowed to know all their secrets but never really know the outcomes from all of the characters. It's as if the author gets you so close to the really emotional depth stuff and then just fades to black for the characters full reaction.So many times you need to understand the characters more and some just feel so elusive Yes you have to pay attention to the chapters and the timeline because it jumps around and I was fine with that but what I wasn't fine with was the way I felt cheated at times by the real emotional depth this story should have delivered and didn't between some of the characters at certain times during this book,and in some cases you just want to \"get it \" understand these characters, truly know them and I felt I truly didn't know or understand all of them .Without giving too much away , there is a death that is just told to you , you know it happens but it doesn't give you the feels that it should between siblings because it just happens and then everyone just moves on .That was wrong .Many missed emotional opportunities from the author .We have a moment when one survivor is sharing her truths with another survivor and the one just doesn't share a word with her .And the ending was just so left to my interruption, I didn't like it at all . So much left at the end that we as the reader have the burden to determine the outcomes. I wanted to hear the words and the truths to be told , I would have given this book 5 stars if only the author had shared everything, had everything come to light so we the reader could hear the words, read the words of regret ,sharing of the pain ,truths etc...Huge missed opportunities over and over again by the author, it was disappointing.Ending is left again up to your interpretation so just keep that in mind.I liked this read when the dialogue was flowing and I loved it at parts too when the emotions were raw and telling and I was very disappointed with the read also .The writing is well done, similar writing style to The Crawdads I thought..This author has talent. I wouldn't skip it at all but I wouldn't feel right recommending because it was good, but frustrating and secretive when it needed to show the reader at the end all of it's cards sort of speak .4 stars , easily could have been a 5 star read if the author did a better job of sharing.",

                "reviewText": "(Spoilers) This book got a lot of hype, so I gave it a shot and had really mixed feelings. While the writing is beautiful and the story is compelling, the main character, Elle, is kind of an a-hole. The young Elle can be somewhat forgiven, and is definitely a sympathetic character based on the sexual abuse she suffers as a child by the young man her step-father brings into her life. Adult Elle was somewhat incomprehensible to me. That said, I do love flawed, dark characters. I just never felt like the author quite bridged the past and present in a way that made me understand and appreciate Elle's character.The story revolves around the past death of her abuser (which she has a hand in), and her present love for her childhood best friend. Elle is married with a family, and so is he, but for some reason, years after they never quite connect as young adults, he's decided he's going to seduce her, and she's ready to be seduced. At the family lakehouse. With the families nearby. Which is fun enough as a plot point, but I found myself rooting against her having either her childhood love OR her perfectly wonderful husband as the book went on. She treats them both terribly, and it really isn't ever clear what either of these men see in her. I just couldn't get past that point - why are these guys even in love with this woman?There are also a few scenes where things happen that are so unbelievable or gratuitous that I felt irritated. (The fooling around in/out of the beach tent with the families feet away scene comes to mind. Yeah, right.)That said, I did finish the book. The beautiful prose and the will they/won't they question were enough to pull me through. I can see why this would be book club fiction. The plot is compelling, the character is debatable, there is a somewhat open question to the ending that is worth discussing.",
