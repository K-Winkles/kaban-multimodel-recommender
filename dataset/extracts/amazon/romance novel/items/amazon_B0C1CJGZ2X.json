She was letting her pride overrule the necessity to tell him the truth. I didn\u2019t like Evan\u2019s cousin Leonard, who was also Arabella\u2019s best friend. He didn\u2019t seem very supportive and helpful when Evan first returned home. The fact that he was willing to use others to cover his own actions made his friendship seem less genuine. I am glad that they had a happy ending and most of the challenges were saved fairly quickly. I don\u2019t like when things drag on and it takes forever for the happy ending.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Can a marriage on the brink of disaster be saved?",
                "reviewText": "Arabella, Duchess of Lancaster, is rumoured to be inviting willing males to her bed. Although nothing could be further from the truth, her husband in name only is persuaded/ bullied into returning to London to \"deal with the problem\" by his rather unpleasant and overbearing grandmother.Having been more or less forced into marriage with Arabella Evan left for his estate immediately after the wedding without consummating it, and has kept himself away from London and his wife for the past five years, but is now forced into her company. The problem was never that he didn't like his wife, but that he found her attractive, and having lost his first wife and his son, he has no wish to love again or to start a family.I enjoyed the story a lot, especially how the couple actually communicated with each other after a few false starts. I didn't suspect who the real villain was or that they would be so dastardly, and neither did I suspect who the person spreading the false rumours was either.The reason for four stars instead of five is the lack of proof reading which would have caught errors like the H suddenly being called Edward, the incorrect use of words and incorrect spelling.I received an ARC from the author but this is my honest opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters are believable. I can feel the simmering friction and disguised attraction between the H and h. I lament the weak character that the H projects. It seems he doesn't know his own mind, nor trust his own decisions so that he comes out as weak. The h on the other hand has more patience than a saint. She went through 5 years without seeing her husband and was prepared to spend more if that was what he wanted! I would not have tolerated any separation arrangement like that. I mean it's just crazy! At last in the end, the H seem to grow a spine and was able to work out that he was the Duke and has power instead of being a child that needed to be told what to do. There are a lot of Steam in this story. Notwithstanding some of the flaws of the main characters, I enjoyed reading this book. The author did a wonderful job of keeping me glued page after page. I like these Kindle Historical Romance books. They are not overly long and can be read in an hour or two. Perfect for a lazy afternoon.",
