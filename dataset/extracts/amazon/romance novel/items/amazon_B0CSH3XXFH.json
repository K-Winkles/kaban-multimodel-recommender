If this is an example of professional writing then the world of the written word is in trouble. The story constantly jumps around, at other times I wasn't even sure I was reading the same book. The descriptions of people and clothing worn to the same event were not the same. It was so distracting I kept going back to reread to make sure I was reading the same book. What gentleman would make love for the first time in a guest room just down the hall from the crowded ball with people walking in the hall just outside the door how disrespectful to the woman he's supposed to love. Both main characters waffled back and forth about their feelings often within the same conversation I got whiplash trying to keep up. Writing jumped from one day then back to another, then skipped back then forward to weeks then back to the same day, totally confusing. It was impossible to stay within the story.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this well-written story Duke Benjamin had been jilted and was against marriage in the future. Abigail was an outspoken young lady but she captured his heart. I liked the way their relationship started with constant verbal battles and gradually they found shared ideals and interests. Both were strong willed and neither wanted to give way but deep down they both realised they were developing feelings for each other. The support of Benjamin's brother, Phillip, and Abigail's cousin Emma, helped both main characters to find ways to share experiences. When Benjamin's ex-fianc\u00e9e appeared, the way forward was confused and Abigail was hurt. Would Benjamin be able to convince Abigail that he should trust him? Read on and enjoy.",
