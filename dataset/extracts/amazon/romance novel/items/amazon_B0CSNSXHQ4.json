But this story pulled me in and kept me until the book was finished. Colby and Lexie\u2019s story was interesting, fun, steamy, sweet and so cool to see them grown not only as a couple but to see Colby come into his warlock powers.I loved their openness to the supernatural world. Colby loved becoming warlock and Lexie accepted every aspect of this new world. I loved getting to see a variety of supernatural creatures including witches, werewolves and of course a ghost.I don\u2019t want do give away too much but I absolutely loved how Colby and Lexie explored their relationship as a married couple and found what they were interested in together. It felt very relatable.I loved that the story and secrets unfolded throughout the book and the friendships and found family Colby and Lexie find within the Super natural community.Colby and Lexie experience ups and downs, challenges and tribulations but through it they rely on each other. There\u2019s action, magic, and a great found family.",

                "reviewText": "I did not hate this book, it was just really difficult for me to get into. First, it is written in third person, which is not my favorite style of writing. After a few chapters, I can generally acclimate to third person and proceed to enjoy the book. The entire time I was reading Warlock: A Strange Grove Novel, it felt like there was a sport commentator in my head giving me a play by play with what was happening in the book. This made for some very interesting moments in the plot for me, and also caused me to take several breaks while reading, which is not my normal. There are a lot of pop culture references in this book, maybe too many, however at times it gave for a humorous inner dialog for Colby, the main male characters. Colby and Lexie are a sugary sweet couple and very likeable main characters. I also found the supporting characters to be very interesting. This was a cute story, several times I felt like the spicy scenes should have been left out and this made a cozy paranormal romance.Overall this is a cute, and enjoyable story. This would be a nice leisurely read for anyone that likes witch and warlock romance books.",

Who doesn't love crossing that line between reality and fantasy, where the book starts out in complete reality only to push you headfirst into a different world, one that still feels real and believable? It was really fun to see the development of the male lead as he learned all about himself and his history! The relationship with his wife was both sweet and extra spicy, creating a fun romp that really stepped a bit into a different zone that I wasn't prepared for, but kind of grew on me. I wasn't sure about a male author in this genre, but heck, this was totally enjoyable, and completely unexpected. All in all, I really enjoyed it, and I will be looking for more work from BJ Wolff!",
