                "reviewText": "This simple, sweet historical romance focuses on two individuals, Phyllis and Alexander, who never have had an interest to marry, and are forced to do so due to a scandal occurring with the Phyllis\u2019s sister. Initially the marriage is tolerable for the couple, as they each try to find their footing in this unexpected relationship. The author does an excellent job in providing believable conflict for the couple, and emphasizing their past histories and insecurities to express their uncertainties about their relationship. I enjoyed how the author paced the story, as the scenes flowed easily and logically. The story is similar to a cozy romance, without the major dramas and villains, but heartwarming and perfect for any age reader.There were a few editing errors that subtracted a star. Several gender/personification errors, his for her, her for him, and several typos. Also, after her sister was married, her husband was incorrectly called \u201cher betrothed.\u201d I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

After coming to know each other, they found that they liked each other or loved each other secretly. Through trials and tribulation they eventually admitted the love that they had for each other when they could have lost each other because of misunderstanding and interference with their families. It was a happy ending for both of them when they confessed true love for each other. It was nice to see that their original plans did not take place. Great storyline looking forward to the next one.",

                "reviewText": "Her Duke for Thirty Days: A Historical Regency Romance Novel is a clean, nice, kind of sparkly story where everything is delightful and perfect. The people are all beautiful and everything is gently and \"delicately\" resolved. The H/h have a difficult time communicating due to personal fears but come to understand their fears and overcome their doubts. Perfectly, gently and delicately. This book is a little hard for me to rate because it wasn't bad, just a little boring. I think it needed more humor and contrast to balance it out.Now, saying this, a soft easy book is not always a bad thing. Sometimes we need gentle sunny perfection in the stressful times of our lives.However, if you are looking for something grittier with less expositon from the main characters, this is not the book for you.To me, the book finally got more interesting when Charlotte showed up. And even her issues were solved just a little too neatly.I think this story would be better served with a little more ugliness to balance all the sweetness. For example, we have hints as to why the mother left but nothing concrete. And where did she go? How did she die? Why did none of the daughters realize how selfish she was? Did the Father truly love her? What were his motivations? These things were hinted at, like just the smallest taste of a dish, but to me needed more meat. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but it never really did.The writing could use a little assistance as well. There was a lot of same word repitition and it was just a bit cloying. Quite a bit of 'telling' but not really enough 'showing'. Again, not dreadful but rather bland.",

                "reviewText": "Both Alexander and Phyllis had rough childhoods that really changed how they viewed marriage. Phyllis was determined to never marry but her father had just informed her that he had an arrangement to marry her to the Duke of Wildaves. She was fighting with him about it when her sister, Joyce, told her that their father had said that unless Phyllis married first then she could not marry the man she had fallen in love with. Phyllis was torn but she loved her sister and would do anything to see her happy and so she told her father she agreed to the match. The couple has their ups and downs but mostly due to their own insecurities and inability to communicate effectively with each other about their innermost thoughts. A very good book and certainly worth the read and to see how things work out between them once they realize how they truly feel about each other.",
