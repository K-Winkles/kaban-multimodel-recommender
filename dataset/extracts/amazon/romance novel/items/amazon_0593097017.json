            "Editorial Reviews Review A YALSA Amazing Audiobook About the Author Heather Buchta graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a B.A. in communications, but she'll tell you the real B.A. in college is learning how to pay bills. After receiving her National Certificate in Youth Ministry Studies from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, she directed youth ministry programs and confirmation classes for both Catholic and Protestant churches. In addition, she taught high school English for a decade in South Central LA. Today, she is a part-time youth pastor for The Rock Covenant Church. In her free time, she enjoys traveling, obstacle-course racing, rock climbing, and snowboarding. She lives in the beach cities of Los Angeles, where she dotes on her dog and writes stories from her indoor porch. Beyond the Break is her first novel. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter OneThe first time a guy felt me up was in the big church prayer room.All the parents of youth--group kids thought church lock--ins were a fantastic \u201coutreach.\u201d So many sign--ups from non--church kids for a night of innocent fun playing sardines and capture the flag, with the gospel message given! Even if \u201cJesus died for you\u201d was thrown into the five minutes between Oreo--eating contests and discussions about which church Justin Bieber attends, seeds were planted!It must be from the Lord.Well, it wasn\u2019t, unless the Lord was the one fanning the flame of rumors about the endless possibilities at lock--ins. Dark rooms. Dark hallways. Lots of games requiring dark rooms and hallways.I was in ninth grade, and this was my first lock--in with our high--school youth group. I had just graduated from junior--high youth group and was nervous, but I had my two best friends Kelly and Lydia, so it was okay. We were playing sardines, where one person hides in the church building with the lights off, and then the masses are released to find that person. After finding the \u201chider,\u201d you hide with him or her until there\u2019s one dogpile of quiet, giggly teenagers waiting for that last scared--poopless soul wandering in the dark after watching everyone disappear.Please don\u2019t let me be the last one, I prayed to Jesus. Oh, and thank you for the cross. I always felt guilty asking God for something without at least thanking him, too. Lydia, who was Catholic and didn\u2019t go to my church except for lock--ins, had sashayed off with some tenth--grade guy named Max, so I was hand in hand with Kelly. \u201cMy goodness, don\u2019t leave me, Lovette,\u201d Kelly begged, but then released my hand and turned a corner into the main sanctuary. When I turned the corner, she was nowhere.\u201cOh God\u2014-I mean, gosh.\u201d I squinted at the shadowed pews. \u201cKelly!\u201d I whisper--yelled. Nothing. I felt my way, back pressed against the wall, searching for a glimmer of movement. A few outlines crept across the balcony, everyone searching for Tim.Tim Rainsforth was a junior and a leader on our worship team, SQUAD, so he\u2019d nominated himself to hide first. I\u2019d never find him. He spent, like, six days a week here and for sure knew every inch of this place.My hand bumped against the doorknob to the prayer room. I\u2019d been here once before, when I asked God for help with my pimples and making the volleyball team, and thanked Him for dogs and the weather. Inside, I couldn\u2019t make out much, but I knew the space was tiny: just a rug, a couch, some pillows to kneel on, and a card table draped with a cloth. On one wall were curtains and a cross. On the opposite wall was a Bible verse: \u201cAnd we know that all things work together for good to those who love God. Romans 8:28.\u201dSomething brushed my leg, and I jumped. My foot landed on a pillow, and I toppled to the ground. An arm wrapped around my stomach and pulled me in.\u201cShh . . . ,\u201d he said, and I sighed with relief. Tim. I\u2019d found him. And first!We were under the card table, and the cloth draped to the ground, so until our group became bigger than four, this hiding place was killer.\u201cWow!\u201d I whispered. \u201cNice spot!\u201d\u201cShh,\u201d he repeated, but I could tell he was grinning, proud. Someone opened the door, and I held my breath. The person was feeling the walls like a blind person reading braille. He or she tapped the top of our card table. I could feel Tim wrapped around me, a leg on each side, and I suddenly forgot about the game. Was this allowed? Sorry, Jesus, sorry, Jesus, sorry, Jesus. My heart thumped loud enough to give us away. Sweating this much had to mean sin. I started to move, but Tim held me firmly. I swear he was more still than a statue. He was so good at this! Tim was always somehow on the winning Ultimate Frisbee or capture the flag team. He also picked the teams. The shadow--person moved the pillows and left the room.\u201cFooled!\u201d Tim whispered.Okay, it\u2019s just legs wrapped around you. It\u2019s just a body. He\u2019s just trying to win. I repeated these lines like a memorized Bible verse. As guilty as I felt, I liked his legs around me. I scrunched my eyes shut. God heard that. Were legs around me considered going too far? How far was too far?We heard another noise outside the door\u2014-someone tripped on a hymnal, probably\u2014-followed by a thump and laughter. Tim responded by clutching me tighter, but his hand accidentally cupped my bra, and I sucked in my breath like someone had walked into the room again. Oh God, oh God, oh God and not gosh because I really meant God. My eyes started to adjust, and I could see his purity ring pressed against my bra. I know I should\u2019ve felt giddy or whatever people feel when hot guys do this, but it was so shocking, I could only gape.Oh God, does this mean I don\u2019t like guys? I mean, gosh.Tim was really good--looking and popular, but this was really weird. He had never held my hand, but now he was holding my boob. I was no relationship expert, but I thought we were skipping some steps in this whole \u201ccourting\u201d thing. Didn\u2019t he just give a talk on this? Through the crack in the tablecloth, I knew the cross was peeking back. Jesus was glaring at me for sure. There\u2019s no way He\u2019d let me make the volleyball team now.\u201cUm . . . ,\u201d was all I could say.He looked down at what he was holding, and his eyes went wide. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014-I swear I didn\u2019t realize\u2014-you kept moving and\u2014-shit.\u201d He let go like my breast was on fire. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he stuttered.Something near the small of my back pressed against me. His hand? Oh no, wait. Ew. I leaped forward, knocking my head on the table. Two people entered the room.\u201cI heard that,\u201d one whispered. I was too busy rubbing my head to tuck myself back under the table.They scrambled over and kicked into me.\u201cWay to kill my hiding place,\u201d Tim grumbled. I could see the outline of his mini Bible sticking out of his pocket. My face flooded with embarrassment. How inexperienced did someone have to be to get a Bible confused with an erection?Anyway, that was two years ago. Tim wasn\u2019t a jerk afterward, either, or weird. Or anything, really. He was always nice to me, and sometimes I wonder if he even knew it was me. We couldn\u2019t fully see each other in the dark, and if I\u2019m honest, back then, my boob could have doubled for a flat stomach. Anyway, that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever done with a guy by a long shot, and I\u2019m proud of it. After all, I\u2019m in eleventh grade and live in Los Angeles! I\u2019m like a walking miracle.Tim goes to community college now, and sometimes I see him in big church, but mostly on holidays with his parents. I hear he still plays guitar but more for gigs, and he wears a puka--shell necklace like a lot of the surfers do, except he doesn\u2019t surf. Or maybe he does, and that\u2019s where he lost his purity ring. It\u2019s not on his finger anymore.Chapter OneThe first time a guy felt me up was in the big church prayer room.All the parents of youth--group kids thought church lock--ins were a fantastic \u201coutreach.\u201d So many sign--ups from non--church kids for a night of innocent fun playing sardines and capture the flag, with the gospel message given!

Or maybe he does, and that\u2019s where he lost his purity ring. It\u2019s not on his finger anymore.Chapter Two Waves. I\u2019m thinking of waves the first time I meet him. Maybe it would\u2019ve been different if I was thinking about God. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m imagining the waves lapping at the beach, one swell cresting higher like it\u2019s winding up but then delivering smooth and even, perfect for riding the line. I don\u2019t notice that someone\u2019s asked me a question until the second time he asks. \u201cHave we met?\u201d It\u2019s 8:55 p.m. on Monday, toward the end of my shift at Billy\u2019s Buns, and I\u2019m staring at a six--inch hoagie layered with roast beef and cheese. No onion, lettuce, pickle. A plain guy. But when I look up at him, he\u2019s anything but plain. I notice his eyes first\u2014-big, dark -brown eyes that make me feel like I\u2019m someone he knows\u2014-and then his shoulders, the kind guys get only after high school. His light -brown hair\u2019s longer than it should be but just barely, which makes it adorable when he blows it out of his face. I suddenly feel ridiculous in my mousy flop of brown hair smushed to my scalp by a hairnet. Holding up the yellow -and white bottles like maracas, I\u2019m double--fisting the mustard and mayo, one in each hand, asking him which, but through the plexiglass, he grins and shakes his head. Neither. This isn\u2019t your future husband, I remind myself. God would never have me meet my future husband like this. Ordering a sandwich from me? No way. Besides, God\u2019s not introducing us to each other in high school. I know. We\u2019ve got a plan, and it\u2019s not happening my junior year. I look down at his sandwich. Did I mess up his order? No, he said plain. I look up at him, my throat dry. \u201cDid I . . . ?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Jake,\u201d he says. \u201cJake Evans?\u201d He says it like a question, like his last name should ring a bell. Kim, my coworker, takes the next lady in line. \u201cLovette,\u201d I manage. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, and I freeze. How does he know me? Then Jake points to my name tag, and I laugh. \u201cRight.\u201d At the cash register, the plexiglass no longer separates us. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar, but I can\u2019t place it, like the feeling of seeing an old friend. \u201cLovette,\u201d he repeats. \u201cThat\u2019s different. I like it.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I say, busying myself with the bill. \u201cSix fifty.\u201d \u201cCan you add a coffee?\u201d I look at the clock. He notices. \u201cTwo--hour drive ahead of me.\u201d \u201cOf course. Cream and sugar?\u201d \u201cNah. Just black.\u201d Definitely out of high school. He hands me a ten, and I make change for him. Why is my hand shaking? Not because I\u2019m interested. Definitely not interested. I don\u2019t date. I wonder if this is what God means when He says, \u201cThe flesh is weak.\u201d My hand is weak, but my heart knows better. There\u2019s no way college--shoulders Jake is for real. I feel my whole body exhale when he turns to leave, but then he stops. U--turns. I suck in my breath. \u201cLovette, what time\u2019s your shift over?\u201d I shake my head, unable to speak, trying to convey \u201cnever.\u201d \u201cRight now,\u201d Kim pipes in and hands me my time card. \u201cI, uh, have to race home.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d he says, smiling warmly. \u201cYou better hurry.\u201d He holds up his sandwich bag. \u201cThank you.\u201d I nod way too vigorously, and he turns and leaves. Everything in me collapses, and I rest against the counter for support. Kim nudges me so the lady can pay for her sandwich. I clock out, turn the open sign to closed, and remove my hairnet and apron. \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d Kim whirls to face me as soon as the lady exits. I grab my backpack from the back room, ignoring her. \u201cHello?\u201d I fiddle with my phone. \u201cToo old for me.\u201d \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t!\u201d \u201cYes, he was. Did you see his shoulders?\u201d \u201cThat means he works out, not that he\u2019s forty!\u201d I fumble with my backpack zipper, my hand still not cooperating. As I pull my swimsuit out of my pack, I mumble, \u201cI don\u2019t date, remember?\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d I say and head to the bathroom to change. Once I\u2019m outside, the beach breeze blows cool against my sweaty neck. I unlock my bike by the light of the moon, coast down the three blocks to the ocean, and then ride ten short blocks south, parking at Old Man Mike\u2019s place. He\u2019s my old surf coach from when I was a kid, a retired guy who lets me stash my bike in his side yard. And my wetsuit. I wriggle into the neoprene, and it\u2019s a bit of a struggle since it\u2019s still damp from yesterday. With my legs and arms suctioned in the suit, I reach over my shoulder and pull the zipper up my back. I get goose bumps from the cold, and my teeth start chattering, but it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s always worth it. I hurdle over the pile of towels, his skateboards, and his two surfboards, then back out the gate. I jog through the alley to the boardwalk, empty except for one lone cyclist with a flashing light. The cold sand squeezing between my toes, I walk onto the beach, look out at the majestic expanse of dark water, and charge at it in full sprint. The moon, whose reflection makes a walkway from me to her, shimmers as white water explodes and crashes at my feet. I don\u2019t hesitate before I leap into the ocean and dive under the cool, churning waters. A smile starts deep inside of me and finishes on my face. The heavens declare the glory of God. This is where I\u2019m home. I don\u2019t know why I feel more alive in the water than on the land, but it\u2019s like I can float and fly and dive, and nothing\u2019s impossible, and the world\u2019s okay. It\u2019s where I feel closest to God, like He\u2019s holding me on all sides and reminding me, \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d And I feel His embrace most in the waves. I don\u2019t care if they crash over me, if they tumble me, if I get tossed around, because even when I\u2019m submerged, I still feel safe. When it all settles, I know the ground\u2019s right there. An hour later, I walk into my house, my hair still tangled and wet from hosing it off at Old Man Mike\u2019s. I wrap it in a T--shirt as I walk down the hall. Dad pokes his head out of my parents\u2019 bedroom. \u201cHi,\u201d he whispers. \u201cMom\u2019s already asleep. How was the Y?\u201d Usually he says, \u201cHow was it?\u201d so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m lying when I say, \u201cGreat,\u201d but today, he asks how the YMCA was\u2014which is where he\u2019s assumed I go every day since it\u2019s right next to my work, and I come home from Billy\u2019s Buns with wet hair. I\u2019ve never corrected him. \u201cHmm?\u201d I say because I hate lying. Like hate hate it. There are certain sins you do without thinking about them, and that\u2019s bad enough, knowing sin put Jesus on the cross. But lying\u2019s one of those sins that you know you\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s just mean to Jesus. It\u2019s like saying you\u2019re His friend while hammering another nail on that cross. \u201cHow was it?\u201d I exhale, because the YMCA\u2019s no longer part of his question. How was it? It could mean anything. \u201cGood! Really good,\u201d I say. He comes into the hallway, closing his door. Darts a look back toward their room. \u201cMatty\u2019s coming home next month to surprise your mom for her birthday.\u201d My brother\u2019s in his third year at UC Santa Cruz, and he\u2019s way closer to my parents than I am, but I\u2019m fine with that because when he was younger, he almost died. If I had a kid who was basically brought back from the dead, every day with him would feel like my birthday. \u201cHey.\u201d Dad puckers his lips, brings his face close to my scalp, and inhales. \u201cThey cleaning that pool at the Y?\u201d I don\u2019t answer because, again, the lying thing. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like chlorine.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I say to his second statement. \u201cI rinsed off before I came home.\u201d Which is true, and once again, I\u2019ve avoided lying. But I feel a little twisty in my stomach. Dad salutes me. \u201cWell done, soldier,\u201d he says, which is kind of dorky, but I like it, because he musses my hair and it makes me feel like he\u2019s proud and I\u2019ve changed the world a little. I enter my room, close the door, and apologize to God for my non--lie lies. My mind drifts back to Jake Evans. Why did he want to know when my shift was over? Was he really interested? I\u2019ve never been interested in dating. I mean, why bother entertaining those thoughts if I\u2019m not going to marry the guy? And I\u2019m definitely not getting married until I finish college, which is, like, in six years. So he\u2019s off--limits, which means thinking about him now would only be bad. Remember King David? He thought about Bathsheba when she was off--limits and ended up having sex with her and getting her pregnant, then sending her husband to the front lines of war to cover his butt. No, thank you. But what if I think about future Jake Evans\u2014-like the Jake Evans that I meet again six years from now. I can dream about that Jake . . . right? He would love animals, build houses for the homeless, and lead worship, and we\u2019d go on night hikes, live on the ocean, and swim twice a day. His shoulders would be the same, I think as I sink into my pillow. They\u2019re already perfect. Chapter Three At youth group two days later, I\u2019m still in the parking lot looking for Kelly when I see her wave and hop off the brick wall she\u2019s sitting on. That should\u2019ve been my first clue. Kelly doesn\u2019t hop. She moseys. Her feet don\u2019t leave the ground when she walks. Her hair\u2019s always in a messy bun, with that single inch--wide streak of purple bright against her blond. One of the leaders blows the conch, which means we\u2019re starting the group game downstairs in five minutes. Church has been a second home to me since sixth grade, and there\u2019s a rhythm to it that I\u2019ve come to love. Big--group game, followed by same--sex small groups, and then back together for worship and prayer. I love the pattern of it, the routine. Every week, I know what I get. Lydia tried to explain to me once that\u2019s why she loves her Catholic church. Something about tradition, and how we\u2019re creatures of habit, and something else that I\u2019m sure\u2019s all good, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever leave my church for hers, not when this place is the reason I love God so much. Or at all. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d Kelly says and squeezes my hand. She loves touching people while she talks. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWho!\u201d she squeals back, which doesn\u2019t help me. She twirls my hair into ringlets. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say \u2018hit\u2019 with an S in front, you\u2019ll see, but I call dibs.\u201d Is someone back from college? Sometimes old youth--group kids come back to visit for a night. Whenever it\u2019s a guy, the girls swoon, like being out of high school makes him perfect boyfriend material. Of my two best friends, Lydia\u2019s the crazy one, but Kelly\u2019s usually mellow, so seeing her like this means she must like this guy, whoever he is. I\u2019m guessing Tim Rainsforth. It\u2019s like a movie premiere when he comes back on his semester breaks. The music blares from the speakers downstairs, something about eternity, and the way the drums and the bass pound, it makes me feel like heaven\u2019s gotta be way better than roller coasters or bungee jumping. Kelly loops her arm through mine as we walk down the steps to the youth room, side--hugging anyone we pass. Brett, our youth pastor, is on the microphone as we enter. \u201cHey, hey! There are three large squares on the carpet I made with painter\u2019s tape. Find your way into one of those squares.\u201d The carpet\u2019s so thin that you could sweep up a spilled can of Coke with a broom. Or drape it with long pieces of painter\u2019s tape. Our youth room is how I imagine college apartments. Mismatched, comfy couches. A Ping--Pong and foosball table in one corner. Three Nerf basketball hoops. The walls covered in posters of extreme sports\u2014-a skier midair with a snow cliff above, a rock climber hanging from a precipice by his fingertips, a base jumper sailing through a bottomless sky\u2014-and on each poster, a quote about living for Christ. Some kids start yelling, \u201cPoop deck!\u201d and divide themselves up between the three carpet \u201csquares.\u201d Brett laughs. \u201cYes! We\u2019re playing poop deck! It\u2019s about to get \u2018lit\u2019 in here, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019, brahs?\u201d He doesn\u2019t notice the groans and eye rolls. Brett is the best youth pastor. He doesn\u2019t talk to us like we\u2019re five, or yell at us to stop chatting when we\u2019re playing games. The only problem is that he tries to talk like a teenager, but he uses the words in all the wrong places. No one cares, because for the most part, Brett puts up with way more than our parents would. And his talks make you get so fired up for God. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He holds the microphone close. \u201cMiggity--miggity--mic check! For the one person who grew up in a cave and hasn\u2019t played this game, here are the rules. There are three large squares in the room: poop deck on the left, half deck in the middle, and quarter deck to the right. If I yell \u2018Half deck!\u2019 everyone run to that square. If you\u2019re already in that square, you\u2019re safe. Our leaders will be the refs. Last two people to each square are out. Oh, if I call \u2018Hit the deck!\u2019 you\u2019ve all gotta jump down to your bellies. Last two people to the ground are \u2018Bye, Felicia.\u2019 If you\u2019re one of the last five remaining, you win\u2014-wait for it, wait for it\u2014-a five--dollar gift card to Two Guns Espresso.\u201d Everyone keeps talking and giggling over him, but Brett doesn\u2019t care. \u201cAnd one, two, three . . . poop deck!\u201d Instantly fifty teenagers scramble. Kelly and I are already in the poop--deck square, so she embraces me in a bear hug like we\u2019ve already won. The square\u2019s not big enough for fifty teenagers, and it\u2019s a giant mosh pit of laughter and squished bodies. \u201cThere he is!\u201d she says in my ear. I try to turn my body around, but I can only stretch my neck. In the corner of the square, his eyes, barely above the other heads, look back at me. Deep -brown eyes peeking out of his slightly too long hair. It can\u2019t be. The refs must\u2019ve pulled the last two people out from that round because I hear Brett holler, \u201cHit the deck!\u201d and the masses drop to the ground. I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t. Everything in me\u2019s stiff as a surfboard. Not sure I even blink. \u201cOoh, Lovette, no replay needed,\u201d Brett says through the microphone. Candy, one of the youth leaders, touches me on the shoulder to move me to the wall with the others who are out, now four of us. What\u2019s he doing here? How did he find me? Did he ask my coworker Kim, and did she rat me out? It\u2019s too much. I step outside for some air. \u201cYou okay?\u201d someone says in my ear, and I practically jump out of my clothes. It\u2019s Candy. She\u2019s in her thirties, and holy Bibles, she\u2019s intense about the Lord. \u201cOh. Yeah, just needed a bathroom break.\u201d \u201cPraise God.\u201d \u201cI suppose.\u201d Should I praise Him for that too? \u201cI just mean you looked like something was wrong. I thought you might need prayer.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d I smile. \u201cAmen.\u201d She extends her arm for a high five. I slap her hand. Should I tell her about Jake? I imagine her praying in tongues over me for protection. \u201cThanks, Candy. I\u2019m good.\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s good but God.\u201d \u201cRight. Okay, well, I\u2019m just gonna go pee.\u201d \u201cBe blessed!\u201d she calls. On my way back to the youth room, someone taps me on the shoulder, and I jump again. What\u2019s with Candy sneaking up on me? Then I remember she\u2019s probably on \u201cpot patrol.\u201d Every week, one of the adult leaders is designated to do the rounds of the church property, making sure that none of the teens are slinking away to engage in activities that would make Baby Jesus cry. We call them the \u201cpot patrol.\u201d I turn and say, \u201cI swear I only peed,\u201d but I\u2019m face--to--face with Jake Evans. He grins and scratches his head right above his ear. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping score.\u201d Chapter Four \u201cOhmygoshyou\u2019renotCandy.\u201d I\u2019m more breathing than talking. \u201cNo,\u201d Jake says. \u201cCandy would\u2019ve probably told you not to swear.\u201d I smile and stop. \u201cWait, how do you know that?\u201d He starts to say something and then doesn\u2019t. He cocks his head, and his hair falls to the side. \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember me.\u201d \u201cOf course I do,\u201d I say, as professional as I can. \u201cYou bought a sandwich from me.\u201d He smiles, looks up at the ceiling, and then down again. \u201cYes. Yes, I sure did. I, uh\u201d\u2014-he rakes his hand through his hair\u2014-\u201cI was in youth group here in sixth grade. It was called Fire, right? The first year you started coming to church. Mine too.\u201d \u201cHow do you\u2014-\u201d \u201cWe were new the same night. I remember because I was so glad they didn\u2019t make me stand in front of the group by myself.\u201d I\u2019m drawing a blank. That following year was rough for me, but I don\u2019t remem\u2014-and then I look. Really look. Dark -brown eyes. It\u2019s a faint memory, like the wisps of a dream as you wake up. \u201cJacoby,\u201d I murmur. We weren\u2019t close; I mean, not that I remember. Not sure we even talked. \u201cJust Jake now.\u201d \u201cYou were so little,\u201d I blurt. He really was. Like a doll. Scrawny with a buzz cut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2014-\u201d \u201cNo, no. I get it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYeah, I was a drop in the bucket. Anyway\u201d\u2014-he motions toward the youth room, and we start walking back\u2014-\u201cI just moved back. Well, for the weekdays. Long story. Military brat.\u201d I feel my shoulders relax. \u201cMe too. Military kid, that is. Well, Dad\u2019s retired.\u201d \u201cYeah? Look, we weren\u2019t that good of friends back then. But I remember you. Maybe your name stuck out. When I saw you at the sandwich shop, I thought, she has to be the same Lovette. Anyway, I was going to tell you all that when you got off work, but you rushed off, so . . .\u201d Oh man, I feel like such a tool. He wasn\u2019t trying to flirt with me at all. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t feel the giddiness of that first night. I just feel kind of self--absorbed. He shoos my words away with his hand. \u201cPlease. I shouldn\u2019t have bugged you at work. Probably looked like a creeper. Anyway, I\u2019m a senior, and it really sucks being the new kid. Just was trying to\u2014-\u201d \u201cNo, I get it! And I\u2019m so sorry. It was one of those days.\u201d Was it? Am I non--lie lying again? He repeats, \u201cOne of those days,\u201d as if he had one, too, and now I wish I did have one. We enter the youth room as kids are filing out to their small groups. \u201cOh, by the way,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re in room fifteen. Senior guys.\u201d \u201cRight. Thanks.\u201d He smiles again. He has a dimple in his left cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, see you back in here for worship?\u201d I nod, and he turns to go, but then he turns back. \u201cHey, do you still surf?\u201d Something catches in my throat, stopping my words. I lick my lips, and I can taste my Dr Pepper ChapStick. I shake my head. At least it\u2019s not a lie\u2014-it\u2019s true, I don\u2019t surf\u2014-but it feels as crummy as a lie. \u201cAw, that\u2019s too bad. You were amazing.\u201d The compliment warms me, and I find my voice. \u201cEh. Maybe for a sixth--grader.\u201d \u201cNah. For anyone. You could\u2019ve competed against high--schoolers back then.\u201d Wait. That means he does remember more about me than just my name. The rest of youth group\u2019s a blur. In our junior girls\u2019 small group, Kelly draws designs on my jeans with her finger as we all talk about effective ways to evangelize at school. The girls are having side conversations about \u201cthe new guy,\u201d who really isn\u2019t the new guy but the old guy who\u2019s just been out of town for five years. Only Kelly knows this. \u201cJacoby Evans,\u201d she whispers in my ear as Nicole suggests leaving encouragement notes from Jesus in student lockers. \u201cJust Jake now,\u201d I whisper, and Kelly stops drawing on my jeans. \u201cI ran into him at the bathrooms.\u201d Charlotte suggests making cookies and giving out plates of them for free with a Post--it that says friendship with Christ is free too. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how different he looks,\u201d I say. He\u2019s nothing like I remember. Kelly shifts like the floor got uncomfortable. \u201cOh, but you still don\u2019t date, right? Besides, I totally said\u2014-\u201d \u201cYou guys would make a cute couple,\u201d I say, and I squeeze her arm to emphasize it. \u201cI just mean he used to be so little, I didn\u2019t even recognize him.\u201d \u201cRight?\u201d She resumes squiggling on my pant leg. Back in the youth room, I sit in the front row. I need time to think about God. To sing and remind myself how much I love Him. To remember His faithfulness to me back in seventh grade. The ways He totally took care of me when no one else did. And my single simple promise I made back, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. By the end of worship, it\u2019s a no--brainer. God has given Jake to be my friend and maybe Kelly\u2019s boyfriend. As soon as I hear the final \u201cAmen,\u201d I stand to exit, but Kelly\u2019s hand finds mine. \u201cKel, I gotta jet,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can hang for two seconds. Let\u2019s just make sure he feels welcome.\u201d I look over at Jake, and there are at least two guys and four girls already talking with him. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s doing fine.\u201d But she\u2019s already pulling me, weaving in and out of teens and chairs and trash cans full of empty chip bags and Capri Suns. I recognize Dave among them, leaning on a table, strumming his guitar. He\u2019s not on the worship team or anything. He just likes to bring his guitar everywhere. \u201c\u2014-so bummed you\u2019re not at Mira Costa High,\u201d one of the girls (Carrie, I think) says. \u201cMy aunt lives closer to the 405,\u201d Jake says. \u201cSo it was either Hawthorne or the charter.\u201d \u201cOoh, Hawthorne High,\u201d Dave says, and there\u2019s a collective wince from the group. \u201cYeah, definitely the charter.\u201d The charter? As in Maritime Academy? \u201cHey, Lovette goes there,\u201d Dave says as he sees me. \u201cShe could show you around.\u201d Wait, no. \u201cJake, this is Kelly,\u201d I say quickly, then add, \u201cShe\u2014-\u201d \u201cI remember you from Fire,\u201d Kelly jumps in, releasing my hand to shake his. \u201cOh, right!\u201d He gives her a friendly handshake, but he glances at me, and I wonder if he remembers her. \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d \u201cSame. I mean, not same since then, but, you know, nothing much. You?\u201d Oh boy, she\u2019s nervous. I should help. \u201cKelly goes to Maritime too. She also attends this poetry thing on Tuesday nights at this coffee shop.\u201d He looks from me to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to meet people,\u201d I add. \u201cYeah,\u201d Dave says, plucking his guitar. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. I\u2019ve played some of my songs there.\u201d \u201cKelly can tell you the details,\u201d I say, nudging her forward. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d Kelly pleads. \u201cI\u2019m on my bike, and\u2014-\u201d \u201cBut you always stay for at least fifteen.\u201d I back out and wave. \u201cI know, but I\u2019ve gotta hurry.\u201d Jake says, \u201cOne of those days again?\u201d I see him grinning at me with that dimple, and I laugh, and he laughs, and then I realize we have our first inside joke. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d I take the stairs two at a time to my bike and pedal down the long driveway before anyone\u2019s made it back to the parking lot. Maybe I should\u2019ve given him my number or a place to meet at school where I can show him around. But that all feels wrong as I picture the look in Kelly\u2019s eyes when she saw him. My feelings feel like sin and not sin at the same time. Dark blurs of trees and houses whiz by, and I look up at the night sky. Clouds cover the moon tonight, and I try to pray but everything feels jumbled, so I settle on one word. Help? Read more"

        "description": "For fans of Sarah Dessen and Jenny Han, Beyond the Break is a funny and gorgeous debut about a girl experiencing her first love. Well, second, if you count her faith... and that's where things may get complicated.Manhattan Beach native Lovette has two rules in life. One: no surfing. Not after her brother's accident. Two: absolutely, no dating. And going into her junior year of high school, she's pretty happy with that arrangement. She has friends, her church youth group, and God to fall back on when things get dicey. But after Jake Evans walks into her life, following these two simple rules gets a lot more complicated. Jake is the boy from Lovette's childhood who grew up. Handsome and sweet, he unlocks the part of Lovette that wants nothing more than to surf the waves again. And as their relationship grows, she begins to question what it means to be faithful: to her family, to God, but mostly, to herself. Told with humor and heart, Heather Buchta delivers a sparkling debut that asks the question: Can you fall in love, be a teenager, and also be a good Christian?",

                "reviewText": "Heather Buchta in her first novel hits it out of the park. If you're into YA faith based novels, this is a must read. Ms. Buchta creates vivid characters and really zeros in on the church youth group culture. One might say some of the characters are cliche, however, there not cliche because every youth group has them: The hyper spiritual person who can sometimes be cruel, the friend who just comes to be with the crowd and the boy who comes just to get a girl. She weaves solid teaching in with a good story that doesn't pull punches or saccharin over the tougher parts of growing up and falling in love. If your a teen reading it, you will totally relate and if an adult, it will bring you right back to your awkward high school days and struggling to grow up and figure out how life works. Can't wait for her next novel.",

                "reviewText": "Love. Love. LOVE! Beyond the break was such a fun read for me! I am not one who usually reads YA, but I found this refreshing and just an enjoyable read. The characters are sweet and innocent and yet deal with real teen issues. Lovette is a sweet young girl who is struggling with real issues of purity and commitment to God. As a Youth Pastor, I felt like these were the kids in my youth group! I could hear their hearts and their struggles with their faith, their daily life and learning how to not just be a Christian by going to church or youth group, but to live their lives as real authentic Christians.Even if you\u2019re not a Christian, it\u2019s a fun read and filled with the friend and family struggles most teens experience. Great read and would highly recommend it! -and shout out to my sister Lovette! I\u2019ve never seen that name in any show or book before!",
