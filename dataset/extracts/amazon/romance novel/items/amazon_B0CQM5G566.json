                "reviewText": "Ava, a healer, killed a corrupt clan leader, Laird Patrick MacCarthy's father, who abused women. She was on the run, but went back to her home village to see her mother.Laird Patrick had stolen a shipment from Laird Callum's clan and Callum was attacking Patrick's soldiers at the same village where Ava's mother lived. Patrick and Callum fought each other and Callum won. Patrick said he would return the shipment, but Callum said it was not enough. Patrick offered any woman in the clan, pulling women out of the crowd, scaring the villagers. In the process, Patrick spied Ava and planned to torture and kill her to avenge his father's death.Callum said he wanted Ava to fulfill his debt and left Patrick looking bad if he did not agree. Ava did not like being a pawn, and Callum told her he would not force her, but staying in in Patrick's clan might be deadly, so Ava agreed.Then Callum had a great idea. His clan council members were pressuring him to find a wife every month and gave him a deadline. So he proposed a plan with Ava. If she pretended to be betrothed to him for a period of time, that would take the pressure off him for a while and he would in return bring Ava's mother and a friend of Ava to his clan and would give them enough money to live comfortably after they \"broke up\".The problem was they fell in love and Callum was afraid to marry because his father had set a fire that killed him and his wife and Callum was concerned that it would be a generational illness. His father had always been good to him and loved his wife, then suddenly this tragedy happened.There was a flaw in the story of his parent's death that was revealed later. I really enjoyed the book and the characters in it and highly recommend reading it!One problem was that",

No spoilers but the hero is truly a hero and not the tortured madman he fears himself to be and Ava - well, she did really murder someone - but she also saved others in the process. The consequences of what they actually did and/or feared they would do keeps the reader guessing. There is a real twist at the end but Callum and Ava have their HEA after all.",

They have a fake betrothal but this don\u2019t work that way. A great read. I received a ARC copy and leave a honest review. I recommend this book to other readers.",
