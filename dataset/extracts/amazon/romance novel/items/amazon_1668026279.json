Set in the world of Icebreaker, it is a light, steamy romance that\u2019s utterly enjoyable.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fShy goalie Russ and seemingly flighty Aurora hook up at a Maple Hills end of the year party. But Aurora sneaks out afterwards, and doesn\u2019t expect to see him again. Except she does, when it turns out they are both spending the summer as counselors at her beloved overnight camp. After an awkward beginning, though, it seems their biggest issue might be the camp\u2019s staff no fraternization policy. Can they keep a lid on their growing attraction and feelings?Russ is a sweet golden retriever hero who doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough for Aurora. And, Aurora is the commitment-phobic character who can\u2019t fathom how to be in a relationship. While both characters have pressing family issues, it\u2019s fun watching them bring out the best in each other. I adored their \u201csecret for a secret\u201d exchanges, which managed to build their relationship and show off their growing chemistry.Wildfire clearly works as a standalone story. But if you liked Icebreaker, you\u2019ll enjoy this book too. And while Russ is a hockey player, this is a story about college students, not hockey. Sometimes a low angst book with likable characters is exactly what you are looking for in a romance, and Wildfire fits the bill.Wildfire is a light, steamy new adult romance. If you are a fan of likable college student characters with a hero who connects with actual golden retrievers, you will be entertained by this enjoyable book.",

Although Wildfire was super cute, I can definitely say that I prefer romance books deep in the sports scene (hockey, baseball, basketball), with a bit more spice.\u2022I did really like how the female main character, Aurora, brought out the confident side of the male main character Russ. THAT DARE and SPICY JENGA!\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude05 I\u2019d feel all hot and bothered to Russ, so don\u2019t be embarrassed. I also really enjoyed the #foundfamilytrope because I love seeing my favorite characters get what they deserve (especially since I do not have that in real life), so I live vicariously through them.\u2022Overall, I\u2019d rate the storyline/plot a \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f/5 stars and the smut/spicy scenes a \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f/5. I am going to share some of my favorite quotes below:1. \u201cPeople mistake me being quiet for being shy, but I\u2019m not shy. I prefer to sit and listen than be the focus of everything. There is too much pressure with being the center of attention. I\u2019m much happier being an observer, watching from the outside\u201d.2. \u201cGeorge Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson\u201d.3. \u201cI have a habit of leaving a path of destruction in my wake, both literally and metaphorically\u2026.

                "reviewText": "My god I don\u2019t know what Hannah Grace is putting in her books but I\u2019m completely addicted!!! I absolutely LOVE Icebreaker and was worried this one wouldn\u2019t be as good because it was set at a summer camp so I thought the amazing friend group from Icebreaker would be missing. I\u2019m so happy that not only was that not the case (I swear I giggled every time Henry made an appearance because I\u2019m so obsessed with him) but we also get some amazing new friends with Xander and Emilia. I honestly kinda hope we get a Xander book someday in the future. All the people we know and love from UCMH are still so involved in this story because they all love Russ so much and of course have their usual shenanigans lolRuss is such an amazing MMC and there were several times when he\u2019d be explaining how he views his dad and their relationship because of his addiction where I just really felt seen for the first time in the way I view my own father\u2019s addiction versus other addicts. Russ was also so great at making Rory feel wanted like she needed. He would say the sweetest things and every time he\u2019d blush I fell more in love with him.Aurora is hilarious first of all. I would have had the exact same reaction if I felt something touch my foot in any body of water lol There were parts of Rory and her relationship with her dad that also made me feel seen. It\u2019s rare I think to be able to relate so much to both the FMC and the MMC on something so closely related. I think that just goes to show how amazing of a writer Hannah Grace is. There\u2019s also a scene where Jenna is telling Rory that \u201cdad\u201d is just a word without any action behind it and it was definitely an emotional conversation for me to read. Rory is just all around an amazing character.There definitely isn\u2019t as much spice in this book as there is in Icebreaker. This goes from a one night stand to a slow burn. But because it\u2019s Hannah Grace, the spice is spicing when you get to it.Finally - I\u2019m so excited that Henry\u2019s book is next lolSpice: 2.5/5",

                "reviewText": "Hannah Grace\u2019s Wildfire follows Russ Callaghan and Aurora Roberts, two college students at Maple Hills. They meet at a party, hook up, and then Aurora disappears whilst Russ is in the bathroom. Then they both find themselves helping out at the same summer camp. They don\u2019t get along at first, but this book is all about two people learning how to communicate, and falling in love. I loved Icebreaker but Wildfire is much more romantic. My favourite character is Aurora because she\u2019s so relatable; she\u2019s 5\u20197, curvy, loves food, cares about the environment, loves books. Something I love about Hannah Grace\u2019s female character is how they aren\u2019t the stereotypical female love interest, they aren\u2019t innocent girls waiting for a bad boy to add excitement to their life. They\u2019re strong, independent, and exciting all on their own. My least favourite character is Aurora\u2019s dad, because he\u2019s useless. I recommend this book because Aurora and Russ really understand each other, they make each other feel wanted and valued, and they want each other for who they are. The found family in the Maple Hills universe will get me every time. \u2018This group is a family more than they\u2019re friends, and they\u2019re so welcoming that it\u2019s impossible not to fall in love with every single one of them.\u2019 Also, it\u2019s very different to Icebreaker which makes me more intrigued for Daydream. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I love books. I love stories about people I don\u2019t know, and places I haven\u2019t been to. I\u2019ve lived a thousand lives between a thousand pages, but no story, no life, no page has ever made me as happy as you do, Russ Callaghan.\u201d",
