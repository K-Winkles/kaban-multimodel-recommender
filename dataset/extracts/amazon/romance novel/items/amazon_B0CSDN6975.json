                "reviewText": "Daphne and Adrian were friends since their youth, but when Daphne announces she loves Adrian, he responds in an unintentional hurtful way. Their lives then separate, and after two years, Adrian returns and their paths cross at a ball. This is an emotional story as each character misunderstands behaviors and actions, which separates them further. Adrian\u2019s character had drawn out insecurities and his reluctance to take a step forward was a bit unnerving. I enjoyed the story, but felt the book could have lost several chapters in the middle, and it would have still been a cohesive story, as I felt some areas in the middle were repetitive. The last third of the story was great. Aware of nefarious characters throughout, they really took center stage which ramped up the endings excitement. The book also needed another review by an editor, as there were several word mistakes. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Determined to not let Adrian hurt her again she has some very tall walls built around her, but circumstances and a meddling matron are determined to tear them down. There is quite the plot twist that adds supsense. Overall a very enjoyable read.",
