                "reviewText": "Original Publication: 1997I first read this book more than a decade ago and recently decided to re-read many of Ms. Quinn's older books that I read around that time frame. My tastes have changed over the years and sometimes find I don't love a book as much as I did previously. However, I'm very happy to say that is not at all the case with EVERYTHING AND THE MOON...The story revolves around the forbidden love between an earl (Robert) and the vicar's daughter (Victoria) whom he adores. Add in two fathers determined to keep them apart and you have a couple who will have to navigate betrayal, heartache, misunderstandings, and a rather rocky road before they can achieve their happily ever after.I'm always a sucker for young loves getting a second chance though so this story called to me from the start. The idea of a love so deep and pure that it stands the test of time calls to the romantic in me every time. JQ even made me believe in love at first sight, which is a testament to her skill as a writer since I don't often buy that aspect. It takes a very talented author to make me believe in that rare occurrence, but I definitely became a believer.Victoria and Robert's romance was at times heartbreaking but always beautiful. There was never a doubt in my mind that these two were soul mates and meant to be together. I even found myself crying at one pivotal point in this lovely tale. I honestly thinks it's one of Quinn's best books and I actually look forward to reading it again sometime. Just a truly delightful and charming historical romance and one that I would very highly recommend \ud83d\ude0aPages & Kindle Locations: The story ended at 98% on page 372 and location 4152.",

I don't know how long Ellis was tied up but Victoria could have sent her with a message to take to Robert as soon as possible! Robert could have confronted Victoria before he decided to leave for London. However, it broke my heart when Robert tried so patiently to win her back and she not only did not want him back but her comments to him were filled with such hatred! This is what I would tell her if I were Robert, \"as much as I love you, I cannot live a lifetime with a wife that shows . So much hatred for me. I'm sure that there is someone that can love Mr and accept me as I am! He redeemed himself for his mistakes , she was a cold witch!!",

Great drama and fun scenario that landed the lovers back in their lives. Too bad the book really drags out.their fighting is amusing but not for the seven chapters it feels like, especially when Robert realizes he loves Victoria. That's where the story has no where to go so the heroine stays mad like a school brat even though the sexual chemistry is oozing through pages.she keeps denying him when he's being a perfect nice hero. A Gentleman with dirty thoughts. He should have dropped her for the spoiled brat she was being, not like her younger self in the beginning chapters. I love Julia quinn. She's still my favorite author",

If you're on the bubble about purchasing it, it's worth it - go ahead. Julia Quinn's books are just entertaining reads. I got a little exasperated with the characters in the middle but I always liked them and found many parts of their story quite touching. I could feel their pain during their conflicts and separation, and when an author can do that, it's worth a read.Yes, I found myself questioning the fast declarations of love. And then even the immediate love itself, but I started thinking back when I was a teenager and how quickly it can happen. Yes at first sight the feeling can be there and they are loves one always remembers.",

The characters are written well and I wanted them to be happy so much. Robert and Victoria's bantering made me chuckle out loud a few times and made me smile alot too.It was romantic and sweet, and a very fun read.A great introduction to Julia Quinns books.

                "reviewText": "Nach den vielen negativen Rezensionen war ich etwas abgeschreckt, aber daa Buch hat mich positiv \u00fcberrascht. Es hat eine un\u00fcbliche Handlung, mal fern ab von London. Es dreht sich alles um die w Protagonisten und die Entwicklung ihrer Beziehung. Mit pers\u00f6nlich gefiel es sehr gut, dass es mal nicht einfach mit einer Liebeserkl\u00e4rung getan war , sondern auch Themen wie Vertrauen, Ehrlichkeit und die Dynamik in einer Beziehung angesprochen wurden. Ich fand es sehr gelungen wie die inneren Konflikte thematisiert wurden und sich Zeit genommen wurde die Charaktere kennen zu lernen, die diesmal ganz anders sind als in all den anderen B\u00fcchern.Gro\u00dfe Empfehlung von meiner Seite!",

                "reviewTitle": "Sweet and mushy",
                "reviewText": "I'm not normally a fan of mushy novels but this one was so well done I really enjoyed it.Robert and Victoria fall instantly in love when they are very young. She is the daughter of the vicar and he is the heir to an Earldom. Due to the differences in their station their fathers are against the match. The dads use lies and physical restraint to separate the lovers, ensuring that each believes they were sold out by their lover.Six years later Victoria is an oppressed governess when Robert encounters her. Their anger at each other is fierce, fanned by the bitterness of betrayed love. Robert plots to bring Victoria down.In between the mushy drama are some funny bits such as when Victoria attracts a female entourage who shield her from Robert's attentions. I also liked the emotional veracity of the lead characters, faulty as they were. Many romances engineer drama through conflict that doesn't make sense. This is not the case here. It's a sweet fun read that I highly recommend.",
