                "reviewText": "As an avid romance lover, I LIVE for the happily ever after. I want to laugh, cry, and feel all the things right along with the characters. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude0d After another long bout with depression, reading and writing had lost its luster these past few months.That is until this story came into my life...I discovered the Webtoon of Lore Olympus through a random Tiktok on Hades and Persephone. I knew nothing of Greek mythology nor the wild story of Persephone's kidnapping. Not only has this graphic novel inspired a thirst for knowledge, it brought real joy back to reading again for me.The enchanting artwork of Lore Olympus flows flawlessly from page to page as the storytelling weaves an intricate web of intrigue. It doesn't shy away from the hard subjects (sexual assault, etc.), but handles them as well as the victims with grace and dignity. It's hard to strike a delicate balance between the beauty of love with the ugliness of life, but this book does it and does it well.Drawing from Greek mythos, LO brings a fresh look at age-old stories and breathes life into them again with modern twists and turns to engage you even further. Persephone and her youthful naivety makes you want to put bubble wrap around her and protect her from the meanies who threaten to destroy her beautiful innocence. And my boy Hades? He's the stuff age-gap romance heroes are made of \u263a Several of my favorite romance tropes are explored within the LO world and its supporting cast. Get ready to fall head over heads in love with Eros, Hermes, and Hera who add splendor and their own special blend of spice to the mix.I'm not one to buy a lot of physical book copies, but I love this story so much, I went ahead and purchased the hardback cover to start my collection. In addition to eagerly anticipating each new weekly episode of LO on Webtoon (9pm EST every Saturday for those interested \ud83d\ude0f), I'll be chomping at the bit to get all of the hardcovers in my hands and relive all the LO feelgoods once more. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc99Although this is only one volume of the story, it's a perfect foray into the world of LO for newcomers to get acquainted with the spellbinding worlds of Olympus and the Underworld as well as their variable Who's Who lists. Hit that One-Click button and prepare to marvel at this gorgeously illustrated tale of first love, broken trust, and the rise of a new queen... \ud83d\udc51PS If you are a LO lover, the bonus chapter is worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY of this price! ***heart gushing still***",

                "reviewText": "Rachel Smythe\u2019s \u201cLore Olympus\u201d retells the Greek myths, though with a modern twist. Cars, phones, and other modern technology exists in the gods\u2019 realms, but they still face all the usual foibles as a result of their nature that they might try to escape even as the fates bind them. Smythe primarily focuses on Hades and Persephone, but she also features Zeus and Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite and her son Eros, Eros\u2019 love for the mortal woman Psyche, and more. She draws out the essences of their stories and relationships, demonstrating the universality of these myths all these thousands of years after their creation. In addition to her writing, Smythe illustrates the comics, which originally appeared on WEBTOON. She creates vibrant, individual character designs in a style that suggests motion even on a printed page, recalling such popular animation designs as in the work of Rebecca Sugar and Dana Terrace. Beyond the linework, Smythe makes beautiful use of color, splashing bold hues and carefully watercoloring individual characters, using greyscale for dramatic effect or colorless line drawings for the same. Just as Ancient Greece had complex gender relationships, the use of bi-lighting suggests the possibility for greater complexity in future installments. This hardcover collection contains episodes 1-25 of \u201cLore Olympus\u201d and is great for fans and newcomers to enjoy the comics offline.",

                "reviewText": "My favorite graphic novel and I love that it is available in paperback. Webtoons is great and how I discovered it of course but I get nauseous binge-reading this by scrolling on the Webtoons app so paperback is wonderful. As with any change in media, there are some slight formatting differences between Webtoons and a print version, but it doesn\u2019t bother me and, like I said, I prefer print. Also, length-wise, do keep in mind that LO\u2019s episodes are LONG so not very many of them fit into each paperback volume\u2014note in the description which episodes are covered in each print volume just to set your expectations. Overall, highly recommend for all ye nerdfolk. I find it a very enjoyable distraction from living with chronic pain and it sent me down a major track of going back and deep diving into reading all the Greek mythology (\u201cThe Greek Myths\u201d by Robert Graves was my volume of choice) and classics (The Odyssey + Illiad) and even the later Roman Aeneid. My only real complaint with the series is the lack of queerness. The ancient Greeks and their gods were queer A!F! but in this series so far (*spoilers*) there is only one queer couple. I wish there were a lot more queer representation, like, we even meet Zeus\u2019s mortal fling Semele but no Ganymede??! The lack of queerness is really incongruent with Greek mythology and feels a bit erasure-y, but oh well. Maybe more will be added in later installments. Overall I still highly enjoy it and do recommend it.",

Estou relendo a hist\u00f3ria e marcando algumas partes com post-it.As folhas s\u00e3o aquelas bem tradicionais de hist\u00f3rias em quadrinhos/Graphic novel/Novela gr\u00e1fica. Aquelas folhas mais durinhas meio plastificadas, mais ou menos como alguns pap\u00e9is de foto (quem l\u00ea hist\u00f3rias nesse formato vai entender).Por enquanto s\u00f3 temos na vers\u00e3o em ingl\u00eas, mas caso venha a ser traduzido comprarei tamb\u00e9m.Ah, eu olhei o pre\u00e7o e foi convertido a nossa moeda mesmo, n\u00e3o foi cobrado a mais como vemos em alguns casos e eu amei isso tamb\u00e9m. Obrigada por essa hist\u00f3ria apaixonante. Uma das minha melhores compras foi esse livro.Se voc\u00ea pensa em comprar mas n\u00e3o sabe se vai gostar, \u00e9 s\u00f3 procurar no WEBTOON e ler por l\u00e1 mesmo, se voc\u00ea gostar, aproveita e leva. Eu acho que vale super a pena.",
