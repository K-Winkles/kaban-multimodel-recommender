                "reviewText": "If you have ever been to the Lunar New Year Festivals, you have probably seen the lion dancers. What I didn\u2019t know, until reading this graphic novel was that each country has its own interpretation of how the lion dances, and even what it looks like.Valentina decides she wants to learn lion dancing. Valentina is trying to decide if she should give up on love. Valentina has been told by her grandmother that generations of her family have been unlucky in love, and she should just face the facts.Valentina\u2019s best friend loves falling in love. She just hates it when love is not so fresh anymore, and you have to work at the relationship part. To her, it is a party all the time, and she encourages Valentina to just fall in love anyway, and then move on.And it doesn\u2019t help that the spirit of St. Valentine is haunting her and encouraging to just give up on love, and not to bother with having feelings at all.There were so many good personalities and moments in this book. I love how blunt the grandmother is. I love how the dragon dancers are drawn, along with the sounds of the drums. I love how Bernice just accepts whatever it is that is going on with her best friend. And I love the quiet moments, such as when Val is looking at the stars Jae.It is probably best to go into this story without knowing too much, as there is so much going on, and being revealed, throughout the story.Suffice it to say, I am a little biased because I love everything Gene Luen Yang writes. He has just such a great way of telling his stories, whether they are contemporary, or tales of Superman, or historical fiction in the time of the Boxer Rebellion.I highly recommend you go out and get your hands on this. Although it is a romance, it isn\u2019t really one of those typical YA ones.",

                "reviewText": "I loved that LUNAR NEW YEAR LOVE STORY came out close to Valentine's Day and Lunar New Year. We don't get a lot of Asian American stories that center around this holiday. LUNAR NEW YEAR LOVE STORY is the new graphic novel that is a coming-of-age story centered on a Vietnamese American teenager Valentina Tran who since childhood is obsessed with Valentine's Day. But when she finds out the true story behind her father and mother, she's ready to give up on love and she's confident when it comes to love, her family is cursed. But things seem to change when she gets involved in lion dancing for the Lunar New Year celebration.LUNAR NEW YEAR LOVE STORY explores teen girlhood and love, both romantic and familiar but also weaves in teen angst and all the complexities that come with it. But it does a good job with also not demonizing anyone because relationship and love is hard! And while it does go into some dark places, the author and illustrators choose hope at the end. LeUyen Pham's illustrations and tones of the visuals were absolutely gorgeous, especially the imagery of the lion dances! Overall, it's super sweet an easy read.The big con though - While I always appreciate the inclusion of Vietnamese language and diacritics, it was very clear the book's team didn't have a Vietnamese language proofreader. When Vietnamese dialogue was used, often it was unnatural and rigid. There were also several spelling/diacritical mark errors in the Vietnamese (both in the dialogue and art) - For instance, \"T\u1ebft\" (Vietnamese name for the Lunar New Year) was frequently spelled \"T\u00eat\" whenever it was used. How the grandma's \"broken\" English was written was also a bit jarring and cringey and didn't feel like what a Vietnamese grandmother (whose second language was English) would speak.",
