                "reviewText": "This historical romance revolves around Anna and Max, a sheltered lady seeking a fourth year for a marriage match and Max, a widower returning after a five year hiatus from England, and their complicated romance. The drama to the story was caused by Anna\u2019s brother who belittled Anna every day, and their aunt, a manipulative, vile person solely working for her own personal goals. Teamed together, Anna had to endure a horrible life. The author did a great job in clearly defining how despicable these two characters were to Anna, allowing the reader to truly feel empathy for her. I enjoyed the author\u2019s creative ways she incorporated a ruse, and manipulative ploys to cause havoc for the couple keeping the reader engaged, and interested in the couple\u2019s outcome. The final chapters of the story reinforces the belief that justice will always prevail, as will love. Great story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed the clean romance. The only major flaw I remember was the age of the heroine was stated as 20 and 18, with 4 seasons behind her the 18 was very unrealistic. Even the twenty meant that she came out at 16. The heroine was very much downtrodden by her aunt and brother. The widow hero at age 32 feels old mostly due to his grief and life experiences. They meet in a garden and there is an attraction, but the hero feels he can only help her find happiness with another man. There is a lot of manipulation happening, but finally the brother comes around and helps his sister. I liked that the heroine was a healer and an artist. It was too bad that she had to hide those skills. The extended epilogue wasn\u2019t attached to the book, which I don\u2019t like. The author really made you feel for the heroine and wanting to shake some sense into the hero.",

He offers Anna a plan so that she can get away from her family and him to have someone to be with. Together they can find happiness and love. Lots of work for them to get there.

Then down sides are few, mainly too much bile in the throat too often and a missed edit concerning the main character\u2019s age. I am not fond of extended epilogues as I feel they should be included in the book and not used as a means of getting you to be part of the author\u2019s community. However I realise this is used by many authors. So I liked the additional final chapter although I felt the aunt\u2019s complete change of personae a little too sudden to be believable.

                "reviewText": "This book is quite different from the usual run of the mill Regency Romance. The Wallflower, Lady Anna Stuart, in downtrodden by he brother & Aunt, but her exterior facade doesn't match her well developed sense of her self & her skills. She meets & falls for Max Montagu, Duke of Manchester & widower of 5 years at a Ball where he returns to dip his toe into the Marriage Mart, needing to move on with his life. He doesn't expect to find love again, being 12 years older than Lady Anna, he proposes a fake courtship to help her find a husband.....Anna wants it to be him! It was nice to read Anna stand up for herself & her passions, including speaking forthrightly that she wants Max to be her spouse, not who her aunt, brother or Max try to convince her is best.",
