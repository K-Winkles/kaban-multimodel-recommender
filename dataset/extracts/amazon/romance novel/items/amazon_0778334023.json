Then Emily\u2019s friend Faith comes to visit her in Washington\u2014and instead finds Charles, a complete stranger and a curmudgeon, to boot. His brother, Ray, meanwhile, shows up at Charles\u2019s place, only to discover Emily living there. But through all the mix-ups and misunderstandings, among the chaos and confusion, romance begins to emerge\u2026Christmas Letters Katherine O\u2019Connor spends her days at a cozy caf\u00e9 writing Christmas letters for other people. She\u2019s good at making their everyday lives sound more interesting. But for renowned child psychologist Dr. Wynn Jeffries, who also frequents the caf\u00e9, Christmas means deception. Katherine argues with Wynn about his theories while he argues that her letters are nothing but lies. They disagree about practically everything\u2014but as the days move closer to Christmas, Katherine and Wynn may find that love means accepting your differences while discovering what you share.",
