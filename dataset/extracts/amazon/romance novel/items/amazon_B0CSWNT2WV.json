                "reviewText": "This is a murder mystery that begins with a courtship, but then twists to another. Ms Haverton\u2019s brilliant talents prove themselves in her dramatic mysteries as it does in this story. A few villains, tangled plot, vindictive revenge tactics, and secrets to reveal, all surrounded by a budding romance as the couple focuses on investigating the murders. The plot is definitely engaging, great characters and well-crafted twists and turns. The author created believable characters with emotional upheavals that easily brought out my empathetic side. Marina\u2019s living arrangements was incredibly sad, and I was anxious for her finding her HEA. I definitely would have liked to give this book a 5-star review but the editing issues played a role in my final rating. Editing issues included typos, indecision on using a lower or uppercase for \u201cuncle\u201d, and misspelling of the character, Josiah. I remain a huge Patricia Haverton fan, and highly recommend this book. No so much her editor. lol I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Anytime two people who are attracted to each other pretend to be courting, engaged or married, invariably they end up falling in love. Although this time, it is a dangerous game when hunting for a killer, because if he killed what is to stop him from doing the same thing again? Falling in love while hunting for killer sets this to be an emotional story. The funny part of this story is that Griffin starts out courting the wrong girl.",

                "reviewText": "You can read the book summary so I will forgo that in my review.This book was clean and sweet with no cliff hangers. I enjoyed that and will continue to support those kinds of books. However, the writing was very basic. Some of the characters were flat and needed a little more development. And yet, I kept reading. Some of the dialogue between the hero and heroine was stilted and unrealistically dramatic; and yet, I kept reading.What kept me reading? Well, I wanted to find out how they were going to catch the villain. That part of the plot was solid, but even there I wanted to see more red herrings or nuggets of \u201cgotcha now\u201d when they actually didn\u2019t. The reader finally get\u2019s a hint towards the end of the book but it would have been nice to see things throughout.Of course I love a good love story and an independent woman, but I think they fell in love a little too quickly. All in all, I would recommend this book if you wanted a clean romance novel with no twists and turns.",

By joining forces they manage to secure their own safety and find a reliable partner to spend the rest of their life with - a wonderful combination of suspense and romance.",

It reminded me of a farcical theater piece, definitely not of a suspenseful love story. The story felt contrived from the start, the plot and the behaviour of the characters unnatural and illogical. Their detective work seems amateurish, their actions are rather daft. There are better books by this author.Marina is determined to find a husband by the end of the season so that she can leave her vicious uncle.When she catches Griffin, her cousin's suitor, sneaking around the house, he tells her that he believes her uncle to be his father's murderer. She agrees to help him with his enquiries and enters into a fake relationship with him, knowing full well that she is putting herself in danger and that she incurs the wrath of her whole family But she also suspects that her uncle could also be responsible for her father's death...",
