                "reviewText": "i'm not sure why it took me so long to read this. While there's things i dislike (the love triangle especially), i enjoyed it so much overall. It's one of those stories where the romance is integral, but doesn't take center stage and becomes the only thing the characters care about.From the moment Liwei enters the page, i liked him a lot. It's refreshing to find characters that just get along and eventually fall in love, but having their own dreams/goals separate from their love interest. I was suspicious of the second love interest from the start, but somewhere along the line forgot why i was suspicious. But the plot twist did somehow make it a complex subplot that i didn't mind so much.I still wanted Xingyin to end up with Liwei, and i hate the emperor and empress. At the same time, i'm a little sad for Fengmei because she was a sweet character who was meant to fulfil a role and make the best of her situation.Also liked that there was genuine friendships between female characters, which is becoming more rare in fantasy and romance and romantasies especially.I got a little frustrated at the start with the info-dump-ish-ness (totally a word, probably). But i understand why it kind of has to happen, familiarizing a broader audience with the source material. And the prose from Xingyin's perspective gives a much needed sentimental/gentle tone in stark contrast to a lot of the sass and bitterness of many FMCs in the genre -- something i really enjoyed when reading! The prose really did feel fresh among its peers.I actually didn't know this was a debut novel, because it reads like the author had 2 (maybe 3) books under her belt.",

                "reviewText": "Content warnings: girl-on-girl hateRep: secret identities, Chinese mythology, friends-ish to lovers, lovers to enemies, love triangle, forbidden love, Mother/Daughter love/bondThoughtsNeutral thoughts:The writing: In the very beginning of the book, the writing starts off very simple & I didn\u2019t mind that cause I think that it helps represent how Xingyin is in the very beginning of the story. And while it still stays pretty simple, I still thought that it was good & just needed some work with the pacing. But because this is a debut, I am more forgiving when it comes to pacing or more simpler writing.Xingyin: I liked her overall. I though that she was VERY naive in the beginning, and still through the events of the book, but I think that reflects the pureness of her ideals and her unwavering loyalty and her morals. She was just trying her best in order to set her mother free & finding herself and herself worth in the process & I could admire that about her.This honestly is a SOLID debut & I highly recommend! I am not entirely sure where the second book in this duology is going to cover, but I am excited nonetheless!Pros:I really liked the lore in this one and how the Gods and Goddess were actual figures in this world, not just beings that were written about in ancient texts and stories that are told in the present timeline. How the Moon Goddess did things & how they were represented in our mortal world.Some of the lines in this were absolutely beautiful. Like I literally had to stop and take the lines in & just are at them for a second.The chapters in this were short & I honestly was flying thru this book like no other. One second I was on page 56, and the next things I knew I was on page 210 without even realizing it. So while the pacing was a little off in some instances, I was still flying thru the pages.I also liked seeing the Mother/Daughter bond in this. I also have a strong relationship with my mom & it was really nice seeing the love that these two had for each other & seeing all of the sacrifices and actions that they did for one another because of the love that they had.Gripes:As I sit here and write this review I can\u2019t think of any PRESSING issues (aside from the pacing) & the only thing I wasn\u2019t a fan of for the most part was the love triangle that bloomed in this. And while it wasn't THAT bad, it is still a triangle nonetheless & I am NOT a fan of them.The romance(s):There is a love triangle in this \ud83d\ude48 I know for this is a \u201cbuzz word\u201d but for me it is not one at all. And while there is an inkling who Xingyin will be with at the very end of this duology based off what happened at the end of the book, I can see there being a \u201cwill they won\u2019t they\u201d and Xingyin going between Liwei and a certain General \ud83d\ude09(if you wanna know his name, by all means look at the spoiler (view spoiler)) in the next book. And while that ANNOYS me, I am hopeful for my boy Liwei \ud83d\ude2dXingyin & Liwei: I REALLY liked them. Could they be described as insta-lovey? Perhaps. But I still liked them. First and foremost they saw themselves as friends, as two people who felt like they were lacking in themselves and the positions/roles that were forced into & just wanted a friend that they could lean on. And that is what I liked about them. It was not an instant physical attraction that they had for one another, it was an emotional bond that they formed first before looks came in to the equation. But lemme tell you, this gets angsty real fast \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude48 There is some heartache and some circumstances that separate these two from one another, but they may or may not reform their relationship at the end of the book\u2026 AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I BETTER SEE A MARRIAGE CEREMONY AT THE END OF BOOK 2For those who don\u2019t know, Liwei is the Prince of the Celestial Kingdom. I REALLY liked him \ud83d\ude39 HE WAS SUCH A CINNAMON ROLL \ud83e\udd7a While he did kind of get on my nerves on some things, he was also just trying to do his best & having to make choices that he didn\u2019t want to make, but he had to. But he thankfully pull his head out of his butt towards the end of the story & I was swooning all over again.Xingyin & the other guy \ud83d\ude39: While I understood the blooming of their friendship/relationship, (I even kind of rooted for them at one point) I just do not support them. (When you read the book you\u2019ll know why). But I can totally see people falling in love with him and their relationship.",

                "reviewText": "Daughter of the Moon Goddess is the debut novel from Sue Lynn Tan and all I can say is WOW. This book was stunning and is one of my favorite books I\u2019ve ever read. From the start, we are captivated by the story and characters and Tan takes you on an amazing journey over the next 500 pages.To begin, the characters are fascinating. I listened to it on audiobook which was really helpful for the pronunciation of names for me, as the story is based of Chinese mythology. Xingyin is the daughter of the Moon Goddess Chang'e, and is such a great FMC. She goes through a coming of age story in this book, starting with leaving her home and her mother and following her on an epic journey over different lands and through many adventures. I loved how we saw her grow and change and while this is a YA novel, I never felt like she was overly young or immature. There are a few times that her internal monologue gets repetitive, which is why I\u2019m taking away a partial star, but otherwise I loved the writing of the character. There is a love triangle (square?) between her and two male characters, but I thought it was done well and was actually a very mature handling of it.The plot and imagery within this book was phenomenal. This is the second series I\u2019ve read this year that is Chinese mythology inspired and both were given such rich description, it makes me want to travel there! The book is rather long, at just over 500 pages, but the pacing is done really well and the plot is complex and developed without ever dragging or becoming confusing. It moves through the different events in a well thought out manner and kept me intrigued the entire time! There is action and some romance (it is YA so this is light romance), and a great story of friendship.",

                "reviewText": "Really enjoyed this book, which I'm glad about, because not only have I been on a romantasy kick recently but I also brought the special edition companion to the duet from Fairyloot due to the cover being pretty lool. And so, I wanted to see if I actually liked the books before trying to source the special editions for this book and the second book.This plot seemed to be focused around a lot of old Chinese myths and legends - I saw somewhere that it was a reimagined telling? - but I liked how it dipped into the Chinese culture and stories as it reminded me of Mulan and another show I used to watch called W.I.T.C.H. which also had a storyline about 'The Four Dragons.'I really liked the backstory for this. The world building was great, and although this was a very long book, at no point did I get bored. I think fantasy books do have more scope to develop their world building and can get away with being longer, but I still like when it doesn't feel too lengthy, instead drawing me in and making the world more imaginable.Whilst I do feel like some of the fighting scenes felt a little rushed and there could've been more detail in the action, I didn't really mind it too much because all the other scenes were very detailed. Likewise, this had less romance than I'm used to, but it ran as a nice secondary plot and I liked that the focus wasn't solely about that. Although, the love triangle situation did have me going back and forth as to who I was rooting for and the decisions that were made!The FMC had a good story arc too. We initially see her as being talented but quite sheltered and unaware of her true strengths. We gradually get to witness her transformation into becoming more open in certain aspects and branching out without becoming overly cocky.Was very much looking forward to the second part of this duet as imo, this technically could've worked as a standalone with the way it ended. However, I would like to know more about certain issues that occurred and I'm glad it is a duet as it makes it more realistic that other issues would crop up later down the line, rather than just having a bittersweet ending and no further details.",
