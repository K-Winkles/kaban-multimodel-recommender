            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cFunny You Should Ask is the kind of fascinating, intimate character study that feels like reading about real people. A breezy, addictive romance\u2014I couldn\u2019t put it down!\u201d\u2014Rachel Lynn Solomon, author of The Ex Talk\u201cFunny You Should Ask is a smart, sensitive story full of love and longing\u2014not to mention a totally swoonworthy hero. It\u2019s also a page-turning peek into the celebrity machine. Framed by one infamous weekend and its fallout, the book goes beyond the glossy surface to thoughtfully tackle questions of perception versus reality, and which can hurt more: the limitations other people place on us, or the ones we place on ourselves.\u201d\u2014Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, bestselling authors of The Royal We and The Heir Affair\u201cElissa Sussman\u2019s adult debut promises a glamorous celeb romp, but offers a double-whammy with thoughtful, emotional depth. As the narrative jumps back and forth in time, the truth of what happened between Gabe and Chani unfolds and a romance blooms\u2014cautious, sweet, and sizzling with tension. . . . A beautiful, fun, heartfelt love story that I couldn\u2019t put down.\u201d\u2014Maurene Goo, author of Somewhere Only We Know\u201cSussman makes her adult fiction debut with a smart and sexy tale of second-chance love. The story thoroughly satisfies on a romantic level and packs an emotional punch with genuine characters.\u201d\u2014Library Journal (starred review)\u201cAlternating between past and present, YA writer Sussman\u2019s first novel for adults slowly lays out the events of her characters\u2019 first meeting and how much has changed in the decade since. The result is a sexy, sometimes emotionally fraught tale that is both funny and romantic and that will appeal to fans of Sophie Kinsella.\u201d\u2014Booklist\u201cYoung adult author Elissa Sussman may be poised for a breakout hit with her first novel for adults, Funny You Should Ask. . . . Sussman\u2019s smart writing and firm control over the narrative steadily lead you on to the next page, and the next page, and the page after that.\u201d\u2014BookPage\u201cSussman\u2019s thoughtful adult debut explores the connection forged between an insecure Los Angeles writer and a charming movie star. A decade after Chani Horowitz\u2019s profile of Gabe Parker went viral, the two are reunited for another interview. . . . Sussman\u2019s musings about fame, success, and the bonds between people elevate this fun and charming narrative. This has ALL THE MAKINGS OF A HIT.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly About the Author Elissa Sussman received her BA from Sarah Lawrence College and her MFA from Pacific University.She is the author of three young adult novels, and Funny You Should Ask is her debut adult novel. Sussman lives in her hometown of Los Angeles with her husband and their two dogs, Basil and Mozzarella. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter 1I arrived early and damp. The blue cotton blouse that had looked professional and flattering in my apartment mirror was now stuck to my armpits in dark, wet half-moons. Lifting my arms, I blasted the AC in my car, hoping both to dry my shirt and shock the nervousness out of my system.I\u2019d interviewed celebrities before.I\u2019d even interviewed supernaturally beautiful celebrities before.This was different.Gabe Parker wasn\u2019t just any celebrity. He was my number one, heart-fluttering, palm-sweating, thigh-clenching celebrity crush. I\u2019d entertained multiple extensive, detailed fantasies about him. I\u2019d done numerous searches for paparazzi pictures of him. Until this morning, a shirtless photo of him had been the lock screen of my phone.I had zero chill when it came to Gabe Parker.If Jeremy and I were still dating, there\u2019d be a major possibility he would have tried to veto this interview. He knew how I felt about Gabe. When he\u2019d insisted on us declaring our \u201cfree pass\u201d celebrities, I\u2019d chosen Gabe. Jeremy had pouted.It was ridiculous, of course.Gabe would probably be charming and kind and amiable. It wouldn\u2019t be because he liked me, or thought I was interesting, or because we had any sort of deep emotional connection. It would be because it was his job to charm me. And it was my job to be charmed. His management had been very, very clear about the kind of profile they were expecting me to turn in. What they wanted in exchange for the access Broad Sheets was getting to Gabe before he started shooting.They wanted a story that would counter the bad press his casting had caused. They wanted a story that would convince the naysayers that he was the best choice for Bond. They wanted me to sell him to America. To the world. I wanted a story that would keep getting me work.I blogged and sent short stories to literary magazines like I was tossing rocks into the ocean.I\u2019d only gotten one published, and then, just when I was considering that maybe I should give up trying to be a writer, I\u2019d gotten the gig at Broad Sheets. I\u2019d been recommended by a former professor who had once called my writing \u201cmainstream\u201d\u2014as much of an insult as one could get in an esteemed MFA program but apparently exactly what Broad Sheets was looking for. Jeremy called the stuff I was doing \u201cpuff pieces,\u201d but we\u2019d still celebrated when I got the job\u2014spending a good chunk of my first paycheck on bottomless fries and happy hour beers.The editors at Broad Sheets seemed to like my writing\u2014at least, they kept giving me work\u2014and every month I could pay my bills with the money I made off my writing felt like an accomplishment.I knew that this interview was an opportunity to show that I could take on more high-profile, better-paying articles. It needed to go well. Even though I\u2019d just checked it five minutes ago, I scanned my bag again to make sure that I had a pen, my notebook with the questions I\u2019d written out last night, and my tape recorder, which had a new set of batteries. I was as prepared as I was going to be.My armpits were now cold and wet. I realized, with horror, that I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure I\u2019d put deodorant on. I gave myself a sniff, but couldn\u2019t tell.It was too late now.I glanced in the rearview mirror one last time, grateful that at least my bangs had chosen to be obedient.Gabe was staying in a rental house in Laurel Canyon. I\u2019d expected something grand, with a massive gate and intense security system, but I\u2019d been sent to a modest bungalow set back from the street with nothing more than an unlocked, waist-high gate to keep people out.But even though it was small, I knew the place had to cost at least four times more than the apartment I shared with one stranger and one half-friend.I could feel my heart ricocheting up and down my throat as I walked through the gate and down the pathway. A heart attack or a panic attack or some other sort of attack seemed extremely likely.\u201cHe\u2019s just a person. He\u2019s just a person,\u201d I said to myself. I lifted my hand, but before I could even knock, the door swung open and there he was.Gabe. Parker. I\u2019d done enough interviews like this to know firsthand the difference a camera and a crew could make in someone\u2019s appearance. Actors were usually shorter than they appeared, their heads often bigger. Round cheeks could make someone look chubbier than they were, just as chiseled features could come off as gaunt in real life.A part of me had been praying that Gabe Parker\u2019s good looks were mostly manufactured.I was swiftly and immediately proven wrong. He. Was. Glorious.Tall, knee-bucklingly handsome, and backlit by the best sunlight California could muster on a brisk winter day. His dark brown hair was mussed, a wavy lock flopped onto his forehead in a way that looked both boyish and rugged. He had a dimple in his left cheek\u2014which I already knew about, but it was on full display as he greeted me with a smile that made my heart stop so abruptly that I put a hand to my chest. He was so beautiful.I was so f***ed.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d he said.As if he had been waiting for me. The truth was that I had been waiting for him. Literally. This interview had been scheduled and rescheduled several times already. But none of that mattered now.I felt fluttery. All over.I didn\u2019t like it.It was deeply unprofessional and a complete clich\u00e9. The world already assumed that all female reporters slept with\u2014or were trying to sleep with\u2014their subjects. I was here to do my job, not get all hot and bothered over a sexy celebrity. It was enough to keep those tingly feelings at bay.Gabe was still blasting me with that full-force grin. It was so powerful that it took me at least ten seconds to realize he was holding a puppy in his arms. And I loved dogs.\u201cCan you take her for a moment?\u201d he asked.I was apparently incapable of speech so I just nodded and held out my arms. His fingers brushed mine as the wiggling, furry bundle was passed over. My heart stopped again, and the tingly feelings returned.Dammit.At this rate, if he shook my hand, I was likely to pass out at his feet. After giving me the dog, he turned and headed back into the house. The puppy shifted in my arms, craning her head so she could take a swipe at my chin with her soft, pink puppy tongue. I inhaled deeply, breathing in her puppy breath. Pure. Unfiltered. Good.It stabilized me. \u201cCome on in!\u201d Gabe said from inside the house.I followed his voice, taking in the beautiful rental with its wood-paneled walls and warm, cabin-like feel. The back of the house was open\u2014glass sliding doors pushed to the side\u2014and I could see a big, grassy lawn with a pool and hot tub. The rental itself had maybe two bedrooms, but the property was spacious. It was exactly the kind of Laurel Canyon home where you could easily imagine the Mamas and the Papas or Fleetwood Mac doing drugs, having sex, and making music during the seventies.I walked into the kitchen and found Gabe on his hands and knees. Without a shirt on.\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized, using his cotton T-shirt to wipe the floor. \u201cI still have no idea where any of the rags are, and we\u2019ve been having a hard time with house-training.\u201d He looked up at me, and I realized I was holding the puppy in front of me like a shield. Standing, Gabe looked down at the pee-stained shirt in his hand and winced before tossing it in the trash. Then he came toward me.\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said to the dog. \u201cI still love you.\u201d\u201cUnngh,\u201d I said.He took her from me, cuddling her against his bare chest. It was smooth and sleek\u2014all those muscles perfectly defined\u2014exactly how it looked on the big screen. Well. Not exactly. He was actually a little thinner than I had expected. Not that I minded.He still looked good. Beyond good.I laced my fingers behind my back to keep from reaching out and touching, but my imagination did not hesitate in envisioning how his skin might feel beneath my palms. Because if I was going to touch\u2014even if it was just a fantasy\u2014I was going to be putting my whole hands on him. Maybe my mouth too.If I had the time, there was a long list of my body parts interested in touching his body parts.It was completely inappropriate, but it was just in my head. What harm could there be in that?\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Gabe apologized again.We both stood there for a moment. He made no motion to indicate he was going to put a shirt on, and I wasn\u2019t going to prompt him to do so. As far as I was concerned, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ogle one of the hottest up-and-coming stars of our time and I was going to ogle my brains out. Silently. Covertly.I knew I was justifying my unprofessional thoughts, but the truth was, I wasn\u2019t sure I could help it. He was just so handsome and my pulse was racing like I was being chased. Read more"

                "reviewText": "As a general rule, I HATE second chance romances... but I LOVED this. I was hesitant to pick this up because of the couple's complicated past, but that all faded into the background as I became immersed in this truly unique love story. Told in flashbacks, present day, and snippets of articles that fill in the gaps, we see how these characters have changed and grown over the last ten years. We see all of the ways they messed things up in the past, as well as all of the ways they are PERFECT for each other in the present. If you're someone who enjoys puzzling out a mysterious hero, then you're going to love this one - piecing together all of the little breadcrumbs that show the depth of his feelings and just how much he thought of her in their time apart. These two fell hard and fast over the course of a single weekend, and they've had ten years apart to let those feelings simmer, fester, or grow. There's really no way to tell until the whole story is told. And one of the best things - beyond the obvious zap of chemistry - is that the story is told in such a way that I was completely and utterly invested in seeing how things played out in the past AND the present.The story follows Chani, a journalist who couldn't have predicted the countless ways that one interview would change her life. As a 26-year-old, she was starstruck and smitten to meet sexy actor Gabe. Tasked with writing an article that would make Gabe look good, Chani was surprised to discover that they seemed to have a connection that had nothing to do with the article she was writing. And the time they spent together that weekend seemed to confirm that... until it didn't. Ten years later, Chani would like to believe that she's both older and wiser. That article changed the trajectory of her career, and the whispers about that weekend have not quieted in the years since. So when Chani is asked to interview Gabe again - now a star who has lost his shine after a divorce and a few trips to rehab - she's hoping to get some closure and move past it once and for all. But spending time together again makes those old feelings come rushing back, and it's possible that finally getting everything out in the open will change everything.I've gotta give it to Sussman - she managed to make this relationship feel rich and deep, despite the fact that Chani and Gabe have only spent a handful of days together. They had that first potential-filled weekend that went horribly wrong, then only brief interactions in the years since. So it's amazing how much history they have, and how much the intimacy grows between them. The story seems to be a bit polarizing to readers, and I can see how that element wouldn't work for some - but it definitely did for me. There are plenty of lighthearted moments, splashes of angst, longing, and a TON of unfulfilled potential. As much as I wanted to shake them over the miscommunication, it was also easy to see that the Chani and Gabe of the past wouldn't have worked out. They needed that time apart, and Gabe needed to get sober. I was even (shockingly) okay with the fact that they both married and divorced other people during those years as well - hurt people hurt people, and returning to safer relationships made sense to me. Besides, they'd only spent a matter of hours together, and neither one was entirely sure of the other's motivations. Once they face the truth of their feelings, the entire dynamic shifts. It's a complex story that drew me in more and more as it progressed, until I was incredibly engrossed. I loved it.Audio note: The audio is great! The story is told exclusively from Chani's point of view, so it's a single narrator, but she does an excellent job. Her performance brought Chani to life, and it was also easy to differentiate between the characters. The runtime (under 8 hours) was perfect for bingeing in one sitting, which is great because that's exactly what I wanted to do. And the tone of the book was ideal for the audio format, especially given the narrator's strong performance. It's an achingly slow burn with just a little spice, so the book is also a good pick for a workday listen - you'd even be able to fit the whole story into a day at the office. While this would be a great read in any format, the audio enhances it even further.",

                "reviewText": "When we first meet our journalist, Chani, she is a little ball of anger and embarrassment, most of which is directed at Gabe Parker, irrationally hot former movie star. One fateful interview a decade ago led to a whirlwind weekend between them, but things didn't end the way either of them (or the rest of us) hoped.Rather than flat up front, their story is told through a series of flashbacks, articles, and snapshots from the present.While I can definitively say I enjoyed reading Funny You Should Ask, I also found myself regularly rolling my eyes at Chani. I found her immature and incapable of recognizing her own faults, so much so that *SPOILER* Gabe literally calls her on it shortly before the book ends. I think the structure of their story is thoughtful, and their characterizations include a lot of wit and charm. I just also want to hold Chani by the shoulders and very sternly remind her that she is nearing 40.",

                "reviewText": "This book was cute and I liked the plot structure, how it shifted between time lines with articles peppered in between. But the actual storyline is like a Hallmark or Lifetime movie. Very predictable. There isn\u2019t anything you couldn\u2019t see coming which makes the jump between time lines a bit boring when you have it all figured out. I struggled to finish the last 50 pages just because I felt I knew how it would end, and I was right. Even the phone call gabe has with chani that\u2019s hinted at in the novel as being something important just ends up being him drunk dialing her randomly one night. There is a lot of foreshadowing in this book that comes to nothing. It\u2019s kind of what isn\u2019t great about these publishers having so much creative control. Authors tend to play it safe and then you wind up with a big bore of a book. This wasn\u2019t a total bore though and if you\u2019re into romcoms you\u2019ll probably like it. It\u2019s just been done a lot and really isn\u2019t anything fresh or progressive.",

Chani has a serious case of impostor syndrome as a writer. They both had issues that made them not ready for each other. Learning to deal with their esteem and gaining confidence was part of their journey to love.I enjoyed the friends who were the wind beneath their wings. I hate that they both were so hampered by the opinions of the public. The dangers of basing our worth on the whims of others. It was a really cute story with a cute ending.",

Gabe is so authentic, clever, humble, funny and sexy. Chani is the perfect protagonist. She\u2019s a gift that keeps on giving. Her name alone is so epic. Look, I could spend my whole day talking about how much I adored this book but it still wouldn\u2019t be enough praise. You MUST purchase this book now.
