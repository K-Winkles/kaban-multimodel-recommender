                "reviewText": "This review will be hard for me because I always have a Spoiler Alert on my review. That being said, because this is an ARC review, I will tone myself down.This book is amazing. It has a great storyline that when you get to the end of a chapter, you can\u2019t help yourself, you binge the next chapter. (And the next, and so on\u2026) But to go with the great storyline are the knockout punch the characters do. Lena and Jackson with the constant push pull of their love/hate relationship. With them constantly pushing them along it seems are Tyson and Maeve, a love/love relationship. Tyson is a member of Jackson\u2019s band.Jackson has experienced so much hurt in his past that it is all encompassing his life, but most particularly his relationships. The more love that happens for people he knows, the more it scares him. I do think that Jackson\u2019s PR firm is good because it got him in the classroom. But I think at times they can be almost as pushy as fans just in a different way. One thing you might expect from other Josie Hart books but this one you don\u2019t expect it really is the amount of erotica flowing throughout the story.Am I sharing the ending, you have to read the book. It is Josie Hart perfect but this one is sooo different because of the extreme hate for love \u2013 Jackson/ and the hatred Lena feels for Jackson.It is an absolute MUST READ!10/10++",

                "reviewText": "Meet 25yr old Jackson Whiss, one of the brothers from the Off Limits Baby Daddies series. Remember Eli and Luke? Well, this time it's the bad boy rockstar's turn for a possible romance. Don't worry this can be read as a standalone. Jackson is a party guy. He flirts, he's blunt, and the guy is against relationships. Nope! Not for him.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffbLove isn't real. In his eyes, women are unreliable, they only want money, and break mens' hearts in the process. Sheesh. Really dude? Men can play that game too. Not every woman will do that, Jackson. Obviously, he has issues from his mother and her abandonment of the family years back. His Dad didn't help matters either. Hence the lasting impression. And yeah, after awhile, Jackson got annoying with his outlook. I understand it but he needed to start the healing process quick. He needed to grow up too. To me, he wasn't the most mature guy. And then he meets a woman at a meet and greet after one of his concerts who changes things. She didn't go gaga over him like other fans. Other women. Imagine that.\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06Lena Harris is 23, an elementary music teacher and she isn't impressed with Jackson at all. His ego, his rudeness rubbed her the wrong way. As it should. He's a jerk. But Lena is there with her BFF Maeve who hooked up then fell in love with Tyson, the guitarist of the band. I like them!!! They were such a cute romantic couple. Anyway. The attraction is there between our main couple. Jackson and Lena are drawn to each other. And yes, they do get involved. It's spicy.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 But since Jackson is a hot mess in the media, (the party lifestyle, having altercations, an ex talking trash about him) his personal image has to be cleaned up. Which leads to singing at Lena's school with the kids and then having a fake relationship and engagement with her. This story has tons of angst, high drama, and deep questions of what their connection truly means. Is it real? Does he feel the same way like Lena? Does Jackson want more despite the rules he has about relationships and women? Will this couple get their HEA despite the rocky twists of a fake relationship spilling into becoming more? Bring on the realness.Extra notes: I think the last half of the book was much better than the first half. It seem to flow more easily. But I wanted Jackson to start having the heart feels before the last few chapters. To get more excited for it and Lena. Instead of the yeah okay, I do love her realization. Does that make sense? I mean Lena gave her all to this man. What he wanted, she did. No hesitation. I wanted her to make Jackson work and earn to have her as his special woman. Even when she confessed her true feelings of loving him and shared her pregnancy news, Jack just stood there. Surprise! You're scared. But so is she. Talk. Support. Don't run. It's like every time he wanted something from her, for his image etc, they were intimate first then he would tell her about what the PR people needed. That's not cool. And dude don't tell your bandmates you got involved with the lady.\ud83d\ude4a He used another word I can't use here. Think of the word duck. Quack. Quack.\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd23 I still liked it and would definitely recommend. I just noticed these little things. And look at the great book cover. He's a bad boy alright.\ud83d\ude18 Happy reading.\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb6\ud83e\udd29Thank you for an early read via Booksprout. This is my honest opinion on the story I read.\ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfb6",
