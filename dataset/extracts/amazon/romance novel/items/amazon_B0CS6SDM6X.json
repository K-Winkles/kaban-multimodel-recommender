It had 3 different parts that weren't accurate with the story:1. Elijah and Abigail met when Elijah came to Abigail's ranch not when Abigail came to Elijah.2. Abigail's sister Elena, came to visit Abigail twice before Elijah and Abigail got married.3. Abigail reunited with her parent right before she married.But I still enjoyed reading the book.",
