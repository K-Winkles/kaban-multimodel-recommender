            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Sweltering chemistry, sizzling banter and swoonworthy romance. Icebreaker melted me head to toe.\" \u2014Elena Armas, New York Times bestselling author of The Spanish Love Deception About the Author Hannah Grace is an English self-labeled \u201cfluffy comfort book\u201d author, writing predominantly new adult and contemporary romance from her home in Manchester, England. When she\u2019s not describing everyone\u2019s eyes ten-thousand times a chapter, accidentally giving multiple characters the same name, or using English sayings that no one understands in her American books, you can find her hanging out with her husband and two dogs, Pig and Bear. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One: Anastasia Chapter One ANASTASIA \u201cAGAIN, ANASTASIA!\u201d If I hear the words again and Anastasia together in a sentence one more time, it might be the thing that finally tips me over the edge. I\u2019ve been on the edge since I woke up this morning with a hangover sent directly from the pits of hell, so the last thing I need right now is more grief from Coach Aubrey Brady. I focus on suppressing my annoyance, like I do every training session when she makes it her mission to push me to my limits. Rationalizing it\u2019s her dedication that makes her such a successful coach, I decide throwing my ice skates at her is something that should stay in my imagination. \u201cYou\u2019re being sloppy, Stas!\u201d she yells as we fly straight past her. \u201cSloppy girls don\u2019t get medals!\u201d What did I say about not throwing skates at her? \u201cCome on, Anastasia. Put in some effort for once.\u201d Aaron snickers, poking his tongue out at me when I shoot him a cold glare. Aaron Carlisle is the best male figure skater the University of California, Maple Hills, has to offer. When I was offered a spot at UCMH and my skating partner wasn\u2019t, Aaron was luckily in the same position, and we became pairs. This is our third year of skating together and our third year of getting our asses kicked. I have a theory that Aubrey is a Soviet spy. I don\u2019t have any evidence, and my theory isn\u2019t well developed. Developed at all, actually. But sometimes, when she\u2019s screaming at me to straighten my spine or lift my chin, I swear a slight Russian accent slips out. Which is peculiar for a woman from Philipsburg, Montana. Comrade Brady was a figure skating superstar in her heyday. Even now, her movements are delicate and controlled, and she moves with such grace it\u2019s hard to believe she can shout as loud as she does. Her graying hair is always pulled back into a tight bun, which accentuates her high cheekbones, and she\u2019s always wrapped tight in her signature faux-fur black coat, which Aaron jokes is where she hides all her secrets. The rumor is she was supposed to go to the Olympics with her partner, Wyatt. However, Wyatt and Aubrey were practicing those lifts a little too often, and she ended up holding a baby instead of a gold medal. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been in a bad mood since she started coaching twenty-five years ago. \u201cClair de lune\u201d fades as Aaron and I finish our routine nose to nose, our chests heaving against each other as we try to catch our breath. When we finally hear a single clap, we move apart and skate toward what will undoubtedly be the source of my next headache. I haven\u2019t even stopped moving when her green eyes lock on me and narrow. \u201cWhen are you going to land your Lutz? If you\u2019re not going to deliver, it needs to come out of your long program.\u201d Aside from Brady, successfully doing a quadruple Lutz and not landing on my ass is the current bane of my existence. I\u2019ve been practicing for God knows how long, but I can\u2019t quite manage to nail it. Aaron can execute it flawlessly, which is why I convinced the choreographer to put it into our routine in the first place. Pride is a foolish thing. It\u2019s incredibly foolish when it comes to figure skating, since when you get it wrong, you bounce your face off solid ice. I\u2019d take face-planting over the annoying, fake-disappointed face Aaron pulls anytime it\u2019s suggested we take it out. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, Coach,\u201d I say with as much fake enthusiasm as possible. \u201cI\u2019m getting there; it\u2019s not perfect yet, but I\u2019ll keep practicing.\u201d It\u2019s a minor lie, a harmless one. I am getting there. What I\u2019ve failed to mention is I\u2019m only getting there off the ice, specifically when I\u2019m attached to equipment that helps me get there. \u201cShe\u2019s getting there,\u201d Aaron lies, throwing an arm around my shoulders. \u201cJust a bit longer, A.B.\u201d It\u2019s nice for Aaron to be on my side and show a united front to KGB Aubrey. What he says in private is that the only way I\u2019m going to pull it off is if I start doping and build a time machine to get my prepuberty body back. She mutters something inaudible and waves us off flippantly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you two back here tomorrow, and if you could both not be hungover, that would be great. I\u2019m fairly certain eating Kenny\u2019s before training isn\u2019t going to get either of you onto the Olympic team. Understood?\u201d Shit. \u201cYes, Coach,\u201d we say in harmony. Aaron is staring at his phone, waiting for me in the lobby when I finally exit the women\u2019s locker room. \u201cI fucking told you she\u2019d know.\u201d I groan, swinging my bag toward him as soon as I\u2019m close enough to hit him in the stomach with it. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have anything!\u201d He grunts at the impact, tugging the bag from my hands and flinging it over his shoulder. \u201cThe woman has the nose of a bloodhound.\u201d Like most things in life, skating is far easier when you\u2019re a man because nobody is picking you up and launching you across the room twice a day. Freshman year, I gained the freshman fifteen. Well, it was more like the freshman five, but Aaron said I was getting too heavy to lift, so I haven\u2019t put on an ounce since. I try to stick to my meal plan religiously, with the odd party here and there to keep me lucid. My best friend\u2019s twenty-first birthday yesterday was the perfect opportunity to let loose a little, even if it did mean braving Brady with a hangover. We climb into Aaron\u2019s new G-Wagen, the latest guilt gift from his adulterous but wealthy father, and head home. Aaron and I decided it would be cool to live together, with my best friend, Lola, at the end of freshman year. Our schedules are similar, and our lives revolve around skating, so it made sense. Aaron takes the turn onto Maple Avenue and looks over at me while I rummage through my purse for my most prized possession. \u201cWhat does the planner say you\u2019re doing tonight?\u201d I roll my eyes, ignoring his teasing tone. \u201cGetting laid.\u201d \u201cEw,\u201d he says, the tip of his nose wrinkling as he grimaces. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough you plan what time you sleep and eat, but do you need to plan having sex?\u201d He\u2019s not lying about the sleeping and eating thing\u2014every minute of my life is meticulously scheduled in my trusty planner, which my friends find equal parts hilarious and ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say I\u2019m a control freak, but I\u2019m a woman who needs to be in control. There\u2019s definitely a difference. I shrug, suppressing the urge to point out that at least I\u2019m getting some, unlike him. \u201cRyan is a busy guy and I\u2019m a busy girl. I want to see him as much as I can before basketball season.\u201d Ryan Rothwell is six feet six inches of pure athletic perfection. UCMH point guard and team captain, he\u2019s as serious about his sport as I am, which makes for a perfect no-strings-attached situation. The added benefit is Ry is the sweetest guy, so we\u2019ve become great friends through our mutually beneficial arrangement. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still fucking around with him. He\u2019s, like, double your size, how does he not crush you? No, wait. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d \u201cI know he is.\u201d I giggle, pinching his cheeks until he bats me away. \u201cSorta the whole point.\u201d Most people assume Aaron and I are more than partners, but we\u2019re more like siblings. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t good-looking, we\u2019ve just never had any romantic interest in each other. Aaron is much taller than me and lean like a dancer with his sculpted, muscular body. His black hair is kept short, and I swear he wears mascara because his sky-blue eyes are framed with the darkest, jealousy-inducing lashes, contrasting prominently against his pale skin. \u201cI officially know too much about your sex life, Anastasia.\u201d Aaron can\u2019t decide if he likes Ryan or not. Sometimes he\u2019s cool with him and Ryan gets to see the Aaron I see\u2014the one who\u2019s fun to be around. You\u2019d assume Ryan had personally ruined Aaron\u2019s life or something the rest of the time. Aaron can be so abrupt and harsh that it\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s unpredictable, but Ryan brushes it off and tells me not to worry about it. \u201cI promise to not talk about it for the rest of the drive home if you promise to give me a ride to Ryan\u2019s later.\u201d He contemplates for a minute or so. \u201cOkay, deal.\u201d LOLA LOOKS UP FROM THE salad she\u2019s stabbing aggressively with her fork and huffs. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, whose dick is Olivia Abbott sucking to get the lead role for the third year in a row?\u201d I can\u2019t help but cringe at her harsh words, but I know she doesn\u2019t mean it. She was already feeling delicate this morning after the copious amounts of alcohol we consumed last night for her birthday, so today wasn\u2019t the best day to find out she didn\u2019t get the part she wanted. I\u2019ve watched every show for the past two years, and Lo knows as well as I do, Olivia is an exceptionally talented actor. \u201cCan she not just be very talented? And not be sucking someone\u2019s dick?\u201d \u201cAnastasia, will you please let me be petty for five minutes and pretend I don\u2019t know she\u2019s better than me?\u201d Aaron throws himself into the chair beside me and reaches over to pick a carrot stick from my plate. \u201cWhat\u2019re we being petty about?\u201d \u201cOlivia Abbott,\u201d Lola and I respond in unison, the distaste in her tone evident as hell. \u201cShe\u2019s hot. Might be the hottest girl on campus,\u201d he says nonchalantly, clearly not paying attention to how Lola\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cIs she single?\u201d \u201cHow am I supposed to freaking know? She doesn\u2019t talk to anyone. She swans in, gets the role I want, and carries on being an anomaly.\u201d Lola studies performing arts, and it must be an unwritten rule that you have to have a larger-than-life personality, because everyone I\u2019ve met in her major is like her. It\u2019s usually an exhausting battle for attention, even as a spectator, but Olivia keeps to herself, and for some reason, it seems to bother people. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lols. There\u2019s always next time,\u201d I offer. We both know it doesn\u2019t mean anything, but she blows me a kiss anyway. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better\u2014I still can\u2019t land my Lutz. Aubrey is going to work it out soon and banish me to Siberia.\u201d \u201cOh no. You\u2019re officially a failure, how can you ever step foot on the ice again?\u201d She grins, her eyes shining as I scowl at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get there, babe. You\u2019re working hard.\u201d Her eyes move to Aaron, tapping away on his phone, totally uninterested in our conversation. \u201cHey, Ice Princess! You gonna help me out here?\u201d \u201cHuh? Sorry, yeah, you\u2019re hot, too, Lo.\u201d I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t see the steam leave Lola\u2019s ears as she yells at him about not listening to her. I slowly retreat to my bedroom, eager to not draw attention to myself and get caught in the crossfire of my roommates\u2019 argument. Living with Aaron and Lola is like living with siblings who always wanted to be only children. Aaron, like me, is an actual only child. The miracle baby to his two aging, midwestern parents desperate to keep their marriage together. Living with other people after being his parents\u2019 pride and joy for eighteen years was a big transition for him, and for us, who are the ones who have to live with him and his mood swings. Now he\u2019s not in Chicago, things between his parents aren\u2019t great, and we always know when they\u2019re extra bad because Aaron gets an obnoxiously expensive and unnecessary gift. Like a G-Wagen. In contrast to the two of us, Lola is from a huge family. Being the youngest and the only girl guaranteed her the number one spot in her house, and she has no problem putting Aaron in his place. I\u2019m still hiding out in my room when my phone buzzes, and Ryan\u2019s name flashes on my screen. RYAN The boys wanna throw a party tonight. Your place instead? They were supposed to be going to a pep rally or some shit, but now they\u2019re staying home. Just wanna be alone w you. Sure, roommates are in though. Will have to be quiet. Ha Should probably give yourself that instruction in a mirror. You free now? Yeah, come over. Omw. Bringing snacks. \u201cEveryone friends again?\u201d I call out cautiously as I make my way from my bedroom to the living room. They\u2019re both fixated on the Criminal Minds rerun on the TV, but I get a faint \u201cYeah\u201d in response, letting me know it\u2019s safe to approach. I lean over the couch for a handful of popcorn from the bowl resting between them, making a mental note to add it to my food tracker when I get back to my room. \u201cSo, the basketball team is having a party. I was wondering\u2014\u201d \u201cIf we will go with you?\u201d Aaron interrupts, sounding uncharacteristically hopeful. \u201cNo?\u201d Lola spins to face me, her red curls bouncing around her shoulders and delight written all over her face. \u201cIf we mind that Ryan wants to come here?\u201d \u201cYeah. How did yo\u2014?\u201d \u201cCough up, Carlisle,\u201d she laughs, holding out her hand. He presses a few twenties into her palm, muttering something under his breath as she counts them out. \u201cWe heard about the party, and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna get railed with drunk freshmen making out on the other side of the door. We\u2019re going to walk there.\u201d Our home is one of Aaron\u2019s dad\u2019s better forgive me presents. It was either after his affair with his secretary or before he decided to have sex with the interior designer. Maple Tower is a beautiful condo block on the edge of campus, and our place has a great view and tons of natural light. The building isn\u2019t exclusive to students, so it\u2019s a peaceful place to live, but it\u2019s close enough to everyone else that stumbling home from parties is easy. Aaron and I aren\u2019t supposed to be at parties, but what Aubrey doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her. I\u2019VE ALREADY WATCHED LOLA TRY on ten different outfits when Ryan texts to let me know he\u2019s finally on his way up, giving me an excuse to leave her and her ten almost identical black dresses. The butterflies I get when there is a knock at the door and I know Ryan is on the other side of it were strange to me at first, but now it\u2019s cute. He\u2019s practically filling the doorway when I open the door to let him in. His messy blond hair is still damp, and he smells strongly of orange and something I can\u2019t quite put my finger on, which is now weirdly comforting to me. His head dips to mine, and his lips press against my cheek lightly. \u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d He hands me the bag of snacks he always insists on bringing because apparently, I don\u2019t eat enough, and I don\u2019t have anything good to eat when he\u2019s here. Ryan eats more than any person I know, and his version of good is loaded with sugar. For some reason, Aaron and Lo are watching us from the living room like they\u2019ve never seen other human beings before. Ryan laughs when he spots them; fortunately, he\u2019s used to their antics by now, and he offers them a quiet \u201cHello\u201d as I lead him in the direction of my bedroom. \u201cHey, Rothwell?\u201d Lola shouts as we reach my door. He lets go of my hand, turning around to face her. \u201cYeah?\u201d She\u2019s leaning over the back of the couch, and I know from the mischievous look on her face I don\u2019t want to hear whatever she has to say. \u201cSince my bedroom is next to Stassie\u2019s and I\u2019m going to be listening to your grunting and balls slapping all night\u201d\u2014my eyes widen as far as they can go from behind him\u2014\u201ccan I have the code for your room, so I don\u2019t have to fight for the shared bathroom at the party at your place?\u201d Campus housing has electronically coded locks on bedroom doors for security. Ryan\u2019s room has a private bathroom, so Lo\u2019s request is a good idea since the bathroom line gets ridiculous the drunker people get. It\u2019s her delivery that\u2019s going to require some serious work. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll text it to you. No snooping, Mitchell. I\u2019ll know if you have.\u201d She holds up a peace sign. \u201cScout\u2019s honor. Enjoy all the sex.\u201d \u201cJesus, Lols.\u201d I groan loud enough for her to hear as I drag Ryan into my room away from her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI like her. She\u2019s funny.\u201d He chuckles, taking my face between his hands and tilting my head up so he can kiss me. It\u2019s soft at first, then more urgent as his tongue moves against mine. His hands travel down my body gently until they reach my thighs, scooping me up in one quick motion. My legs automatically wrap around his waist, my body familiar with his after doing this so many times. There\u2019s banging outside of my room, which I think is my roommates leaving, but every hot kiss Ryan places on my neck steals my attention away. I should check if it is them going, but it suddenly plummets to the bottom of things on my mind when Ryan lowers me to the bed and climbs on top of me. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he mumbles beneath my ear. He always does this. He kisses me perfectly, positions his body between my legs, applies enough pressure to have me squirm, scrambles the thoughts in my head, and then asks me something mundane like how my day was. The second I try to formulate a response, his fingers journey beneath my T-shirt, and he traces the curve of my jaw with his nose. Every inch of my skin feels like it\u2019s buzzing, and he hasn\u2019t even done anything yet. \u201cIt was, uh, uhm, fine, I, mhmm, skated\u2026\u201d His body rocks as he laughs. \u201cYou mhmm skated? Sounds interesting. Why don\u2019t you tell me more, Allen?\u201d I hate him. I really, really hate him. I incoherently mumble something about ice and Russians as he strips us of our clothes until we\u2019re both in our underwear. Ryan\u2019s body would make a Greek god weep; tanned skin from his summer home in Miami, and a torso with more abs than I can count. Forget a Greek god, it makes me want to weep. Gripping my panties on each hip, he waits until I nod before slowly pulling them down my legs, throwing them behind him, and spreading my legs wide. \u201cStas.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d His forehead creases. \u201cCan Lola really hear my balls?\u201d Read more"

Sparks fly when a competitive figure skater and hockey team captain are forced to share a rink.Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA. It looks like everything is going according to plan when she gets a full scholarship to the University of California, Maple Hills and lands a place on their competitive figure skating team. Nothing will stand in her way, not even the captain of the hockey team, Nate Hawkins. Nate\u2019s focus as team captain is on keeping his team on the ice. Which is tricky when a facilities mishap means they are forced to share a rink with the figure skating team\u2014including Anastasia, who clearly can\u2019t stand him. But when Anastasia\u2019s skating partner faces an uncertain future, she may have to look to Nate to take her shot. Sparks fly, but Anastasia isn\u2019t worried\u2026because she could never like a hockey player, right?",

                "reviewText": "Almost 15 year old niece requested this book for Christmas. I however am the aunt that is always YES to every request. Including this one. Total fail for me. I should\u2019ve read the reviews or at least looked into the book. Lmao. When I say I was in SHOCK opening up to a RANDOM page in the book before wrapping. I\u2019m not even exaggerating. The page I opened up to was very descriptive of the sexual situation going on at that point in the book and the conversation the two were having was like a fifty shades scene. Lmfao. I however had already purchased it. She requested it. I obviously know this isn\u2019t the first book nor the first moment of interest into things such as these because she\u2019s almost 15 and let\u2019s face it social media and our society has become way more complex therefore I continued to wrap it & gifted it. Not without the dramatics of reading a tid bit out loud for our family to hear after she opened it. Everyone was dying of laughter and shock, was a memory to keep for sure.The quality of the book was as expected, she read it & loved it, added to her collection. Would recommend if you\u2019re an open aunt like myself and your niece takes advantage of that to request edgy gifts such as these. Lol.",

It\u2019s all that she has worked towards since she was five years old. She managed to get a full scholarship, but her pairs partner wasn\u2019t interested in furthering his career. So, as a freshman she was paired up with Aaron who was in the same boat.Stasis comes to win and nothing will get in her way. She has a meticulous schedule, regime and diet that will not be put off track for anybody or anything. Until she gets summoned along with the entire sporting department for a mandatory meeting that disrupts her day. This disruption continues when they are informed that Rink Two, the Hockey Teams Ice, is out for the count and they all have to share one ice rink.Nathan is the captain of the schools hockey team. He has never met a problem he couldn\u2019t solve, that is until his ice rink is flooded and they have to share with the figure skating team. He sees Anastasia arguing with her coach after the meeting, and his attempt to smooth things over backfires in his face.Anastasia\u2019s partner gets injured so Nathan steps in to fill the role. Swapping out a puck for a toe pick, the pair find themselves stuck together and closer than ever.Review:I don\u2019t even know where to fully start here.The premise is amazing and reminded me of the movie \u201cThe Cutting Edge\u201d. It\u2019s a semi-accurate comparison but only in certain spots. I give this author credit though as she made it her own and it didn\u2019t feel like a rip off of a timeless classic. I\u2019m not even mad at the execution of the story, as it kept me hooked.One complaint though is the spice level. It comes out of the gate swinging and while it does calm down after chapter two until a bit later in the book, this was just too much for my personal preference. Not to mention that the first sexual encounter between Anastasia and Nate left much to be desired. She just used the bathroom dude and you knelt\u2026. Well. You get it. \ud83e\udd2eMy second complaint is the epilogue. It just wasn\u2019t needed. I got to the last chapter of the book and thought I was done only for there to be a very predictable epilogue. I think the epilogue actually ruins the story and rushes achievements for the Main Couple. It felt out of place from what we learned through the book, like the author wanted it so it happened. The lady chapter would have been the perfect ending.One thing I absolutely loved about this story was the cast of characters. It wasn\u2019t just about the main duo, it included such lovable hockey players on Nathan\u2019s team and an amazing best friend for Anastasia. The author managed to flush out these characters and give them their own personalities and problems. It really felt like I could be in a room with a group of friends.Banter is also my weakness. Coming in strong with not only enjoyable back and forth between Ana and Nate, the way the hockey team comes together and ribs on each other was so perfect. There were multiple spots outside of the main couple that had me laughing. The team even accepted Ana and Lola into their group and they joined in on the fun of driving Nate crazy.I have to say that the way the author really delved outside of the romance to introduce complex backstories and emotions for these characters was really well done. Anastasia is in therapy and we see how her anxiety and obsessive planning became established. We see how it affects her daily life and even those around her. It wasn\u2019t just a throwaway plot point, the author actually disperses it throughout the story in a great way.We also get to see some healing in regards to how Ana looks at food. This is such a delicate subject and I think it was handled so well. Of course, I\u2019m coming at this from someone who has (luckily \u2014 but no shame to anyone who hasn\u2019t been so lucky \u2014 I support you) never experienced trauma with food. I hope that the author truly did portray it in a healthy way and if not, can someone please educate me?The climax of the story was pristine but there were some moments that had me rolling my eyes. Development that we worked through only for it to be torn down to further the plot. But, that\u2019s the way the stories are written so what can you do?Overall there were some really great moments through the book but it wasn\u2019t enough to overpower the ending. The ending really ruined it for me and unfortunately that\u2019s a big ding taking away from the rating.",

I felt that they were very immature but they're only 21. I really began to respect Stassi when she started to realize how unhealthy her lifestyle was, both mentally and physically. I loved Nate's golden retriever personality and I loved how supportive he was of her growth. I feel like they both had healthy boundaries with one another and I loved how they learned to communicate and work together through their issues. By 50% into the book, l was fully invested in the characters. The way that they grew to love each other was sweet and hilarious.",

Aquele que pode mover mares e terras pra ver aqueles que ele ama bem.Gostei MUITO do desenvolvimento deles. Eu diria que eles come\u00e7aram sendo um \u201chaters to lovers\u201d que nao durou tanto porque o Nathan \u00e9 irresist\u00edvel demais pra isso (bem do jeito que ele gosta de se achar).\u00c9 um romance pra passar o tempo, que era justamente o que eu tava procurando.
