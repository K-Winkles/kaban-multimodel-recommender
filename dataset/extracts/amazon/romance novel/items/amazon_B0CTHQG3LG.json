                "reviewText": "I read this in one day, since I couldn't put it down! Fantastic book, so exciting and interesting, with strong unique characters, and a storyline that keeps you in its grip. A very wealthy family in San Francisco has twin babies, both girls, each with her own nanny. But the parents ignore the babies, and one of the nannies tries to get the mother to show one of the girls love and gets fired. She cannot bear to leave the girl with such an unfeeling uncaring mother, so she takes the child with her, raising her as her own. Now the twins are 19, and the taken girl, \"Alice\", finds out what happened, after her \"mother\" has died. She seeks answers and the truth. Henry Williams is a wealthy doctor, as is his father, and is expected to take over the practice, as well as marry the wealthy Cora (Alice's twin). But Henry just wants to go to a small town where he is much needed and can personally know everyone he is helping. So many twists, this is a fast fun read!",

Her \"Papa\" has to share with her that neither parent she has known are her actual birth parents. Her mother was her nanny and kidnapped her rather than be separated from her when she was fired. Her twin sister had another nanny as her family was very wealthy. Their mother was very hands-off and image is everything to her (then and still is, as Alice learns later).Alice finds where her parents and sister are, moves there for a time to try to meet them. She determines this needs to be cautiously approached but then meets her twin. There is an immediate bond and a big request from her. Alice is uncertain but decides to do what her twin asks although there are many potential pitfalls. I leave the rest for you to read - a delightful story.",

Alice is reared in a loving caring home. She learns when she is 19 years old that the people that she thought were her parents are not. Mr. Miller gives Alice a letter written by his wife, Luisa, before her death and his wife\u2019s diary. Now, Alice is on the hunt for her birth parents that she travels to San Francisco. Unknown to Alice, she has a twin sister, Cora that she meets at seamstress shop where Alice is working. Cora basically asks Alice to switch places, to leave Alice an obligation to learn of her real parents in their environment. Meanwhile, Cora is free to pursue her own love interest that her parents condemn and forcefully control her movements to contain her efforts. Henry Williams is the one chosen by both sets of parents to wed Cora, but he is not interested Cora. Alice learns from Luisa Miller\u2019s diary that she played with Henry William when she was a young age before Alice left New York City with Luisa. Henry\u2019s statement on their wedding day \u201cIt only makes me more convinced that we were destined to be with one another no matter what. See how we\u2019ve managed to find each other against all odds.\u201d Need to read story for all the details and how Cora\u2019s romance comes to fruition.Received ARC copy review is voluntary, Thank you Leslie Hales",
