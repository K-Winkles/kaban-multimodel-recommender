I've taught Pumpkinheads twice in an intro to comics studies class, and it's been a solid hit for just about every reader. My students generally give it high scores for the expressiveness of the art and the relatability of the characters and situations.",

                "reviewText": "As the 4.0 rating suggests, I really enjoyed this book. I love the way it's drawn, somewhere between cartoonish and mature- definitely stands out from superhero comics but doesn't feel foreign to the genre. I like that this story is perfect for YA readers, but could overlap with adult reading fans as well.It's a sweet story (watch me give away my age here) that reminds me of Saved By the Bell- the summer episodes. Anyone whoever when to summer camp, summer school, or had some other seasonal job or camp experience can relate to this story even though it's set in the Fall and at Halloween. The seasonal and holiday elements were extra- fun bits to indulge those who enjoy the season.**SPOILER**I may be the only person who feels this way, but the main reason I didn't give this story a 5-star rating was the predictable ending. I thought it would have been so much cooler if this had been the story of long-lasting friendship, but it was just another \"cute guy doesn't realize his awesome best female-friend is really the one for him\" story. Everything else about the ending was great, but I guess I just didn't see the point of Deja going out of her way to help Josiah get the girl only to want to be the girl gotten; plus, she already had so many other people interested in her.**End SPOILER**I like how quirky and honest the characters are, as well as the diversity depicted. Never been to Nebraska but I hope it's like this book portrays it. Overall, the thing that really sold me on this story, is just how funny it is. It's not a LOL funny but a more realistic type of funny- ya know when something is funny because it's true (even though it's fiction).Highly recommended to graphic novel fans, romantic comedy fans, and YA fans.",

I know this pumpkin patch backwards and forwards and reading this in an air conditioned room from the disgustingly hot and humid East coast we are forced to live at now - gave me such nostalgia. For both autumn (cooler temps!) and this wonderfully awesome pumpkin patch where I took my kids every year! The story was adorable, and, yes, I had a feeling about the ending but the characters are so engaging, fun and darling, I was happy to join them on their journey. This is perfectly captured and by the way, if you have teens, no, no, gah no, there's nothing wrong about wanting to eat all the snacks like some other reviewer pointed out. No, there's no eating disorder to be found.I'll be definitely rereading this when I get pumpkin patch homesick because it's true and I can attest - there really is no pumpkin patch like it and man, I miss their pie, hayrides and popcorn!The art style and the emotion is spot on! Beautifully captured!",

                "reviewText": "Rainbow Rowell has made me cry. Yet again. I've read enough of her work for this to be expected, but everything about Pumpkinheads \u2014 her first graphic novel with the inimitable Faith Erin Hicks \u2014 sounded to me like it was just going to be a cute, fun romp.And it was, you know? Pumpkinheads is the story of Josiah and Deja, two high school seniors who've spent the last couple of years working at their local pumpkin patch every Fall. Theirs is a seasonal friendship, but the bond they develop is strong \u2014 indeed, they consider themselves best friends. This is their last season working together, and once it wraps up, they will both, for the last time, go their separate ways, towards college and new lives. So Deja is determined to have their last day (their last Hallowe'en together) be an adventure. \"Friends,\" she says at one point, \"don't let friends live small lives.\"Pumpkinheads is charming and adorable and the most fun, gentle read. As are most of Rowell's stories. And like most of Rowell's stories, it isn't just any of those things. There's always more. And there's a lot of heart and soul in this graphic novel. A lot of true things about friendship and relationships and what it means to leave people and places behind. (And quite a lot of Autumn. This is probably the most Fall book I've ever read. I could feel it wrapped around me like a light sweater, could practically smell the crisp October air. Quite the feat considering I live in Puerto Rico, and have never actually come across a proper, Midwestern Fall.)All of this is beautifully conveyed by Faith Erin Hicks's beautiful, beautiful artwork. She's drawn up a gorgeous and warm, welcoming world into which I desperately want to jump.Hicks deserves a lot of recognition in terms of the story, too. The book's back matter includes a conversation between the authors which makes note of the fact that the script Hicks received from Rowell was more screenplay-like in nature, lacking a lot of the beat-by-beat description that is usually found in most comic book scripts, and it was up to her to break down the panels and figure out the pacing of the story. A job she did marvelously \u2014 this is a brisk but fulfilling read. (\"There is a lot of skill,\" Hicks says, \"behind a 'quick read.'\")Hicks ends the same conversation with the following: \"In the beginning, you're trying to get to know them, who they are and how best to draw them so their personalities come through, visually. And by the time you've drawn the last page in their graphic novel, these characters are your best friends.\" This is, of course, in reference to the drawing process, but it also perfectly encapsulates the experience of reading the story of these characters. You pretty much like Josie and Deja from the get-go, but you love them by the end. And then you understand, quite perfectly, just why they are so loathe to say good bye to their pumpkin patch.I loved this book.",
