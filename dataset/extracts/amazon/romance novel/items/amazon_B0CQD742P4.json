He\u2019s putting his estate in jeopardy, all in an effort to avoid his grief over his father\u2019s death and responsibility. His brother, Nicholas reminds him daily of his duty and is disgusted at Tristan\u2019s behavior. Their attorney suggested that Tristan marry a wealthy woman. Such a woman has just been jilted by her fianc\u00e9e and married her supposed best friend. Viola Penrose has been humiliated and suffering the usual judgmental nonsense by the ton. The author writes a clean romance effortlessly, but Tristan\u2019s brother Nicholas is really a thorn not only in his side but the readers as well. He almost ruined the novel with his cynicism\u2026a real downer.Read how this couple come together as a way to erase both of the scandals associated with them and find honesty and love in the bargain. [Anytime you read the word Nicholas, just skip those sentences\u2026It will be more enjoyable.]I received an ARC from the author and I am leaving an unbiased review voluntarily.",
