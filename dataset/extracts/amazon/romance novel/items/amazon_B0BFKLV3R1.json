With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she\u2019s long abandoned the search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to round out a satisfying life.But when Sally\u2019s friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actress who guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show\u2014and in society at large\u2014who\u2019ve gotten romantically involved with incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called The Danny Horst Rule, poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would ever happen for a woman.Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as both host and musical guest for this week\u2019s show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder if there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn\u2019t a romantic comedy\u2014it\u2019s real life. And in real life, someone like him would never date someone like her . . . right?With her keen observations and trademark ability to bring complex women to life on the page, Curtis Sittenfeld explores the neurosis-inducing and heart-fluttering wonder of love, while slyly dissecting the social rituals of romance and gender relations in the modern age.

                "reviewText": "I've seen some mixed reviews on this one, and I can definitely see where every side comes from. I personally enjoyed this one for the most part, but definitely wouldn't call it anything super ground breaking by any means. It was fun to experience and get a behind the scenes feel of what real life shows like SNL are like. However, I do feel like there was maybe a little too much background and detail given, which maybe the author should have focused a little more on building up a more realistic connection and development of the relationship between the two main characters. I mostly enjoyed Sally as the female lead - but while she was a strong character in some scenarios, there were other times where she was just way too unconfident and self sabotage-y, which became irritating at times. I'm not the biggest fan of the narrative when the lead is their own biggest obstacle \ud83d\ude44 But I did like that the author seemed to make her a \"real\" character. She was very relatable in that aspect. And her uh, anxieties, when it came to how one relieves themselves when in a new relationship was a very humorous bit \ud83d\ude06The other bit of criticism I have is that the author was very forward with where her stance is on a lot of real life topics, and this book mentions a LOT about Covid. That kind of thing doesn't always bother me, but to have a good chunk of the book to be taking place during Covid and lock downs kind of ruined the magic of disappearing into a fictional story for me, and it was just too much for me. Having to deal with that in real life was good enough for me, I'd rather not read about it when I'm trying to escape reality, thanks. And it just wasn't necessary, there could have been other scenarios used as a catalyst to get the same story across. For that reason, I can understand where a lot of people did not enjoy this one.All in all, was an enjoyable read, but not one I'd recommend to everyone.",

It is entirely different to read a book set during a catastrophic time that you actually lived through, like COVID. This book is on the lighter end, of course, being a romantic comedy. I liked all the pop culture references that were relatable and the main characters being older and established in their lives. It is a quick read!",

Even better, the story was told in first-person by Sally, one of the show\u2019s comedy writers. I loved the behind-the-scenes details and I could tell that the author did some major research. The story felt genuine. And it was funny.The not-so-good: As the book progresses, the author pivots to romance, which is not one of my favorite genres. OK, yes, I did read the title, \u201cRomantic Comedy,\u201d but I thought it would be mostly about the writing and production of a RomCom, with maybe a little romance between characters as a sub-plot. Instead, the plot became mostly romance and much less about what it takes to be a writer for that type of show. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a great romance novel for those who appreciate that type of story, but I did not enjoy it.One last beef: I really grew to dislike the main character, Sally, who is overly needy, and who tries to blow up every good thing that happens to her in the relationship department. I honestly don\u2019t know how anyone could be with her, because she\u2019s so willing to walk out or have a meltdown when the going gets tough. Sally is insecure, annoying, and drama-filled. She needs reassurance, time after time. I realize that the author was taking us on Sally\u2019s journey, but it was just painful to endure so many character flaws.",

I loved the behind the scenes SNL-type inside scoop. I LOVED the character dialogue and the relationships that Sally had with her friends and family. And I loved the love story. I think Sally\u2019s insecurities are something many of us can relate to. I laughed out loud several times, Noah made me swoon several times, and I just thoroughly enjoyed this book.",

The second half takes place in the Pandemic, not the headlines of it, but the daily anxiety of living through it.Well written- highly recomended if you want a rom- com that references both Thoreau and shopping at Target.",

The behind-the-scenes look at the frenetic world of TV sketch comedy (a la Saturday Night Live) was to me quite fascinating. The romance was a bit of a slow burn, but it felt totally believable.I liked that Noah was not the cliche of celeb/pop star hero that so often feels shallow and not realistic when depicted in books. In this case, both he and Sally were drawn convincingly. Both were likeable, but somehow neither had ever met a person they could have a long-term real and satisfying relationship with. They were attracted from the start, but it did take a while for things to develop between them. I fully enjoyed the journey, and I was completely sucked in to their lives and their story. For me, a very enjoyable read.",
