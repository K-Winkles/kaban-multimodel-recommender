The signs was there but she chose to ignore them, maybe maybe not. As an older sister you try to help providing assistance as much as possible. The author gave us the point of view from two people the mother and the daughter. The daughter was down right disrespectful. As a parent we work hard to protect our children both physically and emotionally. Throughout the story the mothers goal was to protect her her daughter emotionally. I started to dislike the teenager who thought she knew it all. I was once a teenager who thought I knew everything, but I didn't. I enjoyed reading this story I really like the ending.",

Not only is Morgan in utter shock from losing her husband, she also uncovers a painful secret about him that she vows to protect Clara from at all cost. Overwhelmed with grief and sadness, Clara finds solace in a new boyfriend, but is suddenly getting into trouble and lashing out. Morgan also finds herself turning to an unexpected man from her past. Will Morgan and Clara ever work through their grief and repair their strained relationship? And maybe find love along the way?",

                "reviewText": "I just finished the book with one word stuck in my mind, orange. Let\u2019s be honest, Miller looked like a creepy guy with his film. He began to film Clara when she was 14 and when he was with Shelby, his ex-girlfriend. But it is also cute. He is also mature for his age compare to Clara who acted like a totally immature teenager, taking thing personally and judging without understanding. She was so hard on her mother and wanting to \u2018murder her\u2019 for things she hadn\u2019t done. We know in the end she regrets how she treated her mom. Her mom was the one keeping all things for herself and hurting a lot inside. The lost of her husband and sister had been difficult for all the family. One thing I wished to see in the book is to know what the letters said about Chris and Jenny, to have answers because in this real world we all want to know to be able to move on. I was disappointed about that, she destroyed the letters. Another thing is, there\u2019s too much about Clara and Miller. Why not more about Morgan and Jonah? Some spicy scenes and their future. Did Morgan finally got the job? Did she finally go to college? Will she marry Jonah? It was more a book for teenagers than adults. I saw the review and we are more adults readers than teenagers. This is why some are disappointed. Still a good story and I won\u2019t stop reading books from Colleen Hoover",
