She is an auto mechanic, good at what she does, which is mostly fixing tractors for the ranchers in her community of Copper Ridge, Oregon. But she's been invited to a big party and needs a date, something her older brothers are betting she'll never have. She decides to win that bet. But how can she, when she's hardly ever dated anyone?Instead of stressing, she asks her best friend, Chase McCormick, who just happens to be a guy. They've been friends for 15 years, watching movies together, eating popcorn together, but not dating, not dancing, not being boy-girl friends. Chase dates a lot, has bedded tons of women. He knows what she needs to learn how to do, but will he take her under his wing?He agrees and soon realizes that what he wants is being friends with benefits, not just a friend who isn't affected when he sees Anna in her pj's with an ice cream pint in her hand. What starts out as a few teaching sessions becomes a white-hot sexy exploration that forces Anna to realize what she's been hiding for years. She loves Chase, not just as a friend, but also as way more than the beneficiary of his sexual prowess. Trouble is, when she tells him so, he runs like the scared rabbit he is--until he... sorry. You'll have to read to find out what happens next.",

While I would have liked it to have been longer because I enjoyed it so much, I wanted to follow Chase and Anna a few pages longer. Anna and Chase' s long best friendship turns into a friend's with benefits when Anna needs Chase' s help in getting a date to win a bet with her brothers. Not one to date, as the only thing she really knew anything about was being a mechanic, she needed a date to a gala she had been invited to. In steps Chase, who offers to help her enough to get a date. That's where the story takes off, and if you like a good, hot romance this is a must read.",

                "reviewText": "3.5 Stars!Take Me, Cowboy was a fun, friends to lovers romance full of the humor I've come to expect from a Maisey Yates book and I really enjoyed it!Anna Brown has recently opened a repair shop and doesn't have the time nor inclination for dating. However, when her brothers bet she can't find a date for the gala for Copper Ridge's business owners, she's determined to prove them wrong. Anna knows just the person to turn to for advice, her best friend Chase McCormack. Chase wants to attend that gala and agrees to help turn Anna into a lady if she'll take him as her date. However, Chase and Anna soon find themselves fighting the attraction that's between them and must decide how to proceed while keeping their friendship in tact.Anna is a strong woman and believes there's nothing a man can do that she can't do better. She never really had a woman for a role model and is clueless about how to act how she thinks a woman should in order to attract a man. I really liked how over the course of the book, she began to accept herself more for who she is and that she realized that changing how she looks and acts can't change who she actually is.Chase is incredibly loyal to his family and wants to work to restore the family name to the place of honor it held before his parents died. Unfortunately that's probably the best characteristic Chase has. Chase doesn't have the best opinions on relationships or women and he grated on me a bit. He did redeem himself somewhat by the end of the story, but too little too late in my opinion.Anna and Chase have great chemistry and there's a ton of heat between them. I like that while Chase was trying to teach Anna to act like a woman, Anna ended up flipping things around and taking charge. Friends to lovers is one of my favorite relationship tropes and I think it was very well done here. Their friendship was very believable and I enjoyed the scenes where they simply got to be with each other.Overall, Take Me, Cowboy was a fun addition to the Copper Ridge series that could have benefited from being a bit longer to give the characters more time to develop.",

They did not live in a fantasy world where everything was perfect, and had their share of realistic problems, but they got through them fantastically, and the final get together of the characters was amazing. I could read it over and over again. Loved the over protective brothers as well. It just all came together in one great book. Thank you Maisey Yates.",
