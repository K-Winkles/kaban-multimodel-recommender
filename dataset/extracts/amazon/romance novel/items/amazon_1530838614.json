        "description": "What makes a romance novel a romance? How do you write a kissing book?Writing a well-structured romance isn\u2019t the same as writing any other genre\u2014something the popular novel and screenwriting guides don\u2019t address. The romance arc is made up of its own story beats, and the external plot and theme need to be braided to the romance arc\u2014not the other way around.Told in conversational (and often irreverent) prose, Romancing the Beat can be read like you are sitting down to coffee with romance editor and author Gwen Hayes while she explains story structure. The way she does with her clients. Some of whom are regular inhabitants of the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists.Romancing the Beat is a recipe, not a rigid system. The beats don\u2019t care if you plot or outline before you write, or if you pants your way through the drafts and do a \u201cbeat check\u201d when you\u2019re revising. Pantsers and plotters are both welcome. So sit down, grab a cuppa, and let\u2019s talk about kissing books. Read more",

                "reviewText": "This guide is kinda short, but it does what it says on the tin and describes the structure of a romance novel. Note there is only one structure, not more than one, and she doesn't go into what would happen if you deviate from the specified structure.Still, it's a great guide. Hayes writes in a very personable way, full of pop culture references and humor. It may be a hit or miss in that regard. I personally wasn't a big fan of her style, but the information provided was still a gold mine.I'm used to reading writing guides that explain the structure of novels in general. But romance novels are slightly different from that mold and having her point out those differences was really helpful to me.Overall, I reccomend this book for people who want a concise guide to writing romance novels. I don't recommend it for veterans of the genre because it would pretty much explain the basics without going into much detail.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My new Go-To for Romance Writing",
                "reviewText": "The book was released for publication in 2016 and was apparently intended to be a series, because it is listed as book one. Her style is conversational and sort-of off the cuff, such as a conversation with a friend over lunch. She is a little off-beat which makes her book fun to read. At the time of this review, the book is listed at #8 in Writing Skill, #10 in Authorship.As someone who has read and owns about 70 writing how-to books, I found this book delightful. A refreshing change from the general millieu of writing books, most of which are not useful when writing romance fiction. After all, it isn\u2019t really a hero\u2019s quest and the adversarial forces are probably not villain It is fairly quick-paced so it\u2019s important to focus on the ideas and content.The set up is simple. There is the introduction of each main character, their meet cute, and the reveling of why it can never be between them, although it absolutely must be. The set up makes up the first 25% of the story leading to the first plot point as in other novels. The story arc is a little bit more nuanced then other writings, since there might not be the same antagonist forces at work here. Still, there are many complications surrounding the relationships in the romance story.The relationship then begins and despite some complications, the characters arrive at the midpoint having formed some kind of bond, maybe having had the first date. In the third section, it all falls apart, and in the final quarter of the book, the couple fights to save the relationship.Ultimately there are seven key points in the romance story. The introduction of each main character is followed by the meet cute. After establishing that the couple belongs together, it is vital to reveal why it can never be, though, in fact, it also must be. As the plot points works to further the story and the budding relationship, there are pinch points at every turn that pull the couple apart over and again. The couple often has aspirations separate from the relationship and these will further work against the relationship as each seeks to achieve a goal that is sure to come between them. During the third act, when facing the darkest moment, the pair finally realizes that they can and must find a compromise that allows then to achieve most of their goals while protecting the thing they now realize they cannot be without- each other.",
