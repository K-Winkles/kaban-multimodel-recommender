All rights reserved. Chapter 1If someone had told me, as little as two years ago, that I\u2019d own and operate a bed-\u00adand-\u00adbreakfast in this tiny berg of a town called Cedar Cove, I would have laughed my head off. But then I never expected to be a widow at the age of thirty-\u00adsix, either. If I\u2019ve learned anything\u2014\u00adand, trust me, life has been filled with several painful lessons\u2014\u00adit\u2019s that the future doesn\u2019t come with a printed guarantee.So here I am in ninety-\u00adfive-\u00addegree heat, stripping beds, scrubbing toilets, and baking cookies. An even greater surprise is that I\u2019m loving it. Well, maybe not the toilet-\u00adscrubbing part, but just about every other aspect of this new life I have carved out for myself.It\u2019s been two full years now since I got the news that my husband is dead. And while I never thought it would be possible, there are times when I can smile again, feel again, even laugh. All three are surprises. When I got word that Paul had been killed in a helicopter crash on some unpronounceable mountainside in Afghanistan, it felt as if my entire world had imploded. I needed to hold on to something to keep from spiraling out of control, and that something turned out to be Rose Harbor Inn.Nearly everyone advised against me buying the inn: my family, my friends, my employer. Again and again I heard that this was a drastic change, and I should wait a year. Give it twelve months, I was lectured. That\u2019s the proverbial wisdom, and while I politely listened, I silently went about making my own plans. It was either do something different\u2014\u00adall right, drastic\u2014\u00ador slowly go insane.Has it been easy? Hardly. Eking out a living by renting rooms, doing a good majority of the work myself, hasn\u2019t helped build up my investment portfolio. I have yet to see a penny in profit, but I\u2019m not going under, either. For the most part I\u2019ve invested every cent back into the inn.After I purchased the inn, I changed the name and had a new sign constructed and installed. I\u2019d decided to call my new home Rose Harbor Inn. Rose is my surname, Paul\u2019s name, and Harbor because I needed to find a protected environment in order to heal. And my sign hung proudly in front of the inn with my name, Jo Marie Rose, etched below.In addition to the new sign, there were certain necessary repairs, some cosmetic and others unavoidable. Thankfully, friends introduced me to Mark Taylor, the local handyman.Mark.What an enigma he was. I\u2019ve seen him nearly every day for the past year, sometimes two and three times a day, and I still know hardly anything about him other than his name and address. Okay, so he\u2019s a great carpenter and he craves my peanut-\u00adbutter cookies. Not knowing more felt like a pesky bug bite with a constant itch. My imagination ran wild. I wanted to uncover Mark\u2019s secrets, conjuring up a dozen reasons he refused to talk about himself. Some of those scenarios were outrageous, and there were a few scary ones lurking in the back of my mind as well.I\u2019ve been on a mission to pry some small bit of personal information out of him. So far I\u2019ve had little to no success. I might as well try chiseling marble with a marshmallow. The man is as tight-\u00adlipped as they come.The washing machine beeped, indicating that the cycle had ended.The Hendersons, who\u2019d recently checked out, had been in town visiting their son, who was stationed at the Bremerton Navy base. He\u2019d recently become engaged to a local woman, and the couple had flown in from Texas to meet their future daughter-\u00adin-\u00adlaw. Lois and Michael were a delightful couple and I\u2019d enjoyed hosting them.I had two names on the books for the upcoming weekend. Both would arrive sometime Friday afternoon. After a while, names become a blur in my memory. People come and go, but for whatever reason, I specifically remembered both parties who had booked this weekend.The first was Eleanor Reynolds, and she\u2019d sounded quite proper when we\u2019d first spoken. I\u2019d guesstimated that she was either an accountant or a middle-\u00adaged librarian. Since that time I\u2019d changed my mind. I\u2019d spoken to Ellie twice\u2014\u00adshe asked that I call her that\u2014\u00adsince our original phone call. Once when she canceled and then a third time when she rebooked. The woman couldn\u2019t seem to make up her mind. Seeing that I hadn\u2019t heard from her in the last few weeks, I had to assume she would keep the reservation and arrive sometime this afternoon.By contrast, Maggie Porter had been a breath of fresh air, chatting and happy. This was a getaway weekend she was planning with her husband, Roy. Right before the Fourth of July, Maggie\u2019s in-\u00adlaws, who had apparently heard what Maggie was planning, had called and paid for the weekend as an anniversary gift for the young couple. I looked forward to meeting Maggie and her husband.Rover barked, which told me someone was coming up the front walkway. I glanced at my watch, fearing I\u2019d let time get away from me. This happened more frequently than I cared to admit. Rover, my rescue dog and constant companion, raced to the door. I recognized Rover\u2019s bark, which told me I had nothing to be anxious about. It wasn\u2019t a guest arriving early; it was Mark Taylor.Great. I\u2019d been hoping it was him. I fully intended to drill him and this time I wasn\u2019t going to let him sidetrack me or sidestep my questions.I held the door open for Mark. He\u2019d broken his leg last May and it\u2019d healed nicely. I couldn\u2019t detect even a trace of a limp. I\u2019d been upset with him for how long it\u2019d taken him to plant my rose garden. What should have taken only a matter of a few days had stretched into weeks and weeks.As you might have guessed, patience isn\u2019t my strong suit. To be fair, his injured leg didn\u2019t exactly speed up the process. When the rose garden was in and blooming I was less irritated. Next on my agenda was the gazebo, which I wanted Mark to build. I\u2019d given him a photo of exactly what I envisioned, but that had been weeks ago.I longed for that gazebo. In my mind, I pictured Rover sitting with me while I sipped coffee or tea at sunset, watching the sun casting a net of pink and orange shadows across the sky as it slowly went down behind the Olympic Mountain Range. I could get the same view from the deck in the back of the house, but I liked to reserve that spot for my guests. It was a picture of the sunset that graced my brochure. Mark took that photo. Actually, he\u2019s quite good at photography, although he brushes away my praise as if receiving a compliment embarrasses him.Mark came into the inn and paused long enough to look down at Rover. He muttered something about the dog being nothing but a worthless mutt.I bit down on my tongue to keep from defending Rover. Mark was like that. He\u2019d make a comment just to get a rise out of me, but I was onto his game and I wasn\u2019t falling for it.\u201cYou got a minute?\u201d he asked.\u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer me directly. Instead, he went into the breakfast room where I served my guests and placed a rolled-\u00adup piece of drafting paper on the tabletop. \u201cI\u2019ve finished the plans for the gazebo.\u201dThis was a surprise. I\u2019d expected it would take another five or six months for him to get around to that. From the first, he\u2019d let it be known that he had other jobs that took priority over mine. This was something else he did, I suspected, hoping to irritate me. To my way of thinking, my money was just as good as anyone else\u2019s, or so one would think. Despite my best efforts, I had yet to figure out how Mark established his priority system. Not that it mattered. However he calculated it, my projects were generally placed near the bottom.\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I said, and hoped to sound encouraging, but not overly so. I didn\u2019t want to be disappointed when it took far longer than I wanted for him to start the project.He unrolled the sheet of paper and anchored it with the salt and pepper shakers on opposite corners. The free corners curled up slightly.I glanced down and immediately liked what I saw. \u201cWhen did you draw this up?\u201d I asked.\u201cA few weeks ago.\u201dAnd he was only showing it to me now?\u201cDo you like it or not?\u201dI wasn\u2019t the only one who struggled with patience.\u201cI do,\u201d I assured him, \u201cbut I have a few questions.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to cost me?\u201dHe rolled his eyes as if I\u2019d made an unreasonable request. \u201cYou want an estimate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s generally how it works,\u201d I reminded him.He sighed as if insulted. \u201cI would have thought by now that you\u2019d trust me to be fair.\u201d\u201cI do trust you, but building a gazebo can\u2019t be cheap, and I may need to budget for it. I don\u2019t suppose you take payments?\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d As it was, he preferred to be paid in cash.\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll get you an estimate but if you complain about delays, then you have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d\u201cCan you give me a general idea?\u201d I pressed. To this point, the cost of everything Mark had built for me had been more than reasonable.In response, he took out a small spiral pad he kept in his shirt pocket and riffled through several pages. He studied the sheet, then frowned and closed his eyes as if mentally tallying up the final estimation. When he opened his eyes, he named a figure I could live with.\u201cSounds good,\u201d I said, trying to disguise how pleased I was.\u201cIt\u2019s a go?\u201dI studied the design once more. It was basically a carbon copy of the picture I\u2019d cut out of a magazine and handed him months ago. As far as I could see, it was perfect and would add a great deal of curb appeal to the inn.\u201cIt\u2019s a go.\u201d I rubbed my palms together. I was excited now, and I didn\u2019t care if Mark knew it. Rover wagged his tail as if he, too, was pleased.\u201cGood.\u201d He replaced the salt and pepper shakers to the middle of the table, collected the paper, rolled it back up, and secured it with a rubber band.Mark wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou baked cookies this morning?\u201d he asked, and then frowned. \u201cIn this heat?\u201d\u201cIt was early.\u201dI tend to be an early riser, always have been. My friends, before they married and had children, often slept until ten or eleven on weekends. Try as I might, I rarely made it past seven. Eight at the very latest.\u201cHow early?\u201d\u201cFour.\u201dMark shook his head and grimaced as if he\u2019d unexpectedly tasted something sour. \u201cToo early for me.\u201d\u201cIs it too early for a taste test?\u201d It went without saying that he was looking for me to make the offer.\u201cI could be persuaded.\u201d Read more"

Summer is a busy season at the inn, so proprietor Jo Marie Rose and handyman Mark Taylor have spent a lot of time together keeping the property running. Despite some folks\u2019 good-natured claims to the contrary, Jo Marie insists that Mark is only a friend. However, she seems to be thinking about this particular friend a great deal lately. Jo Marie knows surprisingly little about Mark\u2019s life, due in no small part to his refusal to discuss it. She\u2019s determined to learn more about his past, but first she must face her own\u2014and welcome three visitors who, like her, are setting out on new paths. Twenty-three-year-old Ellie Reynolds is taking a leap of faith. She\u2019s come to Cedar Cove to meet Tom, a man she\u2019s been corresponding with for months, and with whom she might even be falling in love. Ellie\u2019s overprotective mother disapproves of her trip, but Ellie is determined to spread her wings. Maggie and Roy Porter are next to arrive at the inn. They are taking their first vacation alone since their children were born. In the wake of past mistakes, they hope to rekindle the spark in their marriage\u2014and to win back each other\u2019s trust. But Maggie must make one last confession that could forever tear them apart. For each of these characters, it will ultimately be a moment when someone wore their heart on their sleeve\u2014and took pen to paper\u2014that makes all the difference. Debbie Macomber\u2019s moving novel reveals the courage it takes to be vulnerable, accepting, and open to love.Praise for Love Letters\u201cRomance and a little mystery abound in this third installment of Macomber\u2019s series set at Cedar Cove\u2019s Rose Harbor Inn. . . .

Jo Marie Rose owns and runs the Inn. It has provided comfort and healing to everyone who has stayed here before. However, it doesn\u2019t seem to be able to heal this group of visitors.Eleanor (Ellie) Reynolds has come to Cedar Cove to meet Tom who she met online. Despite her Mother\u2019s admonitions, Ellie has come to meet Tom in person and see if there might be the signs of a real relationship growing. Ellie\u2019s Mother is not in favor of this meeting as she sees all men out to get women in their claws and never let go. This attitude goes back to her Mother\u2019s (Virginia)marriage. Her husband left Virginia and Ellie and was never heard of again except for child support. Will Virginia be right about Tom? Is he just using Ellie?Maggie and Roy were having a weekend getaway with the blessing of Roy\u2019s parents who had paid for the weekend as an anniversary gift and were taking care of their two sons for them. Maggie and Roy were going through a very rough part in their marriage. They needed to talk it out; but Roy wouldn\u2019t talk and Maggie still believed Roy was texting Katherine. Would their vows to each other hold firm through the turmoil?The Inn at Rose Harbor is a wonderful and fulfilling place. I wish it really existed and I could afford to spend some time there. The characters are very realistic.",

It does seem as if the back story making Mark react the way he does is taking a rather long time to show itself...this being the third book. Jo Marie finally acknowledges at the end of the book that she is attracted to Mark but he is still running away. The stories of the people who come to stay in her bed and breakfast serve as a good backdrop to the growing attraction between Mark and Jo Marie but I feel the time is quickly approaching where these two need to advance their relationship or move on...perhaps in the next one. I still care enough about them to read the next.",

Very interesting and easy reads. I like the fact that Debbie writes about the human kind's inner struggles and joys , regular people like you and I and how they work through it. I don't like storylines about the bad guy and a plot and the bad wins until to the end when the hero finally breaks through. I like books about every day people with every day struggles which makes it easy to relate to.",
