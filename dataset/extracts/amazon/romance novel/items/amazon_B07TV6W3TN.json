                "reviewText": "Tell Me to Stop is an entertaining quick read that ends rather abruptly and will leave you wanting to read what happens next. If you decide to read this book, definitely plan to get the second one because it really gets more interesting at the end.Olive receives a mystery check in the mail that just so happens to be the exact amount of money she owes in student loans. Not knowing who sent the money or why Olive decides to deposit the check and hope for the best. The rest of the story involves learning who the mystery benefactor is as well as what they want, 365 days and nights with Olive.Overall, the main idea behind the book isn't new but it does have its own unique variation on the trope. One thing that really kind of turned me off from the book for a moment was when Olive is reading a scene from her favorite author's book which *just* so happens to be the author of this book, Charlotte Byrd. While I get that it is probably meant to be cutesy or tongue-in-cheek, it just didn't land very well for me. That being said, the story was actually engaging for me, even if it was short, and I will definitely be continuing on with the second part of the story.",

I liked the intrigue of the first book\u2019s storyline; Mystery man sends mystery gift, his intentions unknown, etc\u2026 Our heroine goes to Hawaii with her best friend to meet him and find out who he is and what he wants from her.Things I didn\u2019t like: (Spoilers ahead!)#1 Did anyone edit these books? So much of the writing is clunky and awkward, and there are so many distracting inconsistencies in the narrative (for example: \u2018she leaned across the picnic table to kiss him\u2019; in the next sentence \u2018she puts her head on his shoulder\u2019. What?)#2 Self-Indulgent author who more than once has the heroine mention that Charlotte Byrd her favorite writer.#3 The character of Josephine is practically Byrd herself. She\u2019s written as someone who is an author of romance/suspense books and goes on and on about independent publishing and how to write a good story. Even Josephine\u2019s husband used to be her writing partner just like Byrd\u2019s.#4 Lazy planning out of the story.Hero: \u2018I need to find someone who can crack a safe.\u2019 Heroine: \u2018I\u2019ve never told anyone this but I happen to be an expert safe cracker with all the equipment needed because I worked my way through college as a cat burglar only to take a boring desk job and struggle to make ends meet after college.\u2019 Really?#5 Lazy writing, using the same descriptions and phrases over and over and over again: If I read, \u2018She wiped her tears with the back of her hand\u2019 one more time, I was going to throw my Kindle across the room.",

                "reviewText": "So. I like to think that I'm not particularly picky when reading this book genre, but I'd still like a smooth narrative style, and a basic story. I'm sorry: this story really is terrible, boring, and not well written at all, despite the luring title and catchy summary on the back of the cover.It's all about the poorly written main character's personal drama up to page 175, with close to zero interaction between the guy and the girl. Then, out of the blue, and totally unrelated, you find a sex chapter. And then the next chapter goes back to the girl's personal drama with no trace of the guy. I double and triple checked if it was a mistake in printing the book itself but the page numbers' order is fine! And it's not a sudden change of mind of one of the characters, the guy and the girl are in two different places so it's really impossible.Again, boring to the bone, no interaction between the two main characters at all besides the \"here's the money, do me a favor\" \"yes for the money, no thanks for the favor\" lines...... absolutely no sparkle. Not a hint.Personally, a waste of time, money and paper.",
