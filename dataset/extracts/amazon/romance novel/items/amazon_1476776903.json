It was nice getting to know the characters from such a young age and then see how they ended up as adults. The main heroine had such a tough decision and I don't know what I would have done in her shoes.I tried to put myself in her shoes but unless you are in that position for reals, it's hard to really know what you would do. I kept thinking about Castaway, with Tom Hanks, and how things ended for him in that movie as well. It's not easy.I definitely cried multiple times (but I am a crybaby) and was invested.All in all, I liked it. This author does a good job with the stories and painting a picture.",

I\u2019d say more of a 2.5ish.I think the problem is I know the power of Reid\u2019s talent, and it just did not shine through in this book. It\u2019s not a bad book, it\u2019s not a bad story. Did it grip me, not really. Throughout my reading journey I kept forgetting the name of the book.The characters are cute, the storyline seems rushed. I definitely did not give me \u201call the feels\u201d like I\u2019m use to with her books. It\u2019s a fast read for sure, but you can skip this one and try The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo or Daisy Jones & The Six.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Love triangle",
                "reviewText": "I have found that I really enjoy TJR\u2019s style of writing so I\u2019ve been trying to read through her list of books. This one doesn\u2019t disappoint. It starts off telling you the story from a teenage point of view when she meets and falls in love with her eventual husband. Then you read about their marriage and how he eventually goes missing on a work trip. He\u2019s gone for 3+ years and you hear a lot about her grief and how she tried to get through it. Eventually she takes a chance on an old dorky highschoool friend and ends up getting engaged to him. Then the husband miraculously comes back and she\u2019s faced with deciding between the two.The good stuff:1. The writing about grief was excellent, even if you haven\u2019t lived through a loved one dying or going missing, most people have experienced grief and the description was spot on.2. The love story of how she met her husband was sweet and it immediately transported me back to highschool crushes and best friends that you think matter more than family.3. The relationship with her parents was great - they were supportive even when they didn\u2019t understand her choices and welcomed her back when she needed them.The not so good stuff:1. She had a strained relationship with her sister for seemingly no real reason which was a recurring theme but didn\u2019t have much substance.2. The husbands survival story was so ridiculous and implausible it was comical. They also only discussed what he actually went through for like 1 paragraph\u2026. This was the major pivotal moment\u2026 wish it had been better thought out and described. Wish we could have heard his point of view.3. The book focuses heavily on how a person can fundamentally change after a tragedy.. but I seriously doubt a girl who was desperate to travel the world, moved across the country, and married a trouble making jock, would suddenly decide she wants to move back home permanently, run a small family store, and marry the band geek from her highschool. That sounds like a rebound move while picking up the pieces\u2026 not how she would permanently shape the rest of her life.4. I personally think she picked the wrong guy in the end (don\u2019t come for me on this). I think her decision will leave her unhappy and bored in the long run. To be fair, I think the best ending of all would have been her picking herself and starting her life fresh over going back to traveling and writing. I loved the sister telling her it wasn\u2019t about the men, she had to figure out herself. Wish they had stuck to that theme!In sum, it\u2019s the typical good read by TJR but I wish the ending had been better with the main tragedy better thought out and addressed. Maybe one day she will write a book from Jesse\u2019s POV or Marie\u2019s POV and I would love to read those!",

                "reviewText": "I had heard so much about Taylor Jenkins Reid\u2019s books, but I had never read one. One True Loves introduces us to Emma Blair. Her first crush, Jesse Lerner, becomes her first love, but tragedy strikes and the two are separated. Everyone believes he is dead, and after years of grief, Emma decides to move on. She rekindles a relationship with an old acquaintance and the two fall in love and plan to be married. Then the unthinkable happens, and Emma learns that Jesse is in fact alive and is returning to her. Does Emma choose her old love or her new? I enjoyed the conflict, but there were times I found the dialogue somewhat shallow, and towards the end, I found myself skipping over passages that were too repetitive. So I rated the book 4 stars, or probably 3 1/2 to be honest.",

                "reviewText": "Emma se casa con su amor de juventud, Jesse, y se construyen una vida a medida, alejada de las expectativas de su familia. En su primer aniversario, Jesse recibe un encargo y, mientras sobrevuela el Pac\u00edfico, su helic\u00f3ptero desaparece. Emma regresa a su hogar para recomponerse. A\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, vuelve a enamorarse y, cuando se compromete, encuentran a Jesse, que lleva todo ese tiempo vivo e intentando volver a casa. Emma tiene ahora un marido y un prometido, \u00bfpero qui\u00e9n es su verdadero amor?Gracias a esta relectura he vuelto a conectar con la autora. One true loves es una novela muy ligera que me ha hecho empatizar un mont\u00f3n con la Emma adolescente, sus inseguridades y c\u00f3mo vive sus amores de instituto. Es una historia muy corta, pero que te hace sentir de todo de forma muy intensa. Mucha gente encuentra el (los) romance algo escaso y necesitado de desarrollo. Personalmente, para m\u00ed ganan todas las emociones de Emma a lo largo del libro: su situaci\u00f3n no te dejar\u00e1 indiferente, es m\u00e1s, te llevar\u00e1 por delante de forma arrolladora y sin contemplaciones. Por segunda vez, Taylor ha conseguido tenerme con el coraz\u00f3n en un pu\u00f1o, re\u00edr y llorar en unas pocas p\u00e1ginas. Si hay algo a lo que aspiro es a tener una relaci\u00f3n tan sana y bonita como. Las que tiene Emma a lo largo de la novela, alguien que me quiera tanto y con quien poder hablar de todo. De nuevo, el estilo de la autora es muy sencillo si quieres empezar a leer en ingl\u00e9s, y en esta ocasi\u00f3n s\u00ed he sentido que se ha salido de los libros que suele escribir. Nuestra protagonista no es especialmente guapa y no encaja en lo que todo el mundo espera de ella, al contrario que Daisy o Evelyn; Emma me ha parecido mucho m\u00e1s real y accesible, alguien con quien cualquiera puede identificarse. Es posible que One true loves se cuele entre mis mejores lecturas de este 2024.",
