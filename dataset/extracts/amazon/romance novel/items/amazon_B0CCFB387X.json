                "reviewText": "How to Seduce a Rockstar: A Steamy Rockstar Novel (Bad Boys of Rock Book 1) by Arabella Quinn begins with a spicy scene that is so hot I expected smoke to waft from my iPad\u2019s Kindle app. It all starts with Ryder, guitarist with the rock band \u201cGhost Parker,\u201d deciding to crash at college buddy Max\u2019s apartment before going home to see his family. Talia is Max\u2019s girlfriend who ends up fighting with each other more than a loving couple with a three-year history. After another fight on Max\u2019s birthday in a bar, they leave separately. With her girlfriend egging her on and plying her with lots of liquid courage in shots, Talia goes to Max\u2019s apartment to fulfill Max\u2019s favorite fantasy she nicknames \u201cOLD.\u201dI am still LOL, so you must read the book to find out what the letters stand for. Ryder and Talia have an encounter that rocks both of their worlds. Finding a way to forge their lives together is quite a feat that they both want to try. Ryder keeps so much locked inside himself and tries solving all problems without help from others until his life implodes. Misunderstanding and jealousy drive Talia away from Ryder. Ryder finally seeks help ways to win back his girl. He sends gifts and writes letters to Talia as he begins to share what happened when she visited him in California. As a former college grad, I feel Ryder letters could be something a guy could write on paper as easier than in person. Regardless, I was cheering for the HEA when it was finally realized. I loved this book so much that I looked for the back catalog of her books by Arabella Quinn to read about the other band mentioned in How To Seduce a Rockstar.",

I was definitely familiar with the meet-cute, but this had to have fallen under the new category of meet-awkward \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2cI actually started to like Ryder pretty much right away (despite some of his flaws). He certainly seemed to be more redeemable than Max, at least.My biggest issues with the book were probably the very unexpected plot-twists/complications caused by that piece of trash, Stan, and all of the awful consequences that resulted from that situation. I really thought there\u2019d be a different outcome. I also felt like there were some open holes in the story that should\u2019ve been sewn up. Some, I expect will come in further books, but it just felt incomplete in some aspects.It was a pretty quick read though & turned out to be times right with my (unfortunate) Covid recovery, so that was a plus.I\u2019ll be trying out book 2 straightaway.",

Tallia was strong and loyal, and knew what she wanted, but wasn\u2019t willing to give herself up for it. Thankfully, Ryder was Able to express his feelings and let his love shine through.

I like her writing style, the funny moments and the teary moments. All the characters are brilliant and, when I finish this series, I will go back to the Cold Fusion series. I think I need to read bout \u201cCrazy\u201d Livvy!",

I am a big fan of Rockstar romances and I enjoyed this book.The way Ryan and Talia met is certainly not a 'meet cute' that you'll be seeing in a Hollywood RomCom any time soon \ud83e\udd23. A case of mistaken identity in bed.Ryder is immature, a man whore and there are plenty if pictures on the Internet to prove it. Obviously, Talia has doubts but her strong attraction to Ryder and the connection she feels takes over.This book is funny. I enjoyed Ryder getting locked in the cellar with 'Crazy' Livvy. This series has characters from 'Rock Me' series by the same author which I might read because I love Livvy! You don't have to read that series first though!",
