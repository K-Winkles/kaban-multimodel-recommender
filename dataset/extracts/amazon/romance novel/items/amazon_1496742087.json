It helps to make sure you do the things you would truly like to do before you one day leave this earth. I love that Bree had made a bucket list at such a young age and she thought her sister would be brave enough to finish it for her when she found out she was dying. This book is a love story of sister love, family love and also the realities of medical debt, even when a person dies. Grieving is a challenge and even more so when Jodie, Bree\u2019s sister has to feel her every step of the way in trying to complete her bucket list.This is a fantastic read. Looking forward to reading more by this author.",

She unfortunately dies from leukemia at the young age of 26 and leaves her family with tons of medical debt. After she dies, her family finds out that Bree wants her sister Jodie to finish off the things she didn't get to finish on her bucket list. In turn, all of her medical bills will be paid in full. The downfall though is that all of it has to be broadcasted on social media. Jodie goes through some humiliating experiences but though it all she rediscovers herself. The question is will she finish #100 on the list - fall in love?Overall, it was a good story. I definitely cried during this book, as it does show Bree's family and best friend trying to move through life while grieving.",

It was quite the adventure with plenty of tears and laughs and characters that really came to life. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was Kelly. He was one note and not terribly interesting. He felt shoved into the story. Take him out, let the story be about grief and family and new friends, and it might have been one of my favorite stories.",
