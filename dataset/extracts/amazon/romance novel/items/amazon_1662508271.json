            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cGood music vibes and compelling characters make this good for public libraries.\u201d \u2015Booklist\u201cBestselling author Rochelle B. Weinstein had me at \u2018mix tape.\u2019 Her nostalgic new page-turner, What You Do To Me hits all the high notes: a strong, determined female protagonist, a dreamy love interest (ahh, the lead singer in a band), forbidden love, family drama, journalistic pursuits, suspense, and second chances. Rolling Stone reporter Cecilia James has committed the cardinal sin: She has become emotionally involved in her story, as she deep dives into finding the truth behind a hit love song while trying to detangle her own messy love life and family secrets. I sang, I wept, I laughed, and I applauded\u2015holding my lighter high for an encore performance. Weinstein\u2019s latest must-read gem doesn\u2019t miss a beat.\u201d \u2015Lisa Barr, New York Times bestselling author of Woman on Fire\u201cWeinstein had me at music. Throw in a retro timeline that brings back all the 90s feels and I\u2019m a forever fan. What You Do To Me has everything I love in a story: romance, mystery, and suspense, the trifecta of an unputdownable read. Weinstein savvily crafts not one, but two love stories, each with a heart tugging emotional end, wraps them both in some of my favorite tunes from the best decades (IMHO), plus some new ones, and adds in a mystery detailed so visually I could easily picture this on screen. Fans of Daisy Jones & the Six and novels with music themes and persistent protagonists both flawed and edgy will obviously love this book, but I think Weinstein\u2019s novel packs an extra punch for us romantics who grew up falling for a rock star or two, even if he was only a poster on the wall above our bed.\u201d \u2015Kerry Lonsdale, Wall Street Journal bestselling author of Side Trip\u201cLong a master of the family saga, Rochelle Weinstein now turns her formidable talent to a passionate and playful love story. What You Do To Me is the story of star-crossed lovers Eddie, a musician, and Sara, his muse, and Cecelia, the journalist who is trying to rewrite their ending\u2015and her own. Fans of Taylor Jenkins Reid\u2019s Daisy Jones & the Six will flock to this sweet and soulful book about first love and second chances, and will be moved and inspired to revisit the playlist of their own lives.\u201d \u2015Pam Jenoff, New York Times bestselling author of Code Name Sapphire\u201cWith a deft hand, Rochelle Weinstein has crafted a fascinating, multi-layered tale expertly weaving between then and now. She introduces not one, but several intriguing elements from the past and how they shaped the present, and I desperately needed to know how everything would end. And all I can say is, what a wild and wonderful ride.\u201d \u2015Tracey Garvis Graves, New York Times bestselling author of Heard It in a Love Song\u201cSometimes a book gets everything exactly right\u2015the ultimate love story and a heart-pumping mystery all wrapped up in a Daisy Jones & the Six vibe. What You Do To Me is storytelling perfection.\u201d \u2015Annabel Monaghan, author of Nora Goes Off Script\u201cI love everything Rochelle Weinstein writes, and I am still swooning over What You Do To Me, a story brimming with suspense, rock music, forbidden love, and a heroine who is determined to uncover a decades-long secret. Sexy, sweet, and ultimately so satisfying\u2015you need to read this one!\u201d \u2015Maddie Dawson, bestselling author of Matchmaking for Beginners About the Author Rochelle B. Weinstein is the USA Today and Amazon bestselling author of seven women\u2019s fiction novels, including When We Let Go, This Is Not How It Ends, and Somebody\u2019s Daughter. A former entertainment industry executive, she splits her time between sunny South Florida and the mountains of North Carolina. As Miami\u2019s NBC 6 in the Mix monthly book contributor, Rochelle is on the hunt for the next great read while she teaches publishing workshops at Nova Southeastern University. She loves hiking, beach walks, her two dogs, and finding the world\u2019s best nachos. She is currently working on her eighth novel. Please visit her at www.rochelleweinstein.com."

        "description": "From the bestselling author of This Is Not How It Ends comes a moving novel of two unfinished love stories and the music and lyrics that bring them together.Journalist Cecilia James is a sucker for a love song. So when she stumbles across a clue to the identity of the muse for one of rock\u2019s greatest, she devotes herself to uncovering the truth, even as her own relationship is falling apart.While writing an article for Rolling Stone, Cecilia works to reveal the mystery that has intrigued fans and discovers a classic tale of two soulmates separated by fate and circumstance. Rock star Eddie Vee once sang with his soul, dedicating love songs to Sara Friedman, his inspiration and first love. Now, Eddie takes refuge in anonymity, closed off to the past. Sara, too, has distanced herself from their love, moving thousands of miles away to live the life she once railed against. As Eddie and Sara tentatively open up to Cecilia about broken dreams, she struggles to give them a happy ending. In the process, she learns that broken hearts can be healed\u2015even her own.What You Do To Me is the story of a love song and of the triumph of the heart over the greatest of odds. Even for those who have written off love forever. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Rochelle B. Weinstein, the Author of \u201cWhat You Do To Me,\u201d has written a captivating and exhilarating novel. The theme that runs through this memorable and heartfelt novel is how music encourages our life rhythm, sparks our emotions and dreams, and keeps us in tune and balance between what is magical and reality. The partnership and composition of the melody and lyrics can be so inspiring. Music can be soothing, calming, and therapeutic for children, adults, and pets. Music can remind us of past events and be memorable in happy and sad times. Sometimes, music can be personal. The genres for this novel are Contemporary Fiction, Music, Family, Mother-Daughter Relationships, and Romance.Rochelle B. Weinstein is a master storyteller in this well-written, multi-layered novel. The author brought back memories of songs and the groups that performed them. Rochelle B. Weinstein tunes in to her story and vividly describes the scenery, the lyrics, the rhythm, and her dramatic and colorful characters. Cecilia James is a journalist who writes for Rolling Stone. Cecilia loves music and especially enjoys romantic songs. She is looking for the artist who sang, \u2018What You Do to Me\u201d and the person he wrote the song for. This song provides special memories for Cecilia. Cecilia is a workaholic, and time seems to get away from her when she is busy. As a result, she is heartbroken over her relationship with her boyfriend Pete.A mystery surrounds the song \u201cWhat You Do to Me.\u201d The artist has disappeared, and no one knows where he is. Cecilia is looking for Eddie Vee, who was a famous rockstar. Eddie had been in love with Sara Friedman. Their relationship was broken because they came from two different worlds. Cecilia feels that Eddie wrote this song for Sara and would like to speak to both of them. Cecilia wants to find a happy closure for this couple and, at the same time, hopes that she can fix her relationship.I love how the author uses music in literacy and how she discusses the importance of family relationships, communication, honesty, loyalty, friendship, love, and hope. I highly recommend this novel.",
