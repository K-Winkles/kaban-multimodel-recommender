        "description": "From the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Things We Never Got OverYou don't fall for your brother's high school sweetheart, your boss's daughter, or your ex-wife's best friend. Especially when they're all the same woman.Under Brick Callan's mile-wide chest beats a loyal heart with a few cracks in it. He's the steadfast, overprotective type. Especially when it comes to the one woman he can never have. It's a long, complicated history punctuated by fights, friendship, family, and an attraction that strains his iron willpower.When Remi Ford returns to Mackinac Island in the dead of winter with a secret, Brick makes it his mission to find out what put the shadows in those green eyes. Even if it means breaking down the walls he's built between them. Even if it means falling for the one girl he'll never get over.The free-spirited artist just needs to lay low for a few weeks so she can figure a way out of this nightmare. She's definitely not staying. Not when the man who broke her teenage heart into splinters keeps showing up at her parents' dinner table. Remi doesn't need broody, bearded Brick riding to her rescue\u2026again. Not when it will put them both in danger, costing them much more than their hearts.Author's Note: Frenemies-to-lovers. Opposites attract. Slow burn. Girl in danger. Glorious, glorious banter. Fighting as foreplay. Small-town shenanigans. Big, grumpy, pining, overprotective hero. Wild-child, trouble-finding heroine who keeps on pushing the hero's buttons. Steam Level: Lava. Suspense: Nail-biting. Feels: Big time.",

A character with abandoment issues and how those cause self destructive actions. Apologies and acknowledgement for being a jealous friend. Feeling like you never fit in, but realizing that people do love you just as you are. Such a good story that at times I stopped reading to ponder ideas and thoughts from what I had just read. So glad I found this author. Please keep writing us good stories.",

Remi and Brick met 14 years ago, when she was 16 and he was 24. They are true opposites. A synesthete, Remi sees the world in technicolor. She's a creative risk taker. Brick was nicknamed by Remi because he's strong and stoic. They have always been fascinated by and attracted to each other. While Remi has shared her feelings more than once, Brick has resisted and pushed her away because he feels like he isn't good enough. This isn't a second chance romance; it's at least a fourth chance romance. I was frustrated because Brick pushes Remi away for the first half of the novel and then flips his reasoning based on a single conversation.",

                "reviewText": "Knowing this story was set in my beloved home state and desperate for even a f\u0131ctional visit back home, I was willing to beg, plead, cr\u0105wl on my knees over bro\u0137en glass, and sell a k\u0131dney to get my hands on an early edition so I could be ready to tell the world the very minute this boo\u0137 went live, because I was certain it would be amazing. And let's face it. It's a L\u0173cy Sc\u00f2re book, so we have a 100% chance of it being a delightful, funny, heart-\u015fqueezing read, but this time with an extra dash of some pretty d\u0105rn nail-b\u0131ting suspense.Mackinac Island may seem like a sleepy island town during the b\u00f2ne-chilling winter with transportation via horses and snow mobiles and the most socializing being neighborly visits and a meal at the local tavern. That is until Rem\u0131ngton Honeysuc\u0137le Ford bl\u00f2ws quietly back into town. Being the tiny, t\u0131ght-knit community it is, it doesn\u2019t take five minutes for word to travel across the island that the girl who sees words and music in color and marches to the be\u0105t of a drum that consistently leads to tro\u0173ble has returned home.Remi is the most refreshing, unique heroine I\u2019ve met in ages. They definitely br\u00f2ke the mold with this gal. With a heart b\u0131gger than the Huron and a sparkling individuality and innate goodness that few understand, everyone wants to be in her orbit and some are a little jealous, yet Remi still has her share of insecurities.Then there's Brick Callan, the most brickish hero ever to be penned. Sol\u0131d, dependable and protective, yet I think an actual brick may use its words more than Brick. But when this guy actually does speak? Well, it's worth pulling the snow mobile over and turning off the engine to hear every word that comes straight from his pure, golden heart.Remi's life outside of the island has gone off the rails in a de\u0105dly way through no fault of her own. The past they share and the unrequ\u0131ted l\u00f2ve that runs both ways between her and Brick makes Remi hesitant to trust him with the details beh\u0131nd her returning home, yet she knows beyond all doubt she can trust him to keep her safe.And when you put these two together? Holy Mackinac fudge yumminess, Brick and Remi are like standing next to a volcano on the verge of er\u0173pting. You can feel the radiant heat and hear the gro\u0105n and rumble of the magma, and you know that when it inevitably bre\u0105ks loose it will inc\u0131nerate everything in its path. Sc\u00f2re has turned up the sm\u0117xy h\u0117at, and every encounter draws our couple closer together, making it abundantly clear that these two are as perfect as can be for each other.In this offering, we see a new dimension to this talented lady's wr\u0131ting. Where we're used to lighthearted fun with a side of ste\u0105m and a few heart squee\u017ces, or m\u0105dcap hilarity with a side of suspense, this story is something greater. She takes us de\u0117p into the psyche of these two characters, showing us events that made them who they are and l\u0105ys b\u0105re all the fears and vulnerabilities they\u2019ve kept from those who love them. And the suspense! Holy Grand Hotel! I was grabbing for the \u201coh sheet\u201d handle while gn\u0105wing my nails to nubs!If you\u2019re already a Sc\u00f2re fan, it's a no-brainer for you get this boo\u0137. If you\u2019re new to this gifted wordsm\u0131th, you'll be amazed by the way she paints the scene in the re\u0105der's mind. You'll effortlessly fall for these complex, ent\u00edc\u00ecng characters who make you feel like a quiet yet vital observer within their story. Your heart will get the most exquisite of workouts as you live and breathe every nuance and emotion on this riveting journey to forever. Light-hearted humor, rich depth of heart, stunning suspense and the sweetest of forevers make this an exceptional, unparalleled, magnificent must-read!",

It could have been a great book with a good plot if not for the unnecessary, f bombs everywhere, street terms for every body part and smutty sex instead of a little ROMANCE. By page 53 I was already sick of the foul language, smutty self-pleasure sex and generally spoiled, annoying \"heroine\". I seriously hope for my children's sake this is NOT the norm for language with family and friends entering a new relationship, as depicted here. Saving the heroine's friend from an abusive relationship was great. BUT then these characters decided THEIR rough sex was okay since it was consensual ?1? PS I am NOT a prude just selective about romance. Save your money.",

                "reviewText": "Book was great I loved everything about it. I want my own brick where on earth do I find him!? The push and pull between brick and remi was a multitude of feelings. Sometimes I was incredibly sad for her with how she felt each time he denied her his true feelings, I laughed at the stuff she came out with and I loved her attitude and the way she handled brick. I loved brick and felt bad for him with how he felt he wasn\u2019t enough for remi. The plot ok this book was great all the side characters were excellent. Truly is another wonderful book by Lucy",
