Or at least that makes it easier for me when I\u2019m writing\u2014\u00adbuilding my heroines and heroes up around this one self-\u00adsabotaging trait, hinging everything that happens to them on a specific characteristic: the thing they learned to do to protect themselves and can\u2019t let go of, even when it stops serving them.Maybe, for example, you didn\u2019t have much control over your life as a kid. So, to avoid disappointment, you learned never to ask yourself what you truly wanted. And it worked for a long time. Only now, upon realizing you didn\u2019t get what you didn\u2019t know you wanted, you\u2019re barreling down the highway in a midlife-\u00adcrisis-\u00admobile with a suitcase full of cash and a man named Stan in your trunk.Maybe your fatal flaw is that you don\u2019t use turn signals.Or maybe, like me, you\u2019re a hopeless romantic. You just can\u2019t stop telling yourself the story. The one about your own life, complete with melodramatic soundtrack and golden light lancing through car windows.It started when I was twelve. My parents sat me down to tell me the news. Mom had gotten her first diagnosis\u2014\u00adsuspicious cells in her left breast\u2014\u00adand she told me not to worry so many times I suspected I\u2019d be grounded if she caught me at it. My mom was a do-\u00ader, a laugher, an optimist, not a worrier, but I could tell she was terrified, and so I was too, frozen on the couch, unsure how to say anything without making things worse.But then my bookish homebody of a father did something unexpected. He stood and grabbed our hands\u2014\u00adone of Mom\u2019s, one of mine\u2014\u00adand said, You know what we need to get these bad feelings out? We need to dance!Our suburb had no clubs, just a mediocre steak house with a Friday night cover band, but Mom lit up like he\u2019d just suggested taking a private jet to the Copacabana.She wore her buttery yellow dress and some hammered metal earrings that twinkled when she moved. Dad ordered twenty-\u00adyear-\u00adold Scotch for them and a Shirley Temple for me, and the three of us twirled and bobbed until we were dizzy, laughing, tripping all over. We laughed until we could barely stand, and my famously reserved father sang along to \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d like the whole room wasn\u2019t watching us.And then, exhausted, we piled into the car and drove home through the quiet, Mom and Dad holding tight to each other\u2019s hands between the seats, and I tipped my head against the car window and, watching the streetlights flicker across the glass, thought, It\u2019s going to be okay. We will always be okay.And that was the moment I realized: when the world felt dark and scary, love could whisk you off to go dancing; laughter could take some of the pain away; beauty could punch holes in your fear. I decided then that my life would be full of all three. Not just for my own benefit, but for Mom\u2019s, and for everyone else around me.There would be purpose. There would be beauty. There would be candlelight and Fleetwood Mac playing softly in the background.The point is, I started telling myself a beautiful story about my life, about fate and the way things work out, and by twenty-\u00adeight years old, my story was perfect.Perfect (cancer-\u00adfree) parents who called several times a week, tipsy on wine or each other\u2019s company. Perfect (spontaneous, multi\u00adlingual, six foot three) boyfriend who worked in the ER and knew how to make coq au vin. Perfect shabby chic apartment in Queens. Perfect job writing romantic novels\u2014\u00adinspired by perfect parents and perfect boyfriend\u2014\u00adfor Sandy Lowe Books.Perfect life.But it was just a story, and when one gaping plot hole appeared, the whole thing unraveled. That\u2019s how stories work.Now, at twenty-\u00adnine, I was miserable, broke, semi-\u00adhomeless, very single, and pulling up to a gorgeous lake house whose very existence nauseated me. Grandly romanticizing my life had stopped serving me, but my fatal flaw was still riding shotgun in my dinged-\u00adup Kia Soul, narrating things as they happened:January Andrews stared out the car window at the angry lake beating up on the dusky shore. She tried to convince herself that coming here hadn\u2019t been a mistake.It was definitely a mistake, but I had no better option. You didn\u2019t turn down free lodging when you were broke.I parked on the street and stared up at the oversized cottage\u2019s facade, its gleaming windows and fairy tale of a porch, the shaggy beach grass dancing in the warm breeze.I checked the address in my GPS against the handwritten one hanging from the house key. This was it, all right.For a minute, I stalled, like maybe a world-\u00adending asteroid would take me out before I was forced to go inside. Then I took a deep breath and got out, wrestling my overstuffed suitcase from the back seat along with the cardboard box full of gin handles.I pushed a fistful of dark hair out of my eyes to study the cornflower blue shingles and snow-\u00adwhite trim. Just pretend you\u2019re at an Airbnb.Immediately, an imaginary Airbnb listing ran through my head: Three-\u00adbedroom, three-\u00adbath lakeside cottage brimming with charm and proof your father was an asshole and your life has been a lie.I started up the steps cut into the grassy hillside, blood rushing through my ears like fire hoses and legs wobbling, anticipating the moment the hellmouth would open and the world would drop out from under me.That already happened. Last year. And it didn\u2019t kill you, so neither will this.On the porch, every sensation in my body heightened. The tingling in my face, the twist in my stomach, the sweat prickling along my neck. I balanced the box of gin against my hip and slipped the key into the lock, a part of me hoping it would jam. That all this would turn out to be an elaborate practical joke Dad had set up for us before he died.Or, better yet, he wasn\u2019t actually dead. He\u2019d jump out from behind the bushes and scream, \u201cGotcha! You didn\u2019t really think I had a secret second life, did you? You couldn\u2019t possibly think I had a second house with some woman other than your mother?\u201dThe key turned effortlessly. The door swung inward.The house was silent.An ache went through me. The same one I\u2019d felt at least once a day since I got Mom\u2019s call about the stroke and heard her sob those words. He\u2019s gone, Janie.No Dad. Not here. Not anywhere. And then the second pain, the knife twisting: The father you knew never existed anyway.I\u2019d never really had him. Just like I\u2019d never really had my ex Jacques or his coq au vin.It was just a story I\u2019d been telling myself. From now on, it was the ugly truth or nothing. I steeled myself and stepped inside.My first thought was that the ugly truth wasn\u2019t super ugly. My dad\u2019s love nest had an open floor plan: a living room that spilled into a funky, blue-\u00adtiled kitchen and homey breakfast nook, the wall of windows just beyond overlooking a dark-\u00adstained deck.If Mom had owned this place, everything would\u2019ve been a mix of creamy, calming neutrals. The bohemian room I\u2019d stepped into would\u2019ve been more at home in Jacques\u2019s and my old place than my parents\u2019. I felt a little queasy imagining Dad here, among these things Mom never would\u2019ve picked out: the folksy hand-\u00adpainted breakfast table, the dark wooden bookshelves, the sunken couch covered in mismatched pillows.There was no sign of the version of him that I\u2019d known.My phone rang in my pocket and I set the box on the granite countertop to answer the call.\u201cHello?\u201d It came out weak and raspy.\u201cHow is it?\u201d the voice on the other end said immediately. \u201cIs there a sex dungeon?\u201d\u201cShadi?\u201d I guessed. I tucked the phone between my ear and shoulder as I unscrewed the cap from one of my gin bottles, taking a swig to fortify myself.\u201cIt honestly worries me that I\u2019m the only person who might call you to ask that,\u201d Shadi answered.\u201cYou\u2019re the only person who even knows about the Love Shack,\u201d I pointed out.\u201cI am not the only one who knows about it,\u201d Shadi argued.Technically true. While I\u2019d found out about my father\u2019s secret lake house at his funeral last year, Mom had been aware much longer. \u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I told about it. Anyway, give me a second. I just got here.\u201d\u201cLiterally?\u201d Shadi was breathing hard, which meant she was walking to a shift at the restaurant. Since we kept such different hours, most of our calls happened when she was on her way into work.\u201cMetaphorically,\u201d I said. \u201cLiterally, I\u2019ve been here for ten minutes, but I only just feel that I have arrived.\u201d\u201cSo wise,\u201d Shadi said. \u201cSo deep.\u201d\u201cShh,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m taking it all in.\u201d\u201cCheck for the sex dungeon!\u201d Shadi hurried to say, as if I were hanging up on her.I was not. I was simply holding the phone to my ear, holding my breath, holding my racing heart in my chest, as I scanned my father\u2019s second life.And there, just when I could convince myself Dad couldn\u2019t possibly have spent time here, I spotted something framed on the wall. A clipping of a New York Times Best Sellers list from three years ago, the same one he\u2019d positioned over the fireplace at home. There I was, at number fifteen, the bottom slot. And there, three slots above me\u2014\u00adin a sick twist of fate\u2014\u00adwas my college rival, Gus (though now he went by Augustus, because Serious Man) and his highbrow debut novel The Revelatories. It had stayed on the list for five weeks (not that I was counting (I was absolutely counting)).\u201cWell?\u201d Shadi prompted. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dI turned and my eyes caught on the mandala tapestry hanging over the couch.\u201cI\u2019m led to wonder if Dad smoked weed.\u201d I spun toward the windows at the side of the house, which aligned almost perfectly with the neighbor\u2019s, a design flaw Mom would never have overlooked when house shopping.But this wasn\u2019t her house, and I could clearly see the floor-\u00adto-\u00adceiling bookshelves that lined the neighbor\u2019s study.\u201cOh, god\u2014\u00admaybe it\u2019s a grow house, not a love shack!\u201d Shadi sounded delighted. \u201cYou should\u2019ve read the letter, January. It\u2019s all been a misunderstanding. Your dad\u2019s leaving you the family business. That Woman was his business partner, not his mistress.\u201dHow bad was it that I wished she was right?Either way, I\u2019d fully intended to read the letter. I\u2019d just been waiting for the right time, hoping the worst of my anger would settle and those last words from Dad would be comforting. Instead, a full year had passed and the dread I felt at the thought of opening the envelope grew every day. It was so unfair, that he should get the last word and I\u2019d have no way to reply. To scream or cry or demand more answers. Once I\u2019d opened it, there\u2019d be no going back. That would be it. The final goodbye.So until further notice, the letter was living a happy, if solitary, life in the bottom of the gin box I\u2019d brought with me from Queens.\u201cIt\u2019s not a grow house,\u201d I told Shadi and slid open the back door to step onto the deck. \u201cUnless the weed\u2019s in the basement.\u201d\u201cNo way,\u201d Shadi argued. \u201cThat\u2019s where the sex dungeon is.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about my depressing life,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new with you?\u201d\u201cYou mean the Haunted Hat,\u201d Shadi said. If only she had fewer than four roommates in her shoebox apartment in Chicago, then maybe I\u2019d be staying with her now. Not that I was capable of getting anything done when I was with Shadi. And my financial situation was too dire not to get something done. I had to finish my next book in this rent-\u00adfree hell. Then maybe I could afford my own Jacques-\u00adfree place.\u201cIf the Haunted Hat is what you want to talk about,\u201d I said, \u201cthen yes. Spill.\u201d\u201cStill hasn\u2019t spoken to me.\u201d Shadi sighed wistfully. \u201cBut I can, like, sense him looking at me when we\u2019re both in the kitchen. Because we have a connection.\u201d\u201cAre you at all worried that your connection isn\u2019t with the guy who\u2019s wearing the antique porkpie hat, but perhaps with the ghost of the hat\u2019s original owner? What will you do if you realize you\u2019ve fallen in love with a ghost?\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d Shadi thought for a minute. \u201cI guess I\u2019d have to update my Tinder bio.\u201dA breeze rippled off the water at the bottom of the hill, ruffling my brown waves across my shoulders, and the setting sun shot golden spears of light over everything, so bright and hot I had to squint to see the wash of oranges and reds it cast across the beach. If this were just some house I\u2019d rented, it would be the perfect place to write the adorable love story I\u2019d been promising Sandy Lowe Books for months.Shadi, I realized, had been talking. More about the Haunted Hat. His name was Ricky, but we never called him that. We always spoke of Shadi\u2019s love life in code. There was the older man who ran the amazing seafood restaurant (the Fish Lord), and then there was some guy we\u2019d called Mark because he looked like some other, famous Mark, and now there was this new coworker, a bartender who wore a hat every day that Shadi loathed and yet could not \u00adresist.I snapped back into the conversation as Shadi was saying, \u201cFourth of July weekend? Can I visit then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than a month away.\u201d I wanted to argue that I wouldn\u2019t even be here by then, but I knew it wasn\u2019t true. It would take me at least all summer to write a book, empty the house, and sell both, so I could (hopefully) be catapulted back into relative comfort. Not in New York, but somewhere less expensive.I imagined Duluth was affordable. Mom would never visit me there, but we hadn\u2019t done much visiting this past year anyway, apart from my three-\u00adday trip home for Christmas. She\u2019d dragged me to four yoga classes, three crowded juice bars, and a Nutcracker performance starring some kid I didn\u2019t know, like if we were alone for even a second, the topic of Dad would arise and we\u2019d burst into flames.All my life, my friends had been jealous of my relationship with her. How often and freely (or so I thought) we talked, how much fun we had together. Now our relationship was the world\u2019s least competitive game of phone tag.I\u2019d gone from having two loving parents and a live-\u00adin boyfriend to basically just having Shadi, my much-\u00adtoo-\u00adlong-\u00addistance best friend. The one blessing of moving from New York to North Bear Shores, Michigan, was that I was closer to her place in Chicago.\u201cFourth of July\u2019s too far off,\u201d I complained. \u201cYou\u2019re only three hours away.\u201d\u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t know how to drive.\u201d\u201cThen you should probably give that license back,\u201d I said.\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m waiting for it to expire. I\u2019m going to feel so free. I hate when people think I\u2019m able to drive just because, legally, I am.\u201dShadi was a terrible driver. She screamed whenever she turned left.\u201cBesides, you know how scheduling off is in the industry. I\u2019m lucky my boss said I could have Fourth of July. For all I know, he\u2019s expecting a blow job now.\u201d\u201cNo way. Blow jobs are for major holidays. What you\u2019ve got on your hands is a good old-\u00adfashioned foot job quid pro quo.\u201dI took another sip of gin, then turned from the end of the deck and nearly yelped. On the deck ten feet to the right of mine, the back of a head of curly brown hair peeked over a lawn chair. I silently prayed the man was asleep\u2014\u00adthat I wouldn\u2019t have to spend an entire summer next door to someone who\u2019d heard me shout good old-\u00adfashioned foot job.As if he\u2019d read my mind, he sat forward and grabbed the bottle of beer from his patio table, took a swig, and sat back.\u201cSo true. I won\u2019t even have to take my Crocs off,\u201d Shadi was saying. \u201cAnyway, I just got to work. But let me know if it\u2019s drugs or leather in the basement.\u201dI turned my back to the neighbor\u2019s deck. \u201cI\u2019m not going to check until you visit.\u201d\u201cRude,\u201d Shadi said.\u201cLeverage,\u201d I said. \u201cLove you.\u201d\u201cLove you more,\u201d she insisted and hung up.I turned to face the curly head, half waiting for him to acknowledge me, half debating whether I was obligated to introduce myself.I hadn\u2019t known any of my neighbors in New York well, but this was Michigan, and from Dad\u2019s stories about growing up in North Bear Shores, I fully expected to have to lend this man sugar at some point (note: must buy sugar).I cleared my throat and pasted on my attempt at a neighborly smile. The man sat forward for another swig of beer, and I called across the gap, \u201cSorry for disturbing you!\u201dHe waved one hand vaguely, then turned the page of whatever book was in his lap. \u201cWhat\u2019s disturbing about foot jobs as a form of currency?\u201d he drawled in a husky, bored voice.I grimaced as I searched for a reply\u2014\u00adany reply. Old January would have known what to say, but my mind was as blank as it was every time I opened Microsoft Word.Okay, so maybe I\u2019d become a bit of a hermit this past year. Maybe I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I\u2019d spent the last year doing, since it wasn\u2019t visiting Mom and it wasn\u2019t writing, and it wasn\u2019t charming the socks off my neighbors.\u201cAnyway,\u201d I called, \u201cI\u2019m living here now.\u201dAs if he\u2019d read my thoughts, he gave a disinterested wave and grumbled, \u201cLet me know if you need any sugar.\u201d But he managed to make it sound more like, Never speak to me again unless you notice my house is on fire, and even then, listen for sirens first.So much for Midwestern hospitality. At least in New York, our neighbors had brought us cookies when we moved in. (They\u2019d been gluten-\u00adfree and laced with LSD, but it was the thought that counted.)\u201cOr if you need directions to the nearest Sexual Fetish Depot,\u201d the Grump added.Heat flared through my cheeks, a flush of embarrassment and anger. The words were out before I could reconsider: \u201cI\u2019ll just wait for your car to pull out and follow.\u201d He laughed, a surprised, rough sound, but still didn\u2019t deign to face me.\u201cLovely to meet you,\u201d I added sharply, and turned to hurry back through the sliding glass doors to the safety of the house, where I would quite possibly have to hide all summer.\u201cLiar,\u201d I heard him grumble before I snapped the door shut.

        "description": "FROM THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF PEOPLE WE MEET ON VACATION AND BOOK LOVERS!A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast. They\u2019re polar opposites. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She\u2019ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he\u2019ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really. Read more",

                "reviewText": "I saw this book so many times on amazon before buying it, because it was on the 2nd place in goodreads choice awards 2020 in Romantic genre, and was so interested on reading it, i even started reading it on my birthday\u2019s eve, bc i went to a hotel to celebrate and all. I\u2019ve seen it a lot on bookstagram and it has so many good reviews. I could not help buying it.-Pros: A clear picture of the process of writting a book by a full-time writter, some quotes are phenomenal, the friendship between January and Shadi and how a true friend will go to rescue, inspiring to see how a person can accomplish a task/project that seems impossible or hard to finish, cope with problems, hope perspective on love matters, strong family boundaries.-Cons: The romance was too much of a clich\u00e9 for me, i can\u2019t simply enjoy neither believe player male characters who are relationship-phobes to keep falling for the main female character and completely change for them and fall in love almost begging them, idk, it feels like the same old story changing characters everytime, that inevitably and predictably keeps happening in most love stories. I could not connect with none of the personalities, i could not tolerate January that much, she had no special traits as to amaze me for her story and was way too selfish, like, the story could no conclude until she received \u201cexplanations\u201d of her father reassuring her he loved her in letters. I mean, he was a great father, he was there for her, there was no doubt he loved her, yet she stops talking to her mother, the victim, punishing her more just because she (January, the queen), was not aware of the situation happening between her parents. Totally unfair and selfish attitude, did not like at all, No human being is that perfect to give everything to their partner, sometimes that\u2019s why people are unfaithful, and that has nothing to do with the kids; i felt like the same line complaining of her father was rewinding all the story long. It was too predictable, no mistery to me, no surprise. I did no like the connection between January and Gus neither. Did not feel goose bumps when they had their moments.It was obvious they were falling in love since the first chapters. Two adults alone in a beach city, both single, spending weekends together, and flirting all the time, just because they said they weren\u2019t falling in love wasn\u2019t going to distract from the obvious, so it was very much predictable.I don\u2019t pretend to be hurtful, this is just my personal opinion. I don\u2019t think i\u2019ll read any other books by the author, idk if I\u2019m in a moment of my life where I\u2019m not much into romance, but i did not enjoy that much.",

De kaft was opnieuw geplooid en de pagina's verkreukeld. Ik koop geen boek van 13 euro om dat eentje te hebben wat in een slechtere staat is dan als ik het tweedehands zou kopen voor 4 euro.",

I was especially intoxicated by the descriptions of the people and floored by the plot twists!As a writer myself and having published a book - I usually avoid reading books of contemporary writers, lest I feel underwhelming and inferior to them and their work, but this is that one book which inspires me!Emily Henry is a top tier writer and I wish her the very best with all her books! The first I'll do now after posting this review is purchase a copy of another of her books!",
