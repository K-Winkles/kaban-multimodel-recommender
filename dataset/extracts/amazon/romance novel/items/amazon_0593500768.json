It reminded me a lot of \u201cThe Seven Year Slip\u201d, not plot wise, but because I was not expecting how much I enjoyed it. This was also my first football romance and first ballerina/dance-related romance books and I loved both themes. Does anyone know any other sports romance books with either football or dance as major themes? I\u2019d love to get my feet wet and explore more!\u2022Below are some of my favorite quotes:-\u201cWe want to know how you can be best friends with that god among men and not hit it. Ew, don\u2019t say hit it. My business with my friend is my own, not yours. But you love him, right?\u201d-\u201cEvery inch of me tingles with awareness, and I mentally begin mapping out every way she fits perfectly in my arms\u201d.-\u201cWe need to kiss, on the red carpet. I can\u2019t kiss you out there! OMG, our first kiss can\u2019t be in front of paparazzi! Do you want me to kiss you now? No absolutely not! Well, maybe, actually yes\u201d.-\u201cNot my man yet. Bree, he\u2019s been your man for years\u201d.",

It was a long time coming but by the end, I was pretty charmed.However, the miscommunication really drove me up the wall. I can do a little bit but this was extreme. This was drawn out and every time I thought they would get together, something happened or one of them refused to see what everyone else could see. Despite frustrations with parts of the book, there were more parts that made me laugh & made me swoon. I can\u2019t wait to read more by Sarah Adams!",

O grande problema? Essa desconhecida \u00e9 ningu\u00e9m menos que uma jornalista e no dia seguinte eles s\u00e3o a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o da internet e disso tudo surge uma proposta irrecus\u00e1vel que envolve contrato de namoro falso.No meio de toda essa confus\u00e3o Nathan v\u00ea sua grande chance de sair da friendzone e mudar o jogo a seu favor e o melhor, sem correr o risco de perder a amizade, afinal todos os toques ser\u00e3o pura encena\u00e7\u00e3o pra m\u00eddia, n\u00e9 !?Da\u00ed surge a grande id\u00e9ia dos 5 jogadores de futebol patetas de escreverem uma esp\u00e9cie de livro de t\u00e1ticas de conquistas. Posso afirmar que agora com certeza sei porque todos est\u00e3o solteiros.",

First, the P I N I N G, ooof the pining was so good friends and watching those idiots pine for each other made me wish I had a hot best friend of the male variety.Second, the banter. We all know (or maybe you don't) that I'm a woman of banter and when relationships have the right amount of it I just get suckered in. And these two had banter to spare while at the same time balancing that with a deep knowledge of each other that was just *chef\u2019s kiss*Third, dimples. That is it, that is the tweet. Dimples. Love them.Fourth, Nathan is too sexy for his own good and has a self-sacrificial heart of love that knows how to restrain itself for love and I dig that. I want that!So, if you haven't grabbed a copy for yourself you should really get on that and then grab yourself every other book Sarah has put out because they're just that good.",
