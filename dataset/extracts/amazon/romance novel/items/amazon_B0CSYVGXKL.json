                "reviewText": "A well-written western about two individuals who come from troubled pasts. Lily is a schoolteacher who has no family and few friends. She has a facial disfigurement that makes people look at her with disdain or avoid her altogether. She meets Tucker, a new cowboy in town, who also bears scars that are physical (that no one can see) and emotional (that makes trusting and getting close to others difficult). Tucker thinks Lily is beautiful, despite her scars. He loves the way she opens up with the children she is teaching and cares about their needs. Lily finds that she feels safe around Tucker and he has volunteered to help patch the old school house before winter sets in. As they spend more time together, they find that they enjoy each other's company. Unfortunately, neither know that their pasts are about to catch up with them and put them on a collision course to find out if the trust and love that's developing is strong enough to withstand horrible revelations and violence. This story is about friendship, love and trust. I definitely recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "Lily is a school teacher searching for a place to call home. Her family's response to her scars has added stress which contributes to other physical manifestations beyond her scars. She has left her family to begin her life anew. Much of the story is the glimmers of what might have transpired in her life that causes so much fear and strife for Lily. She is a sweet soul that treats others with such kindness. It takes a long time to learn all about her external scars.When Tucker comes to town, there is immediate attraction between them and a sense of sympathy since he has scars as well. Both are slow to share their full story and slow to trust anyone. As the story progresses, there are rumors that fly about Tucker which makes it even harder for Lily to trust but she never fully breaks her trust in him. Great story with a bit of twist concerning Lily and Tucker.",

Unnecessary descriptions to add page count.I did receive an ARC copy; but this is my honest opinion.Lots of pages, great price, just not worth Hours of melodrama.",
