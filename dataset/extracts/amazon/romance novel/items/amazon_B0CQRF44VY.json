                "reviewText": "Through the efforts of Veronica and Frederick\u2019s grandmothers, they are forced to marry to avoid a scandal. Frederick, carries guilt over the passing of his mother, and chooses to not love his wife, and to only conduct a marriage of convenience. Veronica is an effervescent, independent woman who is always a positive thinker, and is sad to learn of Frederick\u2019s choice of marriage. They find they each have a passion for painting, and similar dreams. Frederick spends a lot of his energy trying to remain unfeeling. At times, those were slow spots for me, but overall I enjoyed the story. This author is great at creating an engaging plot, and bringing flawed characters together to not only have a self-awakening, but find their HEA. I loved the grandmother characters, as they brought levity to the story. I remain a great fan of Harriet Caves. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",
