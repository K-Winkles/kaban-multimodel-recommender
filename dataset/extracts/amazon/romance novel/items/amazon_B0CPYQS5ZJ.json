                "reviewText": "Ethan is given an ultimatum marry or lose your fortune so he goes to the matchmaker Margarita who matches him with Ivy. Now Ivy has basically had a Cinderella life where her stepmother is mean and delegated her to being the cleaning lady and all around servant. Ivy does have a loving sister, Celia, who tries to stick up for her whenever she could. Ivy was under the impression that she was only going to the ball as a partner to Ethan and did not think it was an engagement, which it initially wasn\u2019t, as the two of them had a big disagreement upon first meeting each other. However circumstances forced them into actually setting a rather quick wedding date and so fate had stepped in to bring them together as a couple. Ethan did not have a nice childhood as his mother passed when he was little and his father became somewhat of a tyrant after her death so Ethan had never felt he was lovable and had never really wanted to be married. We then follow the story of them gradually opening up to each other so that a trickle of attraction slowly becomes a torrent as their love expands and grows. Of course we have a betrayal and forces that attempt to drive them apart but as in all love stories, true love is never denied.",
