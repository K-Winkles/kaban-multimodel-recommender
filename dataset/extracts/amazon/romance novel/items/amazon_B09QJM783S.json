                "reviewText": "Amelia is Rae Rose, pop star. She is finding she is not happy with her life, so she decides to take a vacation without telling anyone. Audrey Hepburn is her go-to movie star. She decides to go to Rome like Audrey did in Roman Holiday, but Italy is too far, so she goes to Rome, Kentucky. Her car breaks down on the outskirts of town. A man knocks on her window, but she will not unwind the window or get out of her car. He gets frustrated and walks back to his house where her car is parked on his front lawn. Noah, the man, decides it is too hot for her to stay in her car, so he asks Mabel, his grandmother's friend, to vouch for his good character. After talking to Mabel, Amelia gets out of the car and stays in Noah's extra room for the night, figuring she will get to the bed and breakfast in town the next morning. She finds it will take two weeks to fix her car, so Noah reluctantly offers his spare room. Both are attracted but know she will only temporarily be in town, so they make rules and build walls to keep from getting close. Will it work?I enjoyed this book. It was fun watching Amelia get under Noah's skin as she imitated him, discovered things about him, constantly chattering at him, and all the other little things she does. Noah's been burned by an ex-fianc\u00e9e. He does not trust easily. Even knowing she's only temporarily in his life, he still falls for her. Amelia also falls for Noah. She has been spoiled living the pop star life and knows little of how to take care of herself. But with Noah, she knows she is safe. I liked watching them set up their rules and walls and seeing them fall. I liked the vulnerability each brings to their relationship. Amelia learns a lot about herself while in Rome. She starts to find the joy of music again as well as the comfort of safe people in her life. Noah also learns about himself while trying not to fall in love.I loved the town and its people. A bunch of gossips who have good hearts and protect those they see as theirs. I loved Noah's sisters. Each was different in personality, but each backed the others, The characters were quirky. They were fun. They saw love when it hit their town.I look forward to reading more of this author's work.",

I could totally see this being made into a Hallmark Movie. The main characters, Amelia and Noah are the absolute cutest. I fell in love with them quickly. The writing in this book is well done. I caught myself smiling and giggling at the banter more than once.Amelia is a pop star that was so stressed out she ran away to hide before her tour. An absolute catastrophe of a day happens and she meets Noah, the grumpy Pie Shop owner in the extremely small town of Rome, Kentucky. Stuck in town for a bit, the town grows on Amelia. While I love the main characters, it was easy to love the side characters too. Annie was my favorite secondary character in the whole book.",

E como, com isso, aprendemos que descanso n\u00e3o \u00e9 luxo, precisamos ouvir nosso corpo, nossa mente. Adorei como a hist\u00f3ria se desenvolveu e acho que vai ressoar com quem tamb\u00e9m j\u00e1 passou por traumas que deixaram marcas no presente.",

                "reviewText": "Je ne pensais pas qu\u2019en reprenant la lecture en anglais avec When in Rome, je le lirai en moins de 24h mais qu\u2019en plus de \u00e7a c\u2019est \u00e9galement un \u00e9norme coup de coeur. Pour la petite histoire, je voulais lire Pratice makes perfect, mais j\u2019ai vue que c\u2019\u00e9tait la suite de When In Rome et pour moi il \u00e9tait inconcevable que je ne le lise pas.Me voil\u00e0 donc, \u00e0 lire When in Rome sans avoir d\u2019attente, sans quoi que se soit pour au final tomb\u00e9e sur un petit bonbon. C\u2019est dr\u00f4le, l\u00e9ger, doux, bienveillant. On rencontre deux personnages qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9 l\u2019un de l\u2019autre, lui ? Il tient un pie shop, elle ? Une super star de la musique. Deux mondes qui rentrent en collision. Le besoin d\u2019Amelia de fuir se monde \u00e9tait si puissant qu\u2019elle se retrouve \u00e0 Rome, Kentucky.Pourquoi ? Parce qu\u2019elle est fan d\u2019Audrey Hepburn mais partir en Italie en voiture c\u2019\u00e9tait compliqu\u00e9e. Elle se retrouve donc en panne, devant chez Noah Walker. Lui qui ne vit que pour sa famille, son commerce. Apr\u00e8s une d\u00e9ception amoureuse il ne veut plus attendre parler de tout \u00e7a, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait sans compter l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019Amelia devant chez lui. J\u2019ai accroch\u00e9e tr\u00e8s vite avec l\u2019histoire, les personnages, puis disons le, la trope smalltown elle d\u00e9gage quelque chose d\u2019incroyable. Le sexe est mentionn\u00e9, avec pudeur et parcimonie vous ne retrouvez pas de sc\u00e8ne de smut, mais soyons franc : \u00e7a fait du bien. Bref, c\u2019est un coup de coeur, j\u2019ai ador\u00e9e d\u00e9couvrir nos personnages et je vais lire la suite parce que\u2026 C\u2019est la petite soeur de Noah, avec le garde du corps d\u2019Amelia, (ceux qui me connaissent le savent : je suis en train de jubiler derri\u00e8re mon \u00e9cran en parlant de se prochain tome).",
