Since Samantha had only recently returned to her home town, after taking time off from the Detroit police department, it was unexpected when she and Sheriff Hunter were forced to team up and try to get answers to the strange activities in the county. Samantha\u2019s childhood crush on the older Hunter made their reunion so many years later all the sweeter.I look forward to finding out more about Hunter\u2019s sexy friends in the next books in the series.",

What a great debut to the Moving Violations series with captivating characters you want to root for and a fast-paced story that kept me entertained and intrigued from beginning to end and turning the pages as fast as I could to see what would happen. I was totally mesmerized by the nail-biting, heart-pounding suspense and skin-scorching intimacy. I loved the undeniable chemistry between Sheriff Hunter Steele and Samantha Ryder, a Detroit cop who returns to her hometown of Deerhaven, California after her aunt dies unexpectedly.This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted, suspenseful romance. I received an advance reader copy from the publisher via NetGalley and this is my voluntary review. I liked the book so much, I purchased a copy for my keeper library.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first book by both of these authors so I am not familiar with either of their writing styles so I was not sure what to expect.I think the overall storyline was well developed and plotted out well. As for the main characters I think that there could have been a little more of their past history given since childhood. It was very brief. In addition, it seemed to me that the two characters rushed into a romantic relationship a little two fast even though there was connection between them. That might have been what the authors wanted but seemed awkward to me at times.I really did enjoy the murder mystery crime aspect of the book that they added to this romance book from start to finish of the book that the reader gets to experience. I think that is something unique to this book that not alot of authors have in addition to the normal romance.I am definitely interested to see what the next book in this series has in store because there was alot that they had in this story it will be interesting to see what they will do to top it.",
