Joss Wood is great at painting a vivid image of a foreign city so her reader feels like they can visualize just where her characters are at the time. With Olivia and Bo, the chemistry is instant and forbidden. I loved seeing them let their guard down with each other and grow close. The plot was easy to follow, the pace was quick but thorough and the characters were really addictive.
