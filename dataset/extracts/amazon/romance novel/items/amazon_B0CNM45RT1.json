We have what is supposed to be an evil, beastly Laird most fear and a very spirited outspoken Lady that is an avid reader when most women were not. The Beast is Laird Keith O\u2019Neil, who lost his parents in a fire and was badly burned trying to save them. He wears a mask to cover his scars. He is hides a soft nature under his mask. Lady Maisie Lennox whose mother is pushing her to marry a man old enough to be her father. She doesn\u2019t want to wed period. But knows she will have too. She wants one last adventure before she must give up her life as she knows it. She wants to read a special book and is sure the Beastly Laird has it in his library. So, she plots and plans and sneaks into his castle to borrow it. Only once she has her book, is she caught by none other than the Laird himself. Oh, my these two are so much fun to watch. Both have secrets, longings, pride and together a lot of attraction. He is nothing like she thought, and he can\u2019t believe a Lady would go to so much trouble for a Book! The make a deal for thirty days to which will help him, with his council and she gets a Library all her own.! There is so much going on in this story. Lots of under currents speak of a danger just out of reach. His council and grandmother are pushing him to marry. There is deceit, treason and evil hidden within the castle walls. Lots of twists and turns before all is solved. There is a lot of emotion, feeling, passion and trust in this story. The ending may surprise you. A truly enjoyable read from start to finish. I love when she tells him \u201cYe will not touch me\u201d. So funny in the end. The title for this book is all wrong as neither of our couple is trapped. I received an ARC from the author and wish to thank her. This is my honest opinion and am freely giving it. Surely a story not to be missed.",

                "reviewText": "Keith O Neil was called the Beastly Laird. He had a mask covering half of his face. Scary rumors swirled about him. He was being pressured by his clan and his grandmother to marry and he wanted no part of it. He was given an ultimatum to find a wife in one month. His grandmother had invited a prospective bride to be and her father to come to the castle.Maisie Lennox was an avid reader. She was being pressured to marry a man who was 15 years older who wanted to marry to secure a male heir. She felt trapped and wanted to have some adventure in her life before she had to marry. She was interested in reading one certain book that she did not have. She thought the neighboring Laird would have it, so she disguised herself as a servant to make herself look inconspicuous. She went in the middle of the night, made it to the library, but it was dark. However she successfully found the book and was making her way out of the castle when she was spotted by a guard who chased her until she successfully ducked into a room to evade him.Unfortunately, it was Beastly Laird's room and she woke him. He surprised her, put a knife to her throat, wanted to know who she was, why she was there, and kept asking questions. He did not believe her story, but did believe her name. He released her, then asked her to show him what she was hiding in her skirts. She decided to come clean and took the book out. He was amused that she would break into his castle and only take a book. That's where she picked up her new nickname, \"Book thief.\" It lasted throughout the whole book!He told her she could keep the book and she was amazed. Then he said she could read any of his books she wanted and she was excited. She would only have to do one thing in return.....marry him.She was shocked. Then he said if she stayed in the castle for one month and pretended she was betrothed to him, he would GIVE her his whole library! Her answer was, \"Can I see the library first?\" They went to the library, he lit the candles, and she was so impressed she agreed to stay. She wanted to write to her brother to let him know where she was. He agreed.There was a lot of humor in the book, plus mystery, excitement and an enemy. I truly loved the book!",
