I'm not sure if what I want to share is a spoiler or not, so stop reading if you want to avoid those......Autumn's father was granted legal and medical power of attorney over her after she has a rough go of things. He goes as far as firing the doctor she's got a therapeutic rapport with and replacing her with a very unprofessional one who calls her an attention seeking jealous brat, in attempts to keep her under his control. At one point, Autumn is the victim of a pretty violent attempted rape.",
