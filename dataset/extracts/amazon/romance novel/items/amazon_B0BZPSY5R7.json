                "reviewText": "Vivienne Lorret begins a new series with this romance of a Duke (Magnus) who is roped into helping a spinster named Verity from getting into some serious hot water over a whopper of a lie that the 2 of them were engaged. This is a slow burn, possibly too much of a slow burn for some.There was quite a bit that I enjoyed about the story. There was pretty delightful banter between the hero and the heroine as these these 2 strangers navigate this odd plan to pretend to be engaged for a week. And the heroine, Verity, was not your obnoxiously self assured heroine. It was rather refreshing that we had a woman with heartfelt insecurity from being the studious and quiet member of a very energetic and outgoing family.But I'm not sure that I completely follow their reasoning for fake engagement. And it really didn't pick up for me until they got to London. And there was an introduction of a new subplot about the 80% point that made me confused.As it turns out the duke is very familiar with her family. He believes that her father was responsible for a swindle 7 years before that had contributed to his father's death. He spends a great deal of the story convinced that they're can't possibly be any redeeming characteristics of anyone connected to that family.Ms. Lorret does her usual fine job telling this story. Its overall a good read even though it is slightly burdened with \"first book in the series itis\" -- You know, that's where we are Introduced not only to the hero in heroine of this story but to heroes and heroines in training for future installments.Slow burn. No epilogue.",

                "reviewText": "This was my first Vivienne Lorret book and I found the storytelling to be engaging and the characters likable. Magnus Warring, the Duke of Longhurst was the perfect example of a stern brunch daddy. He is a grump to the extreme and when he becomes looped into a little white lie involving himself as the fianc\u00e9 to spinster Verity Hartley, the grouchiness comes out two fold. This is a case of forced interaction of opposites and the feuding between Verity and Magnus\u2019s families puts them even more at odds. Despite their dislike for one another, I found that I liked both of the MCs very much. Lorret does a great job of building tension between the two and this slowburn of a novel kept me entertained with the banter. Verity does not think of herself as the most desirable sister and her coping mechanism is her way with words, until they get her into trouble. She suffers from panic attacks and I loved the way they were represented. Magnus is a stickler for truth telling and loves to live on his high horse the moral ground, attempting to shame Verity for her engagement lie. Of course it doesn\u2019t work and he finds that he just can\u2019t seem to get her out of his head no matter what she does. My issue was with the pacing of storyline. Several times it felt like the character arc was reaching its peak and then the story would take a different turn. Although everything is wrapped up by the end of the book, there were a few storylines that seemed unnecessary and took away from the main relationship. I\u2019m not sure I 100% believed Verity\u2019s reasons for being angry with Magnus in the third act and I thought that their separation didn\u2019t help to bring the characters back together. I found myself slowing down at the end and think that the story could\u2019ve been wrapped up a bit sooner. Regardless, I will read more Vivienne Lorret for her character writing. I received an advanced copy from the publisher. All opinions are my own.3.5 \u2b50\ufe0f",

Fake engagement + enemies-to-lovers tropes.Our heroine Miss Verity Hartley tells a big fib when put on the spot by her arch nemesis.. that she\u2019s engaged to none other than a DUKE.. to Magnus Warring, the Duke of Longhurst. Unbeknownst to Verity, Magnus hears of the lie and sets out to put a stop to it before it ruins his chances of marrying an heiress. He\u2019s desperately in need of money to replenish the estate\u2019s finances after his father\u2019s big loss to a swindler. To Magmus, his family and the ton.. one of the swindlers was Verity Hartley\u2019s father, although he was never charged with the crime. I really enjoyed this regency HEA, the first book in a series that I plan on continuing. There\u2019s a lot going on in the storyline.. a new friendship blossoms between Verity and the heiress, Miss Anna Snow.. there\u2019s funny moments, a steamy romance, and several mysteries to solve.. who is Anna\u2019s secret penpal \u201cMr. Blossom,\u201d and who else was involved in the scheme causing the late Duke of Longhurst\u2019s financial loss and early death?This kept my attention peaked with various events taking off in different directions.. reading it in a day. I definitely recommend it! \u2765 4.5 stars \u2014 Pub. 11/28/23",
