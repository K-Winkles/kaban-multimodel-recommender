Unfortunately, due to their mothers disliking each other, they plot and manipulate the path of their children. I thought their husbands were both very weak and lacked spines. The drama generated by this author was the hero and heroine trying to work around their mothers, and attempting to determine what was the history behind their mothers\u2019 feud. Her creative plot building focused on unshakable judgmental beliefs, and uncompromising assumptions. The self-serving needs of the mothers seemed to be the primary focus of the story, never considering their child\u2019 happiness, as they were forcing them to each marry another. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Just when they finally reconnect again they are faced with the two mother\u2019s schemes to keep them separated. Eventually in the end they find their hea. It was a sweet and clean story I personally feel both Gregory and Gillian\u2019s fathers were two very cowardly men who both could have verbally and literally put a stop the spiteful domineering women\u2019s plans long before things spiraled out of control and to the point that both Gillian and Gregory were forced into a betrothal to the wrong people. Not a very brave hero at all",

Gregory had gone away for a while and during that time Gillian had been accused of misbehaving. She was innocent but her name was published and she was ruined. She went to live with the uncle's family in the country. When Gregory returned he had hoped to meet Gillian again but was disappointed to find she had left London. He decided to travel to his estate but his carriage broke down near an orphanage and he was amazed to see Gillian with the children. Gregory and Gillian were delighted to meet up again and rekindled their relationship but their mothers were set against them. I felt really sorry for Gregory and Gillian. Why should an old argument prevent Gregory and Gillian finding happiness and force them into marriages with someone they do not love? Their mothers were determined to force them apart. Would Gregory be able to fight against Gillian's motherand his own? Would Gillian's father be able to stand up for Gillian? Read on and enjoy.",
