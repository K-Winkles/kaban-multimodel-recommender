But the storyline was predictable and I foretold the ending.Does anyone read the book before it is classified under romance and humor? Maybe the reviews for this book got attached to the wrong book",

Three years later she is still shaken, not because she missed her fianc\u00e9, but because the event left her doubting her own ability to make competent life decisions. I so identified with the way a little encouragement at her workplace catapulted her to reveal the inspired and creative talent that she had always surpressed. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this story.....Lily\u2019s character was vulnerable and had me cheering for a happy conclusion. Beautiful story, well written and memorable.",

Genuinely laugh out loud in places and filled with wry observations about life and love, I found this tale about one woman's quest to push beyond her 'safe' zone to help save a struggling regional paper an uplifting antidote for stressful times. I think most people will relate to the central message that sometimes you have to face your fears if you want to get what you really need and, whilst romantic comedy is not everyone's cup of tea, I found the warmth and gentle tone throughout made a revitalising tonic one cold, dark weekend.",
