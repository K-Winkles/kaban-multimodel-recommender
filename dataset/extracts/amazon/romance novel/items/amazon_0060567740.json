                "reviewText": "Most baseball fans with an interest in the game's history will remember that for the first 70 years of the twentieth century, the nation's capitol was represented by two American League clubs known as the Washington Senators. (Their moments of glory were few. The famous cry was: \"Washington. First in War, First in Peace and Last in the American League.) But what about the third Senators franchise, born in 1989? You don't remember them? That's because, sadly, they only existed in the imagination of Jane Leavy and between the covers of this book.\"Squeeze Play\" is a wild, bawdy, funny, true-to-life account of life in a big league clubhouse and in the sports department of a daily newspaper. Leavy, a former sportswriter and more recently the biographer of Sandy Koufax, draws on her own experiences, a passionate love of the game and a wild imagination to create one of the most entertaining baseball novels I've ever read.I suppose I should add a cautionary note: \"Squeeze Play\" is not for the prudish. Sex and crude behavior are often on display (just as they are in the real world.) The book is told in the form of a diary of the Senators' first season, as chronicled by Leavy's alter-ego, A.B. Berkowitz. Berkowitz, who grew up worshipping Yankee Joey Proud (a fictional re-creation of Mickey Mantle) is about to find out if her love of the game will withstand close daily exposure to it...in particular, as practiced by this group of has-beens and never-weres. The team starts out the season challenging the record for most losses to begin a campaign and comes to the wire shadowing the 1962 Mets for the title of worst team of the modern era.But this book is about a lot more than wins and losses on the field. Leavy has a lot to say about life, love, friendship, moral values and all the things that really matter....and she does it with an abundance of wit, style and humor.--William C. Hall",

                "reviewText": "Jane Leavy clearly knows her baseball (see her thoughtful bio of Sandy Koufax) and, although this is written as a novel, I have no doubt that it is very real, especially it's raunchy locker-room scenes. Leavy is a former sports beat writer and clearly that informs her knowledge of what goes on off the field in the big leagues. I am not sure that the novel will appeal to non-baseball fans but, if you're a big fan like me, I loved the inside baseball stuff. It's not for anyone shocked by various 4, 6, 8 and 12 letter words or graphic descriptions of how the male anatomy can be paraded in the presence of female sportswriters but the author's ear for dialogue is acute and, oh yes, it's funny as hell.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. A quarter of the way through I commented that it was the baseball equivalent of the classic Dan Jenkins football novel, Semi-Tough. By the end, I concluded that it was even funnier than Semi-Tough. I had tears in my eyes I was laughing so hard at the raucous and often raunchy lunancy of major league baseball depicted by Jane Leavy, which was clearly based upon her experiences as a sportswriter. It is a definite must-read from the same author who brought us the classic biographies on Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle, but trust me, Squeeze Play is a lot more fun.",

                "reviewText": "Sophomoric, salacious, scatological, stereotypical, sacrilegious, stale and snobbish.After reading the author\u2019s \u201cA Lefty\u2019s Legacy\u201d, I had high hopes for \u201cSqueeze Play\u201d. Alas, my hopes were dashed, partly because the author seems to have gone to the Howard Stern School of novel writing. After the text of the novel, the author includes an \u201cAuthor\u2019s Note\u201d, which amounts to a kind of apologia for the novel. In this apologia, the author condescendingly criticizes George Herbert Walker Bush for not understanding that the \u201cwhole point\u201d of the novel is to disgust and appall. Yet, if to disgust and appall is really the whole point of the novel, then it is a failure. To be sure, the novel does often disgust and appall, but it also bores. There is a lack of restraint that soon produces numbness rather than shock or disgust. There is a lack of focus that produces sympathy for filth, instead of revulsion. Indeed, the only thing that the author\u2019s alter-ego, A.B. Berkowitz, seems consistently disgusted by is anything remotely connected to Christianity. Throughout the book, Berkowitz vents her spleen with sweeping generalizations about the failings of \u201cmost accomplished preachers\u201d and how \u201cthe entire Christian community\u201d is against her. Virtually every Christian character in the novel is an unnuanced caricature. This disgust results in a lack of balance and close observation. We have King James versions where Saint Joseph versions should be and crucifixes appearing where they wouldn\u2019t be in real life. We have stereotypes, instead of authenticity. In addition, the best parts of the book sound way too much like what I\u2019ve read from Jim Bouton or Roger Angell. At one of these points, the narrator tells us \u201cThese guys are so bad, they can\u2019t even be original about it.\u201d I could say the same thing about many parts of this book.",
