I'm not a holiday person nor do i celebrate x-mas, but I picked up this book as an impulse buy because I saw it was both body positive and a little bit kinky. I immidiately looked up the author for validation and after it checked all my boxes I ordered it as a spicey, fun thing for me and my husband to do to unwind together. I love the pov and enjoy the variety in it. I LOVE the blatant and flagrant cussing, it makes me feel like an adult while giggling like a child. And I love that it reflects a lot of the reality of being a plus sized person while being utterly fantastical. I have never read a book like this before and now im going to buy them all. This woman is doing gods work out here.XOXOXOXO",

It\u2019s a novella so ofc it came with the instalove one expects, but it felt right. Intense from the jump. The boys were sweet and the fact that the size inclusion in this book wasn\u2019t limited to the fmc was just \u2728chef\u2019s kiss\u2728.We love a fluffy Daddy.On that note, I also love that while fmc\u2019s struggles with fatphobia were acknowledged, they weren\u2019t the focus of her arc. I\u2019ve noticed that usually when the fmc is plus sized, fatphobia is either not acknowledged or it\u2019s her whole personality. So it was nice to see a larger body normalized while also acknowledging (without sensationalizing) the social issues that come with it.Okay, I\u2019m off the soapbox.This book had some of the best spice I\u2019ve read in a long time. It did read a bit like a Kink Bingo sometimes, but I\u2019m honestly not even mad about it.I\u2019ll definitely be picking this author up again and I can\u2019t wait to get my paws on some of their longer stuff.",

But it was exactly what my cold heart needed to lighten up for Christmas \ud83d\udc95Had been in a \"reading slump\" the last few I read just were not really my thing or I struggled to get through them... I had seen tons and TONS of recs to read this one and boy am I glad I did! It's short but not lacking and it's sweet. I love the dynamic types of characters and though there isn't much it I didn't feel like it was just ridiculous. I thought it was really well written and plot was interwoven in it very nicely. Character backgrounds were just enough without being too much, there was some drama, but nothing bad and a great happy ending. I really love the relationships that developed between the characters and felt like the dynamic was exactly what was needed and I'm a sucker for a bad boy who is sweet to his girl (and guy). Yes PLEASE.For the spice, was it absolutely filth? No, it was a lot but I didn't think it was real farfetched kink at all. Again well written and that makes a heck of a difference.",

But on top of all that goodness the FMC is a plus size girl that\u2019s not always so convenient. I think we can all relate to the low confidence at some time or another. Where a lot of authors make plus size girls In their books sound unrealistic this author points out all the \u201cflaws\u201dbut has the men loving her more for those. I absolutely love how this author made this body positive but in the best way. Pointing out all the insecurities and showing her grow in her confidence and having these drool worthy men help her get there. Quick read and definitely recommend!",

If you\u2019re looking for excellent spice, then this is the book for you! It was a quick read. We don\u2019t dive into much plot, but honestly, I didn\u2019t need it in this book. It had extra-hot men and had me needing a glass of cold water at the end. Leo is the guy who has been living in this brother\u2019s shadow for quite some time, so when the beautiful and bubbly Riley confuses him with his hot-shot brother, he doesn\u2019t correct her. They aren\u2019t able to fly due to weather, so Leo invites Riley back to his penthouse for some fun. She decides to let loose and says yes and goes with Leo back to his penthouse. Leo wants to give her a night she\u2019ll never forget, so he enlists his best friend/love of his life to help give her all that she needs. Jace is ready and willing to rock Riley\u2019s world, so the three of them engage in one of the hottest nights of their lives. Of course, things don\u2019t always go as planned, so when Riley finds out the truth about Leo in the morning, she is hurt beyond belief. She never expected such a strong connection with two strangers, and Leo and Jace can\u2019t help but feel that Riley is the missing piece in their lives. Great read!",
