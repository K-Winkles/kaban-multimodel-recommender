        "description": "A Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Amazon Charts bestseller.From #1 New York Times bestselling phenomenon Sylvia Day comes a hotly anticipated and passionate new love story.Once, I would never have imagined myself here. But I\u2019m settled now. In a place I love, in a home I renovated, spending time with new friends I adore, and working a job that fulfills me. I am reconciling the past and laying the groundwork for the future.Then Garrett Frost moves in next door.He\u2019s obstinate and too bold, a raging force of nature that disrupts the careful order of my life. I recognize the ghosts that haunt him, the torment driving him. Garrett would be risky in any form, but wounded, he\u2019s far more dangerous. I fear I\u2019m too fragile for the storm raging inside him, too delicate to withstand the pain that buffets him. But he\u2019s too determined\u2026and too tempting.And sometimes hope soars above even the iciest desolation.Emotional and heartrending, Butterfly in Frost marks a brilliant return by global sensation Sylvia Day, the #1 international multimillion bestselling author of the Crossfire saga.",

I had to go back and read the part at the fountain again because I thought she was having an episode, since her grief and depression hadn\u2019t been addressed. I\u2019m the beginning I thought Garrett\u2019s coming over and jumping at her was too much like Gideon and Eva, but now knowing the back story it has a whole other new take on how everything progressed and it didn\u2019t seem as rushed. Why Garrett didn\u2019t want to leave and go to the exhibit in New York without Teagan made so much more sense at the end when he said she was the most important thing in his life and he didn\u2019t want to mess it up this time. I thought Garrett was being presumptive when he said they would hang the painting in their bedroom, above their bed when they hadn\u2019t been together all that long. That they both found their way back to each other after losing so much and going through so much pain was so endearing, moving, and heartbreaking. I really appreciated the measure that the author included their struggle with mental health in the book. It was refreshing and it makes makes the reader realize this can effect anyone, it points out the fact that Teagan wasn\u2019t opening up about her grief because she felt she couldn\u2019t. Mental health seems to be swept under the rug and not brought up enough in romance; it was touching the author circled their whole story around it and made it so the story didn\u2019t suffer for it.",

But after reading it I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I think it's partially because I was expecting another love story the one in the Crossfire series. The other reason was that although I can usually sniff out any whodunit's or secret spoilers pretty early on in most books, i really didn't get what was happening until the very end. As soon as I finished I read the book all the way through again to look for clues that I missed the first time. Anyway, although it's no Crossfire, I decided I did enjoy it. And I'm determined that in the future I'll try to be more open minded. It's not fair for me to expect every book that an author writes to be a carbon copy of their last one.",

I love the twist and conclusion but wish there was more detail before the end. I guess one could argue that the story is a beginning and the details of the past aren't really important. I appreciate the focus of moving forward. Maybe I just wasn't ready to let go of Garrett and Teagan. I loved the story and the characters.",
