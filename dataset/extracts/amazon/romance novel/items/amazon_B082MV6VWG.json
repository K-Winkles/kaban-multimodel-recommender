One day they were out and Celia was rubbing her leg but what Zoe asked her about it she said it was her arthritis acting up. One day Zoe came home from work and Celia's little dog who was never away from Celia was in the window pawing at the window so Zoe knew something was wrong. She tried the door but it was locked. When she finally found the spare key she found Celia on the floor uncousious. She was trying to get the remote control when she fell. Zoe called an ambulance and when they got her to the hospital and checked her out she had a fractured hip and a broken arm. She was in a coma for awhile. Zoe didn't know who was her next of kin was. She called her friends Grandmother and she said to look in Celia address book for someone named Shawn. When Zoe found his number he had no idea who Celia was or why she listed him as her next of kin. It turned out he was Celia's grandson who didn't even know about Celia. When Celia was young she was going to marry a young man who was killed and she never got to tell him she was pregnant. After she had the baby she fell into a depression and couldn't take care of her so being her cousin and her husband wanted children but couldn't have them Celia gave her the child to raise as her own. The only stimulation was that Celia not have any contact with the child until the child was of age but although Celia tried, and the cousin to explain to the girl why Celia had to give her up the girl never forgave her and that's why Shawn didn't know Celia. Zoe and Shawn got to know each other when he flew up from South Carolina for Celia. Eventually they had to go through her bills and found out Celia hadn't paid taxes on the property in years. When they mentioned it to Celia she said she didn't have the money. So instead of Celia losing the property Zoe came up with a plan with her brothers help to buy the property and fix it up . Only she wanted her friends to be partners with her and Celia's grandson Shawn to do the carpenter work.",

I know in reality many people use foul language on a daily basis and many authors feel they have to include it to make the writing realistic, but I do not use it and I do not like to read it. So I am happy I found this book. I hope other books by Ms. Ellis will follow the same pattern of interesting stories, people who love and care for each other, and no foul language or lurid sex scenes.Thank you Ms. Ellis!!!",

It tells you about friendship, working and juggling parenthood, working life and so much more. There is even a budding romance with a handsome man. I can't wait to read the second one. It shows that taking a leap of faith can sometimes change you life, no matter how scary it first seems. Well done Nicole Ellis on a truly lovely story. It gives me hope.",
