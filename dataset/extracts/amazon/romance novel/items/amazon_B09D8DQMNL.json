        "description": "Welcome to the gorgeous little Scottish village of Christmas, where snow is falling, presents are being wrapped and the locals are writing their festive wish lists. Will this finally be the year that Belle\u2019s dreams come true?Thirty-year-old Belle Albany is feeling lonely this Christmas. Another whole year has passed and her life is\u2026 exactly the same as it was last December. She longs for true love and a little bit of winter magic \u2013 but she\u2019s almost given up on finding it in the sleepy Scottish community where she lives\u2026When Belle crashes into elderly Edina on her cherry red bicycle, it\u2019s not the meet-cute she\u2019d been hoping for. But she immediately recognises the lost look in Edina\u2019s watery-blue eyes and resolves to organise a Christmas to remember for them both \u2013 brimming with mince pies, mulled wine and lots of sparkle. Although Belle hadn\u2019t counted on Edina\u2019s home being a crumbling Scottish castle and she certainly hadn\u2019t been expecting Edina\u2019s handsome long-lost grandson Jack Hamilton-Kirk to turn up on the doorstep in the middle of a snow storm\u2026Jack is arrogant, rude and bossy and Belle is convinced he\u2019s about to ruin the seasonal cheer she has worked hard to create. He\u2019s basically the Grinch in human form, so why does her heart race every time they\u2019re in the same room? They disagree on almost everything, from menu choices to music, and yet she starts to glimpse a softer side hidden behind Jack\u2019s clipped words and brooding countenance.As they hunt down costumes for the annual nativity show and save a donkey from a snowy disaster, Belle can\u2019t ignore their growing attraction. But will a secret from Jack\u2019s past come between them? Or will this finally be the year Belle falls in love?This gorgeous, festive read is like a warm hug in a book!

The characters were likeable, and the story was good enough to keep the reader engaged. For those complaining about the one 'romantic' scene, we're adults here and that is what adults do. There's so much more in the story to focus on.Note: One page in the book came out during reading, no other pages were affected/missing",

I'm a huge fan of Donna Ashcroft and her books never let you down.I love that she brings in characters from your favourite books and the way her romances unfold.This book is a slow burn, enemies to lovers + grumpy xsunshine trope. Perfect.I read this as an arc e format and will definitely buy the physical book when it's available.Kerry Kennedy Author",
