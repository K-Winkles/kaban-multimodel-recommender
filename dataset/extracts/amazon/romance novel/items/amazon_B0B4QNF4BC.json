Ero was so out of touch with the era she was in and Dr. Annie Golden was in her own little world because she literally lived in her research lab and office. Both are a perfect for for each other. I was disappointed how it ended. I didn't expect it to end at Annie 's dad Christmas dinner. Though it didn't change my opinion of this story. I definitely recommend this story to everyone that loves romance even if it is between a vampire and a human. I hope there is a book 2.",

Ero is over 2000 years old but she has definitely not kept up with times as she is very separated from her food or you know us humans. All told in a comical fashion from how she preys and how she fumbles through meeting the one human that changes her everything. Some spice that flows well with the story and their connection. Definitely a fun read!",

As a hematologist, Annie is enthralled by Ero, but she can't get her out of her mind and begins to feel so much more for the mysterious vampire.This was a fun and light short paranormal romance read. Ero is a very old vampire, and sometimes doesn't get the nuances of the modern world. Thus leading to some funny situations. Nines being my favorite of those! Annie is a sweetheart, and just the right person to get Ero's heart beating again. Ero was sometimes hard to connect to in her point of view, and I would have loved if it was all from Annie's point of view to keep the mystery around Ero. But I totally get the attraction! Such steamy scenes.",

                "reviewText": "Like many people, there have been times where I have been fascinated by Vampire novels, an example being \u201cInterview with a Vampire.\u201d I not only read the book I have also seen the movie several times starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. This is why when I saw this 147-page paperback book (Just my type: A lesbian Vampire Romance by Lucy Bexley and Bryce Oakley) on Amazon I decided to purchase it. For some reason I originally thought this was a graphic novel, but it is not; nevertheless, I was happy with the quick delivery service.Since I do like the strange and unusual at times, I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this Lesbian Vampire romance story. Ero has been a vampire for 2000 years and has just moved to Sorrow, Massachusetts. Little did she know she would meet Dr. Annie Golden who is a researcher investigating a rare blood disease.Their sexual attraction to each other becomes intense and if you are into Vampire and lesbian novels you will enjoy this book. I found it to be a fun read.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions).",
