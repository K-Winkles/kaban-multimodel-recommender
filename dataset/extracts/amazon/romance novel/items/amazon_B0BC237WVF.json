This is a dual narrative told by Zaxton and Aurelia.Zaxton a broken CEO Fashion Mogul Boss who is the definition of a broody grump. Unable to let go of his past eight years later. He is damaged upon repair. So he thought!Aurelia an inspiring fashion designer ex model. Just trying to rebuild what was stolen from her while maintaining a positiveattitude.Both characters were everything I could have hoped for and more. Their chemistry, past and connection while throwing in their banter will leave you wanting more. The mouth on them both was so perfect and made it so much more entertaining. Both MCs damaged in their own way wanting to write each others wrongs.There were some awe moments, a lot of giggles, A LOT of SPICE.The way Zax was able to find love again after losing the love of his life eight years ago was so beautiful to read. Uhhhh and when he confessed his darkest secret to Aurelia made me heart jump into my throat.After basically being abandoned at the age of 16 by her \u201cmother\u201d and black listed by someone she trusted, seeing her gain a family was incredible.The end of the book pulled at my heart strings! They both got everything they ever wanted and was an amazing ending of the book.Now for the best and most important part!!! The SPICE!! My god! Was it juicy! I mean the hotel (Zax hotel, suite) scene and every spicy scene after that live forever in the back (maybe the front) of my mind!I 1000000000/10 recommend this amazing read!",

                "reviewText": "Irresistibly Broken is my introduction to J. Saman's writing. I kept seeing this book on social media, and the cover drew me in.Zaxton Monroe, Bass; Greyson Monroe, frontman, played in a band called Central Square, along with Callen Barrows, drums; Asher Reyes, guitar, and Lenox Moore, piano and keyboards; their manager was Suzie Moore, Lenox's twin sister, and Zaxton's girlfriend until she died in the shower. The Boston band members went in different directions. Callen Barrows became a doctor; Asher Reyes is a quarterback for the NFL. Greyson stayed in the music business as a solo artist, and Zaxton took over his father Elias's business. Lenox retreated to Maine.Aurilia Whitlock was the stepsister to the Monroe brothers when her mother married their father; the marriage didn't last very long. Aurilia was approached by a talent manager regarding modeling when she was only sixteen, and her mother thought this was an excellent opportunity to leave her daughter on her own, so Aurilia became model Lia Sage. Aurilia saved money and enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Technology, FIT, where she studied to become a fashion designer. However, she was blackballed by another designer who stole her design. Now, she was looking for any position in the fashion industry.I was cheering for Aurilia to succeed and get the guy. And after reading the second epilogue, I need to read Greyson's story. Way to go and win fans over by giving them a peek at the next book in the series.",

She is determined, gorgeous, talented and loving. I instantly fell in love with her. She is trying to make a mark in the world. Zax is my new book boyfriend. He is hard, smart, rich and hot. He is a man with few but but mean them. These two broken souls found love in unexpected way but I love it for them. The writing was truly amazing and I love the flows of things. This is my first time reading from the two authors so I can't really tell their work from apart which is good in my book. I love it. Amazing work J. Saman and Julie Saman!\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e",

                "reviewText": "So well written. An unusual enemies to lovers story involving Jason Monroe, former band bass player turned fashion mogul, and his ex-stepsister and fashion model, Aurelia. The tale includes a bit of industrial espionage as evil ousted father attempts to reclaim his former CEO position using the multi-talented Aurelia as a pawn in his game, never realizing what a strong and resourceful survivor she is. Mix in humor involving his former band mate friends and one has an entertaining story to enjoy. Not overdone on angst and stupid miscommunication issues.",

The parent\u2019s divorce and they lose touch. He has left the band and is head of a high fashion design company (cause his dad got kicked out for sexual misconduct). She also went into high fashion but got blackballed because the owner of the house she designed for stole her design and objected to her objecting. With that background, the story starts with her day 1 at his company being mugged as he arrives. It is a very fun read without a whole lot of credibility for his former band or the fashion industry. It is worth it to set those credibilities aside and enjoy the story.",

Both were so broken and cautious but blindsided by the other with feelings they didn't expect or want! Thank you J. Saman. I loved the first book in this series! On to the next one!",

Whatever the reason, I finally read Irresistably Yours and now I'm going to have to binge read the whole series so I can find out all the rest of Central Square's stories!I loved the chemistry Zax and Aurelia had right from the outset and although it was a slow burn before they finally succumbed to their need for one another, there was still plenty of heat. And once they caved? Phew (fans herself!) I enjoyed the characters around them too. Zax and Aurelia's friends were the kind everyone needs - there to tease and have fun with, but always there with support when required. Without wishing to spoil anything, I also enjoyed the element of suspense about what Zax's father was up to and the conclusion of this element of the story was more than satisfying.I'm looking forward to reading Greyson's story next and seeing more of the other band members.",
