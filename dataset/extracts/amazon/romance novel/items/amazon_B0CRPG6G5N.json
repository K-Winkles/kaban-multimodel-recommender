                "reviewText": "This is an engaging story involving two different characters deciding to start new lives in Redemption Spring. Sarah moves into a ranch given to her by her aunt, and discovers James and his ranch is her neighbor. Through their attempts to make a successful living on their land, they become aware of unethical happenings occurring among other ranchers and townspeople. As they develop their relationship, they realize they need to work together to battle all those trying to control the town and their livelihoods. As the drama builds, villains become more devious to reach their final goal. Will Sarah and James lose their ranches? Or will they find redemption? The author creates endearing characters, an original plot, and drama-driven scenes keeping the reader engaged. Greed, murder, and betrayals keep the story interesting, and the underlying heartwarming romance keeps it up lifting. Great story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",
