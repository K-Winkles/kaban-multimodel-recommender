First Del is \ud83e\udd24, a stalker with tattoos and a \ud83c\udf46 piercing. Yes please.Once I started I could not put this down. Mariah has not one but two stalkers?! I loved the whole stranger photography session as those always looked interesting to me. I loved how Lauren was able to use it in her book and then turn it around to be a possessive stalker romance.Del gives Mariah all her fantasies and I am here for it. You will definitely want to read this quick spicy book.",
