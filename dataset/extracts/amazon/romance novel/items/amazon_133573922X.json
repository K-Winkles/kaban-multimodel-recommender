On a yachting trip, the H fell overboard and 10 months later the h found him about to marry another woman. The H has amnesia and doesn\u2019t remember any parts of his life. He is attracted to his wife and wants to build a relationship but the h is hiding their true relationship. The H gets his memories back and she leaves him because of his nasty behavior. They were able to find their way back to each other. My only complaint is no epilogue.",
