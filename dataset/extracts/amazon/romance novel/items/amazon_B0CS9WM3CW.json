                "reviewText": "This romance involves two appealing characters, a well-defined plot filled with drama, mystery, personal demons, and a steamy romance. Both characters lacked interest in relationships, though one only yearned for love, whereas the other did not believe in love. Fate and a dramatic first encounter brings them together, while others try desperately to win them for themselves. This is another wonderful written story by this author. She continues to pull you in from the first page, keeping your interest and with her beautiful writing allowing the reader to become involved with the characters and scenes. I really enjoyed the ending with its surprise drama. A great read all historical romance fans would enjoy. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

The characters are rich, well developed with a nice plot of getting over one disappointment and finding the right partner. Levi, one of the secondary characters is also great. What holds me back from a 5 is the length of the book. I really struggle with stories that go on and on as they become repetitive and gap fillers. That is my own personal opinion and yet I would encourage you to take a chance and make your own determination based on all the other positives.",

                "reviewText": "What an engaging story ! So many plots snd twists. Levi was jilted at the altar and his Ex tarnished his image badly. He swore he will never love until he met his best friend\u2019s sister. She is so different from the ladies of the ton and so selfless.. Alice goal is to help Levi clear his name from the scandal and love him despite he can\u2019t return her feelings.Highly recommended",

                "reviewText": "A nice story with a good plot and likable characters, a few steamy love scenes, some twists and a bit of suspense, but too long in my opinion, 250-300 pages would have been enough. And I think the title is rather misleading. Levi is more of a cinnamon roll hero and definitely not a Duke of Sin. He is innocently accused of deeds he didn\u2019t commit, and he is not a rake.Alice\u2018s brother Isaac is a nice side character and I hope he will get his own story.After being jilted by his fianc\u00e9e at the altar, Duke Levi falls into a melancholy. Once again he is betrayed by someone close to him. At the hunting party of his friend Isaac he meets his sister Alice and is immediately attracted by her. She is the only person who can soothe the turmoil in his soul and treats him like a man, not a duke.Alice is compassionate, forward and honest. She plans to become an artist and remain unmarried, but she is fascinated by her brother\u2018s friend Levi at the hunting party. She too is instantly attracted to him and realising that he suffers, she wants to help him heal.They quickly become friends and the passion between them flares up, but they first have to convince themselves and the other of their own feelings and overcome a few obstacles before they find a happy ending.For all readers who like books by the author, brooding heroes and strong heroines.",
