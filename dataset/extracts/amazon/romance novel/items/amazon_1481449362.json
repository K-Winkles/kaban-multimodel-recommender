                "reviewText": "What are the pernicious effects of rape to the human psyche and to the human soul? After being raped by someone she thought was a friend, Eden\u2019s identity completely disintegrates. She is no longer the way she used to be. She can never be that dorky clarinet playing girl again. The rape stole her innocence. This is a gripping story of a young girl\u2019s plunge into the depths of darkness and despair then the eventual rising out of the ashes like the Phoenix. The rape evaporates her sense of worth and Eden engages in risky sexual behavior-sleeping with anyone and everyone without regards to the consequences . The rape makes her hostile to her friends and family. Her anger erupts consistently. She self sabotages her first true love. And she bottles up all her trauma never revealing the haunting events to anyone. Eden\u2019s silence on the rape mirrors what happens to thousands of rape victims. Eden doesn\u2019t report the sexual assault because of fear of reprisal, the overwhelming shame and the possibility that people might not believe her. This is very common with sexual assault victims. Eden\u2019s story speaks true to many sexual assault victims\u2019 stories. The imperative need to report sexual assault is something parents typically don\u2019t talk about to their kids. Mist parents are too afraid to talk about the birds and the bees to their kids. So if parents aren\u2019t going to warn their kids then I think every young adult could benefit by reading this cautionary tale.",

                "reviewText": "Eden wasn\u2019t a perfect victim. And because of this, her story gives a voice to so many women still blaming themselves. So many women who look back and wonder if the noise of society saying, well what were you wearing, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone, holds any merit?It gives victims permission to share their stories. Even though it was years ago, even though you had a crush on him before the incident, even though he\u2019s well liked by your community, even though you\u2019ve developed undesirable coping mechanisms.I saw Eden as a child crying out desperately for help, and even her most trusted person couldn\u2019t see it and treated her poorly first.I will say, there are some tropes and that\u2019s why this wasn\u2019t five stars for me, but I felt that the love interest was written in appropriately and realistically for someone who\u2019s experienced trauma. It would\u2019ve bothered me a lot if they lived happily ever after. But that\u2019s the thing about trauma; it\u2019s invasive. It stops you in your tracks when you\u2019re trying to live out your life. It shows it\u2019s ugly head when you\u2019re trying to experience the beauties of life like falling in love.People who criticize victims like Eden are part of the problem and miss the point completely. My heart hurt for those that Eden was hurting, I think this brings up an important space to talk about how there needs to be room for survivors to get help and have their voices heard even if you go to the police you often will not get justice. Because when they\u2019re made to make themselves small and hold it in to make everyone comfortable, the consequences are disastrous on an entire community.This book was an important one. I had a hard time getting immersed at first but a few chapters in and I couldn\u2019t put it down. I\u2019m glad I read this.",

Eden's story is one of loss and lonelyness and a broken individual after trama. It is her story of overcoming. Though it may take time you have to be patient and ever supporting.",

From the time 5 minutes of violence shake up her life, we follow Eden down a rabbit hole of denial and self blame. It is all too real. An amazing and compelling read about how one event can impact your life and how you can come back from it.",
