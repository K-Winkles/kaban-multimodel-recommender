        "description": "A riveting new novel from Danielle Steel, whose countless number-one New York Times best sellers have made her one of America's favorite storytellers. Heads always turned when Rose McCarthy walked into a room. Nearly six feet tall, she was ramrod straight, and impeccably put together with faultless style, long graceful legs, her snow-white hair cut in a chin-length rounded cap. Her piercing blue eyes missed nothing. She could terrify anyone with a few well-chosen, soft-spoken, eloquent words, or comfort and delight a young employee with generous praise. For 25 years, she had been the legendary editor in chief of Mode magazine. Gentle, polite, supremely competent, she ran it with an iron hand, with the ultimate grace and discretion. She was known for her excellent judgment, wise decisions that always benefitted the magazine, her dedication and love of fashion.... Read more",

Danielle Steel always makes us stop and think as we read about the emotions and situations of life that she weaves seamlessly into her characters and in THE AFFAIR, we're faced with more than one person's perspective when a torrid affair is revealed that tears a family apart at the seams and leaves emotions boiling over.New York magazine maven Rose McCarthy is blindsided when the latest topic of gossip on a potential cover model brings to light the affair her son-in-law is dragging her youngest daughter through in Paris. She and her other three daughters quickly rally around to love and support Nadia through the whirlwind her life has become.Nadia is hearing advice from every direction but all she can really feel right now is devastation as the man that she loves with all of her heart tells her he's torn between still loving her and his addiction to the young starlet currently carrying his child. She has two small children who adore their father and she doesn't know how to break their hearts ... or if she even should.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a drama filled read with lots of emotional upheavals and several supporting characters that lend volume to the overall story.",

                "reviewText": "First off I'm 54 years old and a avid reader and this was my very first Danielle Steel book , I don't know how that happened but it's the truth .So I was excited to give her a try after seeing her on GMA and her and Robin Roberts discussing the read . I really liked the book but I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It's a personal opinion but I just couldn't relate to two of the sisters and spouses outcome. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say too much. I'll just say that two important characters and their spouses had a big hurdle to overcome or not and I was enjoying this storyline and telling until the end .The ending was like a Disney movie but it didn't go with the seriousness of the beginning and middle of this well written book. I really think it's more of a personal experience but I wouldn't have excepted and ended this book with the Disney theme ending. Especially when you find out it wasn't the first time for the one spouse .I really liked the family dynamics and the the story it was just the ending that left me feeling not pleasantly surprised but unpleasantly disappointed in the characters behavior and his pass .Overall 3.75 star read .I will definitely try Ms .Steel again though for sure .",
