                "reviewText": "Ava Harrison takes us back to the dark side in Sinful Crown, a Mafia romance. Harrison grabs your attention in the opening sentences and doesn't let you go until the very last moment. This decadent walk in her mafia world is just perfect. Gideon Byrne is at the top of his world. A hard-nosed businessman, feared drug lord, he isn't a man to cross. He reluctantly grants a man's dying wish to protect his sister, and comes to find more trouble than he bargained for. Sasha Lennox is a young woman used to disappointment. Her older brother is a drug addict and not above stealing her meager savings. Learning of his death sends her reeling. Meeting Gabriel Byrne knocks her out of orbit. Gideon is obsessed with Sarah, and kidnaps her to thwart a death threat brought on by the actions of her brother. Sarah just wants to go home, and she's not afraid to let Gideon know exactly what she thinks of him, his kidnapping of her, and his less than savory business practices. It's a race against an unknown threat and Sarah finally finding a way to escape. Their love story is steamy, and filled with twists and turns. We've come to expect nothing less from Ava Harrison, and she delivers. This Mafia world is one we've visited before, and characters from others books make an appearance. I just want to say, Mafia-Men group texts are a thing, and not to be missed. Que up some Yo-Yo Ma or Hauser cello pieces, and settle back to enjoy Sinful Crown. You'll never find classical cello boring again.",

                "reviewText": "This story was full of twists and turns, lies and betrayal but it was oh so good, as only Ava Harrison can do. This is the story of Gideon Byrne and Sasha Lennox. We know that Gideon took over after Tobias stepped down to be with his wife. This was another successful story of a wealthy man who is good and bad. Gideon gets the women but he had to save her from the Russian Mafia but wait until you find out the twist in the plot. I enjoyed this book \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcd6 very much. I would highly recommend this Ava Harrison book, but then I would highly recommend any of her books.",

Who am I to say anything.I just had issues with holes in the story and a lack of realty and chemistry.I definitely did NOT feel their love when they started flinging the L word around. I thought Sasha was stupid when going back to her apt in the end. Gideon \"teaching\" Sasha to shoot a gun was ridiculous. \"Shoot at this and aim\" but no ear protection? This alone would freak a virgin to shooting out. Not to mention, the author made no mention of it. Just shooting along at targets, yet not once was...\"ouch, I have ringing in my ears!\"...brought up. Because you would! What happened to the Russian that helped Sasha? What exactly did Gideon do? Drug dealer? He was always working but nothing explained. What's that Elysian deal we never heard about after he met the main seller? Just so many loose ends. At about 75% of the book, I started to trudge along slowly. I had a very hard time finishing the book.",

Sasha is a hard worker trying to save as much money as she can and is working up the courage to apply to Julliard even though she\u2019s afraid to play in front of an audience. When Gideon first sees Sasha he\u2019s not expecting her beauty and can\u2019t keep her out of his mind. They have a chemistry that can\u2019t be denied, but he has to earn her trust. This story has a bit of everything, banter among friends, suspense, romance, danger, and love.",

                "reviewText": "A remarkably gripping, entertaining and passionate book. Gideon and Sasha are highly engaging, alluring and interesting characters with an enticing, intriguing and captivating storyline. From the very first chapter I was all in! This mafia romance has danger, suspense and drama. The chemistry between Gideon and Sasha is intense and breathtaking. Even if Gideon is a criminal he has many redeeming qualities and his devotion to Sasha is just beautiful. I enjoyed Sasha\u2019s character because of her sassiness and strength , also it was delightful to see how Gideon never expected that she\u2019d be everything he ever needed.Congratulations Ava this book is PHENOMENAL\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "Did I read this because of the Narrator (Jacob Morgan)? Yes, and I regret nothing!Gideon, the MMC, gives all the possessive \"touch her, and I'll end you\" vibes, and I was so here for it! His dry humor and thoughts were even better through Jacob Morgan's performance. I freaking loved being in his head!While Sasha started as a more timid, quiet girl, she quickly showed her feisty side. She knew something felt fishy and didn't let her attraction overrule her common sense. I appreciated her giving as much back as she got.I loved how slowly their relationship developed, and the tension between these two was great. I also LOVED that Gideon called her \u201cfirefly\u201d. I have a weakness for unique pet names, and this hit that sweet spot where it didn't feel weird or too basic.While the beginning captured me right away, the last third of the story started to drag on a little. But I'm happy with how everything ended.Overall, I really enjoyed Sinful Crown and can only recommend the audiobook. (Jacob Morgan is the best. You're so missing out if you haven't listened to an audiobook narrated by him yet.)Definitely not my last Ava Harrison book!\ud83d\uddc2Genre: Contemporary Romance\ud83d\udcd5Type: Standalone\ud83c\udff7Tropes:- Mafi\u00e0- Age gap- F\u00f6rced proximity- P\u00f6ssessive MMC- \"Even just try touching her and I'll end you\"- \"I need to know everything about her\"- \"Her words are only for me\"\ud83d\udcd6Audiobook: 1st person dual POV, and narration (Jacob Morgan & Stella Hunter) ++++++",
