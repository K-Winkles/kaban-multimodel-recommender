                "reviewText": "This was definitely not a romance book as I had initially expected. Did it have romance? Yes, but that wasn\u2019t the premise. Savvy went through a horrible breakup with Jason, whose actions throughout the book were so predictable. Typical man. Sees his ex is doing better, looking better, and feeling better, and he wants to weasel his way back in and mess it up.To cope with the breakup, Savvy makes a revenge list to show Jason what he was missing, though she quickly realized that that\u2019s not really what she wants to do. I hated that she wanted to try to show him what he was missing.Through this process, she takes up yoga, tennis, and cooking classes, and she meets Spencer, who initially she thinks is homeless, but ends up being her contractor. I loved how she occupied her time doing things she loved, and even got a promotion she wanted, but the requirements didn\u2019t mesh with her new life. She stood up to her mother and finally figured out what makes her happy, what makes her feel good. And cute Teddy loved him some Sheldon.Now, one thing that irked me was that Jason just kept showing up EVERYWHERE like a stalker.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m so here for it. Savannah was a girl living for everyone except herself. A people pleaser who loves to cook and loves her family to boot. When Jason, her boyfriend of six years dumps her, Savvy has to find her own purpose and path. Luckily for Savvy she has an awesome girlfriend squad to give her support, encouragement and some reality checks.I love that this book wasn\u2019t just about Savvy finding romance and love with a man, but finding love for herself and her career. She had to get right with herself and address those insecurities that made her settle and try to do what everyone else wanted instead of her own dreams.The writing in this book was very descriptive and visceral. Most of the food Savvy cooked had detailed recipes. I would have preferred the recipes to be in the back of the as opposed to actually listed in the midst of the story. But clearly this author enjoys culinary things. This audiobook was a winner.If you want a book about a curvy girl winning in the end, this is it!",

Her name suits her to a tee.McCoy\u2019s writing is smart and colorful, filled with humor and emotion.The sex scenes are detailed enough to make you blush but don\u2019t dominate the book. This is a great story of love, friendship and female empowerment. Oh, and really good food. Seriously. I need some recipes!In short, Savvy rocks!!",

Savvy is overworked, stressed out and in a terrible relationship. She gets out of the terrible relationship by force and decides to finally pay attention to herself. Score one for Savannah.The depiction of friendship was great and Savvy\u2019s journey to finding the things that make her happy was nice but there was just so much focus on her tennis lessons, cooking classes and yoga. Pages of descriptions that could have been paragraphs.This was a personal irritant of mine, but I really got tired of the nicknames. I\u2019m sure people do this but it didn\u2019t work for me. Pages and pages of Mags, Savs, Savvy, Maggie, Joanie, choke me. Maybe a Californian trait, I can\u2019t say.Finally, there\u2019s barely a romantic subplot in this book. You meet her new beau immediately and they don\u2019t really interact again until 60% of the way through. Then it\u2019s nothing until near the end.Road trip, airport approved reading.",
