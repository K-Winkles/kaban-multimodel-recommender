        "description": "From the author of The Longest Ride and The Return comes a novel about the enduring legacy of first love, and the decisions that haunt us forever. The year 1996 was the one that changed everything for Maggie Dawes. Sent away at 16 to live with an aunt she barely knew in Ocracoke, a remote village on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, she could think only of the friends and family she left behind...until she met Bryce Trickett, one of the few teenagers on the island. Handsome, genuine, and newly admitted to West Point, Bryce showed her how much there was to love about the wind-swept beach town - and introduced her to photography, a passion that would define the rest of her life. By 2019, Maggie is a renowned travel photographer. She splits her time between running a successful gallery in New York and photographing remote locations around the world. But this year she is unexpectedly grounded over Christmas, struggling to come to terms with a sobering medical diagnosis. Increasingly dependent on a young assistant, she finds herself becoming close to him. As they count down the last days of the season together, she begins to tell him the story of another Christmas, decades earlier - and the love that set her on a course she never could have imagined.Nicholas Sparks recently curated a \u201cChapter and Verse\u201d playlist for Pandora.

                "reviewText": "The Wish, Nicholas Sparks, 01/26/23Nicholas Sparks is one of my absolute favorite authors. He always delivers, with each book better than the last. The Wish was thought-provoking and pulled on my heart strings. From the beginning, I felt like I was right there with each character, feeling their emotions and rooting for their happiness and successes.Like Jodi Picoult, Sparks addresses societal concerns of the day. In this complex novel, he addresses teen pregnancy, coming of age, first loves, wartime heartache, as well as death and dying. In his way, he is educating us and encouraging us to become part of the answers in the world around us.It\u2019s 1996. Maggie was a fifteen-year-old pregnant teenager. Her parents were old school Catholics and were of the mind to send her away to deal with the pregnancy. She was sent to live with an aunt she barely knew in an isolated location in North Carolina. An adoption was arranged, and since Maggie was Catholic, abortion was not an option. To avoid any socially related stigma, Maggie was to remain in isolation until \u201cit was taken care of.\u201d Maggie was depressed as she no longer had contact with her friends or family. She also felt unloved by her parents.Maggie\u2019s depression lifted after meeting Bryce Trickett, one of the few teenagers on the island. As she was to be home-schooled, Bryce became her tutor. Bryce also introduced Maggie to photography. She was a natural and this new love would become the building block to her future.As Bryce and Maggie spent time together, they fell deeply in love. She felt safe with Bryce as he had proven to be a handsome, gentle, compassionate, non-judgmental young man. He was well-read and on his way to West Point in the fall. Could they realistically share a life together? Accepting the possible roadblocks, they made a vow to return on Maggie\u2019s 24th birthday to the beach where they first met. They also promised to send yearly Christmas cards to one another.2019. Maggie has become a well-known photographer. She traveled the world to capture pictures of the most diverse and beautiful wonders that nature had to offer. Additionally, she opened a gallery with another artist in New York. The gallery was wildly successful, attracting artesian collectors from all over the world.This year, Maggie had to slow down due to a life-threatening illness. She relied heavily on her staff in her absences, especially a new young man that she had recently hired. Mark quickly became a very good friend, and they spent the Christmas holiday together. At Mark\u2019s insistence, Maggie shared her memories of Ocracoke, the place that taught her how to love and find her dream.The characters were so well defined that they become part of your heart. The reason that Nicholas Sparks books continually get made into movies is because they appeal to everyone as real and compelling stories. I have read every one of his books, at least once. I enjoyed reading \u201cThe Wish,\u201d and look forward to his next novel. I wholeheartedly recommend his books to anyone who likes to read a relatable story that touches the heart while also taking you on a journey to explore the social issues around you. Put together, his books can change the way look at the world and how you treat those around you.This is a voluntary review, and all comments and opinions are entirely my own.",

We all make choices in these situations, then we spend the rest our lives questioning the \u201cwhat if I had done this differently.\u201d There were difficult years, but the fact I was able to raise my baby, get beyond the difficulty of being so young with so much responsibility, and ultimately able to become successful in a different, but rewarding way than portrayed by Maggie in this book. So definitely a great read for me!!",

It took you to places , where you think to yourself what would I have done if I had been in Maggie shoes. The story pulled you in bit by bit and made you want to learn more to what happened to Maggie and Bryce . The twist in the end was so heart breaking , I cried that she had found Mark and given back her childhood bear . Loved it",
