She lives with him, her two young sons, and their cats in a little town in England called Wolverhampton. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. December 21 Laurie It\u2019s a wonder everyone who uses public transport in winter doesn\u2019t keel over and die of germ overload. In the last ten minutes I\u2019ve been coughed on and sneezed at, and if the woman in front of me shakes her dandruff my way again, I might just douse her with the dregs of the lukewarm coffee that I\u2019m no longer able to drink because it\u2019s full of her scalp.I\u2019m so tired I could sleep right here on the top deck of this swaying, rammed-full bus. Thank God I\u2019ve \ufb01nally \ufb01nished work for Christmas, because I don\u2019t think my brain or my body could withstand even one more shift behind that awful hotel reception desk. It might be festooned with garlands and pretty lights on the customer side, but step behind the curtain and it\u2019s a soulless hellhole. I\u2019m practically asleep, even when I\u2019m awake. I\u2019m loosely planning to hibernate until next year once I get home to the nostalgic familiarity of my parents\u2019 house tomorrow. There\u2019s something soothingly time warp-ish about leaving London for an interlude of sedate Midlands village life in my childhood bedroom, even if not all of my childhood memories are happy ones. Even the closest of families have their tragedies, and it\u2019s fair to say that ours came early and cut deep. I won\u2019t dwell though, because Christmas should be a time of hope and love and, most appealing of all at this very moment, sleep. Sleep, punctuated by bouts of competitive eating with my brother, Daryl, and his girlfriend, Anna, and the whole gamut of cheesy Christmas movies. Because how could you ever be too tired to watch some hapless guy stand out in the cold and hold up signs silently declaring to his best friend\u2019s wife that his wasted heart will always love her? Though\u2014is that romance? I\u2019m not so sure. I mean, it kind of is, in a schmaltzy way, but it\u2019s also being the shittiest friend on the planet.I\u2019ve given up worrying about the germs in here because I\u2019ve undoubtedly ingested enough to kill me if they\u2019re going to, so I lean my forehead against the steamy window and watch Camden High Street slide by in a glitter of Christmas lights and bright, foggy shop windows selling everything from leather jackets to tacky London souvenirs. It\u2019s barely four in the afternoon, yet already it\u2019s dusk over London; I don\u2019t think it got properly light at all today.My re\ufb02ection tells me that I should probably pull the tacky halo of tinsel from my hair that my cow of a manager made me wear, because I look like I\u2019m trying out for Angel Gabriel in a primary school nativity, but I \ufb01nd that I really can\u2019t be bothered. No one else on this bus could care less; not the damp, anoraked man next to me taking up more than his half of the seat as he dozes over yesterday\u2019s paper, nor the bunch of schoolkids shouting across each other on the back seats and certainly not dandruff woman in front of me with her \ufb02ashing snow\ufb02ake earrings. The irony of her jewelry choice is not lost on me; if I were more of a bitch I might tap her on the shoulder to advise her that she\u2019s drawing attention to the skin blizzard she\u2019s depositing with every shake of her head. I\u2019m not a bitch though; or maybe I\u2019m just a quiet one inside my own head. Isn\u2019t everyone?Jesus, how many more stops is this bus going to make? I\u2019m still a couple of miles from my \ufb02at and already it\u2019s fuller than a cattle truck on market day.Come on, I think. Move. Take me home. Though home is going to be a pretty depressing place now that my \ufb02atmate, Sarah, has gone back to her parents\u2019. Only one more day and then I\u2019ll be out of here too, I remind myself.The bus shudders to a halt at the end of the street and I watch as down below a stream of people jostle to get off at the same time as others try to push their way on. It\u2019s as if they think it\u2019s one of those competitions to see how many people can \ufb01t into one small space. There\u2019s a guy perched on one of the fold-down seats in the bus shelter. This can\u2019t be his bus, because he\u2019s engrossed in the hardback book in his hands. I notice him because he seems oblivious to the pushing and shoving happening right in front of him, like one of those fancy special effects at the movies where someone is completely still and the world kaleidoscopes around them, slightly out of focus. I can\u2019t see his face, just the top of his sandy hair, cut slightly long and given to a wave when it grows, I should imagine. He\u2019s bundled into a navy woolen pea coat and a scarf that looks like someone might have knitted it for him. It\u2019s kitsch and unexpected against the coolness of the rest of his attire\u2014dark skinny jeans and boots\u2014and his concentration is completely held by his book. I squint, trying to duck my head to see what he\u2019s reading, wiping the steamed-up window with my coat sleeve to get a better look. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the movement of my arm across the glass or the \ufb02ickering lights of dandruff- woman\u2019s earrings that snag in his peripheral vision, but he lifts his head and blinks a few times as he focuses his attention on my window. On me. We stare straight at each other and I can\u2019t look away. I feel my lips move as if I\u2019m going to say something, God knows what, and all of a sudden and out of nowhere I need to get off this bus. I\u2019m gripped by the overwhelming urge to go outside, to get to him. But I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t move a muscle, because I know there isn\u2019t a chance in hell that I can get past anorak man beside me and push through the packed bus before it pulls away. So I make the split-second decision to stay rooted to the spot and try to convey to him to get on board using just the hot, desperate longing in my eyes. He\u2019s not \ufb01lm-star good-looking or classically perfect, but there is an air of preppy disheveledness and an earnest, \u201cwho me?\u201d charm about him that captivates me. I can\u2019t quite make out the color of his eyes from here. Green, I\u2019d say, or blue maybe? And here\u2019s the thing. Call it wishful thinking, but I\u2019m sure I see the same thunderbolt hit him too; as if an invisible fork of lightning has inexplicably joined us together. Recognition; naked, electric shock in his rounded eyes. He does something close to an incredulous double take, the kind of thing you might do when you coincidentally spot your oldest and best friend who you haven\u2019t seen for ages and you can\u2019t actually believe they\u2019re there. It\u2019s a look of Hello you, and Oh my God, it\u2019s you, and I can\u2019t believe how good it is to see you, all in one. His eyes dart toward the dwindling queue still waiting to board and then back up to me, and it\u2019s as if I can hear the thoughts racing through his head. He\u2019s wondering if it\u2019d be crazy to get on the bus, what he\u2019d say if we weren\u2019t separated by the glass and the hordes, if he\u2019d feel foolish taking the stairs two at a time to get to me. No, I try to relay back. No, you wouldn\u2019t feel foolish. I wouldn\u2019t let you. Just get on the bloody bus, will you! He\u2019s staring right at me, and then a slow smile creeps across his generous mouth, as if he can\u2019t hold it in. And then I\u2019m smiling back, giddy almost. I can\u2019t help it either. Please get on the bus. He snaps, making a sudden decision, slamming his book closed and shoving it down in the rucksack between his ankles. He\u2019s walking forward now, and I hold my breath and press my palm \ufb02at against the glass, urging him to hurry even as I hear the sickly hiss of the doors closing and the lurch of the handbrake being released. No! No! Oh God, don\u2019t you dare drive away from this stop! It\u2019s Christmas! I want to yell, even as the bus pulls out into the traffic and gathers pace, and outside he is breathless standing in the road, watching us leave. I see defeat turn out the light in his eyes, and because it\u2019s Christmas and because I\u2019ve just fallen hopelessly in love with a stranger at a bus stop, I blow him a forlorn kiss and lay my forehead against the glass, watching him until he\u2019s out of sight. Then I realize. Shit. Why didn\u2019t I take a leaf out of shitty friend\u2019s book and write something down to hold up against the window? I could have done that. I could even have written my cell phone number in the condensation. I could have opened the tiny quarter-pane and yelled my name and address or something. I can think of any number of things I could and should have done, yet at the time none of them occurred to me because I simply couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him. For onlookers, it must have been an Oscar-worthy sixty-second silent movie. From now on, if anyone asks me if I\u2019ve ever fallen in love at \ufb01rst sight, I shall say yes, for one glorious minute on December 21, 2008. Read more"

I could see how someone might get so incredibly frustrated with it but I can also see how someone would completely understand the why behind this love story. I can absolutely bet money that we've all had some version of this story in our own life at some point. Love is crazy like that. This was a great read but didn't give me that 5 star feeling unfortunately. But still, really good. I laughed, I cried. It was gut wrenching at points. But it felt real. If that makes sense.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Loved it! (SPOILERS)",
                "reviewText": "OK. OK. I admit...I actually liked this book. I liked it a lot.Before I start, here's a warning...SPOILERS GALORE AHEAD!A classic tale of love at first sight that took years, actual years, to resolve. We've seen this story, we've read about it, whether in real life, or in books, or in movies. I was very wary about getting this book or reading it, I didn't want the frustration of wanting two characters to end up together for the WHOLE. FREAKING. BOOK.But...this wasn't like that. I mean, sure, there was frustration. But it's not that bad. For many reasons.1. The 'love at first sight' part was kind of silly, and although Laurie spends a good while searching for this random stranger at the bus stop, he remains just that - a stranger. So when she does actually get introduced to him eventually, as her best friend's boyfriend no less, it's frustrating, but not THAT frustrating, because hey! You don't actually know this guy, OK? And to Laurie and Jack's benefit, they both realize that as well, and deal with it.2. You actually can't help but love Sarah (the best friend). And you want what's best for her. And you really like her relationship with Jack, and so you can't be that frustrated, because they work.3. Jack and Laurie's evolving friendship is endearing, and although you can tell there are underlying romantic connotations there, it's still a really sweet friendship.That being said, ten years is a really long time for someone to be in love with someone else. Ten years is a really long time and people change. I really enjoyed the whole first section of the book, when Sarah and Laurie were flatmates, and all the ups and downs and evolution of friendships and relationships.The second section, when Laurie leaves England was also very interesting, and I really liked seeing Laurie separated from Sarah and Jack. Finding herself, relying on herself, and really discovering her own identity separate from these 2 individuals who have shaped her life and character for so long.The third section, when she's back, was rocky, but needed I guess. Seeing the changes in Sarah and Jack, the shift in their relationship, seeing Laurie happy in her own relationship, it was all very realistic.Then came Jack's accident, and that part was...dramatic? I don't know, I wasn't a huge fan. Did Jack need more reason to be a jerk? He was already acting like one prior to his accident. It also seemed to go on for a while, and I kind of just wanted to get on with the story.Then there was Laurie's wedding...and the big revelation the night before when Sarah discovers, well, pretty much everything. Another super dramatic event that wasn't necessary. Personally, I didn't see any reason for Sarah to ever find out about Jack being the bus boy. Also, there was absolutely no reason for her to ever find out about the kiss that happened a hundred years ago. And also, she had no right to get THAT upset about all of it because she wasn't with Jack anymore, and at that point, hadn't been with him for a while! So to miss your best friend's wedding, the best friend who just gave you her dead sister's bracelet, is a HORRIBLE thing to do and is inexcusable.The ending, with the whole radio thing, and the letter, and all that cute stuff. I mean, God, FINALLY. I really, truly enjoyed this story. Not because it was the best story, and not because it was out of this world fantastic and different, but I think the main reason I really enjoyed this story is because I genuinely liked all the characters in this book. Every single one of them. So good on you Josie!",

I found the story took some unanticipated turns which kept me coming back for more. The characters were very believable and not the \u201cperfect\u201d people I\u2019ve seen in some well known romance movies. Novels are a subjective thing so my review is a personal one obviously, but that said I highly recommend this book. Just make sure you make a few meals ahead of time <G>.",
