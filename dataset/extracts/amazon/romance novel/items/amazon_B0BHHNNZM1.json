        "description": "When Miles goes camping with his best friend, Beckett, there\u2019s just one problem: Miles forgot his sleeping bag.The simple solution would be to share with Beckett, but Beckett hates skin-contact. Even the prospect of sharing a tent with Miles makes Beckett flustered and he dismisses the idea immediately. Which is fine. Miles can respect the boundaries of their friendship.But their camping trip turns out to be full of surprises. Beckett\u2019s been hiding a few secrets from Miles, one of which is that he doesn\u2019t always hate skin-contact, not in certain situations, not with certain people. But the biggest surprise of all will come when Miles realises just how he feels about his best friend Beckett.A Tent for Two is a 27,000 word MM new adult romance novella featuring the friends-to-lovers trope.Note: contains explicit tent sex & an extremely oblivious main character.

It felt like the author had an idea for a scene and then just sort of stretched that idea into 8 or so chapters and called it done. For me a Novella should still have all the things a full length book has just obviously on a much small scale, things happen a lot quicker as well because of this.I just can\u2019t say I really enjoyed it and I won\u2019t remember anything about it in a few hours.Also I\u2019m pretty sure Australians call flip flops thongs? I think if you\u2019re going to set a book in a country you should use the language they would use\u2026. I don\u2019t know it felt Americanised.

The characters are fully fleshed out despite the limited space for description and we even grow invested in side characters we NEVER MEET. That's how great the writing is! Definitely going to read more from this author, I reckon we've found ourselves another one click buy. 5 stars :)",
