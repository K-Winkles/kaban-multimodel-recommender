                "reviewText": "Sisters Nora, Emma, Isobel and Lydia flee from their home when Geoffrey, their cousin and Laird, imprisons one to blackmail the other. Lost, tired and cold, they stumble onto a castle where they ask Hunter, the Laird of Mac Ross Castle, for sanctuary. He agrees on one condition. One of the sisters will have to agree to marry him. The table is set for conflict, drama and retribution. There is a black cloud that hangs over most of this story, and if you read the prequel (which I suggest you do), you will understand why. That, along with Geoffrey\u2019s power-driven insanity, sets the stage for an emotionally charged tale where the reader is constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. You will find some humor and a few steamy moments sprinkled in to lighten the atmosphere, and in the end, love develops and brightness prevails. This is one of those stories that draws you in right from the beginning. The characters are varied and believable. They include a deranged villain, a damaged laird, four very different sisters, and a loyal sidekick who is also Hunter\u2019s man-in-arms. There are horrors that will break your heart and your stomach may be tied in knots, but you will keep reading because this is just one of those books that you simply cannot put down.",
