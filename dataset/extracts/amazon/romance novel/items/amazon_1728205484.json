Reading this reminded me of how we grow from adolescent to young adults making bad choices. Or making decisions based on our emotions. We haven't experienced life to make good decisions. Yes I saw the ending coming the very first chapter displayed the accident with Finny not staying in the car. This is how the author captured my attention by leaving a cliff hanger at each chapter. Can an eleven year old fall in love? Or is it their hormones changing? The ending also has a cliff hanger for a second book perhaps.",

Years wasted, when there could have been something. I can't get over how two best friends couldn't say the words to each other. I really liked the characters and could see how people drift apart when we grow into adults.The last paragraph left you hanging. If you spent that much time reading the story, how could the author not write an epilogue?",

I felt as if every little detail that was made in this book was rushed, but in a smart way. Like the main characters \u201cnovel\u201d that she spent DAYS writing, it was sort of foreshadowing to the point that the end was predictable to me. And there were times that I had to put this book down, not to cry, but because I had second hand embarrassment for the main character\ud83d\ude02. There were a lot, and I mean A LOT of \u201cwtf\u201d moments. Anywho, I was so disappointed because the last 30 pages were probably the best and exciting pages in the book, but a rushed ending. If you are looking for a good cry, I recommend \u201cAll your perfects\u201d Colleen hoover. :)",

                "reviewText": "The miscommunication in this book was something else. I hated it and I loved it! The real eye opening part was how we all have our own version of events and we never really see the same things. I loved everything about this book except Jamie. Hated his guts and I\u2019m so so glad he never ended up with autumn. Hated Sasha to how could she do that her best friend. I loved autumn and finny and my poor heart was broken by the end of this book. I wanted her to be with him and when it was happening I was cheering from the rooftops. The last page of this book tho had me screaming. How could it end just like that! I immediately brought both books in paper back and I can\u2019t wait to read book 2. This book was everything I never knew I needed to read. I hope future readers feel the same too",
