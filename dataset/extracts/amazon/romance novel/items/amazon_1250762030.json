However, I do think the story carries on too long without actually telling of the accident or what really happens at the party. It's such a big question of what happened and it doesn't get explained until the end. By then, it's not such a big need for the stories plot. I don't like that Sam's friends blame the female lead, although grieving people do tend to blame someone. This book does tell about the struggle of grieving and letting go of lost ones, which is something most people experience at one point in their life.",

The only reason this isn\u2019t 5 stars is I thought it was bs that Sam had only been gone like 2 weeks, and everyone (including Sam himself), was acting like Julie should have been handling it better and moving on. She was with him for 3 years. It takes way longer than 2 weeks to grieve someone you love. It would take months for most people. I didn\u2019t like that it seemed to be the expectation put on her, and that Julie was even starting to say how she should have been there for others regardless. Like no girl, you need to allow yourself that time. I didn\u2019t agree with that dynamic, it seemed so unrealistic to me.",

It's worth the hard cover.But skipping to the storyline: please don't read it in public if you've a soft heart cuz from the page 1 until the end you'll be crying your eyes out, trust me. Even though it's a sad story, you still able to find comfort and feel love. I really rlly rlly recommend this book if u like me enjoy a good romance but not so cliche... plus ASIAN REPRESENTATIVE!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Hoping for the author to writte more.",
