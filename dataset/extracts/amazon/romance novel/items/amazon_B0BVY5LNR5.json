                "reviewText": "Terrific start to a new series, with a gripping mystery and a second chance romance. The story opens as Hannah, a forensic psychologist, is working with a small boy whose mother was murdered. Complicating matters, the dead woman once accused Hannah's high school boyfriend of rape, sending him to prison. Jed has since been exonerated and is back on the island but is once again a prime suspect.I liked that Hannah never believed Jed was guilty, but her sheriff father disapproved of their relationship and did everything possible to break them up. Things are a bit tense between Hannah and Jed when they first meet again, thanks to confusion about letters never received. When a second single mother is murdered, Jed gets a request from his friend, the woman's brother, to investigate. Because Jed has a private investigator's license, he doesn't have to play by the same rules as law enforcement. This includes inviting Hannah to work with him on the investigation.The suspense of this story had me hooked from the beginning. I felt Jed and Hannah's frustration as their initial leads seemed to hit dead ends. They didn't let that stop them, and before long, they started to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated clues. One lead sent them to a deserted house that had been the site of a horrific murder-suicide. Their belief in its importance was confirmed when someone tried to kill them. I was glued to the pages as they closed in on the identity of the killer. The final confrontation was a nail-biter with a reveal that I never expected.I enjoyed seeing the rekindling of the relationship between Hannah and Jed. They have a few trust issues to overcome in the beginning, not the least of which is her father's role in Jed's conviction. But Hannah's unwavering belief in Jed's innocence goes a long way toward solving that problem. Working together brings them closer, and the old sparks of attraction quickly reignite. I loved Jed's protectiveness when Hannah was targeted. I also liked that no last-minute misunderstanding drove them apart, just Jed rescuing her from a killer. I liked the ending and seeing them plan a future together.Tate and his sister, Astrid, were excellent secondary characters. I liked their belief in Jed and their willingness to help him get his life back on track. Tate is a forest ranger who is helping Jed join the rangers and giving him a place to live until he finishes repairing his old home. Astrid is a single mom with a little boy. She has matchmaking tendencies and enjoys throwing Hannah and Jed together whenever possible. There is a heart-stopping scene where young Olly disappears, and the circumstances are suspicious. The next book in the series is Tate's story, and I can't wait to read it.",

                "reviewText": "There is someone lurking in the shadows. Someone who is killing young mothers. But why? Fingers first point toward Jed Swain, an exonerated con who has returned to his home town on Dead Falls Island. Some have always believed in his innocents including Hannan Maddox. They were friends once. They might have been more. But Jed was accused of a crime and sent to prison. And it was Hannah\u2019s father, Sherriff Maddox who provided all the evidence. But I it isn\u2019t Jed, then who? Jed is trying to figure it out. And Hannah is helping. As a Child Psychologist she has access to information that might help, as well as her father\u2019s old records. But as she searches her father\u2019s old files for clues, she stumbles across his information on Jed Swain\u2019s case. And she learns just how far her father was willing to go to keep her and Jed apart. This new series began with a tense plot and characters that captured my attention. From the very beginning I felt pulled into the story. I believe this is the best of Carol Ericson\u2019s books I\u2019ve read. I am looking forward to her next story in the Discovery Bay series.",

This book has a unique setup with Hannah's father having a hand in sending her love to prison! What a tough thing to live with! Once Jed is free, instead of moving on with his life with a fresh start, he goes right back to his hometown determined to clear his name. Things fall apart when his accuser dies, the town turns on him again before it becomes clear Jed is obviously innocent. Hannah and Jed team up to find a murderer but the killer has other plans.The dynamic between Hannah and Jed was a Rollercoaster, Hannah had a lot to make up for because of the actions of her Father and years built of broken trust. The chemistry still crackles between them despite it all!I was blown away with this book, this is book 1 in a discovery bay series and this book makes an excellent beginning with not only tough and fascinating main characters but side characters that I can easily see in a book of their own!I will post my review on Netgalley, Amazon and Goodreads",
