        "description": "Told in alternating timelines, THE THINGS WE LEAVE UNFINISHED examines the risks we take for love, the scars too deep to heal, and the endings we can\u2019t bring ourselves to see coming.Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia Stanton has to start over after she gave up almost everything in a brutal divorce\u2015the New York house, the friends, and her pride. Now back home at her late great-grandmother\u2019s estate in Colorado, she finds herself face-to-face with Noah Harrison, the bestselling author of a million books where the cover is always people nearly kissing. He\u2019s just as arrogant in person as in interviews, and she\u2019ll be damned if the good-looking writer of love stories thinks he\u2019s the one to finish her grandmother\u2019s final novel\u2026even if the publisher swears he\u2019s the perfect fit.Noah is at the pinnacle of his career. With book and movie deals galore, there isn\u2019t much the \u201cgolden boy\u201d of modern fiction hasn\u2019t accomplished. But he can\u2019t walk away from what might be the best book of the century\u2015the one his idol, Scarlett Stanton, left unfinished. Coming up with a fitting ending for the legendary author is one thing, but dealing with her beautiful, stubborn, cynical great-granddaughter, Georgia, is quite another. But as they read Scarlett\u2019s words in both the manuscript and her box of letters, they start to realize why Scarlett never finished the book\u2015it\u2019s based on her real-life romance with a World War II pilot, and the ending isn\u2019t a happy one. Georgia knows all too well that love never works out, and while the chemistry and connection between her and Noah is undeniable, she\u2019s as determined as ever to learn from her great-grandmother\u2019s mistakes\u2015even if it means destroying Noah\u2019s career.",

Their love story was so powerful and complicated. Scarlett and her sister, Constance, have dedicated themselves to the war despite their parents wishes, only further complicating what they want for their futures.In present day, Georgia and Noah are butting heads over turning her late grandmother's life story into a published novel. Noah is a popular romance writer with a big ego, so naturally he thinks he is perfect for the job. Georgia disagrees with him at almost every turn, but Noah is insistent that he will eventually win her over. Spoiler alert- he does. But Noah does the one thing he promised Georgia he'd never do- he hurts her.This one is actually really hard to review! There are two stories happening in two different timelines and I won't lie, at times it made my brain hurt. I would get invested in what was happening in one timeline just to be thrown back into the other. One thing I had to remind myself of was to lower my expectations a little bit. I loved In The Likely Event so much that I expected this one to hook me just as hard.Rebecca Yarros is a master at writing stories that stay with you. When I finished this one, I texted a few friends that it was \"nowhere as emotionally damaging as In The Likely Event\" but guess what happened the next day? I got in my car and started thinking about it again and the tears started flowing. I wanted so badly to figure out how RY was going to throw me for a loop that I didn't let myself feel the important and painful parts that made the story so beautiful. With each RY novel I read, I am finding it to be incredibly important to be patient and let everything come together.I texted @_bookstamandy_ an insanely long voice message around 77% with my theory of what was happening and I guessed it almost to a T. The clues were there and I was pretty pleased with myself that I picked up on them.\u2014you'll find:\ud83d\udcc6dual storylines\u2708\ufe0fWWII setting\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8a brit x an american\ud83d\udde3\ufe0fenemies to lovers\ud83d\udcd6book in a book",

The author skillfully weaves together the various narratives, creating a rich and immersive reading experience. However, the frequent and at times unnecessary point of view shifts can be a bit distracting, impacting the overall flow of the story. Additionally, while the characters are well-developed, the exception feels like the FMC. I found the female lead a bit unlikeable. Despite these drawbacks, the novel is a four-star read, offering an engaging and emotionally resonant story that lingers in the mind long after the final page.",

Could this be the one Rebecca Yarros book that wouldn't make me cry? Guess what? I was wrong, and I should have known better. Because by the time I reached the last 20%, I was sobbing in public.The book follows two storylines four generations apart. The first occurs amid WWII when Scarlett meets American pilot Jameson Stanton as he volunteers for the Royal Air Force. Theirs is a timeless and hard-fought love with an unimaginable ending.The second storyline takes place 80 years later when Scarlett's great-granddaughter Georgia must approve the unfinished manuscript of her grandmother's love story, which will be completed by novelist Noah Harrison. Love is not on their agenda; they antagonize each other at every turn.The book's structure and writing are brilliant: the past timeline is told in the third person and reads as historical fiction, while the present is in the first POV and is a contemporary romance. The transitions between past and present are flawless, as the storylines intersect through Scarlett and Jameson's letters.What makes Things We Leave Unfinished a powerful book is that it focuses on the many forms of love, making its story universal. While heartbreaking, it also gives hope.",

                "reviewText": "It is hard to put into words what this book did to me. It's been almost 24 hours and I am still reeling from all the emotions. I must admit this was one of the best going in \"blind\" books I could have ever chosen. I felt like I knew the characters or wished I had known them in person. It made me yearn for things (can't give too much away). All were lively, amusing, and distinct, and each faced their own demons. It's amazing how a writer can capture so much of what a character is going through as if you were the one going through it yourself. In some sense, maybe we all are. I do not know if I can do this book justice, but I would highly recommend it. Go in blind like I did. Sometimes the books we randomly choose have a way of being carried in our hearts and becoming a part of our soul. As well as becoming one of our favorites. Also, if you do happen to read it, make sure you also check out the audiobook as well. It is currently a free listen on Audible, and let me tell you, the narrators were phenomenal.",
