Expecting Catherine\u2019s family to fulfill a contract signed from 25 years ago, Hugh offers Catherine a marriage proposal. The story focuses on their developing relationship and marriage, while they investigate a mystery, and figure out who is trying to kill them. This is a wonderful, somewhat steamy story, with very appealing characters, each carrying their past baggage hindering their relationship progress, and a dramatic mystery woven throughout keeping the reader\u2019s attention. The plot explores the emotions of first impressions, unshakable judgmental beliefs, and uncompromising assumptions. The author\u2019s brilliant writing abilities does a great job at plot building, encourages the reader to care about the primary characters and empathize with the hurdles they face, and support their future path. A great read. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Then the story revolves around them coming to terms with their marriage, getting to know one another, and tearing down some walls they both had constructed. There is a villain to add some intrigue.

Violet wrote lovingly about both of their scars, his physical and mental, hers mental. They were able to grow to trust and talk with each other and come out on top. The villanous Georgina was a good throw in, and the puppies were a wonderful addition! That instigated a good relationship with Hugh and Catherine.. Thank you for a wonderful depictive read, am glad that even though what transpired about Catherine's mental scars was not listed during the writing, it very much came through, coming to a good end, and a better familial future.",

This one caught my attention immediately and i almost never wanted it to end. The Cursed Duke is a belated champion with courage and fortitude. Each one of the characters stepped off the pages. Especially the \u201cpoor cursed Duke\u201d. When he finally steps up to the plate, he\u2019s my kind of Hero with courage and fortitude. The complicated history and how this story turns is filled with intrigue and may blow your mind. As i said i loved it and highly recommend it",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this story. Catherine is a spinster and thought she would not marry. Duke Hugh had been injured in a fire and hid himself away from society due to his burns. His family was killed in the fire and he inherited the Dukedom at ten years of age. His uncle had always supported his training as a Duke and taught him his responsibilities. Hugh knew he needed to marry. When his grandmother showed him a contract between his father and his friend, he knew his search for a bride was over. The contract agreed that Hugh should marry one of Lord Sedgehall's daughters. Hugh chose Catherine. They married in a quiet ceremony and they soon have feelings for each other. At times it is quite steamy at times.Events happen that threaten Hugh and Catherine? Who is responsible? Who would stand to gain if anything happens to either of them?Will Hugh be able to solve the puzzle and keep Catherine safe? Read on and enjoy.",
