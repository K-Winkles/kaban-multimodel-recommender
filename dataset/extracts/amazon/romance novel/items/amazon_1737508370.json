When Peter\u2019s twenty-year-old daughter Wendy shows up in James\u2019s bar, he sees his way in. Seduce the girl and use her for his revenge. It\u2019s the perfect plan, until things in James\u2019s organization begin to crumble. Suddenly, he has to find the traitor in his midst, and his plan for revenge gets murkier as James starts to see Wendy as more than just a pawn in his game.Wendy has been cloistered away most of her life by her wealthy cold father, but a spontaneous night out with friends turns into an intense and addictive love affair with the dark and brooding James. As much as she knows James is dangerous, Wendy can\u2019t seem to shake her desire for him. But as their relationship grows more heated and she learns more about the world he moves in, she finds herself unsure if she\u2019s falling for the man known as James or the monster known as Hook.",

It's not your circumstances that determines your worth, it's how you rise from the ashes after everything burns.\"I absolutely loved this dark and spicy retelling of Peter Pan. This story had me smiling due to how well I felt Hook and Wendy connected. Their back and forth got a little cheesy at times, but I loved it. The storyline flowed, making it a very quick and easy read.Hook met Wendy Michaels (the daughter of his enemy - Peter Michaels) in his bar one night while she was out with friends. He immediately decided to make her his pet as a way to try to tarnish her innocence. which, in his mind, would make her no longer Daddy's sweet little shadow. This book had me drooling over Hook like never before as soon as the first line came out of his mouth. This man breathes red flags but makes you want to absolutely anything he asks of you.I know this is a standalone story, but I would absolutely love to hear more from the characters.I highly recommend this book.",

It's twisted and toxic, a poison masked in sugar, making you love the taste of death.SummeryJames thinks all he wants out of love is revenge against Peter. The man who killed his parents and ruined his life. He has spent his life building his criminal organization and ruling over his \"lost boys.\"James now has a way to destroy Peter. He will seduce Peter's daughter, Wendy, effectively bringing Peter to his knees. But Wendy isn't just a pretty face and a loving daughter. A fire burns in her to match his own.My ThoughtsHeart pounding, skin tingling, blood racing, I LOVED it! I might be a little biased, I truly deeply enjoy dark Peter Pan retelling that focus on Hook. This was everything I wanted and then some! I delighted in every turn of the page and never wanted it to end.This is NOT the Peter Pan, Hook, Neverland that we grew up on. This is a modern-day story told in the real world with splashes of Pan lore. Hidden easter eggs flitter through the pages. The child in me jumped with glee with every reference while the woman blushed with heat over James (Hook).James was the total dark villain package. A monster in beautiful wrapping who takes care of his own. Who would destroy the world to heal what is hurt or help you find your retribution. He never lies about who or what he is. He knows he's a criminal. He knows he's a killer and fiend. He is truly himself throughout the book while coming to terms that even a scoundrel can love.\"You want to watch the world burn?\"\"Let me guess, you'll set it on fire?\" I ask.He chuckles, the sound vibrating through me and settling into my bones.\"No, darling. I'll hand you the match and stand at your back, watching you become queen of the ashes.\"Wendy is a powerful female character in her own right. She doesn't just sit on the sidelines in docile obedience. She finds her voice and with it her own strength of power. I loved her character arc.Micintire drew me in on the first page. I was engaged and engrossed in her world. The word building is phenomenal in its simplicity. This will sit with me for a while. I will definitely be rereading in the not to distant future.",

This is a contemporary dark romance that is not a fantasy at all but still manages to be a twist on the retelling of the classic story with the villain getting the girl. I absolutely love this book. And I think I might love it more on this second read-through. The narrators did an excellent job (and swoon for hearing Hook, mmm) and, even knowing the twists, my heart still bled as the story progressed. I know this book has been hugely popular and pretty much everyone has read it at this point. But if YOU haven't, I highly recommend you do so!",

I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever screamed out in frustration so many times.Like, let\u2019s abduct and starve Wendy for days without evidence, then she just as easily is completely fine with that? And oh, let\u2019s wander onto my father\u2019s property when I know he\u2019s a terrible man, and be oh so surprised to find this assistant there, waiting? Like - really? And all of this possessive BS, too, and she\u2019s fine with being called a \u201cpet\u201d - even after the torment she went through?There were some good parts in this, but the bad outweighs it. Not my cup of tea to gloss over important aspects of character and plot development and exchange it for \u201cspice\u201d and insanity disguised as \u201cromance.\u201dI\u2019ve heard that the second book is better, and those little bits of good I found - hopefully they\u2019re more defined than what was in these pages. If you\u2019re looking for a depraved romance, look no further than \u201cHooked.\u201dThis is only my opinion.",

I was a bit worried at the beginning that it was going to be all spice and not enough story. It was the perfect balance of tension between the two main characters, but also the spicy parts were beautifully written. It definitely had me guessing for a while and thinking I knew who it was. It gave just enough hints to add to the suspense. There were twists in this book but they were sprinkled so nicely that it never felt overwhelming. Definitely would recommend.",
