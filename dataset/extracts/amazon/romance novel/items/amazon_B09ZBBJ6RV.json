He gave chase and managed to catch the offender by tackling them to the ground. It\u2019s only when the boy is in his arms that Calan realizes it\u2019s not a boy at all, it a young woman\u2026. And she\u2019s naked.Seeing that she is suffering from injuries, he takes the mystery woman through a secret passage into his keep to get her the healing and rest she needs.Allissaid was kidnapped by her clans enemy and forced into a marriage despite being unconscious. She manages to escape , even going so far as to risk death to do so. But after trying to steal a plaid, and failing, she wakes up in an unknown room with a man sitting on top of her while a woman tends to her injuries.Not knowing if they are friend or foe, she feigns memory loss. However, the more time she spends with Calan, the more she falls for him and her lies are chipped away.Random change of pace with a nice historical romance of the Scottish variety! I used to be heavily into these stories and this one is no exception! Having had recently read the book before this in the series, I saw it was for sale and purchased it!I love being able to get a glimpse into the past and how life was during that time. It\u2019s nice to see that while most men in this era view women as property, not all did. Some were loving and gentle men that are still rare to find today.I liked seeing how Calan was with Allissaid, watching a tenderness that even his mother and sister weren\u2019t aware he had. I do wish that we would have gotten to see him as a leader, but seeing as the majority of the book takes place in his bedroom with Allissaid hidden away, it does make sense why that aspect is missing.A decent read that I did enjoy but wasn\u2019t super in love with.",

I have read many books within this series and while they tend to follow the same template they are always entertaining: delivering endearing protagonists, humorous escapades, witty banter, and intriguing drama, along with atrocious and misogynistic villains. Though this story is slower-paced than I would have preferred, it's a great addition to the Highland Brides series and includes some of my favorite romantic tropes.Clever and wholesome heroine - Allissaid MacFarlaneShy and considerate hero with a protective nature - Calan Campbell, Laird of KilcairnDual POV***** SAFETY AND CONTENT SPOILERS BELOW ***********************************************************Tropes: damsel in distress, injury, forced proximity, hidden/mistaken identity, one bed, honorable marriageContent Warning:Light spice, descriptive - vanilla - virgin hViolence, murder, kidnapping, assault and attempted SA",

MacNaughton (or MacNaughty) is still casing the MacFarlane clan for a bride, and after a mental game of Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, he lands on the second oldest daughter. Powerful clans are rallying against MacNaughton and his cohorts. Unfortunately, it was not in time to save Allissaid from his despicable hands.

It\u2019s actually a good idea to have read Highland Wolf before this one, since this does continue the story arc that began in that one.We do have a couple of Buchanan cameos too, for fans of the series, but this book is a bit more serious than most of the others than precede it. There are a couple of smile and chuckle worthy moments, but Allissaid\u2019s story begins with a harsh note.It\u2019s a surprisingly entertaining book, given that the vast majority of it takes place in one room, and it doesn\u2019t lack for action or excitement. The hero is typical of Sands\u2019 historicals, strong and brave and inclined towards action, while the heroine is amusingly na\u00efve (but not afraid to protect herself or those she loves). She\u2019s definitely resourceful, as is amply shown at the start of the book.It\u2019s a good read, and Buchanan fans will enjoy the small glimpses of that family, as well as enjoy the new MacFarlane ladies who seem to be just as interesting.An enjoyable read for highland historical romance fans.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty average for the series, a little tamer than the earlier books and not as amusing as some but overall a good entry. I liked Calan and Allissaid for the entire book. I was never once angry at or disappointed with either of them, which has not always been the case with these Highlanders and their brides.I was disappointed this book didn\u2019t pick up on what I thought was the start of a story about one or two of the McKay daughters at the end of the previous installment. Ross and Annabel are my favorite characters in the series. I was looking forward to seeing more of them.",

                "reviewText": "The h is a relative of the Buchanan brothers and sister to the h of #10 book. The H is another convenient Laird who she has never met before yet knows his mother quite well. He rescues her as she attempts to steal his plaid when he was swimming in the loch. She is battered and bruised from being kidnapped and almost raped. He hides her and the family look after her as she recovers. He compromises her and then marries her.This book is feeble and dreadfully written. If it was a first novel am sure the editor would have laughed and tossed it back to the author. Don't know what is going on with Sands but the deterioration is plumeting rapidly! The long long explanations were not even pleasant prose, just tedious, tireseome and utterly unnecessary. Very repetitive and some of the phrases like \"hard as a dead hen\" were bizarre and too colloquial.Cannot recommend and wont bother to read any more of this series. Shame that.",
