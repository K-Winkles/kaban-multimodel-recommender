She feels very alone and sad. She has spent her whole life working their ranch with her father, but now she must do it alone. There is a terrible family in town that is trying to get her ranch, by any means. Lottie decides to put in an ad for a mail order husband, so she can have some support. Will answers that ad. He was in the civil war and has an injured leg. He's been looking for his brother for years but has had no success. The last place he was seen was in Benson Texas, the same town Lottie has advertised for a mail order husband. He figures this is a good way for him to seek out his brother. Oh boy is he surprised when Lottie is beautiful, smart, and rich. They are attracted to each other immediately. This is a very good read, by Lilah Rivers. I read it in a day since I couldn't put it down.",
