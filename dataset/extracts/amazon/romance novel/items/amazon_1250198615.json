                "reviewText": "After seeing multiple positive reviews over and over again, I took the bait and read this and I am SO GLAD THAT I DID!!!\"All of you will always be in my heart, and part of me will always be in yours. That's a damn good legacy, if you ask me.\"This book is a mixture of grief, love, friendship, magic, and forgiveness. \"Grief can change a person to the point where they become someone they don't know, or even like very much.\"Anna Kate Callow has come to the town of Wicklow, Alabama since her Granny Zee died. Part of Zee's will stated that Anna Kate could inherit the Blackbird Cafe, if she came to Wicklow and ran it for at least 60 days. And Granny Zee knew EXACTLY what she was doing!!!Anna Kate is planning on becoming a doctor. However, when Zee dies, she has to go run the Blackbird Cafe. Not knowing what to expect since her mother ran off with her (she was pregnant with her) right after her father died, Anna comes to the town of Wicklow. Her father's family, the Lindens', blamed her mother Eden for her father's death. Even though the car accident was ruled an \"accident\", the Linden's, specifically Seelie, insists that it was no accident, and Eden murdered her son AJ.Anna dives head first into running the Cafe and figuring out what what Granny Zee put in the \"Blackbird pie\" to make it taste so good. Ewwwwww....blackbird pie? But the pies aren't made with actual blackbirds, but rather various fruits such as blueberries and blackberries and a \"secret\" ingredient Anna must figure out. After eating the pie, you have dreams that night from loved ones that have passed on that provide messages. On top of that, the rare birds come at midnight and put on a show that soon begins attracting bird watchers from all over.This was a beautiful, magical realism southern book. I loved all of the characters from Mr. Lazenby banging on the cafe's door every morning wanting his pie in hopes of receiving messages from his late wife (completely oblivious that Pebbles is in love with him wanting him to get over her), to Faylene who knows everyone and everything about everyone and is always playing matchmaker, to the mysterious gray cat that keeps appearing out of nowhere leading Anna on various escapades.Then, of course there is love!!! Lots and lots of love. If you are looking for a heartfelt book about overcoming hardships and grief, dealing with family drama, love, some good cooking and a little bit of magic, this book is for you.",

                "reviewText": "The story is about family and two main characters Anna Kate and Heather. There are alot of characters so I suggest you keep track at the start, it helps. The story is set in a small quaint town of Wiklow, Alabama. The description makes you want to go there.When Anna's grandma Zee dies, She goes to the funeral. Thinking she will sell the Cafe and move on to college towards the end of the summer. However, oh, the family drama!Natalie returned to Wiklow because her husband died of a tragic accident and she has an adorable child Ollie. She is easily one to love. Natalie goes to live with her mom and dad, Doc and Seely. However, the mom has not gotten over the death of her son AJ and how he died.The story has so many emotional topics described well such as forgiveness, grief, death, love, independence, and moving on from the past.The book has many long sentences which appears to be a quote about life and how to live it. They give you pause to takeaway and agree.Additionally, there is a light touch of magic connected to the Cafe, the pies that are made by Anna Kate and the blackbirds which appear at midnight. Can it all really bring a connection with the dead love ones.I totally enjoyed the story even though at times the writing seems to get stalled. I enjoyed the characters but there are those you always question. The things I would have liked expanded is more information about Grandma zee. Also an expansion of the few love interests that develop but at the end of the story. Surely, there will be a follow-up to this book so we know what happens?A good one to get lost in, keep track of who is who, and have some pie!",

                "reviewText": "This book is everything I want my writing to be. Immersively descriptive. Emotional. I even teared up over the death of some zucchini plants.The protagonist is Anna Kate Callow who came to Wicklow when her grandmother Zee passed away and left her the Blackbird Cafe. Anna Kate inherits only if she spends two months running the cafe. She has help in Len and Bow, two mysterious people who showed up over 20 years before and never left.Despite being Zee's granddaughter, Anna Kate has never stepped foot in Wicklow. Her pregnant mother left after Anna Kate's father died in a car crash and she was accused of murder. Her mother wouldn't talk about Anna Kate's father, what happened, or anything to do with Wicklow and its denizens. But Anna Kate learned about the town and the cafe through her grandmother's fantastic stories about blackbirds and magical pies that enable people to get messages from loved ones who have passed on.Anna Kate's father was the son of the town doctor. His wife Seelie believes Anna Kate's mother murdered her son. Fearing they would try to get custody of Anna Kate, no one ever told them that Anna Kate's mother was pregnant when she left town.Now Anna Kate is taking over the cafe, and the whole town is talking. Long-buried secrets are unearthed, families and friendships are forged, and Anna Kate gradually uncovers the mystery behind the pies and the blackbirds, discovers a new family, and makes peace with her life.I unabashedly loved this novel. It's set in a fictional Alabama town, and every page oozes with the sights, sounds, smells, and even the textures of the south. I grew up in small town west Tennesse, and this book evoked the best of those years.My own novels are set in the South, but I have a lot to learn to make them as immersive and evocative as this amazing novel.The novel isn't perfect. I struggled with the multiple First Person POV, a POV I, personally, do not like. I understood why she made the POV choices she made, and at one level I could appreciate her technique. I simply don't like First Person Multiple. I honestly didn't see anything here that would have been lost if the novel had been in close Third Limited.That was, overall, just a personal preference and not really a weakness of the book, so I gave it a solid 5 stars. Beautiful-but-still-accessible writing, deeply drawn characters, and a seamless injection of magic. I definitely recommend the novel and hope someday I can write something equally amazing.",

Anna Kate has never been to Wicklow before as her mother Eden refused to return to the small town because of the Linden family who accused her of the murder of their son AJ who was the love of Eden's life. In Wicklow Anna Kate has to deal with the animosity of Seelie Linden, the curiosity and friendship offered by regulars of the Blackbird Caf\u00e9, and meets Natalie Linden Walker and her adorable daughter Ollie. Also, there is the legend of the famous blackbird pies and the mysterious flock of blackbirds who only sing at night. Lovely book, I hope this author writes others.",

                "reviewText": "Heather Webber spins a tale about pies, 24 blackbirds and a midnight chorus that when threaded together have, it is suggested, the ability to brings messages from the dead to those who mourn their passing.The premise is a good one, the characters reasonably well-crafted, but I struggled to find little to either engage or keep my interest. There are few surprises and in fact little imagination is needed to see how things will shake out in the end.A pleasant read that filled a few hours, but it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll be in the market for any of her other books.",
