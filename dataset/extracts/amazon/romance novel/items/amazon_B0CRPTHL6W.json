The internal monologue felt a little repetitive at times, but that\u2019s easy to ignore because there was a lot of world-building in this tiny novella. I liked all the concepts and felt like it was very well-thought out and complex. Overall, really liked it and I will be getting a physical copy for my trophy shelf as soon as I can!",

I have been reading her work from Forsaken By The Gods series and now this paranormal romance and I enjoyed it so much. I do got to say when I started reading this one I didnt know what I was jumping into and it turned out that this is my first ever non-binary read. I have read plenty of MM and poly romance but this is my first ever non-binary character which I was pleasantly surprise. I will have to say it was a bit of a challange but that is just due to the fact that English is not my first language so reworking my brain when it came to the pronouns when it came to reading was a small hiccup at the begining. Once I was able to get that situated, I devoured the story so fast and it was nice to see the apperance of Paine from Paine for the Holidays which is the first novella in the series.If you love\ud83d\udcab Holiday Paranormal Romance\ud83d\udcab Enemies to Lovers\ud83d\udcab He's a monter hunter / They are a monster\ud83d\udcab MM (Male & NonBinary RomanceType: Paranormal RomanceRating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fSpice: \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0fStand Alone or Series: Standalone Novella (Monsters of the Divide)TWs: Violance, \ud83e\ude78 , Gore Use of \ud83d\udd2bs /\ud83d\udd2as, Bitting, Claiming, Loss of a love one\ud83d\udc8bnaj_ana_reads\ud83d\udc8bMood Reader",

Max definitely has lots of shadows that haunt him and the way vex chases them away is beautiful and will make your heart melt.Don\u2019t think that it all sweet there is definitely slice added in the mix and clues to a much bigger plot unfolding that I suspect will unfold across the different books of Monsters if the Divide",
