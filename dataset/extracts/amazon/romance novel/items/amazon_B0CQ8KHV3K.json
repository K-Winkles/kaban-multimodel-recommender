                "reviewText": "This is another story that is part of the Spinster\u2019s series of books written by this creative author. All are engaging stories with unexpected romances that happen to women who have chosen to never marry. Each story is a standalone, and does not have any cliffhangers. This story surrounds Phoebe and Daniel. Acting as a mother to her two sisters, Phoebe is now seeking appropriate suitors for the girls. Daniel, believing he is cursed with an early death, seeks a wife that he will never love, to carry on his legacy. The few times in the past when Phoebe and Daniel\u2019s paths cross, they clash and bicker. Daniel decides he wants to marry one of Phoebe\u2019s sisters, but he must prove to her he is worthy to receive her blessing. Ms Baton creates a mesmerizing story, with a variety of characters trying to find their future happiness and happily ever after. Among the tension between Phoebe and Daniel, things suddenly begin to change. Everyone around them are aware except the squabbling couple. Then the author wisely weaves in unexpected drama to amp up the tension. A wonderful plot that is full of emotional turmoil and misunderstandings, with rich characters failing to see what is within their grasp. I enjoyed the story, and remain a fan of Ms Baton. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "Phoebe has been acting as a mother to her twin sisters, Johanna and Ellen, ever since their mother died. On top of that she has also been handling most of the finances for the estate as her father had not taken his wife\u2019s death well and Phoebe was very good with math and handling financial matters. Phoebe was very protective of her sisters and this was very notable as far as finding suitors for them. Daniel did have a history with Phoebe as he always appeared to be awkward around her and had in fact managed to dump drinks on her on a number of occasions. At the last dance Daniel danced with Joanne as she was enthusiastic and a lot of fun but Phoebe was not at all happy about it. The story then continues with Daniel acting like he is going to court Johanna but he spends most of the time with Phoebe convincing himself that it is because he has to get her approval before he can court her sister. A lot of mixed feelings and also a stark view that Daniel holds about his future almost prevents him from acting upon his true feelings for Phoebe. We also have a bit of drama and then a realization that love could be lost unless acted upon before we finally get our happily ever after.",

The way she wrote this part of the story, it drew you into the it, making it hard to put down. She breathes life into the story especially the characters. My favourite is the twins. They are full of mischief and life. I can't wait for Ellen's story. It will be interesting from the bad experience she had to the good ones yet to come. I look forward to more of the spinster club. They are a interesting group of people. K",

Whenever they meet, she always seems to argue with Daniel. She is determined to stop any relationship developing. .However, her plans do not run smoothly when sparks fly between Daniel and Phoebe instead of Julia. I really enjoyed the arguments between them and how they both tried to fight their feelings. This story has an elopement, and unexpected twists. A good read.",
