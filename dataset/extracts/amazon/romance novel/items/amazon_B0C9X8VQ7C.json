                "reviewText": "Wow, what a story. This is an amazing story of how people can be misjudged, and others can have two very different faces they wear. Kiera and her family were tricked by a Laird Eric into believing he wanted to marry her and take care of her. As was the custom at this time she goes to live in his Castle before the wedding. Only to find out his dark secrets quickly. He is an abuser and enjoys hitting her and causing her pain. Her life has taken a deadly turn for the worse. When the Castle is attacked, she sees her only chance to escape. Only to run Stright into Eric\u2019s biggest enemy, the feared Laird MacPherson, Christian. After all she has been through, could fate be so cruel? Christian can\u2019t believe that a man could hit and hurt someone so beautiful. Kiera is about to learn the truth of who to trust and those who lie and are evil through and through. This book has a lot of twists and turns with issues that may be disturbing for some. They fit the story and helps one understand what little woman had a say in back them. There is also a lot of understanding, passion, love and faith in this book. I hope you will give it a read and find out just how much two people can care for and love the other. Once you start reading you will not be able to put it down, you will cry, laugh and want to kill some too. Enjoy the ride. I received an ARC from the author and wish to thank her. This is my honest opinion and am freely giving it.",

It still had a \"Fairy Tale\" feel, but the writing was richer. I took a star off, due to the poor editing, typos and sentences using the wrong name or not making my sense. Poor quality control, needs to be proofed by someone who can read.",

                "reviewText": "Keira was betrothed to Eric, and as was the custom, she went to live in his castle before the wedding. However, the charming man that he had presented to her family soon disappeared and a violent one took his place. Eric derived great pleasure from beating Kiera on a daily basis. When Christian\u2019s clan attacked Eric\u2019s castle, she attempted to escape, only to run smack into Christian. Appalled by her bruises, he swept her away from there and took her to his own castle so that she would be safe and could heal. Two weeks later, Eric arrives with an army to take her back, which ends in his humiliation. What follows is a heartfelt story wherein Christian, a laird reputed to be ruthless, does everything he can in order to help Keira heal. On one hand, this is a violent story. On the other hand it is a lovely tale of a sigh-worthy hero rescuing and wooing his lady love. The emotions run from terror to heartache, and there is even a little madness thrown in for good measure. Very few can do the fierce warrior to gentle giant as well as this author, and I loved it from beginning to end.",
