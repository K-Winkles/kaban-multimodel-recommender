                "reviewText": "Same Time Next Year, a New Year\u2019s Eve Novella-My rating is 5 stars.Who would have thought that a short, little novella would evoke tears AND a five star rating out of me??! Surely, not I. Novella\u2019s typically are quick reads that are too short to really leave much of an impact. That\u2019s just not the case with this story\u2026This was a short, very quick but intense read, for me. It was plot driven and paced adequately, for a novella. Tessa was able to write this story to evolve over a one year timeline and it hit the points that it needed to, to drive the story.Britta and Sumner come together through a marriage of convenience. To avoid returning to Canada, Britta marries Sumner so that he can continue to play hockey in the United States, something he needs to do to make his goal and dreams of playing in the NHL. They\u2019ve always been friends and they come to a business arrangement, an expirationship and they marry on New Year\u2019s Eve.Britta was a great FMC. She was fiercely independent and loved by everyone that knew her. She didn\u2019t put up with anyone\u2019s crap yet was still able to relate to people in a way that isn\u2019t easily achieved. She had been hurt badly by her father, as a young girl and it made her incredibly tough but also terrified of relationships and commitment. She didn\u2019t believe that everyone got a love story. She wasn\u2019t willing to take a chance on anyone because she believed that everyone will eventually leave, nothing lasts forever.I absolutely fell in love with Sumner. Tessa Bailey wrote him to be the most perfect husband possible. He was so incredibly loyal to Britta and committed to breaking down her sky-high walls that she\u2019s hidden behind for her entire life. He understood her aversion to commitment so well that he was able to reel himself in (for the most part,) and give her the time she needed to figure out that he would only ever need her, that he would always choose her.There were moments with Sumner that brought tears to my eyes:\u201cCan you not see that I\u2019m starving to death for you? Can\u2019t you tell that I missed you so horribly that my family couldn\u2019t even make me smile?\u201d\u201cSumner, what did you do? He has the never to look proud of himself. Made you off limits, Britta. It\u2019s a rule that is rarely invoked among the group. But once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s ******* done. He leans over until our foreheads are a breath apart. If you don\u2019t like it, then stop being my dream girl.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stop me from looking at anyone but you, because I don\u2019t want to look in the first place. Put parental controls on my phone, my laptop, block porn sites. Track my location. Lock my dick in a cage. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make you realize I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m staying right here. I\u2019ll make you feel secure until you realize it\u2019s only ever going to be you.\u201dI mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to have someone feel like this about them?!Sumner and Britta had so much chemistry, it was fiery, passionate and they had a difficult time controlling themselves around each other. They had some incredibly tender moments together but, the spice was definitely spicin\u2019!There weren\u2019t a ton of support characters in this short read but I really loved the dynamic and relationship between Britta and her half-brother Bryce. That \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d talk that he had with her was pretty powerful.I loved how Britta stood up and faced her fears, at the end. She put her big girl pants on and realized that living without Sumner just wasn\u2019t an option and, I was so proud of her. Sumner got what he wanted all along and Britta gets to experience a mad, passionate, soul engulfing love with him. A perfect HEA.I think it\u2019s safe to say that I really loved this novella. I wasn\u2019t expecting much from this book and I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to have it hit me so hard in the feels. If you\u2019re looking for a powerful novella, this is the book for you.",

The team has made a last-ditch effort to keep Sumner on the team by recruiting Britta to marry him, there are only a few problems with their plan\u2026it\u2019s illegal but Britta also has a strong aversion to marriage. Her parent's relationship growing up has left her less than enthused about the idea but she finds herself feeling pressured into agreeing. She knows that Sumner has always had a thing for her but she is determined to keep things strictly platonic. We will see how long that lasts\u2026This story was adorable and had me laughing from the very start, Britta\u2019s aversion to love and relationships paired with Sumner\u2019s desire to treat a woman right makes for some pretty commercial moments between the two when you add in their quick wit. As a fast read, I feel we lost some of the story with the time gaps but we still get a good amount of relationship and personal development with the characters.

                "reviewText": "This was a quick, Prime freebie that I snapped up! I'm the one Canadian who isn't a hockey fan, but I am a fan of sweet with heat RomComs, especially those with handsome Canadian leading men. Those romance elements melt the cheese curds on this Canadian's poutine!This novella centres around a Canadian hockey player who enters a marriage of convenience so he can stay in the US and play hockey professionally. Readers get first-person POVs from both Britta, the bartender and Sumner, the hockey player. Sumner has been obsessed with Britta since the day they met, but Britta isn't quite so smitten and continues to push away the hockey player for her own reasons.I loved Sumner (despite his snooty butler's name) for his emotional intelligence and his awesome Canadian family (who I wish had been given more page time). He's a swoony cinnamon roll character, but I could have done with less of his cringy dirty talk between the sheets and less desperation for Britta to lurrve him. And while this Canuck loved the Canadian rep, I think Bailey should have leaned into it a lot more.Same Time Next Year is a balance of sweet romance with spicy scenes and although readers will have to suspend disbelief about the immigration process, this was a quick and enjoyable novella with a couple I easily rooted for.",

It is purely meant to be a marriage of convenience, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way.Sumner was an adorable book boyfriend, and enjoyed his wholesome family vibe. Britta\u2019s character development was also pretty heartwarming.What to expect:- novella- marriage of convenience- he falls first- very spicy",
