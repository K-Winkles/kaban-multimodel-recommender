        "description": "From the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Things We Never Got Over\"You may be faking the relationship, but you're not faking the orgasms.\"Downsized, broke, and dumped, 38-year-old Marley sneaks home to her childhood bedroom in the town she couldn't wait to escape twenty years ago. Not much has changed in Culpepper. The cool kids are still cool. Now they just own car dealerships and live in McMansions next door. Oh, and the whole town is still talking about that Homecoming she ruined her senior year.Desperate for a new start, Marley accepts a temporary teaching position. Can the girl banned from all future Culpepper High Homecomings keep the losing-est girls soccer team in school history from killing each other and prevent carpal tunnel in a bunch of phone-clutching gym class students?Maybe with the help of Jake Weston, high school bad boy turned sexy good guy. When the school rumor mill sends Marley to the principal's office to sign an ethics contract, the tattooed track coach, dog dad, and teacher of the year becomes her new fake boyfriend and alibi\u2015for a price. The Deal: He'll teach her how to coach if she teaches him how to be in a relationship.Who knew a fake boyfriend could deliver such real orgasms? But it's all temporary. The guy. The job. The team. There's too much history. Rock bottom can't turn into a foundation for happily ever after. Can it?Warning: Story also includes a meet-puke, a bouffanted nemesis, a yard swan and donkey basketball, a teenage-orchestrated makeover, and a fake relationship that gets a little too real between the sheets.

The romance was lovely, but it all moved so slowly that I found myself losing interest. I feel like the story definitely could have been told with 100 less pages.

I liked the cover, the blurb seemed interesting and from the second page on I was laughing.It\u2019s a realistic story, with funny characters that experiment feelings and situations that at some point everyone has felt. And even if it\u2019s full of humor, it also shows the way women can be towards other sisters. The importance of communication, the power of sorority and to always change perspective are the main things this book gave me.It\u2019s funny, interesting and original.",

Mean spirited, unkind people that make others miserable. It was side-splitting funny with great dialogue. I loved the characters of Jake and Marley. How Jake showed Marley how great she was he encouraged her to believe in herself and helped give her self confidence. I loved how she encouraged her girls to fight and helped them to be kind and show team spirit. Thoroughly enjoyed this book.",
