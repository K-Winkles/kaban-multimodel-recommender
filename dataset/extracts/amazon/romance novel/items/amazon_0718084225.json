                "reviewText": "I was introduced to Lauren K Denton\u2019s work in March 2019 during a JustRead Publicity social media tour four \u201cGlory Road\u201d. As I liked the novel, my mother gave me Denton\u2019s two previous ones for my birthday.\u201cThe Hideaway\u201d is Denton\u2019s debut novel, a southern and Christian themed book.The story is told between Mags\u2019 and Sara\u2019s points of view. Mags from the past and Sara from current day.Sara is in Sweet Bay after the death of her beloved grandmother, Mags (Margaret Van Buren]. Sara thinks it is a simple reading of the will and she can return to her solitary life in New Orleans immediately. But, Sara becomes the new owner of \u201cThe Hideaway\u201d, a run-down bed and breakfast which has seen better days. She\u2019s instructed by her grandmother to fix it up to its former glory, even better than when Mags got it. Sara is given a choice to keep it or sell it, but she has to inform the current residents in advance. Residents who are also like family to Sara.Sara decides that it needs to be renovated anyway so why not spruce the old place up?She hires a contractor (Crawford) and sets out to do what has been asked of her. In the process she begins to learn about her grandmother\u2019s past and what led the older woman to the Hideaway in Sweet Bay and how she came to possess it. The story that others tell about Mags is vastly different from the life Sarah uncovers. How is it she knew nothing of this? Why did her grandmother keep the secrets she did?Sarah also learns the truth about her mother and her own past. But, Sara now seemingly has a future there in Sweet Bay \u2013 especially with Crawford.But, Sara also has her life in New Orleans, or believes she does. The longer she stays in Sweet Bay, the less she wants to return to her prior life. When a land developer starts making plans for the property, Sara is torn between staying and fighting for the Hideaway and returning back to the life she\u2019s crafted for herself. Sara is also wondering if she wants to make the same mistake her grandmother did when it came to love? The Hideaway is more than a place to visit; it holds deep memories and love.For her first outing, Denton does a remarkable with this story. It blends the past and present together to weave a beautiful story. It has romance with a not-so-happy ending. It reveals that often we don\u2019t know those we\u2019re closest to. The story also teaches us that what we want isn\u2019t what we need.For some readers their pet peeve was that Mags\u2019 unrequited love story and Sara\u2019s current love story are almost mirror image. I found it interesting in that Sara learned from her grandmother\u2019s mistake. I found it a beautiful part of the story.This book can seem to drag on, but it can also draw one in. I was drawn into and found there were times I couldn\u2019t put it down.If you\u2019ve never read any of Denton\u2019s works \u2013 this book and \u201cGlory Road\u201d are stand alone stories so the reader can start with any one of them. If you\u2019ve read \u201cGlory Road\u201d and enjoyed it, you will likely enjoy this. Denton\u2019s second novel is \u201cHurricane Season\u201d, again, a standalone title.This, like \u201cGlory Road\u201d, is a clean Christian Romance read. There are no \u201csex\u201d scenes in it. The language is mild and completely inoffensive. For those who are fans of \u201cclean\u201d romance reads, this one definitely fits into that category. As of note, I have not yet read \"Hurricane Season\", but it is on my TBR (To-Be-Read) list.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift a few years ago and ended up with a copy of my own recently. I hadn\u2019t read it but now that I have here I\u2019m review. If it\u2019s helpful please marks it helpful!It\u2019s about a grandmother and granddaughter, their own love stories and how an old bed and breakfast hidden in the woods of Alabama changed both of their lives. It\u2019s written in two points of view, one of the past and one of the present.Mags, the grandmother, dies, and Her granddaughter Sara returns home to Alabama to meet with lawyers and attend a funeral. When she arrives she learns that Mags hideaway home has been willed to her, and her grandmother has left a note requesting that she use her artistic skills to return it to its former glory. Along the way Sara learns a lot about her grandmother and herself. It\u2019s an interesting story of family and love that had me appreciating being home with my family and on my porch. Soaking in the quiet moments and the simplicity that comes with our current situation.In some ways I loved it. I found a lot of similarities between the grand daughter and myself. She loved quirky things and art and upcycling and home improvement and also lists and organization and her grandmother. All of these things are me. I was disappointed in the writing style, how the story was rushed at various times and then overly detailed without any visualization other times.The author really failed at all of the large climax situations. I\u2019d anticipate something for chapters on end and when it finally happened, it happened in a few sentences and without any depth. She did so well at developing the two main characters, it was a shame that such large parts of their stories and the other characters were breezed over.I\u2019m going to give it 3.5 starsIt could make a fantastic movie. The author spent so much time describing movements and leaving unanswered questions, that as a movie there may be more time to enhance the meaningful details. Which is usually the opposite when it comes to books vs movies. I\u2019d be interested in how a script writer would interpret the past and present points of view that were so important to how it all fell in to place.",

She is passive. She takes but doesn't give much. And has been uncaring towards her grandmother. I didn't warmed to her. She takes avantage of people who don't know the value of their belongings to sell them to her show off customers with a fat profit. She looked at her grand mother's furniture with that in mind. I ressent having paid 8,99\u20ac for this average book.",

                "reviewText": "The Hideaway wasn't the book I expected, one does have expectations on a storyline that is described on the back cover... I read with amazement. I was drawn in quietly, almost shyly, from the first page and the words that the author wrote didn't leave me until I read the last word. And not even then.Lauren K. Denton is a author whose books I will be watching out for. I found that her powers of characterization simply amazing. She didn't just characterize just people but also the house and Sweet Bay, where the house was located. I loved the diversity of all the people she wrote about and could actually picture them, hear them speaking. I also adored the descriptions of the Hideaway (the house) and the surrounding area, all my senses came alive.While I realize that this simple but powerful story will not be for everyone, for those who come to this book and loves it like I do, it will be a comfortable hideaway.",
