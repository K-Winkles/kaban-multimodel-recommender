                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So unique",
                "reviewText": "Charming and poignant, this ghost story is a little bit romance and a little bit women's fiction. Our hero is a ghost, so that causes plenty of tension, naturally. But as someone who exclusively reads romance novels, I wasn't making an exception for this. There's a sweet and swoony love story wrapped up in the center of a somewhat heavy book about grief and processing loss. Mixing bleak moments with hopeful ones, this intricately weaves together so many important themes in a masterful way. And the ghost puns! SO MANY ghostly references within the text, I loved it. The romance reader in me gobbled up every little bit of the romance; I personally wanted a stronger focus on that, but that's because I'm greedy. One of the best parts of the book is how it balances the light with the dark - there's as much time spent on the pain of death as there is the hope for the future. And that one-of-a-kind feel is what makes this a truly special book - a truly special romance novel - even if this romance reader wanted a stronger focus on that element.The story follows Florence, a woman who ghostwrites for a famous romance author. When her own debut novel failed, Florence was worried that her career was over, but she's found success being the woman behind the scenes. At least she did, until her own love life imploded a year ago. Now Florence is on a tight deadline to produce a happily ever after, and she just doesn't have it in her. She's starting to think that love is dead, and the sudden death of her father certainly doesn't do anything to change her mind. So when Florence's sexy and stern new editor shows up on the funeral home's doorstep - as a ghost - she's not sure what to think. Florence and Ben only met briefly before he became a ghost, and neither one is sure whether Florence is supposed to be helping Ben find peace or whether he's supposed to help Florence wrap up her novel while processing her father's death. Either way, as these two near-strangers spend time together, they begin to wish that they'd gotten closer before Ben crossed to the other side.You're probably still skeptical about whether this is a romance novel or women's fiction, because of the ghost situation. I would call this a romance novel for readers who enjoy elements of women's fiction, because the book is truly Florence's journey, and that doesn't always involve Ben. But... yeah, it's a romance too. While much of the book is emotional and full of grief (not only is Ben grappling with the fact that he's no longer amongst the living, but Florence's father has just passed away), it's also got a funny, uplifting side. It's hopeful. It's a little bit swoony. I loved the opposites attract vibes between Ben and Florence, and how they definitely wouldn't have found their way together if Ben hadn't experienced this time with her. Florence is a chaotic mess of a woman who communicates with ghosts, so that's not something the controlled, workaholic Ben would've been able to handle pre-accident. There are these tiny shifts to the dynamic along the way, and Poston does a masterful job of tying everything together perfectly. That's why this romance reader is willing to round up her rating - while I was greedy for more romance, this is the kind of book that I'm going to be reflecting on for a long time. And it had exactly the kind of ending I wanted.Audio note: The audio was excellent! The story is told exclusively from Florence's point of view, so there is just a single narrator. But she does a great job of differentiating between the characters and giving a stellar vocal performance. I found her voice soothing and easy to listen to, perfect for the many different facets of the story. The runtime was just slightly too long for one day/sitting (10-11 hours), but I was eager to pick the book back up every time I had to set it down. It also makes an awesome workday listen, because there's little to no steam (Florence and Ben literally can't touch), and the romance is an achingly slow burn. I'm sure I would've enjoyed the book in a more traditional format as well, but the audio definitely enhanced the experience.",

                "reviewText": "When I read the plot of this book, I thought it sounded great. Honestly, it was good but read more like young adult fiction than adult fiction, minus a sex scene that was not what an adult would expect but too R rated to be in a young adult novel (making it easily omitted if necessary). The narrator did a lot of reminiscing and the book read more like self discovery than romance, which was fine. The biggest issue I had was the book pandered to social issues of the time so much so that it was distracting\u2026and made the book feel unfinished in the end, since the author is so unfocused in what she\u2019s trying to say.I\u2019d recommend it as a fun read but wouldn\u2019t expect greatness. If you\u2019re looking for ghost read meets romance, I\u2019d recommend A Million Junes over this book, which is young adult but is also more focused in its message.",

It was something in between, a moment in time where two people existed at the exact same moment in the exact same place in the universe. I still believed in that- I saw it in my parents, in my siblings, in Rose's unabashed one-night stands looking for some peace. It was why I kept searching for it, heartbreak after heartbreak. It wasn't because I needed to find out that love existed- of course it did- but it was the hope that I'd find it.\"\u25fe\ud83c\udfaf What I loved: I'm always interested in how discussions of death impact life (it's actually what I wrote my thesis about in college) so the funeral home setting and conversations with ghosts really intrigued me. The references to Six Feet Under and tributes to fellow romance writers were fun and made the characters more relatable and I loved that even in a cis M/F romance, there was tons of LGBTQ+ references and language.\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f What I didn't: There were times when reading that I felt like there was a level of assumed familiarity with the characters and their backstories that I just didn't have. The book jumped from scene to scene with characters from Florence's life in New York and North Carolina quickly and there were honestly just a lot of characters that weren't significant but I felt like I needed to backtrack to remember: people from high school, friends, family, co-workers. I also wished that the story had gone more in depth with the murder case that Florence was involved in- this had the potential to be really interesting and clearly played a big role in her life but was just grazed over when finally discussed.\u25feRead if you love:* paranormal romances* books about authors/publishing* TV show Six Feet Under or movie Just Like Heaven\u25feSee also: By Any Other Name, Meet Me in the Margins, The Two Lives of Lydia Byrd",

Florence is a ghostwriter for a romance author, but after her breakup she stopped believing in love. Ben, an actual ghost\ud83d\udc7b, does believe in love but thinks he's unworthy of it (my baby deserves the world). Florence has to go back home because her father passed away, she doesn't like being in her hometown because she's always been the odd one there. Ever since she was little, she's been able to see ghosts but has been pushing them away because she just wants to be 'normal'. She can't seem to push away Ben tho. Now that he's here, he might just help her finish her manuscript. What else is he gonna do anyways. One thing leads to another and the next thing she knows, she's got feeling for a ghost. How is this gonna end?? This book was so unpredictable to me and I finished it within like 4 hours cause I had to know what was gonna happen next. Their banter was so cute and the whole dynamic between them was adorable. It was such a refreshing romance. I loved everything about it and the way the author described Florence's grief and heartbreak was so good. Will definitely pick up another one of her books!!! \ud83e\udd70",

But oh gosh, it so worked out, and it was so fun and refreshing too! I found the concept intriguing and left me chuckling and hoping for a happy ending right till the very last page. At some point I laughed it off, and correctly guessed the twist, but I couldn't be mad, I truly loved this book!",
