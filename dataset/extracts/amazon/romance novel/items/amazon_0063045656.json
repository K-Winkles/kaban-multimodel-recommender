            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cA romantic comedy delight. If you loved Schitt\u2019s Creek, It Happened One Summer will be your absolute jam.\u201d \u2014 Christina Lauren\"I put my entire life on hold the moment I opened IT HAPPENED ONE SUMMER. I read it in one long, luxurious sitting, reading each page twice, not wanting to miss a moment, and dreading The End. I knew I was reading one of my new favorite books, and I will reread it for years to come, whenever I need a dose of small-town coziness and hard-bodied sea captains. Tessa disarms you with a laugh, heats things up past boiling, and then puts a squeeze inside your heart. The tenderness, vulnerability and heat I am always guaranteed with a Tessa Bailey book are the reasons she is one of my all-time favorite authors.\" \u2014 Sally Thorne\"Tessa Bailey writes pure magic! It Happened One Summer has everything you could want in a rom-com\u2014heartwarming romance, laugh-out-loud humor, and scorching hot chemistry between the lovable socialite and sexy ship captain. I absolutely loved it!\" \u2014 Alexis Daria, bestselling author of You Had Me at Hola\"With her singular talent for writing romantic chemistry that is both sparkling sweet and explosively sexy, Tessa Bailey once again delivers\u2014It Happened One Summer is everything I want in a modern romance, with two complicated, appealing leads, a setting that feels lived-in and also fresh, and storytelling you want to sink into even as you can\u2019t stop turning pages. The total package from one of the genre\u2019s very best.\" \u2014 Kate Clayborn, author of Love at First\"Fans of 'Schitt\u2019s Creek' will love the premise of Bailey\u2019s latest work... [a] sexy, drama-filled love story. 'It Happened One Summer' is another great beach read. Plus, laying out in the sun is a perfect excuse for the blush-inducing scenes scattered throughout.\" \u2014 USA Today\"Schitt's Creek fans, this is the romance read for you.\" \u2014 PopSugar (Best Books of July)\"Her voice feels as fresh and contemporary as a Netflix rom-com... Bailey writes banter and rom-com scenarios with aplomb, but for those who like their romance on the spicier side, she\u2019s also the Michelangelo of dirty talk. She wields filth like Da Vinci does a paintbrush, and there\u2019s a lot to be said for an author who can fill such exchanges with all the requisite heat, enthusiastic consent, and yes, even humor, of such a scenario without veering into corny territory.\" \u2014 Entertainment Weekly\"Bailey strikes rom-com gold in this outstanding tale... [She] is bound to earn new followers with love scenes hot enough to boil water and a hilariously na\u00efve Schitt\u2019s Creek-inspired protagonist who is clearly out of her depth.\" \u2014 Booklist (starred review)\"Bailey delivers on her usual trifecta of sharp banter, instant chemistry, and high-heat sex scenes, but they are coupled with intense soul-searching for both Piper and Brendan... Another winning romance from an author at the top of her game.\" \u2014 Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\u201cWhen you read a book by Bailey, there are two things you can always count on: sexy, rapid-fire dialogue and scorching love scenes...\u201d \u2014 BookPage.com\"This fish-out-of-water story features quirky characters in a charming working-class small town and a steamy, feel-good romance between opposites. Schitt\u2019s Creek fans who just wanted to see Alexis get her happy ending will flock to this title.\" \u2014 Library Journal\"Steamy, sexy and fun, you\u2019ll want to soar through these pages.\" \u2014 New York Post About the Author #1 New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey can solve all problems except for her own, so she focuses those efforts on stubborn, fictional blue-collar men and loyal, lovable heroines. She lives on Long Island avoiding the sun and social interactions, then wonders why no one has called. Dubbed the \u201cMichelangelo of dirty talk,\u201d by Entertainment Weekly, Tessa writes with spice, spirit, swoon and a guaranteed happily ever after."

        "description": "The first in a spicy and unforgettable rom-com duology from #1 New York Times bestseller and tik tok favorite Tessa Bailey, in which a Hollywood \u201cIt Girl\u201d is cut off from her wealthy family and exiled to a small Pacific Northwest beach town... where she butts heads with a surly, sexy local who thinks she doesn\u2019t belong. Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father\u2019s dive bar... in Washington.Piper hasn\u2019t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won\u2019t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can\u2019t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She\u2019s determined to show her stepfather\u2014and the hot, grumpy local\u2014that she\u2019s more than a pretty face.Except it\u2019s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there\u2019s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn\u2019t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan\u2014and this town full of memories\u2014may have already caught her heart. As seen on E!Online, PopSugar, CNN, EliteDaily, Vulture, Buzzfeed, Bustle, the Nerd Daily, PARADE, LA Magazine, Country Living, USA Today, and more!",

The characters here are fully formed adults with a myriad of feelings, insecurities, and histories that shape them. Brendan is a dream of a book boyfriend and a true alpha male, human and flawed as he is. I loved him. The town itself that served as the backdrop made me want to pull up stakes and make a new start myself. This is truly a wonderful read about love conquering all. Highly recommend.",
