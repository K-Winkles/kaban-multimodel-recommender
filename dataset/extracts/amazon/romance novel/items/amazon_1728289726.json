                "reviewText": "ARC ReviewI've literally been waiting for this book since we found out about Vivian and Dante in Twisted Lies and I'm so excited that I was able to read it beforehand. Ana Huang has easily become one of my favorite authors and the way she portrays her characters is just done so well and she executed that so well in this book. I was truly amazed but how much detail and depth she added to these characters, and I feel like it's something that I don't see too much.I assumed that Vivian was going to be a soft character but she was completely different. The depth of her character was so beautifully done and I absolutely love her character because of that and since I was able to relate to her so well. The struggles that she goes through with her family is something that many children with a cultural background go through. It was just so relatable and heartbreaking the things that Vivian had to go through because of her parents, people that she expected would always be there and support her through everything. I think that the culture aspect and parent relationship was done so well and something that I heavily enjoyed since it was done well.Dante, the man he is, just non-stop hits from him because the way he tried to avert himself from Vivian but was so soft for her made me fall in love with him. I just loved everything about his character and the way that he was so straightforward about who he was and never apologetic. Although there are many male characters like this, Dante just had a way of doing that I just ate it up and I loved every bit of it.Overall, I love this book and I'm so excited for the next book, and this series as a whole. Ana Huang will always have me in a chokehold with her books because they never disappoint me and they always leave me wanting more. I heavily recommend this book and I would say that if you want a little bit more fun to start with the twisted series since Dante is introduced in Twisted Lies which made me really excited for this book. Let me know what you all think about this book!",

                "reviewText": "Ana Huang absolutely obliterates the competition once again. This book was so perfectly detailed, but at the same time, not that that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense but let me try to explain better. This book gave us so much detail. Like the perfect amount of detail if you get my drift because it is a common issue that sometimes it will be under-detailed or over-detail especially in romance books. The attention to detail, and yet the precision of not giving us too much detail was probably my favorite part of this book. It gave us enough detail that we could visualize the story, but not too much detail where we felt overwhelmed by it, and that is was the entirety of the word count. The tension, the backstory, the whole whole thing was absolutely outstanding. The reason I did doc some points only because I stop reading the book for probably a couple weeks and I came back and I was like lost. But I pick right back up after a couple chapters and that was my only gripe with this book. The spicy scenes in this book were out of this world. I can\u2019t explain about how much I loved those scenes. The. FL was a Woman after my own heart, because as the daughter of a very \u201ccontrolling father\u201d I completely got her struggle in going against her parents choices for her. This Fl was absolutely truly just so beautifully written. She was sassy and in charge and spunky when she had to be in this book and then complete personality shift and her perfectly explained. The ML in this book well, good Lord, he was beautifully explained as well. The complexities to his character in the struggle against the Fl and her family were so amazingly described. Overall, this book was absolutely amazing and I can\u2019t wait to read the sequels.8.5/10\ud83e\udd85(388pgs)",

Why did I take so long to read this??? From the first chapter, I already knew I was going to love this book. As always, Ana\u2019s writing is so easy to read and the way she develops the story and characters feels so natural without any awkwardness or plot holes.King of Wrath has arranged marriage, enemies to lovers, and forced proximity tropes and I\u2019m all for it. The tension between Dante and Vivian? \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 the spice? \ud83e\udd75 and the way their banters and talks had me giggling and smiling omfg.I loved the story and how it was written, it didn\u2019t feel forced. I loved Viv\u2019s character, I felt like I could relate with her in the sense of feeling like always having to please my family (except my parents weren\u2019t like hers lol, they\u2019re supportive of me). As for Dante? I was swooning nonstop at his words. I loved both the characters throughout the book - it kinda gave me Josh and Jules vibes, except less\u2026 hate. \ud83d\ude02I can\u2019t believe it took me this long to start this book, but I absolutely loved it. As always, def recommend! Can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the kings of sin series \u2764\ufe0f",

The way Dante and Vivian\u2019s love story was written, it\u2019s just beautiful. It\u2019s heartbreaking at some points but it\u2019s still so beautiful. Dante being so in love with Vivian, it always gave me a warm feeling in my heart whenever he showed her just how much he loved her. I got butterflies every time he said something sweet to her (or naughty hehe). Him being cold towards her in the beginning, to being the most romantic person who will do anything for her, it makes me want to cry.

                "reviewText": "King of Wrath marked the beginning of Ana Huang's new series, and I must say that she started the new era in a excellent way. King of Wrath's narrative is simple, yet cohesive and coherent. And Ana Huang's writing has evolved a lot over time,and the evolution is fully noticeable when I compare it to the first book I read by her, Twisted Love. I really like the way Ana led the story, I devoured the book in one day because I was so involved in the story.Vivian Lau is one of Ana Huang's best protagonists, in my opinion. She is simply fantastic and she has a beautiful evolution throughout the book. It was beautiful to be able to follow her evolution. Vivian had a beautiful development and all her psychological aspects were very well elaborated.Dante was a perfect character too. I've been curious about him since Twisted Hate's first appearance, and the wait to learn more about him was well worth it. Ana Huang developed all aspects of the character, from the personality to the psychological and emotional aspects.Dante and Vivian's relationship was wonderful from start to finish, and I loved the fact that Vivian stood up to Dante at every turn. Ana Huang managed to develop every detail of their story as a couple very well, from the moment they hated each other to the moment they found themselves in love. The only thing I missed was the presence of more domestic scenes between the two of them.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a good book!! The arranged marriage angst hits so good. The tension, the hate that they are feeling attracted to each other despite knowing this marriage is only of convenience, the desire to call make each other theirs, the confusion, the lust and finally the love, acceptance, partnership and possessiveness. Vivian is one hell of a strong women and Dante as dangerous as he is, compliments Vivian so beautifully, they are one of the strongest yet one of the graceful couples to exist in the King of Sin series. I thoroughly enjoyed this book !!!!",
