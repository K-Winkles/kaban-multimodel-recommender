As they come together they develop their talents to be able to overcome a multitude of hurdles and issues. The story is outstandingly engaging, a page turner that causes the reader to block out the rest of the world until it ends. Very talented writing throughout.",

I do not think estrangement of the sister nor the lapse in confessing her existence was worth such a commotion, especially since it was a new acquaintance. So some things were overblown. Loved the put- down of Amelia. I was dismayed by the use of opposite gender pronouns, missed words, opposite meaning in sentences that if the reader didn't adjust, would not make sense. I've noticed this author's books have this same issue. Otherwise liked the story.",

                "reviewTitle": "Nice story, some editing glitches.",
                "reviewText": "A clean story. A brother decrees his sister must marry a Lord he has chosen, but she negotiated that she has 3 months to find a husband of her choosing. She meets a Duke who has similar views on marriage to her, and they decide to court. Numerous obstacles arise that they need to overcomeI liked the story, but I found some of the editing a little odd. In mid chapter the next paragraph would have moved from the Duke being in conversation at his house to his friend, to him having a conversation with Georgiana at hers. Very odd, I would have expected a break or something to mark this separation. This was read on a Kindle, maybe print is different. There is also a continuity issue. Edward\u2019s sister first meets Georgiana at the modiste\u2019s , but when reconciling with her brother says it was at a bookshop. I think carefully editing could have avoided this, which was a distraction for me. Margaret also tells Edward her husband is divorcing her. As I understand it divorce then was very hard to achieve, it needed a bill approving in both Houses of Parliament, was rare, very very slow and expensive, but he is not wealthy? He may have effectively thrown her out but I am not sure he would have achieved a divorce anytime soon.Would ladies have started the scurrilous rumours about Georgiana? As Isobel says Georgiana would be Duchess so would have a powerful voice and that could have been very damaging to the ladies involved. I thought at times Edward was a bit slow, especially over discussing his sister. I find it surprising given he is a Duke that the ton would not have known of his sister and been querying where she was? Similarly I am sure some would have known who and what Lord Pembroke was, but nobody seems to have known - odd. Lastly Georgiana\u2019s brother I felt would have come to London as soon as she and the Duke wished to become engaged. There would have been the marriage settlements to sort out, plus I am sure he would have wanted to be seen with his new powerful connection.
