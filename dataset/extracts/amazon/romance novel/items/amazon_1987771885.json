He is very protective of her and considers himself her personal bodyguard so when a customer becomes aggressive he steps in and rescues her which only brings them closer.When she witnesses something she shouldn\u2019t she goes to Shane and he will do whatever is necessary to keep her safe but will the secrets they hold bring them closer or tear them apart?I am loving this series and this story is no exception.

This author failed to research dancers properly. No professional dancer (ballet or strip club) in their right mind would ever get a full pedicure! The slight hint at a BDSM lifestyle was lame and and responsible person in BDSM has a proper conversation with their partner about it and no way in hell she would call someone else Sir in front of him. There wasn\u2019t as much character building in this book as there were in previous books of hers.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure what the title has to do with the story, it's not easily linked like the first 2 books in this series. But, it's an interesting story with a wonderful and extended HEA. Usually authors give just a little epilogue to close everything up with a nice bow but this book's HEA takes up a good 10% of it which is nice, it doesn't feel rushed. You get the same care and delivery with the ending as you got with the rest of the story instead of what usually happens and that makes it even better. I did find it odd, though, that they were given an ultimatum to get out of the city by the mob boss, to which they agreed, but then they never left. That was a glaring oversight. What was the point of putting that in the story if the author was just going to ignore it? That's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5: because the author ignored a big piece of her own story.",

And any story that can make me cheer for the \u2018bad\u2019 guy has my undivided attention. Quiet, unassuming Maggie has been my favorite secondary character in the previous books. I was so excited to see that she gets her own story. I loved how what started out as a really simple juxtaposition of black and white turned into a study of shades of grey. Everything in this story, from leading man, Shane, to every other supporting cast member, and even the situation, is a lot deeper and more complex than they appear. I\u2019m so glad to know that this isn\u2019t the ending to the series I thought it was going to be. And I\u2019m happy to start the next book right away.",

                "reviewText": "Wow !!!!what a fantastic story , I happened to read the next book in the series Dirty Secrets before this one, but I don\u2019t think it mattered really the two seemed to be intertwined . Shane works as a security guy for Dominick the badass mob Boss ,his life is about to get very complicated when a young waitress Meghan / Maggie starts working at the club and he\u2019s instantly attracted to her . The club has a strict policy of no relationships between the employees , but one night after she whittnessed a violent incident at the club that rule is about to be tested to the limit. After realising that what Meghan/ Maggie saw her life is now in danger , Shane has no choice but to get her to safety . This is where it get really complicated both Shane and Meghan or Maggie as that\u2019s her real name, are obviously hiding secrets from one another and to cap it all when the past catches up with them they have to go back to Dominick to ask for his help . Will there be a HEA for them .............I\u2019m not saying \ud83d\ude09,but we definitely see exactly how brutal and cold Dominick can be towards those who have wronged him \ud83d\ude33.",

                "reviewText": "I haven\u2019t read the other books in this series, it really didn\u2019t make a difference, I thoroughly enjoyed this unique read. As I understand it Maggie made an appearance in \u2018Dirty Laundry\u2019 as she works at the same gossip magazine with Elise - however that\u2019s where the overlap ends.Maggie\u2019s latest assignment has her working undercover as a waitress at Petals, a strip club, to get juicy stories & collect the dirt on celebrities. Maggie/Meghan is the perfect example of the good girl next door....Little does she know what she\u2019s getting into when she takes this assignment.Shane is a security guard at the club and he has had his eye on Maggie for months but knows that it can go no further as the no fraternizing policy would put an end to both their jobs. He is very protective of her and considers himself her personal bodyguard so when a customer becomes aggressive he steps in and rescues her which only brings them closer.Shane and Maggie were hot together and the chemistry was intense. Plenty of action and intensity - An absolutely amazing story that guarantees to deliver.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very entertaining story featuring Maggie, a tabloid reporter who\u2019s working undercover as a waitress in a strip club and Shane, the bouncer who struggles with his forbidden attraction for her. I loved Maggie\u2019s character with her ability to convince others while lying to them that she was someone and something else \u2013 a terrific skill to have as an undercover reporter. I also loved her alter ego Meghan with her nerdy innocence and sweet charm. When it\u2019s discovered that things are not quite as they appear at the strip club, and Maggie is suddenly in danger, how far will Shane go to protect her? The story is well written, with charismatic characters and features some drama, suspense, humour and a few twists along with several steamy scenes.",
