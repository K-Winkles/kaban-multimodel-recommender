                "reviewText": "Mickey is the much adored pitcher for the Belle City Broads. The team would be softball champs if it weren\u2019t for the Gaiety Gals who are led by the wealthy and conniving Jasmine. Now the Gals have added the magical phenom Astra to their team which pushes Mickey to desperate means. They leave the Broads and join the Danger Dames who have their own magical team member, Wolfgang, who might even be a better player than Mickey or Astra. Fantastic book with great energy and illustrations. Mickey Monsoon is a heck of a character, both intense and vulnerable. I also got a kick out of the love triangle of Astra, Wolfgang, and Mickey. The rest of the team members are all pretty awesome as well. Looking forward to Book 2 in 2024.",

Great plotting and pacing, too.Cannot wait for Book 2!",

                "reviewText": "The writing was all over the place and the pacing gave me whiplash. Sometimes I couldn't tell if the book was trying to parody itself or being serious. The main character is bland, barely acts on there own, aside of being obnoxious to the rest of the cast and almost comes off like an author self insert. Even after reading this, it is hard to summarize the plot or figure out the character's motivations and goals. Everything about them is telling, not showing. Main character is apparently passionate about softball \u2026 I know this, because other characters told this.Don't get me wrong, I did expect something whacky when I read the pitch, but this was just a really disappointing read. Even the queer romance is mostly lewd jokes and characters acting very random. There was no chemistry between the mains aside of maybe one spread \u2013 no pun intended, sadly.If you just wanna read a stream of horny queer jokes without actual explicit content, go for it. If you are looking for a story and engaging characters, stay away from this.",
