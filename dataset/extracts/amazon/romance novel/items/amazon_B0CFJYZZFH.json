Such a fantastic read!And during the third innings, when Wilder and Penn entered the story, it was kicked up a notch for sure. What a dynamic friendship. I could easily read another 200 pages on these MC\u2019s. Enjoyed this book immensely. Loved it! I cannot wait for more in the series!",

                "reviewText": "I do enjoy a good age gap / forbidden romance. This was a fast paced romance between a coach & his star player. For Austin, this wasn't a slow burn. He had a sexual awakening that he laser focused on his coach. To say he was undeterred by Marcus trying to steer his flirtations elsewhere would be understating. Once Austin makes his mind up, it's game over. Marcus didn't want to give in, but after graduation, he couldn't say no anymore; Austin was just too perfect a fit for him.The book is broken up into 3 parts. It flow pretty well, there are some time jumps. We start with Austin at 18 & end up when he's 20 to 21 by the end.Overall, it was a great story. I do have some questions about Sean popping back up & I'm dying to see how Austin's career turns out post college.",

This book is a non-stop feast for the carnal senses - from Austin's porn stash to Marcus' imagination... and by the time you get to 69% of the book, you finally get full on penetration... I also love how this book intersects with the Family Sins book where we got teased about their relationship, so we see just how Austin and Marcus handle finding out about the family secrets...If you like kinky age gap romance walking the fine line between forbidden and accepted, you'll love Ball Boy!",

It was the perfect mix\u2014drive and deference.\u2019Marcus and Austin are Coach/player characters who are finding it hard to stay away from each other. As their relationship quietly and secretly develops, each find needs that the other meets.Raquel Riley creatively ties in these main characters with others from another of her books, which further adds to the tabooish artistry of these stories.Ball Boy is book 1 in the Boy Batter series, which will lead us into more MM baseball romance!",

                "reviewText": "I could not put this book down!! I loved it!! You can always count on Raquel to give you a hot flush or 10!!!I just loved Austin, he\u2019s sweet and dependable, but boy does he know what he wanted and what he wanted was Coach!He was relentless in his pursuit but not forceful. He knew he wanted a daddy and he knew it was Coach who was going to be the one to take care of him.Coach Marcus, tried his best to not cave into Austin and his charm, but let\u2019s face it he had no chance \ud83d\ude02He was a daddy, and he knew Austin would make the perfect boy, but once he gave into him his life was complete.This book was spicy, but it had all the feels and care that comes with a Daddy/Boy book. Marcus knew how to get the best out of Austin, not just in the bedroom.They had some hurdles to get over and some neighbours to deal with, but they were the perfect match and dealt with it together.I loved that the Family Sins men were introduced to this book because wilder is my baby I love him!!",
