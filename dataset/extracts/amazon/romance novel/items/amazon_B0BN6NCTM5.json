Audrina has fallen for the widow\u2019s brother, Brian, who she knew as a child, and his feelings are mutual. Her father is anti-Scotland anything. This becomes the foundation of the story. Knowing her father to be an opinionated brut, the drama is finding a way for him to allow Audrina and Brian to marry, once their secret tryst is discovered. How do they derail such a huge hurdle of her father rejecting anything to do with Scotland? There are other key characters that makes this an engaging read. For me, the beginning of the story moved slowly, but eventually events occur moving the plot along as the couple navigate various hurdles until reaching their HEA. I enjoyed the story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Many things will play into Bartley Watson\u2019s heart being changed but the biggest is how Laird Brian handles him with kindness, humbling himself and keeping his temper under control. The characters are developed so that they come alive off the page and the book is well written grammatically and flows easily making the book irresistible to put down. It\u2019s a clean stand-alone, HEA with 2 Scottish brothers to enjoy, and it includes adorable twin girls and puppies. Yes, it has it all!",
