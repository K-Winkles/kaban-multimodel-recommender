        "description": "Robyn Schneider's The Beginning of Everything is a witty and heart-wrenching teen novel that will appeal to fans of books by John Green and Ned Vizzini, novels such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and classics like The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye.Varsity tennis captain Ezra Faulkner was supposed to be homecoming king, but that was before\u2014before his girlfriend cheated on him, before a car accident shattered his leg, and before he fell in love with unpredictable new girl Cassidy Thorpe.As Kirkus said in a starred review, \"Schneider takes familiar stereotypes and infuses them with plenty of depth. Here are teens who could easily trade barbs and double entendres with the characters that fill John Green's novels.\"Funny, smart, and including everything from flash mobs to blanket forts to a poodle who just might be the reincarnation of Jay Gatsby, The Beginning of Everything is a refreshing contemporary twist on the classic coming-of-age novel\u2014a heart-wrenching story about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.

                "reviewText": "\"I still think that everyone's life, no matter how unremarkable, has a singular tragic encounter after which everything that really matters will happen. That moment is the catalyst--the first step in the equation. But knowing the first step will get you nowhere--it's what comes after that determines the result.\"So says Ezra Faulkner, the president of his high school's junior class and captain of the varsity tennis team. For Ezra, that tragic encounter is when his BMW is blindsided by a hit-and-run driver, leaving his leg shattered, his wrist injured, and ending any hopes of ever playing sports again. After spending the summer recovering from his injuries, he returns for his senior year of high school and everything is different--his girlfriend has found someone new, his friends have moved on without him, and he's not sure what life is like outside of the \"in crowd.\"But after reconnecting with his childhood best friend, and being suckered into joining the debate team, he meets Cassidy Thorpe, an intelligent, beautiful, mischievous, and mysterious transfer student who was a legendary debate competitor at a rival high school before she disappeared, only to return as a student at Ezra's high school. She forces Ezra to embrace his intelligence and realize he needs to work for his dreams instead of expecting everything to be handed to him as it always has been. And as the pair's friendship turns to romance, Ezra realizes that Cassidy is the type of girl he has been looking for all along. Until the relationship suddenly sours for reasons he can't understand.I absolutely loved everything about The Beginning of Everything. Robyn Schneider did such a terrific job creating and giving depth to her characters and creating a plot that draws you in instantaneously and hooks you completely. Schneider's dialogue is tremendously intelligent and witty without being overly precious--honestly, if she thinks this way in \"real life,\" I totally could see myself being friends with her. It truly is, as Kirkus said in its review of the book, \"Here are teens who could easily trade barbs and double entendres with the characters that fill John Green's novels.\"This is a book about trying to figure out where you belong, even though you've truly known it all along. It's about being pushed beyond your comfort zone, being forced to believe you're more than you've always thought you were, and how important it is to find friends you truly identify with rather than feel obligated to be with to uphold expectations. And more than that, this is a story about not letting your life be defined by the adversities you're dealing with.I've said quite often how impressed I've been over the last few years with the outstanding quality of YA fiction, particularly stories that aren't dystopian in nature and/or don't include vampires, werewolves, angels, or others with superpowers. (Not that there's anything wrong with those books.) While The Beginning of Everything may be classified as a YA novel, it's equally as good as--if not better--than some \"adult\" novels I've read recently. Besides, it's not every novel that makes me wish I could relive my high school days with the kind of awareness and self-confidence that the characters in this book do!",

                "reviewText": "The Beginning of Everything Book Review AG \u201cSometimes I think that everyone has a tragedy waiting for them...That everyone's life, no matter how unremarkable, has a moment when it will become extraordinary\u2026\u201d (Schneider 1). The Beginning of Everything is a novel that explores a young boy\u2019s life that has been completely turned upside down. Ezra is a teenager that has everything going for him. For instance, he is the star tennis player, a jock, and dating the popular girl Charlotte. His world is suddenly changed when he faces one tragedy that affects him physically and mentally. Ezra feels as though all humans are faced with a tragedy at least once in their lifetime. Ezra\u2019s traumatic event will never bring him back to the boy he once was. Tennis is now over for him and his reputation of a jock has now transformed into a crippled young boy. However, one day he meets the new, mysterious girl named Cassidy. Cassidy had been the leader of her former private school\u2019s debate team. Hence, she is intelligent, confident, and unpredictable. Ezra does not realize that even Cassidy, the girl who is always seeking an adventure, has a traumatic past that she keeps buried beneath the surface. The Beginning of Everything takes you into the relationship of Cassidy and Ezra and the hidden stories that will drive them apart, but will help one of them discover who they truly are.Robyn Schneider\u2019s novel is heart-wrenching, suspenseful, and worth reading. It is a book that focuses on new beginnings and accepting the past. The Beginning of Everything shows the readers that an individual does not have to remain broken, but can overcome any obstacle thrown at him/her. The book portrays the message of individuals being judged on their outside presence. Humans tend to view each other by the image cultivated in their own mind. Ezra looks at Cassidy as an intelligent girl seeking thrill and adventure. In reality, Cassidy is someone who is alone and does not seek a committed relationship. She feels as though any person she likes will leave and for that she refuses to get close with people especially the ones she loves.My sole criticism for the book, which may be the dealbreaker for some audiences, is that the plot is predictable. Hence, it contains many average stereotypes that teenagers and people in young relationships are categorized as today. I felt myself knowing the base of what would happen in the upcoming chapters without even having to read more pages. It was typical for the boy to fall in love with the girl. However, without thinking about all the stereotypes, the book has taught me and others many lessons about life. The Beginning of Everything is a well written novel that I would recommend for readers of all ages, but especially teenagers. The story is not the ending everyone is hoping for, but it is the ending that is best for the characters. The ending is for the readers to decide for themselves if the love story ends in a tragedy or a wedding. \u201cLife is the tragedy,' she said bitterly. 'You know how they categorize Shakespeare's plays, right? If it ends with a wedding, it's a comedy. And if it ends with a funeral, it's a tragedy. So we're all living tragedies, because we all end the same way... \u201c(Schneider 296). This conclusion, just like the book as a whole, was a realistic look into the lives of many young Americans today facing hardships.",

                "reviewText": "Almost everyone has experienced that moment in their life, when they stopped to take personal inventory and reflect on themselves. Ezra's moment came in the form of a car accident. He had been BMOC: dating one of the prettiest girls in the junior class, class president, varsity tennis, honors and AP classes, with a BMW. When leaving a party at the end of junior year, a black SUV rams into his roadster and never looks back. When Ezra returns to school in the fall, he is left with a sense of identity theft. He no longer understands who he is or where he fits in. This was the beginning to everything, which would shape his character and help guide him on his path to self-discovery.I loved this book. It is filled with so many colorful and interesting characters. Ezra, our poor struggling narrator, who is trying to move on with his life and deal with the loss of who he thought he was. Cassidy, the mysterious new girl, who ignites a flame in Ezra, encouraging him to function outside of other people's expectations. Toby, his estranged childhood friend, who understands that our real friends are the ones who are there for us at our lowest points.This book was honest, funny, sad, tragic. I felt all sorts of emotions. The book is filled with philosophical musings, literary discussions, mock debates and heart-to-heart discussions. I kept wanting to find out what was going to happen next and at the end, I wanted more.",
