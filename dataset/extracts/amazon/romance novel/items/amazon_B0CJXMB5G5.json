                "reviewText": "Had a lot of potential but with enough small issues what I could only give it 3.5 stars.First of all, the book was amazing until 50% then it kind of started to go off the rails.Calistas character felt inconsistent. At times she was a timid, shy, socially awkward and inexperienced young girl. Other times she was a witty and snarky adult woman with a good up bringing and a Senator for a father. It was like she had two different personalities and they didn\u2019t mesh.Then this girl - who\u2019s so timid she can\u2019t even talk to a somewhat pushy coffee store customer - gets a job as a half-naked bartender in a B-rate Hooters-esque bar? No, just no.The stalking never got intense or angsty or\u2026 thrilling. Her reaction was \u201cmeh\u2026 I think I have a stalker\u201d. Okayyyy. At no point was she scared for her life or did I feel a sense of uneasiness about the events happening. The writer could have made it so much more interesting.The interactions between Hayden and Calista started out great, but quickly delved into insta love territory, and the worst part was her self-depreciating inner turmoil about not being good enough. Towards the end the inner monologues got tedious. I just would rather action and dialogue drive the plot more than thoughts.The whole \u201cI own you now\u201d situation - while I typically love it, there is nothing better than a growly, dominant MMC - it just felt off. I was rolling my eyes over some of the interactions.On top of it all, for a stalker romance it was only mildly spicy. Granted I just got done reading a bunch of Penelope Douglas - aka the Queen of morally grey MMCs - so that has undoubtedly colored my opinion. I could only give it 2\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f.The book had a lot of potential but it kind of fell flat. I\u2019m debating if I want to read the second book just to see how the cliffhanger resolved.",

He will stop at nothing to do everything for her, but what he leaves out may not end well for them.

                "reviewText": "H-Gerard Butler (Hayden Bennett)h-Calista GreenI'm a little confused about this story. So we have Calista who just lost her dad (a senator) he was murdered and it seems he was murdered by Hayden since that's what it tells us in the 1st chapter while he is slowly becoming obsessed with her. So we have a very wealthy lawyer who is also a murderer and we are supposed to \"like\" this main character who not only kills people but possibly made a mistake and kills Calista dad in error. Yea no. I get this story is a \"stalker\" type of story but I feel like she is just too dumb. Her dad is wealthy and she spent all that money on clearing out his name and now she is not only poor but dirt poor. I don't get it. The story I feel is very well written is just too boring and a lot of internal thoughts that make no sense sometimes. I really gave this book a shot but I just couldn't continue it. I stopped at 73% chapter 33. I know that this book ends in a cliffhanger so it is not like I'm going to be getting a happy ending on this book. I just don't want to waste my time.",

I loved how possessive Hayden was from the very start, loved how he took no crap when it came to Calista. I was very nervous how it was going to play out with all the many secrets he is keeping from her. I loved how sneaky Hayden was. Not much spice but when it hit it was good \ud83e\udd2dHarper did annoy me quite a bit in this one, I just felt like her \u2018humour\u2019 was really forced and it made me roll my eyes more than made me laugh. I did like how she had Calistas back constantly.This book has it all for a dark romance- serial unaliver is a lawyer- stalking- possessive MMCDefinitely give this duet a read \ud83d\udd25",
