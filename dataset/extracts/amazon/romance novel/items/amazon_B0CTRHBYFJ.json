The two get to know each other, spend time with each other, have quite witty conversations, and fight the attraction to each other. Their obstacles are many, some self-inflicted, some inflicted by friends and family. Lady Grace has a loving but eclectic family. Her mother and father are \u2018accepted\u2019 but not up to \u2018ton\u2019 standards. Colin, an only child, is struggling with promises he has made to himself and his feelings for Grace. Deception and betrayal by someone close to them surface and cause a confrontation. Family members step up for the couple as Grace and Colin work to tame their doubts, help find trust and allow them to acknowledge their love. Unexpected help comes from a friend and an unexpected acquaintance. Grace and Colin have multiple engagements, smart and witty, sexy and sweet, hot and cold. The storyline is not new, but the characters are engaging, and my heart wanted them to find their way home together. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",

                "reviewText": "Colin was intent on marrying but he wanted to marry for convenience and not love. Grace had wanted to marry for love but being the eldest daughter of four sisters she knew she had to marry for convenience. This set the stage for Colin and Grace to court although at first they did not think they were suitable for each other so Grace had made the daring proposition that their courtship should be a fake one until they could each find their perfect match. This was a delightful tale that slowly unleashed the tentacles of love between the two hesitant participants. There was a shocking betrayal that almost thwarted this couple but luckily all worked out as love fully bloomed at the end.",

It is really fun to see how Colin winds up in a situation where he thinks he will have the upper hand and he finds it the opposite way. Grace winds up being more than he had thought and hoped for and she finds him to be more than she bargained for as well. Fun to read and makes you want to get to the end fast so you can see what happens.",

                "reviewText": "What makes this book the interesting read it is, has to be the two main characters reactions to each other. Colin Johnson, the Duke of Montgomery determined never to love a woman after watching his mother almost mourn to her own death over the loss of his father, decides to seek a wife he\u2019s not physically or emotionally attracted to so there will be no danger of love. Grace Finch the oldest daughter of five daughters of Viscount and Viscountess Crampton feels she must marry a wealthy gentleman to pave the way for her sister\u2019s because of her parent\u2019s unusual ways and irresponsible spending is introduced to Colin by her best friend Margaret. Margaret\u2019s brother William is Colin\u2019s best friend. Colin quickly takes Grace to the dance floor but his fake pleasant personality that he shows to everyone else he drops in the presence of Grace. He even demands a second dance with Grace, a sign of courtship amongst the ton, and the couple, although constantly insulting each other, come to an agreement to enter into a sham courtship. Colin seems to be cruel to Grace but underneath he is the first to begin to fall for her and it\u2019s appears he knows how to manipulate her to gain what he wants but he\u2019s not aware of some conniving individuals determined to break them apart in the end. Colin and Grace keep the story interesting with their unusual courtship and banter back and forth and Grace\u2019s parents add additional humor to the book. I do have an issue with the cover of the book. It appears to me that the male is wearing a too modern of a suit for this time period.I received a free Advanced Readers\u2019 Copy of this book but was given no monetary compensation. I read for the enjoyment and voluntarily review so that others may know what to expect and authors may be helped by critique and encouragement.",

I particularly enjoyed their playful banters and biting remarks, as well as the steamy chemistry between them.Grace, who is ashamed of her parents' unconventional behaviour, must find a husband to secure her sisters' prospects, and her mind is set on Viscount Repington.Colin is looking for a agreeable wife to please his mother, but he is determined to choose one he won't fall in love with.When they meet at a ball, he proposes to her and she refuses. But she soon realises that a fake courtship with him is the best way to overcome society's rejection of her family, even though she loathes him for his jocular behavior...If you like witty historical romances with witty dialogues, a touch of steam and mystery, you will enjoy this book.",
