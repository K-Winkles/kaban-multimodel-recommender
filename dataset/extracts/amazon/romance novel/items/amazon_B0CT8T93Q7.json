The author recommended a prequel on her website, to be read before the book, which I did. But that actually confused me a bit, as the drama as described in the prequel didn\u2019t justify the spinster\u2019s \u201ciciness\u201d to me. The book, however, reveals more detail than the prequel did and makes the spinster\u2019s attitude much more believable. So I\u2019d recommend NOT reading the website prequel!

Charles takes an instant like to Jane, and is attracted to her intelligence, wit, and assertive personality. Jane, having suffered a broken heart, is less interested in forming anything with Charles. The plot focuses on these two well-developed characters, and their emotional struggles. In addition, the author did a wonderful job in weaving in a mystery affecting other supporting characters that Charles and Jane decided to investigate together. The author did a wonderful job in creating a sweet, clean romance, and developed a captivating plot that made it easy for me to feel empathetic for all the characters\u2019 struggles. I remain a Hazel Linwood fan! A great read. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this story. Charles and Jane have a bumpy relationship. Jane is naturally cautious of men, having been jilted by her fianc\u00e9. When she meets Charles she is very defensive and it takes all his efforts to try to break through her barriers. Jane's brother is about to be married but Charles feels there is something odd about his fianc\u00e9e, Lady Daphne. Together with Jane, they try to find evidence about Daphne. Will they find the evidence before the wedding? Will Jane be able to lower her barriers? Will Charles finally win Jane's hand. Read on and enjoy.",
