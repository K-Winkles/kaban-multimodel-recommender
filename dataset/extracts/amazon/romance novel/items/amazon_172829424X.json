                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic!",
                "reviewText": "WOW. Just wow. Grippingly intense and rivetingly psychological, this story consumed me! I\u2019m both mesmerized and aghast- brilliant story telling from Sophie Lark! While I love so many of Lark\u2019s story, I can without a doubt say this is her most creatively inspired piece to date. There Are Not Saints is one of the most interesting stories I\u2019ve read in a while- a story of brilliant contrasts, one existentially bold and expertly told. Psychological thriller, dark suspense, gothic romance, angsty taboo? Everything and none of those- this story stands intrepidly on it\u2019s own. And I can not stop thinking about it.The premise alone is enough to both titillate and chill. Two rival serial killers that have combined their love of the hunt with their artistic expression engaged in a captivating game of cat and mouse, a murderous one-upping feud. Both respected artists, both rich and powerful, one more base and primitive in his antics, the other more strategic and manipulative. And one is our hero. And our young, starving artistic ingenue finds herself the center of their games- at first a survivor, then an unwitting participant, and then suddenly grappling with her own inexplicable desire for the dark and control mercurial artist whose dark edge is clearly more than an artistic persona. Intrigued? You should be. There\u2019s nothing like that- because Sophie Lark is going to make you delirious attracted to a cold, ruthless serial killer. Oh yes, it\u2019s like The Fall meets You, and I was transfixed from the first word to the last.The story unfolds like dangerous seduction- an alluringly slow burn paired with the menacing edge of psychological intensity. Like the blade of a beautiful but bloody knife- something both marvelous and fearsome. Truly, Sophie\u2019s best writing to date- vividly told, atmospherically brilliant, creatively unique, and expertly paced. But the characterization, this is where the story shines. What sets apart a true psychological thriller is just that- the psychology. The nexus of the pathos and logos that make a human mind tick- and tick in a way that isn\u2019t quite normal but still accessible, reliable. And that\u2019s what makes Cole Blackwell such an effective hero. He exudes this Ted Bundy-esque detached charm- a charismatic sophistication paired with a compelling raw magnetism. Sophie so brilliantly constructs and deconstructs this character- gives him depth and nuance that seduces us, but challenges his own essence by inserting emotional chords that are unfamiliar to him. He\u2019s unpracticed in some aspects of feeling- it unsettles but awakens him. Possessive or obsessive, terrifying or enigmatic, sexy or menacing? I don\u2019t care- I\u2019m here for it. And Sophie connects us to him as a character first intellectually, then entirely emotionally- a really brilliant way of evolving a character arc simply by the narrative duality to his point of view. You FEEL his evolution- as much as we also see it in his subtly evolving actions. And we are so wrapped in his mind- we can both recognize psychological \u201cotherness,\u201d and it makes him all the more endearing. Is swooning over a serial killer a thing?And Mara is such an effective foil- she is a FORCE. Surprisingly given how unassuming she is- slight in stature, poor, unnoticeable and powerless, yet she becomes the lynchpin of this story, all because she refuses to let go of her incredibly unsatisfactory life- and then something beautiful happens, her life becomes extraordinary. Like her artistic media, Mara is a collage of pieces- a mosaic of interesting character traits and unexpected moments of character brilliance that made her equally as psychological fascinating as her serial killer beau. We only scratch the surface of her potential to live in the grey, but the glimmers we saw here make me incredibly excited to see just what she\u2019s capable of. There\u2019s a wildness to her that I can\u2019t stop being curious about. And their chemistry is just FASCINATING. Inexplicable, consuming, taboo, toxic- yet beautiful. So much so you even forget about the world around them- because really that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s about the collision of darkness, love, and power- and how they can all find peace in the soul.\u201cEvil men always want to justify what they do\u2026.they want to push you, and bend you, and break you until you snap. Until you do something you\u2019d never thought you\u2019d do. Until you can\u2019t even recognize yourself.\u201dBe warned triggers abound. Did you not hear me say serial killer? Expect more than just the unsettling- expect the macabre in places. And Sophie dives into it with gleeful savagery. Normalizes it even- yet another brilliant stroke as we enter the mind of Cole. And it\u2019s also filthy hot- kinky Sophie Lark is definitely my favorite.This is what happens when you step outside of the box- Sophie\u2019s boldness pays off and then some. This is the kind of book that reminds me what I love reading- how words can be art, can challenge our hearts and minds. Brava. I can not wait to see how Sophie brings the story to close.",

Definitely check the trigger warnings if you\u2019re interested!!! The warnings are meant for a reason as this novel covers some pretty dark & heavy topics, but that said it conveys such emotions that we need to discuss not hide away from! It is sad that these things happen, but how the characters evolve good or bad from this experience is critical to the story!! It ends on a cliffhanger, but Main thing is a HEA in next one which is what I live for in novels!!!! No grammatical errors which is always a plus! The story flowed nicely!!!! Definitely can sense the connection loved that! Omg their fathers were such tools can\u2019t believe them! Props to the author for creating such realistic & engaging characters & plot!! The chemistry between our main characters was AWESOME!!!! Loved the forbidden romance trope!! Possesive male alpha & his love eeekkkssss :)",

(I\u2019m making it a word!) If you like Dark Romance which involves a serial unaliver falling hard in the most obsessive of ways, filled with suspense and hot chemistry, this is one to check out.Not going to lie, the morals in this one are\u2026\ud83d\udc40, and yet, I couldn\u2019t help rooting for this couple because \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.So definitely check those TWs because there are definitely some gruesome scenes and some very \u201cquestionable\u201d actions by our protagonists\u2026As for me, as soon as I turned the last page, I immediately downloaded the next!What this book is giving:\u2705 Dark Romance\u2705 Dual POV\u2705 Serial Unaliver + Struggling Artist\u2705 Obsessive MMC\u2705 Rival Serial Unaliver Nemesis\u2705 Morally BLACKRating:\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f /5\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\u00bd / 5",

But it\u2019s also very much tiptoeing the line of crime thriller. Cause you put the stalker, obsession love interests aside\u2014we are actually dealing with serial killers and murders!Like how do you redeeem a character like that? I\u2019m reading because I am intrigued to see how this is gonna be wrapped up into a HEA. And I give credit to the author for even giving this idea a go. I guess it\u2019s not so far fetched though\u2026 I mean there was an obsession and romanticization with YOU. Even I got caught up for a minute\u2014where you were actually hoping the killer didn\u2019t get caught?! Like\u2026 wtf?! I love how well developed stories can mess with your morals like that.",

I\u2019ve been wanting to read one of Sophie Lark\u2019s books forever (she\u2019s literally the reason I got KU, all the way back in September) and I\u2019m so glad I finally have. I can\u2019t say for sure if starting with the Sinners Duet was the way to go because, of course, I haven\u2019t read anything else. I can say for sure that this is one of the best dark romance books I\u2019ve ever read.Let\u2019s start off with the plot. I don\u2019t want to spoil too much (though I will provide TWs at the end) but just know that this book is chaotic af and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.Our protagonist, Mara, is amazing. I would die for her. She goes through it in this book and has for her whole life, as most DR heroines do, but she\u2019s able to get back up on her feet with Cole\u2019s support. She has some truly iconic moments. I mean, she keeps a serial killer for company. Clearly, she\u2019s a badass.Said serial killer, Cole, is a character I was truly skeptical about. I went into this book wondering how Lark was going to make that work as a love interest, but she absolutely did.I\u2019m halfway through There Is No Devil right now and I can confirm that book 2 is just as dark, steamy, and impeccable.Trigger warnings from a review on StoryGraph.
