She makes a bet with her best friend that the person who loses has to streak after the bowl game for their college football team. With her Christmas spirit back, Andi is excited to fly to her family's cabin, only to find out her flight is canceled and she has no chance of completing the list. But her luck changes when she runs into the football coach for her university who is in desperate need a break and some naughty Christmas cheer.This is a December read I was looking forward to. There's something about the coach/athlete trope that I really like. Mix that with a MWM scene and I could not wait to get my hands on this book.I liked this story, but it took some time for me to fully get on board with it. The reason for this was Andi. I love a strong heroine who is confident in who she is. I love when heroine's don't care if they're \"too much\" because they know there's nothing wrong with that. That being said, Andi was doing the absolute most in the beginning in a way that wasn't fun. I think this was mostly because of how she was written in the beginning. To me, it felt like Hailey wanted it to come across that Andi was funny, confident, strong, and carefree, but was overcompensating by making Andi do and say wild things. It felt forced and I don't love that. However, I think as the story progressed, Andi felt more authentic and true to herself as a character. She was funny, strong, confident, etc., without doing so much that she felt like a caricature of herself. I really liked her by the end and wanted to spend more time with her.I liked the spice, but I wish there was a little more. I loved the threesome scene. It was hot. Imagine being between Knox and Porter \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd75 I will say I was unprepared for Porter to LICK KNOX. Omg I was shocked to my core, but I loved it. It made me want more.I'm not a big fan when stories end on a cliffhanger, but I'm excited to find out what what happens next with this couple.Thank you Hailey for the early copy!",

Things to look for in this book:\ud83c\udf84 Holiday novella\ud83c\udf84 Age gap\ud83c\udf84 Grumpy/sunshine\ud83c\udf84 One bed\ud83c\udf84 Sister\u2019s ex-boyfriend\ud83c\udf84 Coach/student\ud83c\udf84 MFM scene (holy hotness)\ud83c\udf84 Naughty to do list\ud83c\udf84 Bisexual repWhen Andi and Porter\u2019s plans get derailed and they are forced to stay in their college town for the holidays. And unfortunately for them, things keep pushing them together. And when Andi needs someone to help he with her naughty holiday to do list, Porter volunteers himself as tribute.And what fun these two have! From all their naughty shenanigans, to all of the fun banter they have between them, these two are so full of good times and chemistry!I also love the friendly competition between Andi and Stella - and the absolute crazy things that they came up with for this list! They had me laughing out loud.My only complaint is that I felt this ended on a happy for now, but no real happily ever after. I\u2019m hoping that we get a full novel between these two to really dive into everything that they are working against them and to see if they have what it takes for a real relationship!",

                "reviewText": "Thank you to Hailey Dickert for the early copy of Merry Mischief List!When cheerleader, Andi, gets stranded at college for Christmas after bad weather cancels her flight home, she runs into Porter, the (also-stranded) coach of the football team, at the airport bar. The idea of getting stuck alone for Christmas in one of the least Christmas-y places (Florida) puts a damper on the spicy holiday to-do list she has planned. The only upside is she may have just found the perfect candidate to help her with her list.This was such a fun novella with all the smutty Christmas goodness you could ask for and I absolutely loved it. I can\u2019t wait for y\u2019all to experience the Triple Gumdrop Tower! I would love to see more of these characters in the future of the Crystal Bay University series. He calls her cupcake and I think it\u2019s super cute. Also as an Australian, I kind of loved that it was a Christmas book without snow, I feel like this never happens.But seriously, I cannot recommend this one enough! I can\u2019t wait to get a physical copy so I can annotate it.",
