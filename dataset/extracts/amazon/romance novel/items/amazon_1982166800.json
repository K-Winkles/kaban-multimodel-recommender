        "description": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In this \u201cmagical trip worth taking\u201d (Associated Press), the New York Times bestselling author of In Five Years returns with a powerful novel about the transformational love between mothers and daughters set on the breathtaking Amalfi Coast.When Katy\u2019s mother dies, she is left reeling. Carol wasn\u2019t just Katy\u2019s mom, but her best friend and first phone call. She had all the answers and now, when Katy needs her the most, she is gone. To make matters worse, their planned mother-daughter trip of a lifetime looms: to Positano, the magical town where Carol spent the summer right before she met Katy\u2019s father. Katy has been waiting years for Carol to take her, and now she is faced with embarking on the adventure alone. But as soon as she steps foot on the Amalfi Coast, Katy begins to feel her mother\u2019s spirit. Buoyed by the stunning waters, beautiful cliffsides, delightful residents, and, of course, delectable food, Katy feels herself coming back to life. And then Carol appears\u2014in the flesh, healthy, sun-tanned, and thirty years old. Katy doesn\u2019t understand what is happening, or how\u2014all she can focus on is that she has somehow, impossibly, gotten her mother back. Over the course of one Italian summer, Katy gets to know Carol, not as her mother, but as the young woman before her. She is not exactly who Katy imagined she might be, however, and soon Katy must reconcile the mother who knew everything with the young woman who does not yet have a clue. \u201cRebecca Serle is known for her powerful stories that tug at the heartstrings\u2014and her latest is just as unforgettable\u201d (Woman\u2019s World) as it effortlessly shows us how to move on after loss, and how the people we love never truly leave us.

                "reviewText": "Books that involve some kind of time traveling element that make a character examine their lives in a new way are probably my favorite kind of books. This one had the added fun of the magical setting of Positano, which I have now added to my travel wish list. I enjoyed the setting, the whimsy, and the main character's interaction with another version of her mother as the main character process her own grief. I saw one twist coming but not all of them. All good stuff.The ending and one of the twists I did not see coming are what prevent me from giving this book 5-stars. I felt that the main character's self-evaluation wrapped up a little too conveniently. I can't say much more without spoilers, which I will detail below....SEMI-SPOILERSAfter all of her pondering about how she just drifted through life, let things happen rather than making things happen, including her own relationship, I was disappointed that she then....went back to her same relationship. It was a little too convenient that oh hai this was good after all. was it, though? Or was she just vulnerable and looking for something familiar?Also - the plotline of a woman leaving her underage children in pursuit of self-fulfillment is one that pops up periodically in fiction. The unstated (or sometimes stated) point is that hey, men having been doing this for years and everyone's fine with it, why is it not ok when women do with it? People: it's not okay for ANYONE of any gender to peace out on their underage children in pursuit of self-fulfillment. Yes, it's hard and it sucks, but it sucks ever so much worse for your confused underage child(ren) for whom you are the entire world. If my husband had peaced out to find himself when I had a six month old at home, I don't think I would have been waiting for him when he came back.So, a good read, and clearly made me think even if I disagreed with the conclusions.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, first, I have to say that I didn\u2019t choose this book; it was for my Book Club & it wasn\u2019t my choice of book. I don\u2019t really like magical realism, in general. Okay, that way of the way, I was really excited to get to read this book because I heard of Rebecca Serle before & knew she was supposed to be really good (& also because the audiobook is read by one Lorelai Gilmore herself of the show Gilmore Girls; LOVED that show when I was younger)! HOWEVER, unfortunately, I had a problem with the main character, Katy. I found her to be really unlikeable; she\u2019s very selfish & very whiny! First of all, she leaves her ENTIRE grieving family & goes off to Italy, a trip that she was supposed to take with her mother before she (the mom) died. She doesn\u2019t EVEN consider taking her dad on the extra plane ticket (her mom\u2019s ticket); she actually doesn\u2019t even asked him if he\u2019ll like to go in the first place\u2014let alone also leaving behind her lovingly & supportive husband who is the SWEETEST guy, it seems, (& who also didn\u2019t do ANYTHING wrong, either) just because she\u2019s \u201cbored\u201d of him\u2014or @ least that was just the impression I got. Like she never really loved him; she just married him cause it was the \u201cright answer\u201d to the \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d question. So, then she gets to Italy & she meets her dead mom\u2014but just 30 years younger (not a spoiler; this was in the little \u201csummary\u201d for the book) & a man called Adam \u2026 oh, Adam, you really didn\u2019t need to be there \u2026 That\u2019s the \u201cromance\u201d part of the book, I guess, if you can call it that \u2026. \ud83d\ude12 Honestly, Adam came off as creepy & a little stalker-y to tell you the truth \u2026 I got the impression that he just wanted to sleep with Katy (which Spoiler Alert: he does! Totally not caring that she\u2019s MARRIED & neither does Katy, it seems)!! I didn\u2019t really FEEL the attraction between these two @ ALL!! It was just like \u201cOh, she\u2019s cute, never mind that she\u2019s married. Oh, he\u2019s handsome, never mind that I\u2019M married \u2026 \u201d , so they sleep together. That\u2019s it \u2026 \ud83d\ude12 Where\u2019s all the chemistry that usually comes with a romance?? Where\u2019s that initial first spark?? (Even in the enemies-to-lovers trope, there\u2019s usually that first \u201cspark\u201d \u2026 You can probably tell I read A LOT of Romances \u2026 \ud83d\ude05) And when they did sleep together, it was kinda \u2026 blah \u2026 No fireworks \ud83c\udf86 , if you know what I mean \u2026 \ud83d\ude09 Like honestly, Adam didn\u2019t have to be in the story at all \u2026 This could have been a lovely story about grief & coming to terms with losing your mother & then coming back to your husband \u2026 with NO Adam @ all ANYWHERE!! And that\u2019s another thing: Katy\u2019s relationship with her mother seemed REALLY unhealthy & co-dependent for a 30-year-old woman, even if you ARE really close to your mother. Like seriously, Katy asked her mother if she thinks it\u2019s okay to start having KIDS!! Like, c\u2019mon!! No, woman!! That\u2019s not something you discuss with your MOTHER\u2014even if you are close with her!! I\u2019m siding with poor Eric (her husband) on this one!! (I sorta get \u201cI broke his heart cause he was nice\u201d (I\u2019m a BIG Swiftie) vibe with their whole marriage.) Okay, now, for the BIG * Spoiler Alert * : we find out, towards the end of the book, that WHOLE time Katy sees her 30-year-old mom in Italy is because she\u2019s gone back IN TIME to the 90\u2019s!! Yep, time travel \u2026 Now, in general, I don\u2019t like time travel books (unless they involve saving a hippogriff & a man who\u2019s been wrongfully in prisoned for 12 years \ud83d\ude09; sorry, not sorry, I\u2019m a HUGE Potterhead). Think \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 or like \u201cManifest\u201d, the TV show, back in reverse, instead of 5 years in the future, Katy goes BACK 30 years in the PAST & the whole time she doesn\u2019t REALIZE it!! I\u2019m sorry, but HOW can you not realize it\u2019s the 90\u2019s!! Hello!! NO cell phones, big bulky computers, instead of iPads, the fact that EVERYONE has cash, not credit cards \u2026 !! \ud83d\ude12 I don\u2019t care that everyone reacts to grief differently, but still \u2026 I would DEFINITELY notice if my iPhone wasn\u2019t working \u2026 And that\u2019s another thing: What 30-year-old doesn\u2019t check her phone @ least once a day, even if she IS \u201ctrying to escape\u201d her life back home (even just to take pictures; she IS in ITALY, after all! C\u2019mon \u2026 !! \ud83d\ude12)!! This also means that Adam, the guy she CHEATED on her husband with, would be in his 60\u2019s in the \u201creal world\u201d when Katy sleeps with him!! I\u2019m sorry, WHAT?!?! And Katy doesn\u2019t EVER question ANY of this or freaked out, either!! In fact, we (the reader) don\u2019t ANY explanation for the time travel @ ALL!! Was it all just a crazy dream, alternative reality, a complete mental breakdown as a result of grief, what?! And that\u2019s ANOTHER thing: we (again, the reader) never really FEEL Katy\u2019s grief, either\u2014@ least that\u2019s the impression I got\u2014we are TOLD (by Katy herself) that she was EXTREMELY (again to the point of it being unhealthy) close to her mom. We don\u2019t get to see like a flashback\u2014other than 30-year-old mom in the weird time travel thing\u2014or something to when her mom WAS alive. Maybe if we got flashbacks, I would have FELT Katy\u2019s grief better, instead of just being TOLD it by Katy herself \u2026 But, anyway, I gave it 3 stars \u2b50\ufe0f because, in the end, I DID like the ending. \ud83d\ude0a Also, really liked the descriptions of Italy & Italian food \u2026 made me really want to visit Italy & try all the delicious Italian food that was mentioned! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

                "reviewText": "Love the story, had just gone to Positano this month with my daughter, son-in-law and son. She was reading this book by the pool at Hotel Poseidon where we stayed. So when we got home I decided to order the book to read. Hotel Poseidon is magical and we loved it. I love that its a story about mothers and daughters.But to the publishers of not only this book but others I've noticed lately. PLEASE make the print/ink darker, the print is very light and hard to read, I don't need glasses to read, but still find my eyes straining to read the print even in daylight by the window. I don't know if this is a way to save money on publishing the book or what but please stop scrimping on the ink. If so, how about an option to get it in darker printing, because it's so hard for most of us to read like that. Thanks.",
