                "reviewText": "I have to admit this is not really my kind of book. I was attracted to it because it is set not just in the town where I live, but in the neighborhood where I live, the lower westside of Santa Cruz, California.The plot centers on a broken family. Natalie Walker is the main character. When Natalie was a teenager, her older brother (Jake) and sister (Lynn) hosted a heavy drug party at their family house, when their mother was away. Things went bad when Natalie returned home that night, against her brother and sister\u2019s orders.Natalie ended up calling 911 in a panic, and then things got REALLY bad. Jake and Lynn ended up charged in their friend Carlos\u2019s death by OD. They went to prison for manslaughter, and Natalie was given an indefinite sentence of ostracism and guilt.Natalie, Jake, and Lynn all have separate lives now. But that night haunts every facet of Natalie\u2019s life. Nothing else \u2014 her career, her romantic life, her sense of home \u2014 will ever be right until she finds some resolution to that broken family. Even her mother does not want to see her.The trigger is her mother\u2019s death. In her will, Natalie\u2019s mother has left the family house, a seven bedroom Victorian a block from the ocean in Santa Cruz, to Jake, Lynn, and Natalie on the condition that they all get together at the house and meet to claim it with the lawyer administering the will.Natalie has a raft of problems to resolve \u2014 she\u2019s leaving a difficult job situation in Boston, in a career she doesn\u2019t really like all that much, a boyfriend who has gotten the job promotion she was hoping for, and a generally unfulfilling life. Once she reaches Santa Cruz to help fulfill the conditions of the will, her cat even goes missing.As does her brother Jake. Lynn shows up at the house, and the stress between Natalie and Lynn begins to ramp down, with the help of Lynn\u2019s young son, Kit. Really Kit is the emotional catalyst for everything that happens from then on in the story.Jake has obviously had problems. After all, he spent time in prison, and even though he now has a burgeoning, successful career as a marine biologist in Santa Cruz, he\u2019s got scars.Lynn is worse. A bad marriage, an angry, abusive husband, a danger to both her and Kit.That\u2019s the mess. From there, it is a see-saw of feel good, feel bad, feel good, feel bad, . . . story, with Natalie simultaneously trying to find Jake so that the terms of the will can be satisfied, repair her relationship with Jake and Lynn, resolve her relationship with her boyfriend in Boston, and deal with that not-so-great job situation there as well (where, just to top it off, her boyfriend will now be her boss). And find her missing cat!And there\u2019s also Asier Casillas (Dr. Casillas), a researcher at Jake\u2019s marine biology lab, a spark of new romantic interest, and, together with Santa Cruz itself, maybe the spark for a completely different direction in life for Natalie.Santa Cruz itself is as much a character in the story as the people. Its beaches, funky charm, and the fact that it still feels like home to Natalie.Stories of troubled family relationships and romantic choices are not especially in my target reading zone, so I\u2019m not going to pretend to say how other readers might like the story. It\u2019s engaging, you spend your time in Natalie\u2019s emotional world, certainly something different for me.The one thing I will say is that this is a novel with a point. There are other novels in which the author seems to create characters and a situation with its own autonomy, that will run wherever it will on its own. Godfrey, though, really wanted to take this story in a particular direction and convey a message. That\u2019s her passion here.",

I felt that near the end of the book it got rushed compared to the rest of the book; almost as if the author decided it was time to wrap the book up and just \"finish\" the remaining turmoil. Yes, Jake had changed the most and \"healed\" from going to jail, but I felt it was too easy compared to the earlier part of the book.",

                "reviewText": "The Walker family in Sierra Godfrey\u2019s debut novel, A Very Typical Family, are the victims of \u201cOne False Step.\u201d That step you take with assurance, but the instant your foot hits the ground, you know with cold, spine-tingling certainty that it was a bad move. A move with repercussions that will adversely affect your life from that moment on. For the Walkers, that false step was That Night At The House. Two of the three siblings went to prison. The third, Natalie, isolated herself on the other side of the country. The family was broken.Then fifteen years later, their mother dies and leaves them her house. The three of them must collect their inheritance together. Somehow, they have to do the impossible, overcome that false step and all its repercussions. If this sounds sad and heavy, it isn\u2019t. Sierra Godfrey deftly reweaves the threads from this tragic backstory into a relatable, enjoyable novel that keeps you glued to the pages to the very satisfying end. Even though the book deals with issues of pain, regret, and remorse it is a remarkably happy story that will leave you with a smile. I don\u2019t know how the author did this, but I\u2019m eager to see her do it again!",
