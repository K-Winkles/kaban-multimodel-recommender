        "description": "Romance novelist Liam Bradley (Dylan Bruce) has already found massive success with three books written under the pen name Gabriel August, but he's mysteriously unknown to his legions of readers. With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie's home town of Portland, Maine, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry. Liam's agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August's true identity, but Sophie doesn't know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to light? A Hallmark original movie.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who has been through much of what these two go together combined, I can state clearly that there is not much BS in this movie. To the rest of the planet, it may seem so, but dealing with a difficult past is always a complex challenge. And then there is Amy Acker, who many find painful. I find her very human, which can be painful at a time when one is seeking affection within and without. Dylan Bruce has the same sticky wicket on a different playing field. And so they stumble along finding themselves and each other.Love seekers are often portrayed on a linear path with a small off-course excursion into dispute before happily reuniting. In reality, it is always a tough and long row to hoe. Finding each other and oneself is far more than the passion of the first kiss or a burning look. More often than not, a clean slate is unreachable and therefore the protagonists need to clear out the old baggage in their closets and rebond through restored trust - in oneself and the other.",

This is a very sweet story of a chance meeting between Amy Acker and Dylan Bruce who meet on a jet.Sophie, [Amy] was hurt in the past and not ready to take a chance again. However, she begins to fall for this man who is a famous writer. That is the last thing she wants is to get involved with someone famous. There are many twists and turns this story takes but it is a great payoff in the last few minutes as the movie ends.Amy Acker is so sweet and fragile you really believe in her character. She can be so timid, meek, and damaged in this movie. Then watch her as she plays Root in Person of Interest and she is a female Terminator! This woman should have been cast in a block buster movie by now as she most surely can portray any type of character.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fairly standard Hallmark movie. The idea is that the main character is a famous novelist who writes under a pseudonym. He happens to meet a very nice girl on a plane and they strike up a friendship without him telling her who he is. She happens to be a book reviewer who is in the process of writing a mediocre review for his most recent book. The rest of the movie deals with them becoming close but ending up having problems related to keeping secret identities. If you like the kind of movie where love blossoms without one of the people revealing he or she is famous, then you will probably like this movie. I consider it to be well done for the type of movie it is. There are a couple of mildly interesting secondary characters who don't play a huge part in the story but who are likable. Overall this whole film is pretty likable if not hugely memorable.",
