Most of the book moves along telling a story different from the hundreds of stories I have read that take place in the American west. There is a goal set but once the goal is reached it seems as if the author does not know how to end the book. Maybe as much as 4/5ths of the book is a good read. The ending needs a lot of work. It is worth reading.",
