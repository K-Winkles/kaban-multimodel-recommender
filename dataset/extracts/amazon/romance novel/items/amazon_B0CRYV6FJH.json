It is anchored by the lovely and loving heroine following her own heart and the beleaguered Duke who is a true hero suffering following his heroic acts. Arabella, seeing with her pure heart, treats the Duke as a normal person, not a person subsumed by his scars. His craving for normality and her recognition of his own gentle and kind nature draws them together into love despite a number of unusual hurdles to leap. There is even a lovely twist in the end \u2013 and a stronger than usual HEA. So Lovely! Thank you so much for writing such an exceptional book. The story is outstanding.",

                "reviewText": "This story involves two characters, each carrying secrets. Arabella chooses to work as a maid for a duke she knew had scars inside and out. Henry hires Arabella as a maid, and finds her effervescent, strong-willed personality very appealing. Their friendship blossoms, and then the author strategically weaves in drama and mystery. As they attempt to keep their relationship a secret, events occur testing their resolve and future. It is a clean romance, with strong characters, and well-defined foundation for the plot. The author did a great job in creating conflict in the form of betrayals, manipulations, and surprises.I enjoyed the story, but some areas were slightly puzzling to me. Without disclosing spoilers, I was expecting a different outcome when it came to the introduction of a relative, and I personally didn\u2019t feel closure with two characters that had a dramatic role early in the story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",
