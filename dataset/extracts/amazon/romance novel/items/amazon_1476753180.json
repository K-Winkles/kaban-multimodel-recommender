Chapter One: Tate chapter one TATE \u201cSomebody stabbed you in the neck, young lady.\u201d My eyes widen, and I slowly turn toward the elderly gentleman standing at my side. He presses the up button on the elevator and faces me. He smiles and points to my neck. \u201cYour birthmark,\u201d he says. My hand instinctively goes up to my neck, and I touch the dime-sized mark just below my ear. \u201cMy grandfather used to say the placement of a birthmark was the story of how a person lost the battle in their past life. I guess you got stabbed in the neck. Bet it was a quick death, though.\u201d I smile, but I can\u2019t tell if I should be afraid or entertained. Despite his somewhat morbid opening conversation, he can\u2019t be that dangerous. His curved posture and shaky stance give away that he isn\u2019t a day less than eighty years old. He takes a few slow steps toward one of two velvet red chairs that are positioned against the wall next to the elevator. He grunts as he sinks into the chair and then looks up at me again. \u201cYou going up to floor eighteen?\u201d My eyes narrow as I process his question. He somehow knows what floor I\u2019m going to, even though this is the first time I\u2019ve ever set foot in this apartment complex, and it\u2019s definitely the first time I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on this man. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cDo you work here?\u201d \u201cI do indeed.\u201d He nods his head toward the elevator, and my eyes move to the illuminated numbers overhead. Eleven floors to go before it arrives. I pray it gets here quickly. \u201cI push the button for the elevator,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an official title for my position, but I like to refer to myself as a flight captain, considering I do send people as high as twenty stories up in the air.\u201d I smile at his words, since my brother and father are both pilots. \u201cHow long have you been flight captain of this elevator?\u201d I ask as I wait. I swear this is the slowest damn elevator I\u2019ve ever encountered. \u201cSince I got too old to do maintenance on this building. Worked here thirty-two years before I became captain. Been sending people on flights now for more than fifteen years, I think. Owner gave me a pity job to keep me busy till I died.\u201d He smiles to himself. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t realize is that God gave me a lot of great things to accomplish in my life, and right now, I\u2019m so far behind I ain\u2019t ever gonna die.\u201d I find myself laughing when the elevator doors finally open. I reach down to grab the handle of my suitcase and turn to him one more time before I step inside. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cSamuel, but call me Cap,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody else does.\u201d \u201cYou got any birthmarks, Cap?\u201d He grins. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. Seems in my past life, I was shot right in the ass. Must have bled out.\u201d I smile and bring my hand to my forehead, giving him a proper captain\u2019s salute. I step into the elevator and turn around to face the open doors, admiring the extravagance of the lobby. This place seems more like a historic hotel than an apartment complex, with its expansive columns and marble floors. When Corbin said I could stay with him until I found a job, I had no idea he lived like an actual adult. I thought it would be similar to the last time I visited him, right after I graduated from high school, back when he had first started working toward his pilot\u2019s license. That was four years and a two-story sketchy complex ago. That\u2019s kind of what I was expecting. I certainly wasn\u2019t anticipating a high-rise smack dab in the middle of downtown San Francisco. I find the panel and press the button for the eighteenth floor, then look up at the mirrored wall of the elevator. I spent all day yesterday and most of this morning packing up everything I own from my apartment back in San Diego. Luckily, I don\u2019t own much. But after making the solo five-hundred-mile drive today, my exhaustion is pretty evident in my reflection. My hair is in a loose knot on top of my head, secured with a pencil, since I couldn\u2019t find a hair tie while I was driving. My eyes are usually as brown as my hazelnut hair, but right now, they look ten shades darker, thanks to the bags under them. I reach into my purse to find a tube of ChapStick, hoping to salvage my lips before they end up as weary-looking as the rest of me. As soon as the elevator doors begin to close, they open again. A guy is rushing toward the elevators, preparing to walk on as he acknowledges the old man. \u201cThanks, Cap,\u201d he says. I can\u2019t see Cap from inside the elevator, but I hear him grunt something in return. He doesn\u2019t sound nearly as eager to make small talk with this guy as he was with me. This man looks to be in his late twenties at most. He grins at me, and I know exactly what\u2019s going through his mind, considering he just slid his left hand into his pocket. The hand with the wedding ring on it. \u201cFloor ten,\u201d he says without looking away from me. His eyes fall to what little cleavage is peeking out of my shirt, and then he looks at the suitcase by my side. I press the button for floor ten. I should have worn a sweater. \u201cMoving in?\u201d he asks, blatantly staring at my shirt again. I nod, although I doubt he notices, considering his gaze isn\u2019t planted anywhere near my face. \u201cWhat floor?\u201d Oh, no, you don\u2019t. I reach beside me and cover all the buttons on the panel with my hands to hide the illuminated eighteenth-floor button, and then I press every single button between floors ten and eighteen. He glances at the panel, confused. \u201cNone of your business,\u201d I say. He laughs. He thinks I\u2019m kidding. He arches his dark, thick eyebrow. It\u2019s a nice eyebrow. It\u2019s attached to a nice face, which is attached to a nice head, which is attached to a nice body. A married body. Asshole. He grins seductively after seeing me check him out\u2014only I wasn\u2019t checking him out the way he thinks I was. In my mind, I was wondering how many times that body has been pressed against a girl who wasn\u2019t his wife. I feel sorry for his wife. He\u2019s looking at my cleavage again when we reach floor ten. \u201cI can help you with that,\u201d he says, nodding toward my suitcase. His voice is nice. I wonder how many girls have fallen for that married voice. He walks toward me and reaches to the panel, bravely pressing the button that closes the doors. I hold his stare and press the button to open the doors. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d He nods as if he understands, but there\u2019s still a wicked gleam in his eyes that reaffirms my immediate dislike of him. He steps out of the elevator and turns to face me before walking away. \u201cCatch you later, Tate,\u201d he says, just as the doors close. I frown, not comfortable with the fact that the only two people I\u2019ve interacted with since walking into this apartment building already know who I am. I remain alone on the elevator as it stops on every single floor until it reaches the eighteenth. I step off, pull my phone out of my pocket, and open up my messages to Corbin. I can\u2019t remember which apartment number he said was his. It\u2019s either 1816 or 1814. Maybe it\u2019s 1826? I come to a stop at 1814, because there\u2019s a guy passed out on the floor of the hallway, leaning against the door to 1816. Please don\u2019t let it be 1816. I find the message on my phone and cringe. It\u2019s 1816. Of course it is. I walk slowly to the door, hoping I don\u2019t wake up the guy. His legs are sprawled out in front of him, and he\u2019s leaning with his back propped up against Corbin\u2019s door. His chin is tucked to his chest, and he\u2019s snoring. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, my voice just above a whisper. He doesn\u2019t move. I lift my leg and poke his shoulder with my foot. \u201cI need to get into this apartment.\u201d He rustles and then slowly opens his eyes and stares straight ahead at my legs. His eyes meet my knees, and his eyebrows furrow as he slowly leans forward with a deep scowl on his face. He lifts a hand and pokes my knee with his finger, almost as if he\u2019s never seen a knee before. He drops his hand, closes his eyes, and falls back asleep against the door. Great. Corbin won\u2019t be back until tomorrow, so I dial his number to see if this guy is someone I should be concerned about. \u201cTate?\u201d he asks, answering his phone without a hello. \u201cYep,\u201d I reply. \u201cMade it safe, but I can\u2019t get in because there\u2019s a drunk guy passed out at your front door. Suggestions?\u201d \u201cEighteen sixteen?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re at the right apartment?\u201d \u201cPositive.\u201d \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s drunk?\u201d \u201cPositive.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s he wearing?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want to know what he\u2019s wearing?\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019s wearing a pilot\u2019s uniform, he probably lives in the building. The complex contracts with our airline.\u201d This guy isn\u2019t wearing any type of uniform, but I can\u2019t help but notice that his jeans and black T-shirt do fit him very nicely. \u201cNo uniform,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you get past him without waking him up?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to move him. He\u2019ll fall inside if I open the door.\u201d He\u2019s quiet for a few seconds while he thinks. \u201cGo downstairs and ask for Cap,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him you were coming tonight. He can wait with you until you\u2019re inside the apartment.\u201d I sigh, because I\u2019ve been driving for six hours, and going all the way back downstairs is not something I feel like doing right now. I also sigh because Cap is the last person who could probably help in this situation. \u201cJust stay on the phone with me until I\u2019m inside your apartment.\u201d I like my plan a lot better. I balance my phone against my ear with my shoulder and dig inside my purse for the key Corbin sent me. I insert it into the lock and begin to open the door, but the drunk guy begins to fall backward with every inch the door opens. He groans, but his eyes don\u2019t open again. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad he\u2019s wasted,\u201d I tell Corbin. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad-looking.\u201d \u201cTate, just get your ass inside and lock the door so I can hang up.\u201d I roll my eyes. He\u2019s still the same bossy brother he always was. I knew that moving in with him would not be good for our relationship, considering how fatherly he acted toward me when we were younger. However, I had no time to find a job, get my own apartment, and get settled before my new classes started, so it left me with little choice. I\u2019m hoping things will be different between us now, though. Corbin is twenty-five, and I\u2019m twenty-three, so if we can\u2019t get along better than we did as kids, we\u2019ve got a lot of growing up left to do. I guess that mostly depends on Corbin and whether he\u2019s changed since we last lived together. He had an issue with anyone I dated, all of my friends, every choice I made\u2014even what college I wanted to attend. Not that I ever paid any attention to his opinion, though. The distance and time apart has seemed to get him off my back for the last few years, but moving in with him will be the ultimate test of our patience. I wrap my purse around my shoulder, but it gets caught on my suitcase handle, so I just let it fall to the floor. I keep my left hand wrapped tightly around the doorknob and hold the door shut so the guy won\u2019t fall completely into the apartment. I take my foot and press it against his shoulder, pushing him from the center of the doorway. He doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cCorbin, he\u2019s too heavy. I\u2019m gonna have to hang up so I can use both hands.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t hang up. Just put the phone in your pocket, but don\u2019t hang up.\u201d I look down at the oversized shirt and leggings I have on. \u201cNo pockets. You\u2019re going in the bra.\u201d Corbin makes a gagging sound as I pull the phone from my ear and shove it inside my bra. I remove the key from the lock and drop it toward my purse, but it misses and falls to the floor. I reach down to grab the drunk guy so I can move him out of the way. \u201cAll right, buddy,\u201d I say, struggling to pull him away from the center of the doorway. \u201cSorry to interrupt your nap, but I need inside this apartment.\u201d I somehow manage to prop him up against the doorframe to prevent him from falling into the apartment, and then I push the door open farther and turn to get my things. Something warm wraps around my ankle. I freeze. I look down. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d I yell, kicking at the hand that\u2019s gripping my ankle so tightly I\u2019m pretty sure it might bruise. The drunk guy is looking up at me now, and his grip sends me falling backward into the apartment when I try to pull away from him. \u201cI need to get in there,\u201d he mutters, just as my butt meets the floor. He makes an attempt to push the apartment door open with his other hand, and this immediately sends me into panic mode. I pull my legs the rest of the way inside, and his hand comes with me. I use my free leg to kick the door shut, slamming it directly onto his wrist. \u201cShit!\u201d he yells. He\u2019s trying to pull his hand back into the hallway with him, but my foot is still pressing against the door. I release enough pressure for him to have his hand back, and then I immediately kick the door all the way shut. I pull myself up and lock the door, the dead bolt, and the chain lock as quickly as I can. As soon as my heart rate begins to calm down, it starts to scream at me. My heart is actually screaming at me. In a deep male voice. It sounds like it\u2019s yelling, \u201cTate! Tate!\u201d Corbin. I immediately look down at my chest and pull my phone out of my bra, then bring it up to my ear. \u201cTate! Answer me!\u201d I wince, then pull the phone several inches from my ear. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, out of breath. \u201cI\u2019m inside. I locked the door.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he says, relieved. \u201cYou scared me to death. What the hell happened?\u201d \u201cHe was trying to get inside. I locked the door, though.\u201d I flip on the living-room light and take no more than three steps inside before I come to a halt. Good going, Tate. I slowly turn back toward the door after realizing what I\u2019ve done. \u201cUm. Corbin?\u201d I pause. \u201cI might have left a few things outside that I need. I would just grab them, but the drunk guy thinks he needs to get inside your apartment for some reason, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m opening that door again. Any suggestions?\u201d He\u2019s silent for a few seconds. \u201cWhat did you leave in the hallway?\u201d I don\u2019t want to answer him, but I do. \u201cMy suitcase.\u201d \u201cChrist, Tate,\u201d he mutters. \u201cAnd\u2026 my purse.\u201d \u201cWhy the hell is your purse outside?\u201d \u201cI might have also left the key to your apartment on the hallway floor.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even respond to that one. He just groans. \u201cI\u2019ll call Miles and see if he\u2019s home yet. Give me two minutes.\u201d \u201cWait. Who\u2019s Miles?\u201d \u201cHe lives across the hall. Whatever you do, don\u2019t open the door again until I call you back.\u201d Corbin hangs up, and I lean against his front door. I\u2019ve lived in San Francisco all of thirty minutes, and I\u2019m already being a pain in his ass. Figures. I\u2019ll be lucky if he lets me stay here until I find a job. I hope that doesn\u2019t take long, considering I applied for three RN positions at the closest hospital. It might mean working nights, weekends, or both, but I\u2019ll take what I can get if it prevents me from having to dip into savings while I\u2019m back in school. My phone rings. I slide my thumb across the screen and answer it. \u201cHey.\u201d \u201cTate?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d I reply, wondering why he always double-checks to see if it\u2019s me. He called me, so who else would be answering it who sounds exactly like me? \u201cI got hold of Miles.\u201d \u201cGood. Is he gonna help me get my stuff?\u201d \u201cNot exactly,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cI kind of need you to do me a huge favor.\u201d My head falls against the door again. I have a feeling the next few months are going to be full of inconvenient favors, since he knows he\u2019s doing me a huge one by letting me stay here. Dishes? Check. Corbin\u2019s laundry? Check. Corbin\u2019s grocery shopping? Check. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d I ask him. \u201cMiles kind of needs your help.\u201d \u201cThe neighbor?\u201d I pause as soon as it clicks, and I close my eyes. \u201cCorbin, please don\u2019t tell me the guy you called to protect me from the drunk guy is the drunk guy.\u201d Corbin sighs. \u201cI need you to unlock the door and let him in. Let him crash on the couch. I\u2019ll be there first thing in the morning. When he sobers up, he\u2019ll know where he is, and he\u2019ll go straight home.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWhat kind of apartment complex are you living in? Do I need to prepare to be groped by drunk people every time I come home?\u201d Long pause. \u201cHe groped you?\u201d \u201c?\u2018Grope\u2019 might be a bit strong. He did grab my ankle, though.\u201d Corbin lets out a sigh. \u201cJust do this for me, Tate. Call me back when you\u2019ve got him and all your stuff inside.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d I groan, recognizing the worry in his voice. I hang up with Corbin and open the door. The drunk guy falls onto his shoulder, and his cell phone slips from his hand and lands on the floor next to his head. I flip him onto his back and look down at him. He cracks his eyes open and attempts to look up at me, but his eyelids fall shut again. \u201cYou\u2019re not Corbin,\u201d he mutters. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. But I am your new neighbor, and from the looks of it, you\u2019re about to owe me at least fifty cups of sugar.\u201d I lift him by his shoulders and try to get him to sit up, but he doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think he can, actually. How does a person even get this drunk? I grab his hands and pull him inch by inch into the apartment, stopping when he\u2019s just far enough inside for me to be able to close the door. I retrieve all of my things from outside the apartment, then shut and lock the front door. I grab a throw pillow from the couch, prop his head up, and roll him onto his side in case he pukes in his sleep. And that\u2019s all the help he\u2019s getting from me. When he\u2019s comfortably asleep in the middle of the living-room floor, I leave him there while I look around the apartment. The living room alone could fit three of the living rooms from Corbin\u2019s last apartment. The dining area is open to the living room, but the kitchen is separated from the living room by a half-wall. There are several modern paintings throughout the room, and the thick, plush sofas are a light tan, offsetting the vibrant paintings. The last time I stayed with him, he had a futon, a beanbag chair, and posters of models on the walls. I think my brother might finally be growing up. \u201cVery impressive, Corbin,\u201d I say out loud as I walk from room to room and flip on all the lights, inspecting what has just become my temporary home. I kind of hate that it\u2019s so nice. It\u2019ll make it harder to want to find my own place once I get enough money saved up. I walk into the kitchen and open the refrigerator. There\u2019s a row of condiments in the door, a box of leftover pizza on the middle shelf, and a completely empty gallon of milk still sitting on the top shelf. Of course he doesn\u2019t have groceries. I can\u2019t have expected him to change completely. I grab a bottled water and exit the kitchen to go search for the room I\u2019ll be living in for the next few months. There are two bedrooms, so I take the one that isn\u2019t Corbin\u2019s and set my suitcase on top of the bed. I have about three more suitcases and at least six boxes down in the car, not to mention all my clothes on hangers, but I\u2019m not about to attempt those tonight. Corbin said he\u2019d be back in the morning, so I\u2019ll leave that to him. I change into a pair of sweats and a tank top, then brush my teeth and get ready for bed. Normally, I would be nervous about the fact that there\u2019s a stranger in the same apartment I\u2019m in, but I have a feeling I don\u2019t need to worry. Corbin would never ask me to help someone he felt might be a threat to me in any way. Which confuses me, because if this is common behavior for Miles, I\u2019m surprised Corbin asked me to bring him inside. Corbin has never trusted guys with me, and I blame Blake for that. He was my first serious boyfriend when I was fifteen, and he was Corbin\u2019s best friend. Blake was seventeen, and I had a huge crush on him for months. Of course, my friends and I had huge crushes on most of Corbin\u2019s friends, simply because they were older than we were. Blake would come over most weekends to stay the night with Corbin, and we always seemed to find a way to spend time together when Corbin wasn\u2019t paying attention. One thing led to another, and after several weekends of sneaking around, Blake told me he wanted to make our relationship official. The problem Blake didn\u2019t foresee was how Corbin would react once Blake broke my heart. And boy, did he break it. As much as a fifteen-year-old heart can be broken after the span of a two-week secret relationship. Turned out he was officially dating quite a few girls during the two weeks he was with me. Once Corbin found out, their friendship was over, and all of Corbin\u2019s friends were warned not to come near me. I found it almost impossible to date in high school until after Corbin finally moved away. Even then, though, the guys had heard horror stories and tended to steer clear of Corbin\u2019s little sister. As much as I hated it then, I would more than welcome it now. I\u2019ve had my fair share of relationships go wrong since high school. I lived with my most recent boyfriend for more than a year before we realized we wanted two separate things out of life. He wanted me home. I wanted a career. So now I\u2019m here. Pursuing my master\u2019s degree in nursing and doing whatever I can to avoid relationships. Maybe living with Corbin won\u2019t be such a bad thing after all. I head back to the living room to turn out the lights, but when I\u2019ve rounded the corner, I come to an immediate halt. Not only is Miles up off the floor, but he\u2019s in the kitchen, with his head pressed against his arms and his arms folded on top of the kitchen counter. He\u2019s seated on the edge of a bar stool, and he looks as if he\u2019s about to fall off it any second. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s sleeping again or just attempting to recover. \u201cMiles?\u201d He doesn\u2019t move when I call his name, so I walk toward him and gently lay my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake. The second my fingers squeeze his shoulder, he gasps and sits up straight as if I just woke him from the middle of a dream. Or a nightmare. Immediately, he slides off the stool and onto very unstable legs. He begins to sway, so I throw his arm over my shoulder and try to walk him out of the kitchen. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the couch, buddy.\u201d He drops his forehead to the side of my head and stumbles along with me, making it even harder to hold him up. \u201cMy name isn\u2019t Buddy,\u201d he slurs. \u201cIt\u2019s Miles.\u201d We make it to the front of the couch, and I start to peel him off me. \u201cOkay, Miles. Whoever you are. Just go to sleep.\u201d He falls onto the couch, but he doesn\u2019t let go of my shoulders. I fall with him and immediately attempt to pull away. \u201cRachel, don\u2019t,\u201d he begs, grabbing me by the arm, trying to pull me to the couch with him. \u201cMy name isn\u2019t Rachel,\u201d I say, freeing myself from his iron grip. \u201cIt\u2019s Tate.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I clarify what my name is, because it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll remember this conversation tomorrow. I walk to where the throw pillow is and pick it up off the floor. I pause before handing it back to him, because he\u2019s on his side now, and his face is pressed into the couch cushion. He\u2019s gripping the couch so tightly his knuckles are white. At first, I think he\u2019s about to get sick, but then I realize how incredibly wrong I am. He\u2019s not sick. He\u2019s crying. Hard. So hard he isn\u2019t even making a sound. I don\u2019t even know the guy, but the obvious devastation he\u2019s experiencing is difficult to witness. I look down the hallway and back to him, wondering if I should leave him alone in order to give him privacy. The last thing I want to do is get tangled up in someone\u2019s issues. I\u2019ve successfully avoided most forms of drama in my circle of friends up to this point, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to start now. My first instinct is to walk away, but for some reason, I find myself oddly sympathetic toward him. His pain actually appears genuine and not just the result of an overconsumption of alcohol. I lower myself to my knees in front of him and touch his shoulder. \u201cMiles?\u201d He inhales a huge breath, slowly lifting his face to look at me. His eyes are mere slits and bloodshot red. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a result of the crying or the alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Rachel,\u201d he says, lifting a hand out toward me. He wraps it around the back of my neck and pulls me forward toward him, burying his face in the crevice between my neck and shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I have no idea who Rachel is or what he did to her, but if he\u2019s hurting this bad, I shudder to think what she\u2019s feeling. I\u2019m tempted to find his phone and search for her name and call her so she can come rectify this. Instead, I gently push him back into the couch. I lay his pillow down and urge him onto it. \u201cGo to sleep, Miles,\u201d I say gently. His eyes are so full of hurt when he drops to the pillow. \u201cYou hate me so much,\u201d he says as he grabs my hand. His eyes fall shut again, and he releases a heavy sigh. I stare at him silently, allowing him to keep hold of my hand until he\u2019s quiet and still and there aren\u2019t any more tears. I pull my hand away from his, but I stay by his side for a few minutes longer. Even though he\u2019s asleep, he somehow still looks as if he\u2019s in a world of pain. His eyebrows are furrowed, and his breathing is sporadic, failing to fall into a peaceful pattern. For the first time, I notice a faint, jagged scar, about four inches long, that runs smoothly across the entire right side of his jaw. It stops just two inches shy of his lips. I have the strange urge to touch it and run my finger down the length of it, but instead, my hand reaches up to his hair. It\u2019s short on the sides, a little longer on the top, and just the perfect blend of brown and blond. I stroke his hair, comforting him, even though he may not deserve it. This guy may deserve every single bit of the remorse he\u2019s feeling for whatever he did to Rachel, but at least he\u2019s feeling it. I have to give him that much. Whatever he did to Rachel, at least he loves her enough to regret it. Read more"

        "description": "From Colleen Hoover, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of It Starts with Us and It Ends with Us, aheart-wrenching love story that proves attraction at first sight can be messy. When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she doesn't think it's love at first sight. They wouldn\u2019t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn\u2019t want love, she doesn\u2019t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her. Never ask about the past. Don\u2019t expect a future. They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can\u2019t handle it at all. Hearts get infiltrated. Promises get broken. Rules get shattered. Love gets ugly.",

Completely and 100% blew me away\u2026not that I\u2019m surprised or anything because she never ceases to amaze me but\u2026OMG! Let the book hangover commence because this one is going to be a doozy to recover from. I was pulled in from the beginning and giving the angsty ride of my life...and I loved every second of it!Elizabeth Tate Collins...where do I begin with Tate. I freakin adored her...I couldn\u2019t help myself. I can\u2019t even tell you the exact moment when it happened or what pushed me over the edge\u2026she took me by storm. Tate really is a force to be reckoned with. She\u2019s so freaking smart\u2026already a nurse at the age of 23 and pursuing her master\u2019s degree in nursing\u2026she\u2019s driven, focused and determined\u2026genuine, kind and caring\u2026but she\u2019s not a pushover. I loved her sense of humor\u2026she\u2019s sweet, funny and sassy. She\u2019s got her own little quirks but I just found them more adorable. I liked her attitude and I think, as usual, the key for me was that I was totally emotional connected to her. Everything she felt\u2026I felt. I related to her in some ways, but that wasn\u2019t even the half of what drew me to her. Tate is a very compelling heroine\u2026she\u2019s just one of these extremely relatable girls that is easy to fall in love with\u2026and it\u2019s easy to see why Miles did as well..\u2018Something strange is going on in my chest. A flutter, flutter kind of thing. I hate it, because I know what it means. It means my body is really starting to like Miles.I just hope my brain never catches up.'Miles Mikel Archer...oh Jesus Lord in heaven this boy, where do I even begin. He stole my heart\u2026held my heart...he crushed my heart...and then he healed my heart. As closed off and emotionally detached as Miles was, I was still incredibly drawn to him...and that's saying something considering I am an emotional reader. I think it's because the glimpses of emotion that we get in the beginning from him are like moments of gold...I clung to those because they were just...so amazing! Knowing how much those affected me...how could I not want more?!? I swear\u2026the moment he stroked Tate\u2019s foot and cracked a smile I was DONE FOR people. Just done. I know\u2026I sound crazy, but that boy melted my heart and he continued to do so for the remaining 80% of the book. Oh Miles\u2026Miles Miles Miles\u2026every time I thought I had no more feels left to give\u2026he painfully extracted them from my body\u2026every time I thought he cannot be more perfect (yes\u2026even with his walls!)\u2026he proved me wrong with his words and actions. Miles is very understated...he\u2019s sexy but it\u2019s not shoved in your face and he doesn\u2019t act like a conceited @#% hat. He\u2019s successful but he doesn\u2019t brag about it or let it go to his head. He\u2019s sweet, kind and thoughtful\u2026but its like he doesn\u2019t want anyone to know. But Tate knows\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve always been a sucker for the quiet types of guys. Primarily because most guys talk too much, and it\u2019s painful having to suffer through every single thought that goes through their heads. Miles makes me wish he were the opposite of the quiet type, though. I want to know all the thoughts that pass through his head. Especially the one thought that\u2019s in there right now, hiding behind that unwavering, stoic expression.\u2019Hmm...how do I describe Miles and Tate...hot...sensual...electric...passionate...just YES! How can it not be? Their relationship is based of one thing...sex. Now\u2026before we get crazy, it\u2019s not erotica, it\u2019s tasteful but it\u2019s still sexy as hell. Heck\u2026everything about Miles and Tate was sexy and addictive\u2026I truly could not get enough of them. I thrived off of Miles and Tate together...they are just that amazing. You could see even in the littlest things how happy and complete he made her and as much as he tried to fight it, I could tell she was chipping away at that hardened shell. It was hard though\u2026seeing the impact of his decisions and what that did to Tate\u2026it hurt my heart, but\u2026I never once questioned her decisions. I was waiting for that point when I would get frustrated or angry with what Tate was doing\u2026it didn\u2019t come. I got it\u2026because I understood her feelings for him\u2026I would have done the same thing! Truly, the thought of her walking away from him killed me more than the angst they were experiencing.\u2018He brings his hands up and slides them through my hair, brushing his thumbs across my cheeks. He inhales a shaky breath while looking down at my mouth. \u201cYou make it so hard to breathe.\u201dHe punctuates his sentence with his kiss, bringing his lips over mine. Every remaining part of me that had yet to melt in his presence is now liquefied like the rest of me. I try to recall a time when a man\u2019s mouth felt this good against mine. His tongue slides across my lips, then dips inside, tasting me, filling me, claiming me.Oh\u2026.my.I.Love.His.Mouth.\u2019Tate and Miles are so\u2026unique. I loved that we got both of their POV\u2019s\u2026I love the way both of their POV\u2019s are presented\u2026and I\u2019m being intentionally vague on that because I don\u2019t want to spoil things because that was part of the surprise for me. I wasn\u2019t expecting to get both but it was honestly genius and a totally different approach. I guess\u2026the best way for me to describe without giving too much away is that I fell in love with Miles twice\u2026which is probably why he got to me so deeply. You get to see two very different sides to him, both of them are amazing and wonderful (hence\u2026the falling in love) but that\u2019s where my struggle began. Now\u2026before I go on, we\u2019ve established, I love Miles\u2026I love everything I know about him and every second I learned more I fell more\u2026I love the good, the bad and the ugly\u2026I felt like a part of my heart broke with him\u2026I shed tears for him\u2026flaws and all he is still perfect in my eyes. So\u2026here\u2019s the problem\u2026I was so connected with Tate and feeling her pain\u2026so I was getting double duty pain\u2026with her and for him\u2026it sometimes felt like I was being ripped in two. The struggle is real\u2026 \u2018A kiss is so much easier than what we\u2019re doing. When you kiss, you can close your eyes. You can kiss away the thoughts. You can kiss away the pain, the doubt, the shame. When you close your eyes and kiss, you protect yourself from the vulnerability.This isn\u2019t us protecting ourselves.This is confrontation. This is a standoff. This is eye-to-eye combat. This is a dare, from me to Miles, from Miles to me. I dare you to try to stop this, we\u2019re both silently screaming.\u2019I could babble on and on all day about these two\u2026but that\u2019s not all there is. There are two other very important men in Tate\u2019s life and I thoroughly enjoyed the relationships she had with them. First\u2026her brother Corbin\u2026he is the typical older brother, super protective, loving to a fault and no one is good enough for his little sister. I liked their closeness\u2026at a time when Tate needed someone, he was there for her in his own way and they had a very easy relationship\u2026except when it comes to Tate\u2019s dating life, but I thought it was cute that he was so caring and wanted what was best for her. In all honesty\u2026if it wasn\u2019t for Corbin\u2026there would be no Tate and Miles\u2026so it\u2019s really all his fault. Then we have Cap\u2026.his real name is Samuel but it just looks weird calling him that cause\u2026well, he\u2019s Cap. He\u2019s an 80 year old man that turned into one of Tate\u2019s closest friends and I don\u2019t think I could have loved their relationship more if I wanted to. He was this little injection of comedic relief, his timing was perfect and there is no other word for Cap besides awesome.\u2018\u201cWhat do you think would make a man never want to experience love again?\u201dCap doesn\u2019t answer my question for at least five floors. I eventually look at him, and he\u2019s looking right at me, his eyes narrowed, producing even more wrinkles between them. \u201cI suppose if a man lived through the ugliest side of love, he might never want to experience it again.\u201dI contemplated his answer, but it doesn\u2019t help much. I don\u2019t see how love could get ugly enough for a person to just shut himself off from it completely.\u2019Of course the writing is absolutely flawless\u2026it\u2019s Colleen Hoover, there was never any doubt in my mind. I\u2019m in awe of her. I literally don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m reading when I read her books\u2026it\u2019s an experience\u2026I live it with the characters. I immerse myself in her stories and I think it\u2019s genuinely impossible not to walk away from them a changed human. Every sentence blends perfectly\u2026the flow is smooth\u2026I\u2019m just effortlessly pulled in. It\u2019s torture to stop reading and you never want the journey to end. I liked that this book was a little different from some of her others\u2026but it still had that CoHo vibe to it \u2013 her tone is still there, the characters still have that special edge that make them classically hers, but it was just a little more mature. Seriously, the one common thing with all of her books is the level of emotion that she pours into them\u2026especially this one. Every time I think there is no way she can out do it\u2026can make me cry again\u2026can angst my heart out more\u2026can create characters that I can love to bits and pieces\u2026and yet she does. Every. Single. Time. It\u2019s brilliant wrapped in genius dipped in amazing\u2026shot straight through my brain and into my heart.\u2018She\u2019s absolutely beautiful. Her hope is beautiful. The smile on her face is beautiful. The tears streaming down her cheeks are beautiful.Her love is beautiful.\u2019I am a self professed clinger\u2026and I\u2019m struggling to let go of Miles and Tate but\u2026I can\u2019t deny\u2026Ugly Love is a perfect standalone. Do I think Corbin deserves a book? Your darn tootin\u2019\u2026that boy is a man whore and I LOVE my man whores\u2026he is a recipe for awesome in the making when combined with Colleen\u2019s brain\u2026but that still doesn\u2019t change that I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better than the way Miles and Tate\u2019s story ended. It was perfection\u2026big red bow and all. I laughed\u2026I cried\u2026I loved\u2026it was beautiful and ugly and everything I wanted and I will never look at water the same way again.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Pure Colleen Hoover Magic!",
                "reviewText": "\u201cIf I were capable of loving someone\u2026 it would be you.\u201dColleen Hoover is a genius, plain and simple. I\u2019ve read Slammed/Point of Retreat/This Girl and Maybe Someday/Maybe Not and I\u2019ve loved them all, but after reading Ugly Love I can easily say that this was my favorite CoHo book that I\u2019ve read so far! This woman has such a way with words, her writing is just a joy to read, even when she\u2019s tearing your heart out. I don\u2019t know how she does it, she doesn\u2019t use big fancy words or complicated prose, these are just ordinary everyday words but the way she puts them all together is simply magical. It\u2019s hard for me to describe, but if you\u2019ve read any CoHo books I think you know what I\u2019m talking about. All of her stories are so unique and amazing but one thing they all have in common is Colleen Hoover\u2019s gift with words. I know exactly what I\u2019ll be getting when I pick up one of her books in terms of writing and quality, but I am always surprised with the direction her stories take. It\u2019s always an incredible adventure and I love going along for the ride.I loved how this book was narrated, it\u2019s told from dual POVs, alternating every other chapter between Tate and Miles. The thing that made this book unique is that Tate\u2019s chapters were set in the present day and (with the exception of the last few chapters) all of Miles\u2019 chapters were set 6 years earlier. So we essentially get two separate love stories that are both wonderful and beautiful that come back together in such a great way. I loved getting Miles\u2019 backstory in the form of these flashback chapters, first off they were so amazingly written, they just flowed like poetry and I found myself lost in these simple words:\u2018My new favorite flavor is Rachel. My new favorite thing is Rachel. I want Rachel for my birthday. I want Rachel for Christmas. I want Rachel for graduation. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. I\u2019m gonna fall in love with you anyway, Rachel.\u2019Secondly, in Tate\u2019s chapters Miles really is an enigma and without his current day POV you really don\u2019t have much clue what\u2019s going on behind that wall he\u2019s put up:\u2018Still no smile, though. Jesus Christ, this man. Does he now realize that facial expressions are supposed to accompany speech?\u2019But reading his flashback chapters really helped understand what Miles\u2019 potential to love was. Before you find out what happened to him in the past that caused him to be so closed off you get to see what a huge heart he has and his great capacity for love. This book was just as much Miles and Rachel\u2019s love story as it was Miles and Tate\u2019s story, you\u2019d think that as a reader you\u2019d have ill feelings towards the \u201cother woman\u201d because you know you should be rooting for Tate but there\u2019s none of that. I felt Miles and Rachel\u2019s story just as fully as I did him and Tate.Colleen Hoover\u2019s characters are always so well written, they are well developed, incredibly detailed and 100% relatable. I totally loved Tate, she was a riot and she said and did things that I could see myself doing in those situations and I connected with her right away. I loved her inner musings as she tried to figure Miles out or tried to soak up any little scrap of hope he threw her way:\u2018\u201cYou look pretty, Tate.\u201d I want to plaster those four words on a billboard and require myself to pass it on my drive to work every day. I would never take another day off work again.\u2019There were some times when Miles would do something where Tate totally should have walked away, but I think she reacted how many women would react and I know that she didn\u2019t give up completely on Miles because she knew what was happening between them was real even though he would never admit it. Miles intrigued me from the start and from their first meeting where she witnessed his very private breakdown I knew that I was in for a doozy when his past was revealed. I knew he must have endured some horrible event(s) that caused him to swear off any form of love, and wow was he dedicated to his rules:\u201cDon\u2019t ask about my past,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cAnd never expect a future.\u201dI\u2019ve never seen a character hold so steadfastly to rules like he did. We got to see moments, tiny glimpses of actions or a slipped word that gave us some hope but just as quickly as we grasped that hope he snatched it right back. I was so sad for him and falling so in love with him at the same time (much like Tate, only with the added bonus of seeing what a wonderful guy he was six years earlier when he was still full of life and love) and I just wanted to hug him. My heart completely broke for him as his full past is finally revealed, and I will say that what actually happened was not at all what I was expecting. But I love how once we hit that point the story shifts to all present day and it\u2019s seamless and I love how it put my heart back together again and wrapped up in a totally believable and satisfying way.In addition to Tate and Miles I loved all of the secondary characters. I\u2019ve already mentioned Rachel and I did really love her. I also loved Corbin and his friendship with Miles and his protectiveness of his sister. I also liked seeing Ian and Miles\u2019 relationship both in the past and in the present day. My favorite secondary character however was Cap, I LOVED Cap! I love how Colleen Hoover can throw in a quirky random character like this and make you totally fall in love with them and have them end up being so important to the overall story.I read this book over the course of a few hours spread out the day, I simply could not put it down. I struggled though because I wanted to read as fast as I possibly could to find out what happens next but at the same time I wanted to slow down to savor every single word on the page! In the end speed won out but I think I highlighted half the book with passages I wanted to always remember! I\u2019m going to have to re-read this book someday because I don\u2019t think one time is enough for something written as well as this was. I\u2019m sad I don\u2019t have more time with Miles and Tate but I am so glad that I was able to spend one wonderful afternoon/evening in their world with them and I know I will never forget this amazing, beautiful, ugly love story! 5+++ stars!\u2018But the second she opened her eyes and looked at me, I knew. She was either going to be the death of me\u2026 or she was going to be the one who finally brought me back to life.\u2019",
