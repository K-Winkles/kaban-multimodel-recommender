Seems the new housekeeper is a gorgeous young woman who cooks like an angel and wrangles his family like a pro. If only she didn't dislike him so much...Penny Cash is down on her luck, and the last thing she needs is a flirtation with a wild, carefree cowboy. Sure, he's funny and sexy, but they're as different as whiskey and tea. And she'll be leaving town as soon as she finds a full-time teaching position. But when trouble comes calling, Penny will find out how serious Sam can be when it comes to protecting the woman he loves...Also includes the bonus novella Saved by the Cowboy by A.J. Pine! Olivia Belle has always believed in fairy tales...until the moment her boyfriend dropped to one knee. When Olivia speeds into Cash Hawkins' town like a modern-day Cinderella in a ball gown and glass slippers, Cash's careful existence is thrown for a loop.

                "reviewText": "Montana Strong #2, can be read as a standalone. All things are quiet on the Monroe Ranch but it's about to get shaken up when Mac Monroe does a favor for a very dear friend. Mac hires Penny Cash on at the ranch to help out with cooking and cleaning when her teaching job at Haller Creek falls through. When Mac adopted Sam and his brothers over sixteen years ago he turned the three foul-mouthed troublemakers into ranchers. Sam Monroe took to ranching like it was something he was meant to do. Sam was in no hurry to settle down he was content to go out drink beers, hustle a little at pool, and sleep around that was until he walked into the house after three weeks out with the cattle and found Penny in his kitchen.Penny was used to being in a household of all men, she practically raised her three brothers all by herself after their parents death, so she was prepared for what to expect when she started on at the Monroe Ranch. What she wasn't prepared for was how strongly attracted she was to Sam. A slow burn romance that builds their relationship before anything else. Both are hard workers who know the value of a hard days work but where Sam knows how to kick back and relax Penny doesn't. Penny has worked hard her whole life when she wasn't taking care of her brothers or her elderly aunt she was studying to be a teacher, it's been her dream for as long as she can remember. Penny discovers that her youngest brother is working on a ranch outside Haller Creek, she also finds out he's been betting and losing money playing pool and when trouble follows him Penny gets caught in the middle. Sam just found happiness with Penny and now he's will to put his life on the line to save her.Overall, it's a contemporary western with a splash of suspense, just the way I like it. R.C. Ryan hits the spot with this heartwarming family relationship, sexy and smart cowboys, a picturesque setting, and a romance that burns slow but hot. Sam and Penny have a lot in common but just enough to keep it interesting. Finn said the dreaded famous last words of a single man, \"I guess it's up to me to stay strong and resist whatever love virus is going around.\" *maniacal laugh* I can't wait for his book. Thank you to Forever Publishing for this ARC, as always this review is Honestly and Voluntarily Given.",

He was the one that hid his pain behind laughter and smiles. Now Sam is living his life as a rancher by day and a pool hustler by night.But when Penny is hired on as the housekeeper at the Monroe Ranch, Sam finds his thoughts are taken up by the beauty and slowly he begins to change his ways.This is the second novel I've read by R.C. Ryan, To be honest, I liked the first book in this series (Cowboy On My Mind) but I didn't love it. So I was a bit hesitant to request a copy of The Cowboy Next Door. But because I love cowboys so damn much, I couldn't resist! And I'm so damn glad I caved into the temptation. I loved Every Single Thing about this romance. The slow burn, the suspense towards the end along with those final heartstopping moments. This one definitely had me on the edge of my seat hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.Penny and Sam's romance is so freaking adorable. I loved their playful banter that ignited in two nights of endless passion. Couples like them are the reason why I read romance novels!Even though the first book in this series didn't spark my attention I have to say, after reading The Cowboy Next Door I'm more intrigued by this series and I can't wait to get ahold of Finn's story!",
