People wanted to be me or be with me.Except for Lyla James Marichal.She didn't look at me like I was her next meal. She eyed me with disdain.Instead of vying for my attention, she ignored me and pushed me away.She was completely unattainable, and I became obsessed with her.When I finally got her, it felt like I was on top of the world. I was going to help the team win another championship, going into the draft, and had Lyla by my side.And then, without warning, she left me.Vanished.It took me three bitter, angry, long years to find her, but I did, and now she owes me a lot more than just an explanation.Three years ago, she ruined my life.Now, I was going to become her worst nightmare.Tropes: hockey romance, new adult, obsessed/possessive hero, boy falls first, #JP hero, dark themes (content warning in the book) Read more",

Lyla is a bada$$ FMC and Lachlan reminds me a little of Carter Beckett with a touch more obsessive tendencies (damn those hockey boys lol). Lots of trigger warnings but I'm good with that. There's trauma, drama, suspense, a little violence, some craziness, and a whole lot of love. I highly recommend this book and I'm excited to read what else this author has to offer!",

It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve read a suspense-focused story. I loved the plot, the characters, the \u2728drama\u2728. This book is a dark romance, and some content may be triggering, however while this story was emotionally-devastating, it also featured a very raw and heartwarming romance.While this book is coined a \u201chockey romance\u201d, hockey wasn\u2019t actually a huge factor to the story. However, this really does not deter how enjoyable it was to read. The characters were super genuine for me. Our characters are put into an insane situation, and this story features not just how trauma can shape someone but also what it looks like to overcome it. This story is about the beauty in strength. This story is gut wrenching but I LOVED these characters.If you\u2019re looking for a emotional DARK romance that features:\u2728 love at first sight\u2728 second chance romance\u2728 obsessed hero\u2728 TRAUMA\u2728 \u201ctouch her and die\u201d vibes\u2728 revenge\u2728 mental health repThen this story is for sure for you!",

Their story was instant like a match to a can of gasoline, there was no stopping it and it was more dangerous than either of them realize.What I loved: the writing sucked me in immediately. I\u2019m mentally beating myself up for not reading Claire Contreras sooner. Now I\u2019m on a deep dive into her books! The chemistry was off the charts for Lachlan and Lyla. I also loved the angst in the middle when they\u2019re apart. I love love love love the touch her and you die trope and this one was just \u2728 chefs kiss \u2728My thoughts: i loved these characters so much I didn\u2019t want the book to end. I immediately signed up for Claire Contreras email list just to get the bonus scene and it did not disappoint. I think the best sign a book is good is when you never want it to end and in this case it was very true. This book and author are my new favorites!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s weird. The book itself is choppy and full of layers that make it almost tedious. There is so much unnecessary information and then not enough necessary information. The character development is seriously lacking and slightly frustrating. They\u2019re basically the same people. They never lose their childish antics from college. Kudos to Lyla for wearing the wire and getting her own evidence. But it\u2019s also seriously unrealistic that nothing could have been done to prevent this entire book. Also, there is only two hockey scenes. Kind of annoying. As for Lach\u2019s stalking, it\u2019s basically non-existent. Everything you think you\u2019ll get from this book, you won\u2019t get it. It\u2019s also way too long for the story itself. Overall, this is a college romance with an arrogant jerk and an emotionless chick. She \u201cHAS\u201d to leave and it takes him three years to find her. He\u2019s still a jerk, but much more so. They guilt trip and manipulate one another and then it\u2019s a HEA with a cheap and easy sense of \u201cjustice\u201d. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not great.",

I wasn't sure where it was going at first because the prologue didn't have a time stamp on it and I wasn't sure when it took place, and I was afraid at first that Lachlan was the stalker in a bad way. But it all worked out!I loved these characters! They were strong and lovable and compelling and heartbreaking. I loved getting to see their struggles and triumphs and see their characters grow and learn and become happy. Their Present timeline was impeccably done with the anger on his side and the sadness on hers until they discovered each other's secrets and why they felt that way. The side characters were amazing! I loved Marissa and Prescott and Banks! I really want stories for all of the side characters and the other hockey players!The only reason this isn't getting 4.5 or 5 stars is because there were times that the writing felt lackluster and like I was being told things instead of experiencing them with the characters and it took me out of the story.",

Then, part two of the book takes place 3 years later. This is where you get into more of the mystery and suspense that\u2019ll have you unable to put this book down. Sprinkled throughout are some amazingly written, hot and steamy scenes, and it\u2019s finished with the perfect HEA.This was the best emotional rollercoaster I\u2019ve been on in a while, and I loved every bit of it!\ud83c\udfd2 College Sports Romance\ud83c\udfd2 Trauma & Tragedy\ud83c\udfd2 Mystery & Suspense\ud83c\udfd2 Possessive & Protective MMC\ud83c\udfd2 He Falls First\ud83c\udfd2 Second Chance\ud83c\udfd2 Steamy scenes",

                "reviewText": "ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEE!!! This book had me on my knees. My heart!Ok so. I had read 2 comments saying it took a while to have action and, personally, I got sucked into it super quickly though I do agree, it got slow for a little while, like, 3-4 chapters?The story line was so well thought out and everything/everyone was introduced perfectly. Lyla\u2019s feelings and angst and anxiety radiated through the book. Lachlan\u2019s anger and obsession was the same. To me, I couldn\u2019t escape relating to them and feeling what they were feeling. They made me cry and laugh and love them too.Even the side characters were so present, nothing felt unfinished to me when I sadly had to turn the last page.It is well written, the pace of the story was perfect (yes it got slow for a few chapters but trust me, it\u2019s necessary for what happens next as it\u2019s a whirlwind. You need to take a breath babe!), the characters are easy to get attached too.Now, beautiful readers, read the warnings! Especially the last one because it gets difficult. Keep your mind safe :) and thank you Claire Contreras for an excellent book.",
