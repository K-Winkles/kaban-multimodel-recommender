RaeAnne Thayne takes her readers to a snowed in ranch with people who have secrets. One of the secrets is an unplanned pregnancy, how it is announced and the forever life they want. Michelle Major, author of the second great story, is filled with angst over a failed career as an actress, an inheritance that gets everyone's attention and a young girl who bonds with the actress in a mother/daughter way. Both books are great and made my reading over the holidays filled with smiles, laughs and a few tears. Thanks for a Merry Christmas.",

Yet due to a one night encounter leads to a whole lot of issues for both of them. You will enjoy the story line and the characters. Whereas Kiss on Crimson Ranch goes in a different line. It is also a good quick read with fun characters. Here you have actress Sara Wells inheriting her Grandmothers house and meeting Josh and his Daughter Claire. Both Sara and Josh have trust issues and learn how to deal with them. You can read both stories in a day and have a good time losing yourself in their stories",
