                "reviewText": "This is another story in Ms Byrne\u2019s matchmaker series. Jason and Augusta are paired by the matchmaker, each having their own personal reasons for doing so. This leads to their marriage, which is the primary focus of the story. I truly enjoyed this story and the primary characters. The author created a well defined plot, and added drama, secrets, emotional barriers, and interferences from nefarious characters, which kept me engaged and invested in Augusta and Jason\u2019s path and future. Each character has their crosses to carry. Augusta is trying to quickly find a match to avoid a scandal from being dumped three days before her wedding, and Jason, suffering from PTSD, from his time in the war. These barriers cause the couple to keep an emotional distance, not wanting to show each other their vulnerability. This is a fast paced story, that kept my attention from the first page, and does include a few spicy scenes. The characters are portrayed brilliantly, and the obstacles that they need to overcome are crafted wonderfully. The only issue I was a bit confused about was the title of the story. \u201cTwo nights\u2026.\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to match the story\u2019s plot. But I still highly recommend this book. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "Jason had been injured in the war and suffered from terrible nightmares. Seeing how happy his friends were who got married and with encouragement from his mother he spoke with Maria Webster, the matchmaker. Augusta was supposed to marry the Earl of Rueford but he backed out three days before their wedding. Her family afraid of the scandal told her they were going to have the matchmaker find her a husband. Now Jason, being in the military, was rather abrupt in his demeanor and so Augusta was rather taken aback by his manners. However, she did see that there was more to him than met the eye and that she was feeling an attraction to him that she had never felt before in any other man. Once they got married Jason was captivated by Augusta but also scared to let his walls down as he was afraid he might hurt her if she was with him when he experienced his nightmares when asleep. We do have some very bad actors who try their best to disrupt their gradually growing attraction to each other. The betrayals that happen do hurt but the two of them manage to overcome all of this and do find their happily ever after.",

I liked how this book reminded us everybody deserves a second chance, but a stable relationship requires hard work, the will and the effort to get to know each other, the trust to show your true colors and admit to fears and weaknesses, the tolerance to allow the other one to be who he or she truly is. I enjoyed this wonderful read very much.",

                "reviewText": "The next instalment of the matchmaking games! I liked the book, the plot was good, the characters were well developed and very likeable. Jason already appeared in the previous book in the series and I'm glad he got his own story. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them, especially the sparks that fly when they argue and their mutual attraction despite of it. There are a few steamy love scenes and a touch of intrigue to spice up the story.It was nice to meet some of the characters from the previous book again.Augusta, the diamond of the season and an obedient, poised daughter, was jilted by her fianc\u00e9 just days before her wedding. To avoid another scandal, she must marry as soon as possible, and her mother insists on using the services of the matchmaker, Mrs. Webster.She doesn't like Jason at first sight, he is too commanding and she fears that they will never suit.Jason has been to war and returned scarred and traumatised, making him grumpy and reclusive in public but vulnerable inside.Although her mother tries to talk her out of marrying Jason, Augusta decides to marry him anyway. But his past and her scheming mother stand in the way of a happy ending...I recommend to all who like historical romance novels with marriage of convenience and opposites attract themes, grumpy heroes and poised heroines.",
