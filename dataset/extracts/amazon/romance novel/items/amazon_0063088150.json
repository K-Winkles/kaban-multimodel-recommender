                "reviewText": "This started off a little slow for me. I was expecting six independent short stories like Blackout. This time around it was a continuous story with no indication of who wrote what (until the very end). As the friends-to-lovers and second chance romance storylines developed, I became a lot more invested. I was rooting for each couple because they all seemed to genuinely care about each other. I loved the way their stories were all intertwined. The snowstorm in Atlanta was a fun plot. My first winter as an Atlanta resident was marked by Snowpocalypse 2014. I didn\u2019t experience any of the cute, lovey dovey stuff like the kids in Whiteout. I want a do-over!",

                "reviewText": "I read this book for a book club featuring Black YA books. Tbh YA romance is not my thing and I went into this book knowing that it may not be for me. I generally I don\u2019t read YA romance because it tends to be really saccharine and melodramatic and not super realistic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with these traits because these books are targeted to a younger audience so it makes sense. But these traits don\u2019t really impress me in a YA book so that\u2019s why I typically avoid YA romance. This book is very has all of the mentioned qualities. It\u2019s saccharine, whimsical, and all about romance. If you\u2019re a person that just loves love then this book may be for you but if not then maybe just leave it alone. I was ready to be finished with it, and I actually don\u2019t think the ending was as fulfilling as it could\u2019ve been consider the all the drama and angst it was building up to. The ending was rushed and fell flat and I don\u2019t say this because you know the MCs will end up together. Even though I knew the MCs would unite, ending just didn\u2019t take it\u2019s time to let us enjoy and soak in the reunion. To me it made the book feel like a huge let down.Overall, it\u2019s a fine book if it has the right audience. If you love all kinds of romance then this book may be for you. For me I know it would be something that wasn\u2019t my cup of tea.",

But instead I was met with a fresh group of people in a completely different state. At first I really hated it, but as time progressed I found myself engrossed.Now maybe I\u2019m getting a little too old for these types of books but I hate how unrealistic the ending sought out to be. Typical teenagers don\u2019t know the code to the safe where their phone is and cannot just leave when grounded. Then again typical teenagers don\u2019t have the kind of connections that these kids had.I love that in the end, people got to explain their side and there was forgiveness which is good for a second chance romance but I will say\u2026 this is a lesson about not jumping to conclusions!",
