Two attempted rapes and one inciting a crowd with the intention of murder were all handled with barely more than a talking to by the laird. I though it made the leader look weak and a poor protection for his people.I am not familiar with this author and would have preferred one novel size story. I think she does not participate in Kindle Unlimited and this was her way of getting more paying readers. I think it is more considerate than offering one free book and charging for the rest of the series as some authors do.So, it was a pleasant read. IF I were in the market of paying per book, I would add this author to my list.",
