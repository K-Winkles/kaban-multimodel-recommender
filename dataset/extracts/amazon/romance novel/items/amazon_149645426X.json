One of the books main themes was the abolitionist movement in Pennsylvania in particular. I loved the time slip story. The story had a rewarding ending.",

It was very strange to read it mixed in with the Amish. Had I understood that was what the book entailed, I would not have gotten this book.The book does time travel from 1985 vs 1822. Some of the information given from the 1822 time was interesting as it dwelled on the anti-slavery aspect and how the Quakers were involved in trying to help with the Underground Railroad to help the slaves get from Ohio to Pennsylvania so they could be free.This book did dwell on love and forgiveness. In spite of all the moving of the story from 1985 to 1822, the book did have a good ending.I received a copy of this book from Tyndale House and NetGalley and the opinion expressed is my own.",

I'll warn you that this is one of those that will keep you up reading late, and it is hard to put down, it is that good!This is an Amish, Quaker, Mennonite story, and yes, we encounter all these cultures, but it is the Love of our fellowman, with a bit of time slip.The stories are meshed so well, from 1985 back to 1822, from Old Order Amish and the Ordung, to Quakers helping escaped slaves. Though the eyes of the authors, we put faces and names on these people, and see how their faith in God is persevered in the face of adversity! We see how past meets the future, how actions of the past affect the present. We also see how Love pulls everything together!Now I can't wait until the next book coming in January 2024!I received this book through Net Galley and the Publisher Tyndale House, and was not required to give a positive review.",
