                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book by Ava MacAdams. It has it All: a simmering sensual attraction between main characters, mystery and intrigue, twists and turns, a glimpse of the delicate balance needed to survive life among the ton\u2026and a scandal. Lady Ann Hatson is a debutant with a problem. She has a secret admirer. Not just your average poetic secret admirer, but an obsessive, threatening, dangerous stalker. She doesn\u2019t want her parents to know, but her brother and protector is away on tour. A frightened Anne turns to her brother\u2019s friend Alexander, the Duke of Windsor, for help. The Duke is seen by the ton as heartless, dangerous, and domineering. A man who wouldn\u2019t think twice to ruining a girl\u2019s reputation. If he is all these things, why would Anne\u2019s brother ask him to watch over her while he\u2019s away? The two agree to set up a fake courtship in order to keep Anne safe, but Alexanders\u2019s help comes at a cost. Is Anne just trading a dangerous stalker with a man who could be dangerous to her reputation? The attraction between these 2 characters is strong and steamy. Will the courtship remain fake or become real? Who is tormenting Anne with the horrible letters? Will Ann loose her standing in the eyes of the ton? I hope you enjoy finding out as much as I did. I received an ARC copy of the book, but that did not influence my review in any way.",

Alexander was reluctant to do this as he had feelings for her ever since he was young and did not know how he would be able to keep those feelings in the background if he had to be constantly in her presence. This was going to be especially hard on him if he was going to have her dance and flirt with other men at the parties and balls he was going to have to chaperone her at. Anne was not happy that her brother had tasked his best friend as her protector especially since she has had a crush on him since she was young and he was always around teasing her. However, when she received troubling stalker letters she turned to him for help. Alexander did have a troubled past that was holding him back from fully committing to Anne but as things unfolded he learned that losing her was not an option. Finding out who the stalker was and putting to rest scandalous gossip our two heroines finally open their hearts to each other and to the love that they have for each other.",

Until now, she has been protected by her brother, but when he sets off on a tour of the continent, he asks his best friend Alexander to look after his sister.Alexander, a social recluse with a bad reputation, has long been attracted to Anne and takes on the task, even if Anne is not particularly enthusiastic at first. She has also long had a soft spot for him, but feels provoked by his commandeering behaviour. The passion between them flares up and they begin a push-and-pull game of seduction, jealousy and dominance, while the stalker becomes increasingly dangerous\u2026",
