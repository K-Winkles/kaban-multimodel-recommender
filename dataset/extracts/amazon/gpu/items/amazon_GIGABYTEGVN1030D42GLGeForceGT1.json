                "reviewText": "The card works wonderfully! It provides HDMI for HD and UHD display. It also has a DVI port for a second monitor/display. I recently upgraded my computer to Windows 11 only to find out that my existing graphics card was not supported. I found this on sale (50% off) at Amazon and it works like a champ. The NVidia \"GForce Experience\" and driver software were easy to download, but it gave me an outdated driver. The GForce Experience would download the updated driver but would not let me install it. I finally had to go to the NVidia website to get the updated driver and install it manually. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone needing a graphics card for Windows 11.",
