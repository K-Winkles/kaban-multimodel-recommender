                "reviewText": "My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4. I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy. It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game. The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds. Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super. I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570. The frame rates are incredible! Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card. I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream. The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play. I highly, VERY highly recommend this card! It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's. It's worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "PROS:* Single slot bracket* Clears tall capacitors on some motherboards* Low enough watts to not need aux power* Decent enough for serious gaming* Budget pricing* 4GB Texture RAMCONS:* Not as fast as 1080 (duhhh)* Not low-profile* The extra 2GB of Texture RAM adds 30% to the card price.This is the best single-bracket card right now. I have 2 of these, plus one 2GB card. All of the systems are quad-core 2.9GHz and with this card, GTA, Overwatch, etc are cranked up to eleven. These are GTX 1080 chips that were not stable at the higher clock speeds, so they underclock them. Same silicon, same performance, cooler temps, lower wattage. Same as all the chip makers do for their different grades of silicon.I've had no problems with these running full throttle, though I'm sure, somewhere, someone needs the faster speeds of a 1080, or a dual-SLI rig with three compute cards added, or whatever. But, for budget gaming, this is great. Laugh if you want, but we run these in Dell Optiplex 755 systems with Q9550 chips, 8GB RAM, and SATA SSD (dual *x100, or single EVO). These make serious budget gaming rigs, topping out around 500 smackeroos in total to build up including LDC, Keyboard, Mouse, UPS, etc. Check Passmark, and you'll see. Not top of the line, but right in the sweet spot that plays all the things.If you need a low-profile card, the GTX 750 Ti from MSI is similar price/performance, but older vintage, though the 4GB version of those are really hard to find..",

                "reviewText": "The GTX 1050 Ti Mini was very easy to install, and solved the problems we were having with games on an older card (a GTX 660, which had a sad tendency to crash running Destiny 2, and which was noisy and running hot a lot of the time.)1) The 1050 did not need a power drop from the power supply. No cable to run. Just plug it into the graphics card slot, screw the back plate into place, and that was it.2) Windows 10 already had the driver. No software installation required. It just worked.Downsides:- It's an entry-level card. It's not going to work well for 4k displays in ultra high resolution.- The minimum fan speed is 45%, which is not noisy at all, but winding the fan up to 80% (using the Zotac software) revealed that WOW, it will whine like a flying drone if it gets hot enough.Take-away: no regrets. The next step up for us would be a card which costs two to three times as much, and doesn't actually deliver two to three times the value. This card will keep this old PC (Intel architecture from 2013) alive and gaming for at least another three years.",

                "reviewText": "Probably the best value card out there right now performance/price wise, seeing how the whole concurrency market is buying up all the higher end cards from both Nvidia and AMD. This thing is surprisingly capable and it can run most AAA titles at 60FPS on medium-high settings (depending on game). It will completely crush most e-sports titles (CSGO, League of legends) with frame rates in the 150-300fps range on max settings. Overwatch should also run with 80fps minimum at max settings, probably averaging higher.Even though it is powered only from the 75W PCIE connection on your motherboard, you can still safely overclock it by about 150MHz core and easily 200MHz on the memory (I have seen others get higher). With these settings, it will boost up to above 1800MHz in game.Even after playing for 30 minutes or so with nearly 100% GPU utilization and core clock around 1800Mhz, the temperature was still under 60 degrees with stock cooling/ fan profile. The performance of this card is limited by the power connector, not by the thermals. For this reason, I think that overclocking it is quite safe as the built in power regulation will simply decrease the clock to stay below power requirements.",
