                "reviewText": "I was building my first pc ever and almost everything went well. I had everything finished and it was time to turn it on and everything worked. After setting up everything like windows, games, etc, I played some games like apex legends, fortnite, rocket league and more. PART1: Now this is the part you have to pay attention. When I played games that didn\u2019t require much gpu or cpu utilization everything was pretty quite. HOWEVER when I played games that required about 60+ utilization of the gpu like apex and fortnite I started hearing a buzzing noise coming from the gpu. THIS IS CALLED COIL WHINE. Although this doesn\u2019t hurt the performance of the gpu, it can be annoying to listen to if you don\u2019t have headphones in or something.Part 2: GPU DRIVER ISSUES. While setting up my pc I was downloading motherboard drivers and gpu drivers. When I was downloading gpu drivers I got a message saying that I needed to reboot/restart my pc. I went to restart my pc and my monitor turned off but my pc stayed on AND FOR SOME REASON MY FANS WERE BLOWING AT FULL SPEED. I WAS PANICKING BECAUSE THIS WAS MY FIRST PC BUILD WHICH I HAD USED SOME GOOD MONEY FOR. I had to turn off my pc by the power button because nothing was happening except my fans blowing at full rpm. IF ANYONE SEEING THIS HAS THE SAME PROBLEM THEN FOLLOW THESE STEPS: Step 1. Turn off psu by the switch. Step 2. Unplug monitor and psu cable from power strip. Step 3. Plug monitor and psu cable back in then switch the psu back on. Step 4. Press power button on pc and it should boot up now on the monitor. SIDE NOTE THIS DOES NOT FIX THE DRIVER ISSUE IF YOU RESTART THEN THE ISSUE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. HOWEVER AFTER RESTARTING MY PC AND UNPLUGGING EVERYTHING OUT AND BACK IN A COUPLE OF TIMES I MANAGED TO GET RID OF THE DRIVER ISSUE (KEEP IN MIND IM WRITING THIS REVIEW THE SAME DAY I HAD DRIVER ISSUES SO THIS ISSUE CAN HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE).Part 3: Kind of bad temps. I looked up videos of people with a similar build with mine and I looked at their gpu temps while they were gaming and mine would always be higher in every game by about 5-10\u00b0C (same settings as theirs).Part 4: MY EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS GPU WERE NOT MET. I THOUGHT I WOULD GET WAY HIGHER FPS THAN I ACTUALLY DO. THIS GPU CAN BARELY GET 140 FPS AT 1080p MEDIUM/HIGH SETTINGS ON MOST GAMES. I PLAY ON A 144 FPS MONITOR AND I THOUGHT THIS GPU WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP IT AT 144 FPS AT ALL TIMES BUT IT CANT. THERE IS ALSO ALOT OF 1% LOW FPS CHANGES AND THIS IS BAD BECAUSE WHEN YOURE PLAYING, YOUR SCREEN LAGS WHILE CHANGING THOSE FRAMES.OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GPU FROM ANOTHER BRAND LIKE SAPPHIRE OR MSI. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST UNLUCKY AND GOT A GPU WITH COIL WHINE AND BAD THERMAL PASTE APPLICATION BUT PLEASE BE AWARE OF THESE ISSUES THAT YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU PURCHASE FROM THIS BRAND. PLEASE DO RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS GPU.",

En juegos maneja niveles de temperatura entre 70-80grados y es silenciosa (en mi caso cuando el juego exige a la tarjeta hace un peque\u00f1o leve ruido el\u00e9ctrico pero no es perceptible) Por lo demas la tarjeta funciona muy bien y con muy buen rendimiento en juegos",
