The package that came in was very basic, the installation was pretty easy, I just plugged in the power cable onto 5V 3pin connector on the motherboard and it just worked as intended. According to the installation guide on the back of the box, it wouldn't be smart to plug the power cable onto the power supply unit (PSU) because the RGB would light up in their own software and it would not sync with other RGB hardware that goes together with the motherboard",
