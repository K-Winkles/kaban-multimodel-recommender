                "reviewText": "Fits well in my rosewill cullinan v500 case. The case has some mounting plates in the way, but it works well, just back it up a bit and open one slot cover for the cable. The magnets are strong and easily stabilize a 3070. Not a huge fan of the pci cable as it's a little stiff but it will do fine. The pins pushing through the cloth backing as seen in other reviews, aren't a bin deal on the mount they will never contact or disrupt performance, for 60$ a mount and cable that seems to perform the task of transferring 4.0x16 speeds, its to be expected. Its Nothing to crazy like C_Payne PCIe adapters.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 4090 and Y60 case. both are beautiful but not a good fit in the case at least in stock form. Technically the Y60 was designed for water cooling. The problem is that the stock mount is too close to the glass so with the size of the 4090, it sits too close to the glass and can\u2019t get proper airflow. I was consistently getting 80-85c temps in modern games with fans on full blast. Wasn\u2019t until I took the glass off to realize what the problem was and ran ~20 degrees cooler. But I don\u2019t like having the glass off my case bc I have a sheddy dog and it gets dusty.I saw this mount recommended on some forums so gave it a try. Solved all my problems! Temps were way down vs stock mount and sits far enough back off the glass. Plus it can sit freely in the case without needing to bolt it in so you can move it around freely in the case and can also tilt it a bit for even better airflow. Super easy to install and sits firm on the bottom of my case with magnets.Only downsides are I think it is overly expensive for what it is. Also the magnets are glued on and just moving it around the case to adjust caused the top layer to start peeling off the feet. It still works fine and stays in place plus you can\u2019t see it so not a big deal but just an annoyance esp for the price.Overall I will say if you have the Y60 case and a bigger card then you need this or a similar mount if you want normal temps. Otherwise I would make sure to take the glass off while gaming. Nice case looks beautiful but it certainly is not perfect.",

Setting it at a 45 degree angle makes it easier for your fans to cool the card. The magnetic feet are a cool feature, it makes it easy to position exactly and then it doesn't move easily. But you need to make sure it will fit in your case. If you have a mid tower case, this probably will have a tough time fitting. I have a full tower and it works great! The included card rise cable seems to be pretty well built, and with these types of mounts, the rise cable is usually the weak link.",
