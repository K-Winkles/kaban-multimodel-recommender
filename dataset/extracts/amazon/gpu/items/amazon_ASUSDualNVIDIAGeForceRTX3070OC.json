It fit like a glove and performs as advertised. Looks great. Paired with an 8700k and 16gb of ram @ 3200mhz I'm getting 144 fps in benchmarks for Hitman 3 with everything maxed out except super sampling. No complaints performance, it's a welcome step up from my 1070. I didn't prefer over paying but that's the market right now and these have gone up in price considerably since I purchased it anyhow.",

The recipient was estatic and initial benchmarks blew away the 1060 it was replacing.Make sure you have enough power to feed this thing. Takes two 8(6+2) pin PCIe connectors. I don't recommend using a splitter as that power draw will stress that single cable and cause serious heat. Also, if your motherboard doesn't have a reinforced PCIex16 connector then look into getting a btace bar for vertical setups. This GPU has some weight to it.The price is inflated. As is the market right now. But, like I said, it was gift so i threw down against that judgement.",

Love the dual modes (quiet and performance) and the fact that the fans don\u2019t kick in unless the card hits 55C. The lighting is very subtle but adds a nice extra touch. Unfortunately Aura Sync doesn\u2019t recognize the card...so it\u2019s stuck on stock settings for lighting.",

                "reviewText": "To begin with this would be receiving a 4 Start review if it hadn't been for the MSRP increase. Some of these prices for just a 3070 have gotten ridiculous. Some 3070's going for more than 800 dollars with tax. This was a fair price, although it seems that most people want it bad enough it doesn't matter what it costs, and I believe the AIB's have taken advantage of that. This was the final piece for one of my builds. I did a lot of testing with it including running some triple AAA games. Cyberpunk runs really well at 1440p. I wouldn't run it at Ultra though unlike people are saying because when u get into some heavy firefights, Frames take a dip. If want a constant 60+fps then I would suggest running it at High with some of the settings on Ultra.I like the accent of the RGB, really subtle. I seem to also have gotten a somewhat decent bin on it with a OC. I run at stock just seeing if this one won the silicon lottery. Not the best, but not the worst. Can't expect more for a bargain card $100 over the MSRP.",

I'm running it undervolted at .875mv and at a steady 1965mhz in a MicroATX build with two 140mm bequiet Pure Wings 2 fans and three 120mm fans of the same make and model. It's not gone above 62 degrees at maximum load.In short, it's an absolute beast. Runs anything maxed out at 1080p, 144fps; 1440p, 60fps. At RRP, a very good card if you're not looking for 4K gaming.",
