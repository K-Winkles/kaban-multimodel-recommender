Also, having had good experiences, I trust the PNY brand to make a reliable well-engineered product.Installed in an older 3rd gen i7 PC. Had to clear my PC's CMOS before it was recognized. It would beep and not post before I reset the ASUS MB's CMOS, flawless operation since that initial glitch.Much faster and more energy-efficient than my older GTX 10xx series cards that I was using beforehandIt doesn't come with any LED light shows, that's good so it is tailored for adult useThough I would have preferred Samsung memory over the SK Hynix that it came with, so far it's proved reliable enough.",
