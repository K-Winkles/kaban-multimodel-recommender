                "reviewText": "After months of trying to get this card to work support stopped responding to my emails. The card continuously crashed. I provided everything support asked for, I tried it in several different systems, driver versions recommended by AMD and the version recommended by support with no change. I sent the card in to be tested and they claimed to have tested it on two systems with no problems. It ran for one hour and crashed when I got it back. I finally installed a new card from a different vendor and have had no trouble at all. I'm convinced they didn't actually test it and between the time it took for shipping and receiving and the testing I was out the card for a month. I'll never buy anything from this company again and I suggest you don't either. Especially if you're providing service to clients and rely on vendor support. You will not get it.Edit: the manufacturer finally came through! For honesty's sake I have to say they shipped a new part and paid for the return of the old one. This was a one star review but I'll give them three now. If it hadn't taken so much time and effort to get the swapped part it would be a four.",

                "reviewText": "I use the card for my FSX flight sim and have four monitors...three across and one on top. When I use my regular screen resolutions, my primary screen is the center monitor. My three other screens can be used for moving tabs/windows around, etc.When I use the flight sim, I have an Eyefinity display group which makes my three across monitors into one giant monitor. My top monitor is used for moving lower resolution sim windows (like plane's GPS or autopilot) up there.Remember, you MUST use ACTIVE HDMI to Mini Display port adapters for the card to work with your monitors. I also have DVI's that are using adapters to the mini display ports on the card. Using non-active adapters won't work.I love this card. I'm not sure how it will work with the new 2020 flight sim, but I'm going to try it out before spending $600+ on a gaming card.",
