The boost in performance can be noticed immediately.MSI made a great job with the looks of this model, the back plate is nice, only lacking a bit of rgb maybe in the logo for that +5fps LUL.It's a plus that AMD is taking care of this gen of GPUs on the drivers side. Tested the preview drivers and can say that AFMF helps a lot with fluidity on those poorly optimized games (yes, I'm looking at you, Escape from Tarkov). Got this on a nice deal around $190 before taxes 1yr ago, feeling it was worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "Pros: It was readily available when I wanted to upgrade my 1050ti. It doubles performance on every game I have (except GTA IV it does worse for some reason). Fans are off most of the time unless I\u2019m playing a newer game maxed out.Cons: It\u2019s kind of loud when under heavy load and the fans kick into high gear.I paired this with a Ryzen 5 5600g and 32gb 3200mhz ram. Overall I just decided to build my first pc at a time when the graphics card market is in shambles, so I can\u2019t complain too much about price because idk how prices used to be. But for the $60 above msrp I paid it\u2019s an amazing 1080p60 max settings card. I came from only having consoles for almost 20 years, and I play mostly rpgs or racing games so a locked 60fps isn\u2019t a deal breaker. DOOM, BL3, Sekiro, Far Cry 4, MGSV, Forza Horizon 4 and 5 all run max graphics with no stutters or lag.",

                "reviewText": "I got this card for $227 back in December 2022 and it was the absolute perfect time to buy it. It\u2019s performance is comparable to an RTX 3060 and they both trade blows. FSR 2.0 works great and I\u2019ve been getting well over 80 FPS in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Modern Warfare 2 all on ultra settings. One complaint I have though is the noise. It can be fixed with a fan curve but it\u2019s miles better than my XFX RX 590 which was a total nightmare. Overall, extremely good card and I can\u2019t really complain considering the price I got it at. \ud83d\udc4d-Just one thing though: AMD Radeon Software, I can\u2019t turn the power limit over zero or see my clock speeds and temps in Unigine Benchmark (Heaven and Superposition). I also can\u2019t control the GPU fans in third party software like FanControl. IF YOU HAVE A FIX FOR THE POWER LIMIT OR IF THAT\u2019S JUST HOW THE GPU IS BUILT, TELL ME.",

It serves the 1080p purpose real well, and even 1440p 60fps is achievable if you pull those ultra settings down a notch.IMPORTANT: If you're an overclocker, don't get this MSI model. It's wattage is limited to the stock 100 watts, unlike most other 6600s in the market. I don't mind, and if you aren't an overclocking kinda guy, you really shouldn't care too much either. It will still let you undervolt and overclock it, you just won't be able to make it pull more power, which will limit how much you can push it.",
