                "reviewText": "I bought a budget desktop CPU that only supported output for a single monitor. This card allowed me to run two monitors off its DisplayPort outputs. Given serial capabilities of DP, I suppose you could run more if desired. I also wanted a card that did not require external power; this one draws off the mother board.Setup was a snap. I swapped the attached short port cover for the included long cover, opened up my CPU, fit the card in (no external power required), closed the case, hooked up the cables, and booted up the computer. The card comes with a driver disc, but Windows 10 found and installed the drivers.Now I have the dual monitor setup I like. As a bonus, I also have a little more graphics processing capability (but look elsewhere if you want a modern gaming performance). This card is a great value for those looking to add a couple DP outputs to a desktop.",

It is an obsolete card with many better ones available but was suited to the older computer in which it was a replacement part. The Amazon supplier handled the order beautifully, made sure that this was the part I actually wanted and would work in my machine and shipped it on time and with all that was promised. I would not buy this particular card for a new computer today, there are more advanced video cards out there, but with the setup we had, it was nice to be able to buy a replacement, a new one, that functioned well in the machine. I would buy from this supplier again.",

I didn't want to waste money on a new PC just for documents and surfing so I bought this card. Initially I had issues with the driver because Win10 wasn't picking it up and while it worked, the PC would not remember the extended desktop setting after each restart. I opted to roll back Win10 to default which essentially reinstalled windows and that fixed the issues. It automatically picked up the drivers and has been working seamlessly ever since.",
