                "reviewText": "This was just what I was looking for... something simple, easy to install and doesn't get in the way or look out of place in the PC case. Corrected the slight sag that my EVGA 3070 FTW3 had and I now feel better that the GPU socket isn't getting torqued by the GPU card. Super easy to install and flexible enough to adapt to almost any card. I had to put the rubber bumper in-between the 2nd and 3rd fans on the 3070 FTW3 since the bracket wasn't long enough to catch the end of it. Still worked fine and does not block airflow what-so-ever. The EVGA 3070 FTW3 has a contoured fan shroud which makes getting the bumper in the right place a little bit harder than if it was a flat surface but I was able to find a location that supported the card and that won't slip into a fan accidentally. There is a short bumper and a long one but I used the short one since I think it provides the most stable support.I read another review that said the supplied screws were too short to go through the bracket and card. I honestly can't see how that is possible unless they sent the wrong screws to that person. I didn't even need to use the supplied screws since the original ones were still long enough to fasten it securely. I included a photo in this review to show the supplied screws -vs- the original ones so you can see how much longer they are. Should fit any common PC case.I got the red version which matched my red and black theme and very happy with the simplicity of this support bracket.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, it's great.It works well enough, there are however a few issues with larger graphics cards.With my EVGA RTX 3080 FTW the bar does not line up with the edge of the card. Instead it runs about 3/4\" inset from the edge. This results in the bar going directly where the fans are. This only allows the rubber boot to be placed within a 1/2\" area between the fans. That puts all the weight of the card on a single point that is pressing on nothing but the plastic card shroud deviding the fans.I had 2 times where the rubber bumper slid over and stopped the fans. After glueing it in place, it has not moved again. But stopping the fans could cause some serious throttling if you don't notice.My only other complaint is the obnoxious logo printed right in the middle of the bar. With a full ATX case you can mount the bar upside down to hide it. But on a microATX you will most likely have to see it all the time.I did NOT have any if the issues with the screws others have mentioned, screws not working are probably more a symptom of bad case manufacturing than an issue with the included screws. (My original case screws and the included both worked fine)All that said, for the price, I would definitely recommend it, so long as you are aware of the possible fitment issues with larger cards.",

But a slight push down on the card will make it droop down. As long as the machine is stable and not moved around, it will support a XFX 6800 long card. I like the idea of how it works, just needs to be more rigid. - 12/24/2023 - Update, rather it be automatic or real concern, the seller asked what could be improved. This makes the seller a #1 in my book and would purchase from them again because they asked for my feed back.",

For my install the provided longer slot bay screws and rubber bumpers were the perfect size to make everything work.",

I decided to use the narrower one so that I can flip the bracket and have a clean look without the brand showing as well as just trimming the excess off the rubber pad to fit my desired support.",
