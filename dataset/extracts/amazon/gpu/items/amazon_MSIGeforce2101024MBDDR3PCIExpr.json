                "reviewText": "DELL XPS 8700 Windows 8.1 this card works just fine for dual monitors. But you will need to go into BIOS and disable secure boot mode. I used the onboard graphics while setting this up. I used the HDMI plug (it has a cap hiding it, just pull the cap out and plug in your HDMI TV or monitor). Take your graphics card OUT when doing this. Restart you your computer and Hit F2 when you see the Dell splash screen. Now arrow over to BIOS and change the setting to disable secure boot mode. Exit and restart your computer. Now shut down the computer and put in the new graphics card hook up the HDMI TV and monitor and restart. You should now be good to go.BLACK screens and 5 Beeps!I started out assuming I could just plug and play. But I ended up with black screens and was getting 5 beeps. People kept saying the 5 beeps meant the battery on the mother board was bad or needed to be reseated. That is if you get 5 beeps over and over not 5 beeps and then stops. Luckily I could put my old card back in to do the research. I did not realize there was an onboard HDMI hook up on my DELL until I kept exchanging the cards in and out. I had a hard time getting rid of the drivers I loaded from the start, I used the CD that came with the card. But with the drivers loaded the method above would not work. I had to delete them first which I could not do without the card in place and could not see the screens with the card hooked up to the motherboard. I ended up refreshing my computer to a date before I bought the graphics card and could start from scratch.I have been using this MSI Geforce 210 for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with it. I did not want to spend a lot since I am not a gamer.I just wanted to be able to watch movies on my big screen.",

I know that it was NOT new for the following reasons.1. The package for a new unit would have been in a shrink-fit cellophane wrapper, this was not.2. The package should have contained a low profile bracket, this did not.3. The cardboard container did not have any internal structure that would prevent the PCIE card from moving around.4. But the dead giveaway is that the board was NOT covered with a static resistant wrapper. Every computer item I have ever bought had a static resistant wrapper.I did confirm that the Graphics Processor Card was functional, but I have no idea of its previous history.I consider this UNACCEPTABLE, but I kept the card because I was in dire straits and needed a working computer.I believe the item should should have been classified as RETURNED/REFURBISHED.",

                "reviewText": "What a great little card. I was a little concerned upon first opening the (poorly sealed) box because I saw immediately that the card was attached to a wide profile strip for a wider PC case. THEN I noticed that the 3 ports easily can be unscrewed for removal and placement into two slim profile metal strips and then be secured with the same screws FURTHERMORE then to be placed inside case using/taking up TWO (2) two spaces NOT one (1) not 1 space but 2 spaces. (Notice the emphasis by way of reiteration here? I'm trying to help. This isn't always easy.)Finally, in case you're tired from reading a lot of reviews already or whatever today, NOTE: only one slot, but occupying TWO spaces is what this graphics card does in 'Slim Profile' cases BUT only 1 space, NOT blocking thus keeping available an available slot in standard Wide Profile cases.So, if you're buying this to use in a SLIM profile case, make sure you have at least two spaces available BECAUSE upon having the two in place, one of your available motherboard slots will no longer be available for use.So we know we're talking about the same card here as reviews CAN get mixed; this MSI GeForce 210 1024 MB (that's ~ > 1 GB) DDR3 PCI-Express 2.0 Graphics Card MD1G/D3 in my opinion IS, I feel, a sweet little graphics card. It hums right along with its small, quiet fan and so forth. pretty smooth really.I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak for game performance; however it was a very, very acceptable upgrade for ME personally for use in/on a PC I use only occasionally, so the system I put this in is not in my everyday PC. My supposition just the same however though is that for general everyday use; spreadsheets, Word Processing, web access; general purpose stuff, etc., you won't be disappointed. In fact if you find you're as happy with your decision to get this as I am; that you will find you're feeling pretty good about it and pretty happy at that.",

                "reviewText": "Nice card but my HP Pavilion balked during the boot process. The card initially worked with my monitor and then when the PC went into the boot process, all I got was a black screen. I am sure there might be a setting in the bios that needed to be set so the system could use the card. I am not familiar enough with the bios settings to resolve the problem and could find not help on the internet and so had to return the card.",

                "reviewText": "Originally brought an AMD video card that did not work out and had it exchanged for this MSI GeForce 210. First impression is a professional product; all ports and connector have protective cap/cover; circuit board is of high quality; on top it comes with a pair of low profile brackets that could save me another $15. The installation is as smooth as it could be.Without doing any pre-installation steps, simply turn off the computer, plug in the card, connect the monitor to the VGA port, turn everything on, and the standard 600x800 screen comes up. That is it, the video card automatically becomes the primary display. Unlike the previous video card, I got blank screen all the way. The downloading of drivers and utility is smooth but with a minor glitch. The latest version download button on msi web page is grey outed and need to choose the next one down on the list. There is one problem though once the drivers are installed.The on-board audio speaker is disabled. After some googling, it seems to be a rather common issue; the solution is to get into the computer's BIOS setup to re-enable the on-board audio! However, this audio issue does not affect the HDMI output; there is good sound if the video card is hooked up to a TV via HDMI.For dual display, simply connect a second device, no need to do anything in Windows, as in my case a hd tv is added seamlessly and effortlessly. Finally, another plus for this card is the cooling fan; without a fan like the AMD one, the heat sink could be to too hot to touch. Over all, I am very pleased with this msi geforce card. The installing and setup is as smooth as it should be. Performance wise, it serves my basic needs well. Highly recommended. By the way, my computer is a HP low profile desktop with on-board video and audio running Windows 7 Home Ed.",
