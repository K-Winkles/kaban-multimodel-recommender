It looks absolutely stunning when it is all put together, and I have no regrets buying this bracket to set up my PC this way.Make no mistake, this is a vanity setup. Upright GPU mounting has no performance benefit (possibly even negative performance), and actually introduces inconveniences for the sake of beauty. Your GPU's IO is now inside your PC, and you can't reach it unless you take the mount apart. In my case, it would be a complete pain in the ass because I would have also to unmount my AIO. Measure display and HDMI cables beforehand to ensure there is enough slack to reach your monitors because the embedded AIO will eat some of that up.There are many reviews and build videos out there so be sure to do your research first. The bracket itself is not a big deal, but undoing the installation will cost you time.",
