I wish it had at least a 160bit bus and 10GB of VRAM but it is what it is... in Cyberpunk running DLSS 3 and Frame Gen you can easily get over 100fps at 1440p it has lower power draw and this is a very decent and stylish cooler model. It's definitely worth the upgrade if you prefer Nvidia and you have an older card like the 3060 or 20 series or lower... if you have a 3060 ti or higher just undervolt and stick with your card until something better comes along...Overall I like this card a lot and it has great performance at 1080p and 1440p and would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I read the reviews and everyone's views on the 30 series vs. this one. It was a simple choice for me. I had a 650w power supply and the 3060ti required a 750w. This one would run with a 650w PSU. So, rather than save a $100 on the 3060ti and spend another $150-$200 on a new PSU, I bought this.It has met all of my expectations and more. I should mention, I have an ultra-wide 1080p monitor, a side regular 1080p monitor, and a 1080p TV all hooked up to this GPU. It runs all well, is stable, and I get good fps. 100+ on my main game, Hunt: Showdown on high settings. I probably could get higher fps and smoother play with a newer CPU and motherboard (current: 9900k and z390-pro) but that's something I need to save for. All-in-all, if you want a solid performing 1080p card with a lower power draw, this is a great card. If you can spring for the 4070, and need 1440p resolution, go for it, but don't hate on this card. It's solid for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a gamer at all, but I did want a modern GPU with all the ray-tracing and tensor cores possible for 3D rendering, video rendering, and photo processing without getting one of those insane workstation cards with 6x the RAM. I'm not a professional, I don't need all that. This does wonderful! I have converted 4K video in record time and it runs adobe programs like Illustrator and Premier like a champ.I like that it doesn't have insane power requirements so I was able to get by with a 750 watt PSU with plenty of overhead. I love the Studio ready drivers that are optimized for creative applications. I also like that this card is simply designed with no RGB LED everywhere. You can keep a desktop setup looking professional and clean but still show off that GeForce RTX badging if you like.Install was uneventful in that I had absolutely no issues with the card itself. Once I got the system booting and Windows loaded, installing the drivers was easy and everything is working great. Plenty of outputs for future expansion if I want.Hopefully I'll get many years out of this card before the next big thing comes out. Until then, it is a great card for someone who doesn't game but doesn't want to be limited with creator applications. It could probably game really well too as long as you aren't trying to max-out settings on modern games with 120Hz at 4k.",
