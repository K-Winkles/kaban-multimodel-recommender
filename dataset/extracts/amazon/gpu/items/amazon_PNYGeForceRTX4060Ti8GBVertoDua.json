                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Stellar Upgrade from the 2070 Super - PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti",
                "reviewText": "I've been a dedicated user of the 2070 Super for a solid three years, and it's been a great journey. However, the time came for an upgrade, and the PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB XLR8 Gaming Verto RGB Triple Fan Graphics Card with DLSS 3 has been a game changer for me. Despite the initial skepticism surrounding its release, mainly due to debates over its cost-effectiveness, this card has proven its worth in my setup.First off, let's talk about the acoustics. It's whisper-quiet. I'm talking library-level silence that's a breath of fresh air compared to other cards I've used in the past. When it comes to performance, it doesn't disappoint. Playing games on max settings and still getting smooth, high frame rates has been nothing short of a treat.The aesthetics are a bonus. The RGB lighting adds a sleek, vibrant touch to my glass case setup that just brings everything together visually. It's just a pleasure to look at.Now, I won't skirt around the price point - it is on the higher side, and I'm all for getting the most bang for my buck. But considering the leap in performance from my previous card, I see it as a worthy investment, especially when it's not trying to be a 4080, nor is it priced as one. The affordability relative to its higher-tier cousins was a significant factor in my decision.I purchased this card with a specific need in mind - running AI models locally - and it has exceeded my expectations. The 16GB of memory is a powerhouse, and it's cut down my video and 3D rendering times dramatically compared to the 2070 Super.To cap it all off, the shipping was fast and without any complications, which is always appreciated. It's a breath of fresh air when a product not only meets but exceeds your expectations, and the PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti has done just that. I wholeheartedly recommend this card to anyone looking to upgrade their gaming or creative workstation. It's a solid performer that stands tall in its own right.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using a 1070 with 1080p monitors since 2016, lately started replacing monitors with 1440 and a couple 4k, and the ol 1070 was finally starting to struggle a bit.This seemed like a good choice given it\u2019s recent tech and comes in around the same price as the 1070 during its day, and review/benchmarks suggestedThe card itself is kind of cheap feeling compared to the beefy 1070. Where that has a big heat sink and a brushed aluminum backplate, this one has a big heat sink and a plastic backplate, 1070 had basic RGB, this has no leds, and so on. It runs cool enough, fans get loud but not annoying under load.Performance is beast mode max settings 120fps at 1080, with only very complex RTX crap bogging it down. DLSS works well but don\u2019t believe the IQ hype, it is definitely noticeable.At 1440, it essentially runs the same as the 1070 did at 1080p, maybe 10% faster overall. Which is to say, still very playable with near max or actual maxed non-RT stuff.It will do a playable 4k in most games if you don\u2019t mind some low or OFF settings, and even then you\u2019ll need DLSS for completely stable 60fps.",

                "reviewText": "Having recently gotten into PC gaming again, I felt it was time to retire my 1660ti and replace it with something newer. I did some research and was looking for the best bang for your buck and ultimately settled on this. Seemed to be one of the higher user rated options currently out there.I've lost count of the number of cards that I've installed into machines over the years. Installation was as expected. Make sure you have a big enough case for the version card you get. I opted for the RGB triple fan big boy and I don't think you'll fit that in anything other than a full size tower or a case that is specifically designed for big cards.Being I have Windows 10, after NVIDIA pulled down the needed driver, all my monitor positions stayed where they were with my old card. Didn't have to rearrange anything or mess with any settings. Was back up and gaming in less than 30 minutes all said and done. And a major improvement this card has been so far. It seems to run cooler than I was expecting, and no noticeable noise from the fans over anything else making noise with my build.",

We bought it as a Christmas gift and we were going to bring it into a computer shop to replace it but we ended up replacing the old graphics card by ourselves with the help of some YouTube videos - it was so easy we couldn't believe it! He is very pleased with the performance of his computer now.",

                "reviewText": "I got this as a placeholder card until a nicer card drops in price.CONS: Fans are off until the card gets warm then they get kind of loud. For some reason the mounting holes on the bracket do not align to my case so the card is loosely secured. It's on a 128bit bus.... 16GB of vram is great for what I want it to do but the data flow rate is going to be slow.PROS:Well, it has 16GB of VRAM. It's pretty cheap. It's also lightweight, my screw alignment issues aside it means the card won't pull down on the board like bigger heavier cards do. I do get 60+ FPS on 4k gaming on max settings so you can game on it.End Thoughts:It will get the job done for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Aun fui de los que alcanzo a pedir esta tarjeta, ya que ahora veo que ya ni siquiera tiene listado el precio. En mi caso la compre cuando estaba hasta 1000 pesos mexicanos m\u00e1s barata que las de gigabyte o asus. Aun as\u00ed y a pesar de no conocer mucho sobre PNY, puedo decir que ha resultado ser una gpu bastante buena.Aunque ha sido una tarjeta bastante criticada, sigue siendo una buena opci\u00f3n para actualizar una gpu vieja. En mi caso cambie de una amd 5500 rxt a esta 4060 ti 16gb y definitivamente se nota la mejora. Los ventiladores son m\u00e1s silenciosos y puedo elevar m\u00e1s las opciones graficas y de rendimiento en los juegos. Aun as\u00ed, cabe mencionar que no tengo un juego que realmente me ayude a sacarle todo el rendimiento que podr\u00eda a esta tarjeta, pero es un hecho de que puede correr los t\u00edtulos actuales con opciones normales y altas.La vram que tiene me ha permitido trabajar con software de machine learning, que es para lo que realmente la quer\u00eda. En este aspecto, se podr\u00eda considerar como una opci\u00f3n de entrada asequible cuando se compara con las quadro o cosas as\u00ed.Dicho esto, es una opci\u00f3n buena para las necesidades de cada persona. Tal vez para juegos una amd m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mica y potente sea una mejor opci\u00f3n, pero como entrada para procesos de machine learning definitivamente es de las opciones m\u00e1s baratas que hay. En mi caso que estoy aprendiendo sobre estas nuevas tecnolog\u00edas y ni siquiera juego mucho, resulto ser una gpu ideal.",
