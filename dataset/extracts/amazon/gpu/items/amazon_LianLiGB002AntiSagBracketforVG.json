                "reviewText": "I picked up a 3.5-slot RTX 3080 Ti in the Newegg Shuffle and knew that those two wimpy screws on the backplate wouldn't cut it to keep my GPU from sagging and ripping out the PCIe slot. This kit is perfectly engineered, all metal with standoffs high enough to clear the heatsinks and SATA ports on my ASUS ROG Strix B550-F motherboard. Because my card was extra long, I mounted the bracket on the two rightmost ATX standoffs and positioned the arm as far as it would go toward the front of the case.The long arms included in this kit are perfect to support a long GPU from the opposite end, and at least on my motherboard, the bracket did not interfere with the card seating securely in the PCIe slot, and the screw holes were spaced appropriately to accommodate my oddly-thick GPU. I didn't need to use the included spacers, which were essentially just thick rubber strips with an adhesive backing, but I appreciated having them handy just in case.Overall excellent engineering from Lian Li, and as you can see in the picture, once it's installed it's almost invisible against my black case and blacked-out motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "This is as close to junk that actually somewhat works as it gets. The first thing you install are posts. The threads are about half as long as the ones holding the MB in. It took maybe 2 360 rotations before it bottomed out. Don't worry about the little tool as you wont need it unless you want to break off the post or damage the MB. This is followed by some cheap super thin sheet metal bracket that looks to be spray painted black. This cant be more than a 64th thick. The screws holding this to the post have maybe an 1/8\" thread. I used an eyeglass screwdriver as I was afraid to put any more torque then a finger twist. The holes that mount the card holding bracket really have no threads. It's not thick enough and the holes do not have extra metal for threads. You need to be very careful here. I over tightened the first one with my eyeglass screw driver and 2 fingers. The screw was fine but the mounting hole wasnt. Luckily I miscounted and had to move it up one anyway. Super careful on the 2nd try. So it works I think? I was really afraid to push on it. Considering how well my Lian Li case is made there is no way the kit I received came from them. It looked like 2.00 of home depot stuff and a rattle can of black paint.. The printed directions was probably more costly than the hardware in the kit.",
