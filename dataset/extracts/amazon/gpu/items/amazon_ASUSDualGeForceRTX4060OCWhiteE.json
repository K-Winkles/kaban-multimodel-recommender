                "reviewText": "I bought this on Nov 27, 2022 to replace my GTX whose CUDA was so slow which impacted video rendering a LOT. Gaming was really good. Until I noticed this one. Blazing CUDA performance! Games are also a lot better. I don't care about the A.I. stuff, but I've tried it. Ehhh... The CUDA is a big deal, and though CPU rendering is better quality sometimes you just want great quality FAST. It functions well with Windows 7 as well as 11. I cannot handle Windows 10 and that ugly Metro thing. I've also started trying Linux Ubuntu and some others. Some older games just won't run at correct speeds or have problems that were made for x64. So Windows 7 is still very handy. However, Wine with Ubuntu has been very helpful in these cases. I'm not a \"hard-core\" gamer, so... DiRT 5, DiRT 4 (a modification is needed), and some other new ones do very well with this board. I also dig the RTX remakes of Source's games like Portal. Though I noticed I had to degrade some performance in the game for it to be totally smooth. Since they're still in process maybe that will change soon enough? The lowering of settings though does not detract from the added Ray Tracing. Wow! So Windows 7, 11, and Unbuntu are doing really with this in everything I've done. Again, I'm not really an A.I. fan, but it has moments of cool, as long as it not ChatGPT...I'm cool with it.HDMI sounds fantastic, but most times I'm using my AirPods or wired ear buds. But when playing Rush songs, the HDMI does very well. Games sound good, and I always disable game music because it detracts from games. When I'm talking to people, or in situations music isn't often going at the same time.",

Installing was so easy it seemed too good to be true. Plug it in, install drivers and nvidia software, boom you\u2019re ready to play. Absolutely amazed there were no driver issues! The card runs cooler than my previous 4gb card and consumes less power. The 4060 is a bit heavy and does sag slightly in my pc, not enough to cause damage but if I pay close attention I can notice it isn\u2019t perfectly straight. So you may want to invest in a support of some kind to help hold the gpu up. Overall I\u2019ve had a fantastic experience with this card so far, it works as intended and had no driver issues.",

                "reviewText": "Brand new and untouched phoenix! Box was sealed and honestly great performance for the platform of gamers it aims for it\u2019s a great card!Tiny form factor! I just upgraded from a EVGA 1060gb 6gb single fan and it\u2019s roughly the same size as the older model! The cooler on it is massive! The Asus phoenix generally takes 3 slots while the evga would only take two slots.Specs: It\u2019s roughly in the same ball park as a 1080ti and a 2070 super. You can game on a 1080p monitor and get 60-80fps ultra settings but I\u2019ve seen it also get 50-70fps on a 1440p I just think it\u2019s the drivers or Ampere technology making it utilize so well in 2k. In my opinion the 3060 can get 70fps average on 1080p and 60 fps average on 2k, 4k however it struggles with medium/high settings only getting 20-50fps.Thermals are great! My GTX 1060 6gb was hitting 90c while this one runs around 60-80c it\u2019s also quieter too! Both GPUs use the same 100% utilization when gaming at similar specs.Overall: It\u2019s a great mid tier card! If you plan on gaming with high refresh rate of 144hz on 1080p your definitely getting 80fps average!At 1440p you can definitely game at 60fps average! At 4K it\u2019s playable if you are okay with 30-50fps average.Personally: I\u2019m having buyers remorse, I wish I went with the 3060ti because the 27% increase in performance would definitely please my 60 fps needs at 3k gaming! Im running at 3960x1080p resolution triple monitor and my fps is averaging 40-50fps which is expected because at 4K i would be getting the same fps. I might be limited by my cpu and pcie 3.0 so I might get better results if I upgrade my mobo and cpu more testing needs to be done, but in my opinion the 3060 ti would definitely get me the 60 fps I need except in GTA V it runs 60fps solid, but that\u2019s because the game runs better on triple monitors.Cons: What\u2019s the point of 12gb vram? Ampere is great but the GPU is actually the same as a 3060 6gb laptop variant. I get the same fps I would on my laptop with both systems getting average 70fps on 1080p ultra gaming.It\u2019s odd but when utilizing 3.5gigs of vram I can maintain 70fps+ on high settings but if you go into 5 gig or 6 gig territory the card really struggles, it\u2019s like only 4 gigs of vram is actually been properly utilized and the extra 8 is just crap in comparison. Maybe it\u2019s the 192-bit bus because I\u2019ve only seen it utilize 4gigs properly.Personally it\u2019s a great 1080p card if you want 144fps 1440p card for 60fps but it will struggle in 4K gaming.If you want high refresh rates I would definitely go with 3060 ti and above because I feel like this card can only perform at best 75fps 1080p ultra settings with low raytracing from what I\u2019ve seen.The only game I\u2019ve seen it get 240fps is League of Legends.My 1060 6gb was only getting max 140fps so it\u2019s definitely an upgrade but I\u2019m not really seeing a difference on my 144hz monitorIs this a card I\u2019m planning on using for a while? No with todays age and 2k gaming and 4K being widespread you can use a small 2k monitor and average 60fps but With 4K 144hz is almost around the corner so I see myself upgrading in the near future very soon.Sadly I can\u2019t return it because it\u2019s a GPU things are hard to get and I enjoy 1080p ultra setting gaming at 70fps. But is 600$ worth it? Nah I would rather get a 3060ti because you would definitely get 120+ fps at 1080p on ultra.If I sold my 1060 at 250$ msrp i would definitely gotten the 3060 at 350 msrp maybe scalpers are trying to make us give away our old gpus to everyone haha!I do enjoy how my 3060 laptop and my 3060pc give the same performance in all the games! Ampere is definitely ahead of its time when it comes to utilization!",
