I will update the review once I get a compatible power adapter cable.EDIT: I updated the review to 4 stars from 2. I got a 8 Pin Male to Dual PCIe 8 Pin Female Adapter wherein I connected 2 PCIe power cables to the female adapters and then the male to the GPU. This worked great. The next issue if you are running this like I am in a Desktop cabinet with good airflow is that it isn't in a data center so you will need active cooling. I got a simple blower that I use to push air across the GPU to move away from the GPU's heat sinks. The GPU is awesome. I would have given 5 stars if it had included the power adapter that is shown on most unboxing videos instead of me having to order it separately.",

The AI technology innovation opportunities created by this product are endless. This is the breakthrough technology needed for the future of complex AI computing. The double precision coming out at 7.8 Teraflops and deep learning at 125 Teraflops. This also clocked in the highest score ever on the open CL Geekbench test at 417807. Im currently using my card to run games (dont@me) and when I did boy were they awesome. The graphics are as smooth as a babies butt rubbed with butter. The new Roblox update looked gorgeous and took full advantage of this beast of a GPU. After I tried this, I decided to test its performance on Minecraft. Boy oh boy...this was an absolute champ. I was able to spawn about 20,000 pigs and run around for countless hours hearing their delicate little grunts. I could see the little details in the pixilated Minecraft grass, so lush and thick. The sky rendered so perfectly I almost shed a tear. This graphics card stole my heart. Simply breathtaking. This is by far the best graphics card for use as a eGPU for the MacBook Air. It put its Intel intregrated graphics to shame.",

                "reviewText": "Picked up this little gem yesterday and man I didn't realize what I was missing! The card has to have alien technology built into it. I swear it even made the delivery driver look 10 times hotter. And for the best part you don't even need a computer to make it work. It may be the placebo effect, but since I have gotten this card I have been able to run faster and lift heavier weights! Simply amazing. The only negative thing I can say about the card was that it didn't make Tetris look any different. Probably because I don't have it installed in a computer. So not going to hold it against this freaking spaceship. But it sure made me a better player! Anyway do yourself a favor and pick up a couple of these bad boys so you can have it in stereo!",

Nvidias tools recognize it as a Tesla V100 and it gets 7+TFLOPS/s on their samples. So don't let the fact that Dell is selling this for $19,500 make you think this one must be a fraud. The university I do research at bought the card so Amazon doesn't recognize my account as a certified purchaser of the card but it is in the desktop I use.",

Unfortunately my monitor had massive screen tearing and I misplayed as the mouse was not keeping up. The cards flickered like a candle as they floated across the screen. My CRT monitor glass turned black from the unbelievable frame rate before bursting into flames. I then upgraded my monitor to 240hz and you would not believe it, I can now see the air molecules pushing back on the cards as I move them from the Tableaux to their foundation homes. Words cannot describe the winning cascade. It was visually stunning; more so than Iguazu Falls itself. Simply tremendous! This GPU is the future of Solitaire and I will be recommending it at worlds in Helsinki.",
