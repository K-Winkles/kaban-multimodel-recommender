                "reviewText": "I bought this 3080 last year for $700, it\u2019s crazy to see the price still the same 9 months later, if you are 4k gaming, you are better off adding $400 for the 4080. This GPU runs HOT and is super loud. I couldn\u2019t bare it so I upgraded to 4090, if you just play 1080 or 1440 then this GPU could maybe suit your needs. But will be outdated by 2025.On 4k low settings halo Infinite I was getting 90-100fps , tempature would spike to 85+, 76-78 with no cover on my case.",
