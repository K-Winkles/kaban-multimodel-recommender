                "reviewText": "No need to review the 3080 part. That\u2019s been throughly covered.The main things to note about this card are:1) Only has two 8pin connectors. That\u2019s not enough OC overhead for a card that is not only watercooled but represents Gigabytes top of the line series of video cards. Trying to push the OC makes the card unstable-random system crashes. Even though temps are low and the system seems stable for a few hours.2) The G1/4 openings are designed for traditional 13/10 (1/2\u201d-3/8\u201d) size fittings. Larger fittings may contact against the leak protection circuit and cause a system crash. Leak feature can only be disabled by pulling out the two pin connector.3) Plating inside the waterblock comes off over time and discolors your tubing. It leaves a muddy copper colors residue on tubing that can only partially be removed. You\u2019ll need to replace your tubing unless you used something like glass or opaque tubing. This happens even with a through pre clean. It might be possible to avoid by pre stripping the platting off in advance by soaking the block in a mild acid like vinegar. But I didn\u2019t try that.",

Was able to get around that by only starting the Gigabyte software setting the effect (not smart) and then closing all services and starting other softwares.With this being said the temp of the vram is higher than i would wanted it to be, will be a 5 star product id the software was not so buggy and the vram was cooler.",

No over clocking at all. Liquid cooled and card gets no higher than 38-42 Celsius on extreme use. Gigabyte customer support takes 5-7 days to respond to an RMA request and since their hacking, their processes are just horrible. Stay away from from the 12GB and 10GB Revision 2 cards.

                "reviewText": "The 3080 is a powerhouse of a graphics card. What else can I say. You won't be disappointed in the outstanding video quality this produces. Being already attached to a water block saves time and hassle too, if you're planning on a water cooling build.As for the seller MCI Electronics, they were great!The outer seal on the box was split on arrival. I was concerned I was receiving a used graphics card or a returned item. I immediately contacted the seller, who sent me a pic of the item that was sealed before shipping. They helped alleviate my fears of it being used or a retuned item. And said that the seal was probably damaged in shipping. I opened the item and found that it was not used, but did have some small holes in the static bag along the sharp edges of the card, and also the items in the box had been jostled. It did correlate that the box was bounced around during shipping. After discussing it with the seller I opted to keep the card and try it out once my computer was built. I am happy to report that the GPU works well and I am a happy customer so far. I appreciate the fast and professional responses from MCI Electronics. I would consider them to be a trustworthy seller of computer parts. I would offer the advice of better packing in the future for such an expensive item though.",
