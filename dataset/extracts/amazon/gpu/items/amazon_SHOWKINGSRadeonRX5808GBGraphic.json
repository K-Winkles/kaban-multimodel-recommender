                "reviewText": "I'd built a system with a Ryzen 5 CPU for my wife, and because she's not big into gaming, I'd used a reasonably inexpensive Nvidia-based GPU. After several months, she continued to experience intermittent hangs/lockups of her display for a second or two. Checking Event Viewer, I could see that she was experiencing a driver crash, despite having the most up to date drivers.Thinking that getting an AMD-based Radeon GPU might solve the solution for her, I again looked for a reasonably inexpensive solution, but one that would provide a bit more gaming capabilities for her, as she does like to play Age of Empires every now and then. This SHOWKINGS Radeon RX 580 8GB Graphics Card, 256Bit 2048SP fit the bill perfectly and the price was right.Installation was of course easy and despite the larger size/fans the card is very quiet - a requirement for her - with the fans off most of the time.Best of all, the hangs/lockups are gone.Overall, very happy with the change.",

I picked up this Radeon RX 580 8GB for small $, slotted it in quickly, and it's been working great - for stuff like War Thunder it actually works quite well driving three 27\" 1080P monitors (@60 hz, of course).

                "reviewText": "This is a review of the SHOWKINGS Radeon RX 580 8GB Graphics Card, 256Bit 2048SP GDDR5 AMD Video Card. The card performs outstandingly. It was affordable and can handle most videogames based on reviews I have read. My primary usage is for movies and animation. I use Adobe Creative Cloud software and it really is a perfomance gobbling software. With rendering and the like, it slowed down my other, older computers. This new computer I built from parts hoping to improve rendering time and quality when I have more than one program open (like AE, Photoshop, twenty pages on the web, Fusion360, Word, and Adobe Premiere, all at the same time). The card handles graphics flawlessly - (and so does everything else on my $650 build PC). Performance is a lot like the Alienware top end computers so this card brings it. There are better and more expensive cards out there, and this is close to legacy, but with inflation, this card's going to be around for a long time to come thus future-proofing the build.",

                "reviewText": "Upgraded from integrated GPU on AMD Ryzen 5600g, improved 3d Mark score on DirectX 12 free test from ~1400 to ~4500 and now we are able to change graphics settings from Low to High in games like MS Flight Sim or Fortnite. Whilst it may not be a good choice for high end gaming machines, for a $500 rig we bought my son last Xmas this is a massive upgrade! Card itself appears well made, definitely takes up a chunk of space so be prepared for tight fit if you other cables like SATA plugged into the motherboard in the space this card occupies. For $100ish I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a better GPU upgrade with this RX580.",
