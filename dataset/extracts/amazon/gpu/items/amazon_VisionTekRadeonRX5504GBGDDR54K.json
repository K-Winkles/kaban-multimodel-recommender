                "reviewText": "Unlike most users, I am not a gamer. I needed to upgrade the graphics card on my Dell XPS 8910 tower for the purposes of video editing using Davinci Resolve 17. The card that came with the unit did not support OpenCL and had only 2 GB of memory so the program would always fail when I tried to render even the simplest videos. So I was more interested in the ability of the GPU to support video and photo editing. From that perspective I am very happy. I was able to edit a half hour worth of 4K video without having to use proxy files and the video played smoothly while editing. And when it came to rendering, it worked flawlessly. Installation was very easy and the driver auto installed after a few minutes.Gamers may have other opinions, but as a video editor on a fairly simple set up, it has been well worth the money.",

It works just as I had hoped. I see no delays or reasons to think this is slow in my world. If one is doing high speed complex gaming I suspect this would probably not be the card for you.",
