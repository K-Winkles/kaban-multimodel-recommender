                "reviewText": "Instructions are very dull and not multilingual. all Japanese he he. Its a nightmare to install in a Lian Li Dynamic Evo. It doesn't come with a PCI-E Riser Cable. Their expensive too. I was luck enough to find a used $120 Thermaltake TT PCI-E Riser cable for under $40. Be advised the cable will need to.be installed beneath your power supply in my case. It was a cabling nightmare but worth it in the end! Look at how pretty this EVGA RTX 3080 XC3 Hybrid water cool mod looks on it. Gorgeous. Dropped Thermal temperatures and dynamics with x3 Static Pressure 120mm Artic P12 PWM Argb fans in the read blowing in the back plate. At the highest stress testing and benchmarks at 4k. The care wouldn't heat past 51 C. It idles at 28C. -2 less than installs regularly. Also it takes all the GPU heat AWAY from your CPU! My CPU temps dropped from 40-50-c regular load to 36-40 C! Definitely worth the investment. I am a proud user of Lian Li since the vintage PC 60. Never abandoning them again!",

It\u2019s not welded or riveted together. It slides and screws together.Whether you\u2019re in the market to mount your gpu vertically, or horizontally\u2026 this is the way to go because both positions are entirely possible.I bought this specifically so I can rack-mount my desktop pc (2u server chassis have rear panels typically designed for vertical low-profile 1 slot cards unless modded)I use the vertical mount portion to mount my lian li 750w psu on the thermaltake core p1 itx edition. Existing holes lined up perfectly.Although that\u2019s only temporary/Test Bench",
