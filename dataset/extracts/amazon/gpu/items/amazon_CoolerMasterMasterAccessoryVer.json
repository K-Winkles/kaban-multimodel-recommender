                "reviewText": "I highly recommend this GPU holder, next to no questions asked.Bracket, Support & Positioning:VERY intuitive installation overall. Documentation is picture-based and easy to follow. I would consider this beginner-friendly and a great alternative to something from Antec, etc. As a general rule of thumb, familiarise yourself with the bracket before inserting your GPU - I was able to attach the bracket to the case, insert my GPU into the 2nd piece, and then slide the 2nd piece into the main bracket before securing. Very quick and in my opinion, easy to do.It also allows you to slide and position the GPU where you want it (i.e. more left or right, and more forwards or back). This was something unique from my original Lian Li bracket where my GPU was nearly forced againist the glass once I was able to get the dang thing in (more notes below on that). It supports my card exactly as I expect it to.Riser Cable & GPU Cabling:I was happy that this included the updated 4.0 cable as I don't have to perform witchcraft in my BIOS. It has some good length on it, while also being sturdy yet flexible. I'm very happy with it and the ease of installation itself was easy.For the power cables to the GPU, I did have to pull it out and extend to rotate around. If using a non-modular PSU and depending on your case, you will have to clean up your cable management if your power cable is not long enough. Do note that, case-depending, you will have a recess on the back of your case. This is normal and I found to be most welcome for a multitude of reasons that might be due to personal preference. Part of the back panel is also removable, which the instructions include as well.Packaging:Arrived securely and well-packaged. Bracket and sub-bracket were wrapped safely so no pre-assembly dings.Notes for clarity:I previously purchased the one specifically for my case (Lian Li PC-011D-XL) (the 3.0 variant) and it was ridiculously complicated / warped. I bought it again from another local store just in case and STILL had issues with it. I love my case but this has been a pain for a long time.This was installed on an E-ATX case and attached to an ATX motherboard, with a fully modular PSU that included pre-extended cabling. There are no cons because honestly, it works perfectly, even at this price point because you want quality for an expensive component. I'm not waiting in a 12 hour line again.",

                "reviewText": "Solid GPU mount that works in a mATX case. It left just enough room below for mounting my fans to help cool the GPU. My only gripe with it is that the PCIE cable is very stiff and pretty long. I had to use some heat to make bends in the cable so it didn't push too hard on the PCIE slot or mount. Plenty of adjustments to make everything work, though I needed to ziptie the back of the mount to the case as the PCIE was pushing it towards the side glass.Overall I'm happy with it as something that is wholly unnecessary for a PC build.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Can cause problems if GPU needs the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0 (RTX 30 series cards)",
                "reviewText": "I bought this to install a 3080 Ti into a Lian Li o11 dynamic case. The card is just barely too wide with common power supply connectors and results in you not being able to use the side panel on my specific case. One of the commenters on this product page did say it worked with the 3080 and 3090, so I figured I should be safe. It took about 10 minutes to install and be running.After 6 months, I started to experience system crashes with no discernible data in the event viewer to identify the cause. I would frequently see a critical error indicating failure to even write a memory dump. After a day of just crashes after every 30 minutes, I did manage to actually get a blue screen of death that said \"VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE\". This lead me to a ton of research and landing on a post on some community where the user indicated they had a vertical GPU mount and it was the cause.Sure enough, I replace the vertical mount and inserted the card normally, leaving the side panel off, and did not encounter any more crashes since. I did understood that my card and the slot on the motherboard worked with PCI 4.0. There might have been a setting in the bios to force the slot to also just be 3.0 at the cost of performance, but I decided to just play it safe. I am now just running my machine without the side panel and looking for low profile PCIe 6+2/8 pin, 90 degree adapters to see if I can force the connections down and have enough space to still use the side panel. I am also checking for decent rated and reviewed vertical mounts for PCI 4.0 cards too.I do not have the data to know if there are any additional issues that can be attributed to the reviewed product, but the issue I encountered was due to me not having the proper product for the devices I use, therefore I am not going to dock points on that. Shipping is irrelevant to the product, but it came on time and without any breaks.",

Bit of a squeeze with the cable to connect to the PCIe slot, but once it's in its does it job wonderfully.",
