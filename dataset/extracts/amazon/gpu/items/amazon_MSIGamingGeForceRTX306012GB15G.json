                "reviewText": "Looking at the specs, I liked the 3060 over the 4060 (even though the 4060 does get an extra ~10fps in most games) simply because I was hesitant to buy a card with less than a 192-bit memory interface. After some testing and witnessing this card turn my 8 year old i5-6500 into a complete bottleneck, I was pretty surprised with the results.To start, the OC edition will automatically bump up the core clock even past the advertised boost clock speeds as high as it's comfortable. For me, that meant 2000+ MHz out of the box. With MSI afterburner, I had the card running at 2200+ MHz in modern games like Forza Horizon 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 without ever going above 67c.That's another thing, this is the first card I've ever had with a stock fan curve I actually don't mind. My last card's stock fan curve let it hit 83c, which had me using custom fan curves from extra programs like Precision X OC in the background of every single game. With this card, fans kick on at 55-60c and keep temps under 65c usually, unless I'm pushing the card at close to 100%, and quickly bring temps down to 40c before shutting off completely. Very quiet gaming, wether the fans are on or not actually.Upgrading from a 1060, the difference is pretty drastic. Most games easily hit 90-120fps on high/ultra settings at 1080p, with the exception of a few demanding titles (lookin' at you RDR2) and that's with my aging i5. I've played with upscaling in some games as well and still managed to keep a steady 60fps at bare minimum. I'll admit, I was skeptical about DLSS at first (Nvidia's choice to make the 4060 and 4070 a 128-bit card and claim that DLSS 3 would more than make up for it left a bad tast in my mouth) but it's been pretty nice so far, definitely not to be overlooked.At ~$280, this is a pretty good upgrade from the 1060 I spent $220 on almost 8 years ago. Should I have spent a little more for a 4060 or maybe a 3060ti? Maybe. For a \"budget\" build though, this card will definitely satisfy.",

                "reviewText": "Recently, I gotten into sim racing and well, I needed more VRAM but also more performance. I figured why not refresh my pre-built PC and give it some more love!At the time, I had a MSI GTX 1660 Super Gaming X, it was great at the time due to me playing low-end to mid-end range games, occasionally some high-end games time to time but with running Assetto Corsa with a few mods, the 6GB of VRAM on the graphics card was suffering quite a bit, leading to an unpleasant experience such as stutters for long periods of time, even lower my graphics wasn\u2019t enough to keep up with what was going on in my game.With the RTX though.. it\u2019s been such a wonderful experience. Never had an RTX before, hell, not even a GTX before getting my PC. I always was a console player so having to make such a huge switch was definitely a good investment. With the 12GB of VRAM from the RTX, I have no issues playing Assetto Corsa anymore, no stuttering or anything like that! Temps wise, I am not too sure what it is as I mainly monitor my CPU temp but it has been quiet.Although, the only mistake I\u2019ve made was that I didn\u2019t do enough research and ended up bottlenecking the RTX with my i5-10400F so I am not getting all the performance from the GPU. Still though, for what it is, I am happy with this graphics card. I am new to PCs and what not so upgrading my pre-built along the way I go will do just fine for me.",
