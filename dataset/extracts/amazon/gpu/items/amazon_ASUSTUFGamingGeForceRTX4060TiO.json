So the basic requirements and procedures for troubleshooting are second nature to me.The four light located on the Motherboard are called \"De-bug LED's\". They're used to quickly diagnose problems upon start up. That being said when I built this PC almost a month ago, it ran great.But sadly just the other day, while gaming (World of Warships, not graphically intensive), the monitors completely shut off and the White LED turned on. This white LED is the \"VGA\" de-bug light and signals that there's something wrong with the GPU. That being said it's generally an easy fix. You either make sure you power plug are secured properly or reinsert the GPU. I tried both, multiple times. And many other attempts to get it working. But sadly nothing. The fact this died during game usage shows it's a faulty piece of equipment.I know TUF is the cheaper brand of Asus but this is ridiculous.",

                "reviewText": "Yeah, the 4060 Ti got \"bad reviews\" from many YouTubers who think gaming is the only thing that exists. But if you want plenty of VRAM for AI purposes this 16Gb variant is a great option (I do some gaming with it too and it handles War Thunder at 4K easily) and this particular version won't have any temperature issues.The only other option for that amount of VRAM is to jump up to the 4080 or 4090 and that is easily double the price plus there's a chance you also need to upgrade other PC components to handle it (PSU, cooling etc...). This fit into an older PC with a 550 PSU and mATX motherboard. Even though there is a WiFi card in the other slot and it's described as a 3.1 slot card, there wasn't a space problem.Stable Diffusion now zips along which really helps with the creative flow and allows processing much larger images than an 8Gb card (esp. if using SDXL models).",
