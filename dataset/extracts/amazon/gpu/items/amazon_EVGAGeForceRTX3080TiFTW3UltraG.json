                "reviewText": "EVGA 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra - simply the best value in a performance GPUAmazed that Amazon was the seller & shipper with 6% discount @ time of purchase, then my Amazon Prime & CC 5% \"credit\" made this a great value for this graphics card.The 3090 might have up to a 5% performance edge; but, boy do you pay a lot more (~50%) for that tiny bump in performanceNo issues, plug & play, used HDMI cable. My Nvidia driver was already new enough to see this card in my X570 build.The EVGA X1 software ver 1.2.6 which was already installed on this PC - recognized the new GPU & advised an update to the firmware.The X1 firmware updated without issue. You just need to wait for it to complete. I highly recommend using a UPS power supply, you do not want any interruptions during the update.Yes 30 series GPUs run warmer than previous designs ... that is the price of a more powerful GPU. So, you want excellent air flow ... & not a tiny case &your case fans need to be moving plenty of airRoom Temp 68F [20C] ..... GPU die Max 60C @ 2040 MHz with a small OC setting in EVGA X1 software. This is an Open bench test & has been running like this for Over 12 hours. Cards fans @ 90%That is a Delta T of 40C (die temp Rise, over room temp) - the case, fans & room temp you use can impact your resultsUsing an EVGA 850 T2 PSU with No Issues on a x570S MB & 5950X AMD 16 core CPUNot OC CPU or heavy loads on CPU -- pulls 600-650W, with the 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra under Full loadThe only Con in the whole process .... Was the shipping from Amazon. Package was not shipped for 2 day delivery - Amazon choose to ship ground 5 days? no idea why with a Prime account.The Bigger issue ... did someone try to open this box ? It was destroyed! Crushed! Torn Open in Spots!I made the UPS driver wait while I inspected my package contents - Box was destroyed & partially re-taped in few spots .... What in the World happened to that box, was my first thought. ..... the outer shipping box was heavily damaged --> crushed & corners seams torn open in several places ... looks like someone might have tried to remove the contents ??... The EVGA thin \"retail box\" (with the Pictures of GPU) only had minimal damage ... torn where it looks like someone tried to open? & 1 corner of the box had a Small dent...... The inner retail \"heavy box\" inside the retail package was not damaged at All ? This does not equate to the destroyed shipping box. I do not believe this damage was from the automated convener system UPS uses... again almost like someone tried to open the shipping Box & retail package .... the EVGA factory seals were still intact. So, I took possession of the package from UPS & signed for this EVGA 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra",

                "reviewText": "EVGA got out of the graphics card business after the 30XY generation. The next better is the 3090, but you get 5% improvement for 50% more, and it takes up another card slot.I use it mostly for flight simulation with PrePar3D v5 and I've never seen it get much above 50% usage. Of course, I keep the frame rate to about 30 FPS. I'm driving a 38\" diagonal Alienware monitor via DP. DP seems more efficient the HDMI. I used HDMI to drive a 24\" Samsung monitor and even though there were fewer pixels to drive, the GPU used more processing power.Just in case, I added a CPU support to keep the card from sagging. The EVGA motherboards have a slot-sized gap by the CPU so that's where I put this card so I didn't use two PCIe connectors.",

I undervolt mine, and temps stay in the low to mid 60's *C. The FTW3 Ultra version of this card has plenty of room for overclocking, mine has reached power draw of over 460 watts while testing overclocks. The cooler is fine, and with the fans at or below 80% it's very quiet, however if the fans go above 80% they get pretty loud. Also, this GPU is quite expensive, several hundred dollars more than a standard 10GB 3080, with around 20% more performance. However at around $500 cheaper than a 3090 with virtually identical gaming performance, it's a decent value for people looking for maximum gaming performance.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this RTX 3080ti less than 1 month ago and tested it on three different flight simulators' platforms for three weeks straight. I run the card at temperatures between 54 and 58 degrees Celsius and high FPS on all simulators. These RTX cards, particularly the ones from EVGA, are already overclocked at stock. I tried overclocking the GPU to 2,100Mhz with no great gain in FPS. The algorithms on those simulators don't seem to allow FPS to increase by more than a few even with high OC settings.The best use with the RTX cards is to work with as little voltage as possible, as the silicon allows (I only allow 840mV max to feed this GPU), and maintain a clock speed between 1,930Mhz and 1,960Mhz. I don't see more than 220 Watts during heavy loads, with an average of 200 Watts across all three platforms, as compared to the 320 watts at stock. This, while playing MSFS 2020 at Ultra settings, with the fans barely spinning and barely audible. The GPU came to me with a stock 84 degree Celsius and all fans spinning out control... In three weeks, I reduced the operating temps by about 30 degrees and quieted the fans to a minimum, all with gains in FPS and plenty of stability. The advantage with this card, at least for me, was the available 12 GBs of VRAMs in a powerful RTX GPU. Heat / voltage / FPS can be improved very easily with lots of testing and some crazy calculations that I developed when I learnt to 'quiet' my 2070 Super in 2020. I run this much cooler and at much lower frequencies than my 2070 Super and gained about 20 / 30 FPS on average.I am looking at doing the same to the RTX 3090 now, which I prefer only because of the extra 12 GB of VRAM. Starve them and keep them cold and they'll behave. No custom loop required!",

Does produce a lot of heat so make sure your pc have a efficient cooling system for your gpu and also for your cpu.

I replaced my old rtx 2080super with this beast and I've been impressed. Over 40% performance improvement however the card does get hot at stock settings and fans ramped up to 80% to keep the card at 80c while gaming, but with a little undervolt the card caps out at 70c while gaming for long period of times and stays at 45c at idle. I would reccomend this card for anyone who can afford it.",
