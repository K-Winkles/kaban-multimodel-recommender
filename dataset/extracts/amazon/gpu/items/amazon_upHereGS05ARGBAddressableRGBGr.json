It's going to work great and keeps some weight off my PCI-e slot when my triple slot GPU is installed.Pros:Thicker than I was expecting, pretty sturdy design.Comes with long thumb screws so you can keep your PCI-e covers on, or install a smaller card behind it(e.g Wifi, NVMe Raid Card)Addressable RGB is great, syncs perfectly.Comes with Rubber pads for vibrationsNo SATA Power needed(idk what some of these other reviews are talking about)Slider can be adjusted on both an X and Y axis.Nice quality packagingCheapCons:Has one dead LED(Not really too noticeable though)RGB is a little less saturated than my RAM and Fans.Slider is a little bit stiff when moving up or over the first time.Sits slightly crooked with weight on it, like 2 degrees not a big deal, barely noticeable.",

                "reviewText": "For the price this can't be beat. Its simple and easy to install. For those saying they need to bend the bracket to work with an EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra Gaming GPU, you do not. As another reviewer pointed out, just move the stand back to the middle of the card. The center fan is offset back from the other two and the stand will fit perfectly in that spot and not interfere with any fan operation. I can only show the rgb working through EVGA Precision X1 software. Since these cards come with a 5v header I just plugged it into that and the color representation has been spot on. Since the bracket does not have a support back to the motherboard (if it did, I would not have bought it) it can be a little wobbly but once you have it set where you want it, it will remain there. Now, if you are one of those people that still lugs their desktop gaming parties then I suggest a little super glue on the rubber pads. As others have stated, these things just fall out. I think in one of my pictures one had already moved out. I reset them and they are remaining in their spot now but I would expect to find them in a fan if I had to move this big case to another room. All in all, easy to install and looks great and at a third the cost of the Cooler Master stand, its a steal, especially if you have fans on the bottom and cannot use a regular post stand.",

                "reviewText": "For $15 you can't get much better than this. Most GPU support brackets are crazy expensive. This one is pure quality for only $15. It is made of solid metal, so you don't have to worry about it not doing it's job. The RGB syncs to you motherboard, and the colors match. RGB is subtle and not obnoxious, only issue I can see is the adjustment for the amount of support doesn't really help all that much, and you're stuck guessing at how high you need it, but once it's set you're good. Sag is gone and it's a really good looking piece in any build.The only bad part is putting in the screws for the expansion slots, a magnetic long screwdriver is a must, otherwise you'll spend a lot of time trying to set the screws and then trying to screw them in.",

                "reviewText": "The quality here is more than acceptable for the price, but the individual item delivered was plainly not new, and was missing the rubber pads described in other reviews. That wouldn't have been a show stopper, but the Arc 770's lower shroud is curved -- attractive, but not really compatible with the small flat platform on offer at the end of the strut here.In addition, I'm a tad skeptical of the design after an attempt to install -- in theory, the use of three slot screws should be pretty solid. But in practice there's too much play for the thing to be really stable. You really have to bear down on the screws (more than I'm comfortable with anyway), and you also have to get the thumbscrew that holds the card up just right to really prevent sag. In my case, the only place I could find that would allow the system to prop up the card was along the edge of the cut out for the fan -- not really ideal.The RGB plug on my unit was also loose and readily slid off the motherboard header -- but I suspect that was an issue with this particular unit. The lighting itself was fine.Not really a negative review -- what's here is reasonably well made. Just not a design that ended up working in my particular use case. I'm not sure the Intel card is really heavy enough to require a brace. But I may try one of the thin posts that are magnetic on the bottom and threaded on top to allow more precision about the upward pressure applied to the card, and a simpler design that is less likely to allow play. Sometimes simpler is better.",

No point buying this. Look somewhere else!Update: this bracket's support actually is in such a place that it starts bumping into the gpu fan. I have tried all possible spacings and it doesn't work. I realized this after 2 hour gaming session with my headphones on after my computer was making a very bad sound. Please do not buy this, it will potentially damage your GPU!",
