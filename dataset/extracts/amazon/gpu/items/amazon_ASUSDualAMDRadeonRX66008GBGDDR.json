Everything was good quality... I'm even keeping the box it came in because it's so strong. It comes with an adjustable anti-sage brace and I would suggest using it. While the brace is fine, I'm going to buy an even stronger one. Again, very well built card, easy install, very cool running, insanely fast, and incredible graphics. I just download drivers from ATI and I love ASUS but I hate Armoury Crate so I avoided that easily. Adrenaline Addition drivers are easy to use but I'd make sure you know what each setting does so you don't monkey something up. Cost was $1079 and I'd say it was worth it. Hopefully for you the price goes down soon.",

                "reviewText": "When I say I was VERY excited to test out my first ever Radeon card, I could barely contain myself opening up the box to put it into my system. For context, my current motherboard is an MSI Meg X570 Unify running a Ryzen 5800X3D and 32GB of 4000MHZ memory. I wasn't happy with my previous 4070ti's performance (which also had HORRENDOUS COIL WHINE) so I figured why not pay a little bit more for double the VRAM (yes, I know VRAM isn't everything), and try out AMD's flagship card to see if it really is a 4080 contender.Short story: I'm returning this hunk of junk and my Gigabyte 4080 arrives in just a few days (which I am now VERY excited for because the 4070ti was already a solid card, and this one should be just perfect for my system's needs.Long story: I'm actually kind of a fan of these huge graphics cards, even if they are a bit ridiculous. This is definitely the biggest card I've ever seen, and this TUF card weighs in around 7.5 POUNDS on its own. Sheesh. It BARELY fit into my NZXT H5 Flow case, but I will admit that the fitment is very satisfying even if its size isn't necessarily ideal. The massive size of the card definitely warrants lots of cooling, so the cooling performance can be credited.I've heard about Tuf Gaming cards before, in terms of build quality, it's excellent, looks attractive, and again, feels premium. Unfortunately, my worst fears were realized when I booted my system and attempted to use the card. Not only are AMD's current graphic drivers unstable, but the card genuinely performs worse in every way than the 4070ti that is supposed to be SEVERAL tiers below this card. Ironically, lowering quality presets in certain games also seemed to worsen my performance even more. Gaming at 1440p, I noticed horrible stuttering, texture artifacts, and arguably the worst coil whine on a graphics card I have ever heard. It's unacceptable. For a flagship card, I am incredibly disappointed with AMD. I had high expectations for this card's performance (I know it's no 4090), but my outgoing 3070 never broke a sweat most of the time, and this card can barely play Halo or Call of Duty at medium settings. 24 GB of VRAM! 24! And the card performs like it only has 8 and I'm using almost all of it. It's pathetic. The coil whine doesn't appear to be fixable, even with undervolting. I have a 1000W PSU from Corsair that is Platinum rated. Nothing about my system is misplaced or problematic. I clean installed the graphics drivers and updated my Windows 10.It's a shame. I was looking forward to this card, but also looking forward to not giving Nvidia more money, but sadly, Nvidia's driver support is just more reliable and the performance of the 40 series card is just better.Don't get me wrong, there may be good 7000 series cards out there, but this TUF card isn't one of them. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.",

                "reviewText": "Using my rig, I use one of these to power a 43\" 4K HDR10 and a second to power 4 24\" panels at 1080. I also run Linux (Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.) on a second drive, and I never had an issue with drivers when running Linux. My use case is uncommon, but these GPUs work well if you do not have the cash to buy the latest and greatest. Some motherboards (like my MSI) link my two GPUs.If you are building on a budget, the Asus dual Radeon RX 6600 is a solid choice, and I speak out of experience from owning them for two years. Opinions are great, but how they hold up in the wild matters more, and they do. I use them on my daily driver, and they have not let me down.",

                "reviewText": "This card is hefty. There may be no way to fully future proof, but I\u2019m banking on this giving me plenty of frame rates at 4K. Coming from a 6950xt that was giving me a 60fps 4K experience, I am now in the120fps 4K range. This basically performs a bit better than Nvidia's previous generation 3090ti. Ray tracing is still just ok. Nothing to snazzy but the screen still looks great so I doubt you\u2019ll notice anything substantially wrong. It\u2019s irritating hearing arguments against using Radeon. Buy Radeon knowing you\u2019ll have minor issues, but once those are taken care of , you\u2019ll be happily surprised at what you\u2019ll receive in performance. Spending the extra $200 or so on an RTX 4080 or an RTX 4080 super just doesn\u2019t feel right and that gap is going to grow even larger in the next coming months. I see the 7900xtx going down to $850 and the 7900xt reaching the current 6950xt price. You can\u2019t go wrong with either rdna2 or 3. For a performance idea. Unigine Superposition @1080p ultra settings. I\u2019m getting a 16,140 score with a 5800x3d and 32gb\u2019s of Teamgroup ARGB c14 3600 ram.",

I used it for 2 days no issues then on 3rd day I downloaded new driver. It kept crashing after the download. Returned it back to Amazon. Refund was issued 4 days later that was fast. I bought Asus Tuf 4080 OC upgrade from 3060XC. It is performing flawlessly no issues at all. I was hoping to switch to AMD but that's not going to happen until they fix driver issues. Don't mind paying extra for convenience. Do yourself a favor and buy invidia if you value your time. Plug and play is the name of invidia GPU.",

No complains so far - easy to install, got a really nice FPS boost, and it's actually pretty quiet. It also comes with a pretty good warranty (2.5 years I think).Had to do some altering to my case, as it is a bit bigger than 1660 Ti it's replaces and has a power supply connection on the side. But that's just because the pre-built case is garbage.We'll see how it goes, but so far I'm happy.",
