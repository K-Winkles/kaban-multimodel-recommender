However, it's the perfect choice for non-gamers with a CPU that doesn't have integrated graphics or those who want to set up a secondary display. This low profile, low power consumption card will improve multimedia performance, extend the desktop, and accelerate apps.For flexibilty of use, it comes with a Low Profile bracket so it can be used in a Small Form Factor chassis or HTPC configuration. This GPU comes with a dual-link DVI port, an HDMI port, and a VGA port \u2014 allowing you to set up three more displays without spending a lot of money. The maximum power draw of 18 watts makes it suitable for systems with a power supply capacity as low as 300 watts. Something to consider: To emphasize it further, this GPU is not meant for gaming, so don't expect it to run video games well. It's best for those who need extra space to manage non-demanding software like word documents and web browsers.",

                "reviewText": "I have an old computer that needed an hdmi, for my big screen TV. I did not want to spent a lot. So when I found this one, the price was right but I was a little skeptical that it would work on a 10 year old computer with Window 7. After I inserted the QTHREE AMD Radeon R5 230 Graphics Card, I booted up my pc and plugged in my monitor and I deleted all existing drivers. Then I downloaded the drivers for this pacific graphics card per instructions that came in the box. But my pc would lock up a short time after each reboot. So I uninstalled the drivers I downloaded and just did a Windows 7 update, which updated the drivers. Now everything works great. I can view both the monitor and TV and the same time, or have an extended view version of both.",
