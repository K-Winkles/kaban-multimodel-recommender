                "reviewText": "Put this in one of our workstations used for CAD. This card is unbelievably efficient and powerful for its size! It doesn't even use dedicated power, the PCIe is enough to power it. No crashes, no overheating. Just a great card. Had some minor issues with the newest Nvidia driver, but downloaded the previous driver and have had zero issues.We have a few other machines with Quadro RTX cards (5000s and 6000s) for our larger assemblies, but even this card can handle some of those larger assemblies for a fraction of the cost. The performance for smaller assemblies and parts (<1000 parts/features) is nearly identical to the Quadro RTX cards. We'll probably continue using these P2200s for future builds as our company expands since they pack a punch at a great price.SIDE NOTE: We have office game nights - Warzone, Fortnite, etc... This card is also extremely capable for those games, usually 100+ FPS on max settings for most modern titles.",

I was expecting a new card in original packaging, but it just came with the card wrapped in some bubble wrap. There was no driver DVD etc that you usually expect to receive.If you are ok with that, then it could be fine. But it was available at a lower price from other vendors. If it was not available elsewhere, I probably would have kept it.",

                "reviewText": "The NVIDIA RTX A5000 is the premier high end sweet spot for content creators and workstation users in general. It provides a large amount of compute and an exceptional gaming performance for those looking for that RTX 3080 experience on a workstation. This is the only GPU you will need to do everything from creation, to work, to gaming on. I highly recommend it to creators and first time aspiring creators alike!Pros:\u30fb8192 CUDA cores over a fast 384 Bit Bus and 16GB/s of GDDR6 Memory.\u30fbPerforms identically in gaming to an RTX 3080 while using 28% less power.\u30fbRenders at an incredibly fast speed through CUDA rendering applications.\u30fbRuns all the latest applications with ease and doesn't crash thanks to ECC.\u30fbIt has 24GB of GDDR6 or 22.5GB ECC (Error Correcting Code) Memory.\u30fbStays fairly cool, quiet, and doesn't expel heat into the shroud or case.\u30fbLong lasting driver support dating back to Quadro K6000.Cons:\u30fbIt doesn't have a USB-C port like the older Quadro RTX series.",
