The GPU will overclock without getting too hot (I am running a air-cooled case) and the Adrenaline software allows control over every aspect of performance. I use the rig for gaming, streaming video, web and number crunching - the GPU handles it all without a sweat. AMD priced this card right too - you can pay more but why? The GPU delivers 120Hz at 3840x2160 in HDR mode and max settings - it's gorgeous on my OLED 60\" TV. You will not be disappointed with this card!",

As this is for a diorama build, I really wanted the closed backplate, but I didn't have time to reorder, and the original does tend to run a bit cooler, so I just went with it. Still a great card, though you may wanna go with the RX 6650 XT if you can get a better price. The difference in performance is negligible. (~5-6 FPS in most games) and it runs a LOT cooler.",
