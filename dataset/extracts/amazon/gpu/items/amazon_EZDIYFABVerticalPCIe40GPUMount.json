                "reviewText": "This GPU bracket is by far the cheapest one available that comes with a PCIe 4.0 riser cable, and I decided to take the plunge even though it's a new product.Installation was super simple and the sliding feature came in handy because I was able to run my DisplayPort cable through without having to saw off my PCI slots. The bracket seems very sturdy and my GPU is definitely staying in place without any sag.The riser cable is a bit long, so it's a little bit of a tight fit as it's touching part of the motherboard, but thus far there have not been any issues. My PC booted up normally after installation, and benchmarks show that performance is virtually identical to plugging the GPU straight into the motherboard. The GPU sits far enough away from the glass that there have not been any increases in temperature during load either.Overall, I'm super satisfied with this product and will definitely be buying more products from this seller in the future!",

It's a little difficult to install, with better engineering it could be much easier and more simple to install.

As soon as I removed the bracket and installed directly into the motherboard, it worked fine.",

                "reviewText": "The vertical mount is overall great, sturdy and easy to assemble. However the color is not a true black. Seams like a blueish tinted black. Can\u2019t really notice it unless you have tons of rgb within the case. The bracket also has some sharp edges. I masked the areas where my riser cable would rub on with electrical tape to prevent a shortage. The riser cable is also not great quality. I have trust issues with riser cables either frying your components or catching on fire. I used my trusted Lian li 4.0 cable. It didn\u2019t match the holes so I used a m3 screw with a nut and plastic washers to hold it in place. Probably will end up drilling a new hole and tapping on the bracket itself. Note that not all riser cables will fit this specific bracket. The sliding option is cool. Better cooling temps now that the gpu is away from the glass. Overall over priced but worth it if you need a good vertical mount.",

                "reviewText": "The bracket is pretty sturdy and I was able to fit my PNY 4090 in the Lian Li O11 Dynamic (non-evo, non-XL) using this. Previously I had to keep the side panel open due to the power adapter but now everything is neatly packed. The bracket also left enough room for the bottom intake fans and the bracket (without the stand) just rests on top of the fan to prevent sag. The only downside is the temp has gone from 66C to 72C (50% fan on stock fan curve). Please keep in mind that the 66C was with the side panel open so I don't know how much of that is because of the side panel or vertical mounting. 72 is still pretty comfortable for me so a non-issue and the GPU looks great. Overall a great buy in my case as I tried the Phantek one before this and it did not fit and was probably 5 times more flimsy that this.",

                "reviewText": "I got this vertical mount kit not because it was cheaper but because it was much faster to ship than the Thermal take one. I was aware of some reviews stating that the riser cable wasn't sufficient for Gen 4, but I installed it anyway.After installation I used GPU-Z to check and it did indeed say the card was running at PCIE gen 4. I was happy with that and continued to use my PC.After heavier usage I did start to get some blue screen crashes and upon checking the windows 11 event log I discovered hundreds of errors pointing to a PCI-E device (WHEA event 17). In the BIOS for the PC I forced the GPU to run at Gen 3 and the errors disappeared. I decided to buy a higher quality riser cable from Linkup for $60, and after installing it I was able to set my GPU back to gen 4 without any errors appearing.In conclusion: the bracket is fine, it seems to go uphill a bit from the case connection which is kind of annoying but it's fine. The riser cable, while it even says PCIe 4.0 on the connector itself l, doesn't seem to be able to actually handle gen 4 speeds, causing crashes and errors. In total, I had to spend $120 for the kit and a replacement riser cable. In hindsight, I should have just waited for the Thermaltake kit.",

Thankfully my Intel CPU has integrated graphics and the system would post on the video out of the board. The GPU fans would not spin and the the RGB on the GPU would not light up. I suspected the EZDIY vertical GPU mount was the culprit. So I ordered the NZXT vertical GPU mount which was not available for months until recently. After I installed the NZXT vertical GPU mount into my NZXT H5 elite and powered up the system the GPU finally came to life. And yes I did reseat several times and check all the connections before the new mount. Unfortunately I ordered this piece of crap several months ago way past the return window. So I removed the 4 screws holding the rgb strip and put under the NZXT mount and threw this piece of garbage in the trash. Don't waste your $60.00 like I did.",

Es un soporte de calidad, puede soportar mi RTX 4080 gaming x trio sin problema alguno, le qued\u00f3 a la perfeccion a mi corsair 5000D, las instrucciones son claras y es f\u00e1cil de armar, no hay errores de funcionamiento, pero \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 4 estrellas?-1 ya que la calidad de construcci\u00f3n de la extensi\u00f3n es mediocre, se rompi\u00f3 el sujetador para la tarjeta y para el costo no se me hace algo v\u00e1lido, por suerte no arruina el funcionamiento y no tuve necesidad de devolverlo.Algo que nadie en general te dice al momento de comprar un soporte vertical sea la marca que sea es que vas a tener que deformar tu gabinete de los slots para que el cable de video entre, no le doy menos estrellas ya que no es algo que sea culpa del producto, pero solo ojo a eso.Fuera de eso la verdad me gust\u00f3, justo como esperaba que se viera mi pc.",
