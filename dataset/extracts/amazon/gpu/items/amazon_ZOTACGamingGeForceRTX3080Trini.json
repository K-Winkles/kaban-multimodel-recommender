                "reviewText": "I bought this when it was on sale. Coming from a gaming laptop with a 1660 in it, I wanted my first build in 10 years to be a nice one. I did a lot of research on graphics cards and knew which games I played and didn't. For example, I play World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Fortnite, and whatever new single player game that came out peaks my interest. I did what any person would if they had the money. I bought a 3080 and a 6950 XT from AMD, to see which was the better purchase for me. I'm a hands on person and I love to tinker. Now, I think both cards are great. I really do. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. I don't play CoD, or am competitive in any way, so the high fps performance with no ray tracing doesn't appeal to me. I like the lighting and shadows. I enjoy the way ray tracing looks in WoW. Plus I can play the rtx games like Portal RTX, or Minecraft RTX.You plug in a Nvidia card, put in the drivers, and then it just works.You put in an AMD card, update the drivers, watch videos on YouTube to figure out how to turn on SAM and overclock the card the correct way, and then you MAY get the same fps you got in WoW Dragonflight with ray tracing on.So I'm keeping both cards, but will be using the 3080. The 6950 will go into another build.Now to the color. I have a white and black build for the PC and this card looks excellent.",

                "reviewText": "I had this shipped to a PO box and received a perfectly working RTX 3080. No cosmetic damage. The card itself runs on average 77 (deg C) in a negative pressure airflow case (NZXT H10i) and a Ryzen 9 3900X processor, 16Gb RAM, 850W Corsair Gold PSU, and an ASROCK B450 Motherboard. With a smattering of mismatched and outdated components, this card was able to perform at standard (1440x1280p). Ultra graphics at the rasterized level and high at the Ray Tracing level. An average across all graphics level with these specs revealed ~95 FPS. Not bad. I have not tried DLSS and I don't personally have a need for it at this time. This thing is BIG and though the stock sink and fans do keep it an expected temperature, the 30 series in general can benefit from undervolting to reduce TDP draw and thermal performance. I have yet to encounter the common ZOTAC thermal pad issue with my card to date but it is something to be wary of. I think that for the price point, this is a great deal that I would not be scared to jump on. Better incredible gains from the 10 series, okay from 20 series, if you have money for a 4080ti you aren't reading this. I hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I selected the New purchase option, but I received a used card. You can see scuff marks and little burn marks near one of the openings of the shroud in the photos I am including.However, the card works fine so far. Also, it was purchased for a reduced price, so it works out to how much it would have been to buy refurbished from elsewhere, so I'm ok with it. Monitoring software also sees the card as legit, so will run benchmarks and update review if anything changes.EDIT: adding updates.Fans would randomly jump to 100% under no load, just web browsing. Setting fan curves in Firestorm and After Burner would prevent that, but it wouldn't adhere to the actual curve that was set. Card runs insanely hot, previous 6700xt I had was usually under 60C under load, this card reaches about 73C if I don't have an aggressive fan curve set. Weird issue with applications flickering whenever I opened or closed them, or if I changed a tab in Chrome. Had to scour videos and forums to find a solution that worked for me (seems a different solution worked for different people that had this issue).",

Poor seller responses when returned. Only got half my money. Beware.",
