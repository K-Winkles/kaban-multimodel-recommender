                "reviewText": "I bought this GPU to replace my RTX 3060 12Gb with a single fan. It is part of an HP Omen 25L prebuilt gaming PC which is already overpriced in retrospect. I went with the 4060 ti for convenience of not having to replace the power supply while getting a bump in performance and access to DLSS 3. First immediate difference was a reduction in fan noise due to better cooling than my previous GPU. Tested with Plague Tale Requiem settings on High DLSS on with a 1440 p LG monitor with FreeSync. I was running at 159 fps 1% lows but sometimes a noticeable stutter would occur. I looked some comparisons on YouTube and chalked it up to the lower VRAM of 8 Gb causing an occasional longer frame time due to lower memory bandwidth. I'm overall happy with the purchase but definitely think these prices are a bit outlandish for some, for me I like to spend my coin on electronics for home entertainment so not too stressed. Also this card runs on 128 bit and not 256 like my previous 3060. The upgrade to DLSS 3 was something I was focused on but if you have a 2070 or 3060 this is going to be marginally better depending on what type of games you play so take that in to consideration if you are thinking about an upgrade. Also take into consideration the length of this card, I had to do some modifications to my HP case in order to make it fit being that it was a prebuilt PC made to handle a smaller model GPU. I'm not a full time PC guy so sorry if I'm missing some key info that I didn't take note of but I'm assuming people buying this budget GPU aren't running any high end equipment and are just as casual as me.",

My complaint is with the delivery, and that's not on the driver either. GeForce products are highly recognizable, so you'd think that if it were being delivered or might come in a plain brown box, or even wrapped in paper or something to obscure the highly desirable product contained within, but, no. This was delivered with a shipping label slapped on the manufacturers shrink wrap and left on my welcome mat. Right out in the open. It wasn't stolen or anything, but jeez guys, just seems unnecessarily risky to drop off something like this just out in the open like that.",
