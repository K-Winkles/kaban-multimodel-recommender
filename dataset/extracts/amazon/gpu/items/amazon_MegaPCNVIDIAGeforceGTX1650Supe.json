Update: This review was for the RX 6700XT, I really hate how these clowns are just updating the listing and Amazon is okay with it.Pro: Price was $45 lower than the next card at the time. The card works. I thought if Dell has so many extra replacement cards that they are getting rid of them that it should be reliable. Was actually able to play with minimal ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077.Cons: Google has never heard of the manufacturer... so no warranty. Arrived in plain box in a open regular plastic bag, did have good foam pieces around bag. Listed as new, guess you have to take their word on that.",
