I absolutely love the design and the price-point. And the GPU is able to keep relatively good temperatures while gaming extended periods of times.Overall, I\u2019m extremely satisfied with the gaming performance. So here\u2019s a general idea of the games that I play.I\u2019m currently playing Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, League of legends and at times I play the witch 3.All these games have been locked at 60fps + at 1080p with no issue what so ever. I don\u2019t have the exact numbers as I don\u2019t really care for the frames that are lost beyond 60. ( maybe I\u2019ll care once I purchase a higher refresh rate monitor )PROSMultiple fansKeeps temperatures under controlExcellent priceCONSBit noisyGPU is a big large and requires extra clearance ( plan accordingly )I wish the outer case was white ( personal preference )",

Everything to do with tech support is online and it\u2019s hard to get someone on the phone unless someone else knows something I do not. Overall I have a dual sli setup with two of these and I play any game really. Metro, need for speed, resident evil, and a whole bunch of high capacity games. These games I run 3840x2460p at 60fps and they do really well. I\u2019m not sure what the cost for these cards are but I think they are worth the money whatever it is. The cooling is superb and with the msi control system you can activate the cooling fans which these have 3 of. For good gaming get there. Of course now they have the RTX line which people are lot so happy about. Have fun and buy these or a 1080ti(much better).",

                "reviewText": "Exactly what I expected and then some. Bought this to replace my 2 year old Radeon R9 390 that kicked the bucket. Fine by me I hated that card from day 1.This beast maxes out everything I throw at it @ 2K resolution. Ashes of the SIngularity, Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Witcher 3 all 60+ FPS maxed out 2K. Was easily able to get the core to 2ghz and the memory to 4.8ghz rock solid stable without much effort and the best part is the temps stay well below 70c in games, only getting to 68c max when stressing the card for OC stability. A far cry from the 88-92c my R9 390 gamed at. It's also dead silent too. never hear the fans at all, period.Love MSI products. I went with Asus Strix on the R9 390 and regretted it. Loved my MSI GTX 770 that was also cool and quiet. didn't think twice about going back to MSI. Glad to be back. NOTE: for those who are wondering about the difference between the MSI 1070Ti Gaming X and this Titanium, they are the exact same card, the only difference is the Titanium has 1 more heat pipe and higher quality thermal paste. This equates to about a 3-5c decrease in temps average. With the way GPU Boost 3/4 work, temps play a large factor in how far it will boost. Though it irrelevant if OC'ing (no point not to). Though even max OC'ing the Titanium will be a tad bit cooler (and thus quieter) over the Gaming X.Achieved a 14.1k 3D score in PassMark. A good friend of mines overclocked GTX 1080 FE achieved a 13.7k.",

This card works perfectly and is a big improvement. Total War Warhammer 1 and 2 runs perfectly and on ultra settings the graphics are amazing! I don't do Battlefield or counter strike or any of those but this card is a beast. So glad I bought it!It was easy to install- all I needed was to get a 6 pin to 8 pin adapter and I was good to go.

For one it is newer and a higher model and the main reason I bought this was because of the HEVC (H.265) video playback from my GoPro 7 and note 9. 4 K at 60FPS. Only issue I had setting up was the color calibrations. The settings we're different than my GTX 970. I never saw such a broad range of difference. But this card functions fast. One suggestion I have is to download MSI afterburn and set the fan settings to stay on. It will make the temps way lower. The default card setting will only make the fans go on at 60 celcius. I have the card running at 38 celcius now with the fans at 30%.",

Plus aucun soucis, la carte est assez silencieuse, elle monte \u00e0 80\u00b0 lorsqu'elle est beaucoup sollicit\u00e9e.Je recommande ce produit d'occasion qui est un bon compromis par rapport \u00e0 des cartes plus r\u00e9centes et plus ch\u00e8res.",

So I can't really speak to this cards true potential but I can say that I'm happy with my purchase.The games that aren't CPU bound run fantastically, and the ones that are heavily reliant on the CPU at least look incredible as they hobble along.Also I haven't had any coil whine or anything like that (I remember that was a big concern that I had), all-in-all a decent purchase.",

I was a tad skeptical at first since at that price, it's much cheaper than similarly performing cards like the GTX1660 Ti and RTX 2060 which are priced at 25k to 32k but upon acquisition of the GPU, I realized that it's brand new and every bit as good as it gets. So, this might be the best purchase I've ever made.The GTX 1070 Ti requires a 6 pin PCI-e and another 8(/6+2) PCI-e pin. I use a Cooler Master Thunder 600W(which rates at 564W) and the card runs very well on the aforementioned PSU.",
