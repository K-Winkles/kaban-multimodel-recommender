Ultra High Performance Conductive Polymer Aluminum Capacitor The Ultra High Performance Conductive Polymer Aluminum Capacitor has a small PCB foot print but high volumetric capacitance that makes 20-phase power possible on the RX 7900 series graphics card. The capacitor offers stable capacitance at a high frequency and temperature with very low signal noise, ensuring the stability and reliability of the product. Optimized Composite Heatpipe The composite heatpipes are fine-tuned for each individual cooling design with optimal heat flow, efficiently and evenly spreading out the heat to the entire cooling module.",

Having the Starfield Game included made this a really sweet deal. PS, I used to be a Nivida supporter, but AMD has now won me over.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this for awhile now and have used it on heavy workloads and lots of gaming, and it has been great. I moved up from a 1660ti to this (7900xt).- Solid Construction- Fantastic heat dissipation- I can't hear it, but my cpu fan is huge and loud.- Drivers have been working fine, one hiccup so far but it was solved within minutes of updating the software- I love all the options in the AMD software, it's a league above Nvidia's.- This thing produces a lot of heat. It goes around 320 watts for me at 100% utilization. However, the card stays at about 72c which is amazing.Will run 4k at 60+fps. I have been using it mostly for 1440p ultrawide though and have had no issue getting 144+fps on max settings on 99% of games. (monitor set to 144hz, could go much higher on most games). Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing on gives me about 70-90fps but it's also very smooth. Without ray tracing I'm more around 140fps, and I'm sure giving me much more in certain environments.Using cyberpunk as a benchmark in this review since the graphics are crazy, but I have had a great experience with all games and emulators.This card will handle anything you throw at it. I'm very pleased with the solid build, the software, and the low temps. My 1660ti got up to 80c in the same case for reference, though it wasn't a triple fan design like this.",

                "reviewText": "Comes with a support bracket since it's a big card, which was a little difficult for me to install, and had to adjust the bracket support rubber thing a little to ensure it made contact with the card by loosening it a little, and pressing up for a little vertical adjustment before retightening. Feels sturdy and well built. Has some coil whine, but that's to be expected when on the menu screen for games and it's at over 300-600 fps. The coil whine is unnoticeable when playing games and in particular when not in a menu screen. Coil whine as I understand it can be mitigated by keeping refresh rates below 300-400 fps, and that possibly swapping out the power supply so the card and PSU don't have harmonizing frequencies. For reference, I'm using an EVGA 850W G6 power supply. The card recommends a 700W power supply.Runs Doom Eternal with max settings and raytracing enabled at 1440x3440 at 160 fps. The Riftbreaker, same resolution, raytracing enabled and settings also at 140-160 fps in the graphics benchmark.Temperatures seem to max out around 75-78 C. Fans can get a little loud if they need to rev up, but that doesn't happen very often during my games and is quieter than my older XFX Radeon rx 580. IMPORTANT NOTE about fan speed, going into Adrenalin (the AMD Software driver) to manually change the maximum fan speed to only 50% instead of it going to 70% then 100% when going above certain temperatures, the fan noise was significantly decreased, while the Hot Spot temperature was interestingly no different than when the fan speed was at 70-100% despite the GPU utilization/load being at 100%.Playing Doom Eternal with these changes, I didn't notice it at all. I tested Quantum Break, and was getting about 65 or so fps, however from what I've read online, that game is an unoptimized mess, so given that being the case, and that my older rx 580 was only getting 14 fps, I'd consider that a win.SUMMARY (TL/DR section)Overall, a well built, quiet and fast card. If you can't get the XTX card, you might not notice any performance difference with just the XT. I do recommend changing your maximum fan speed to 50% in the Adrenalin software for quality of life and without it really impacting temperatures.",

                "reviewText": "I got this on sale for $720 plus a deluxe copy of Starfield for free ($100 value) so couldn't go wrong or complain there. This card is a beast and quite capable In every regard. This card will run every game out right on max settings.However as others have also mentioned the screws on my backplate are not flush, see pics, if this is by design its worrying. If this is on accident its even more worrying. So far the card has handled most games fine. Only a few crashes after a couple hours continuous gaming. Haven't determined cause yet.I have noticed a few issues. First off if you run high resolutions basically 2k+ above 100hz the power draw jumps from idle 8w to 10w up to around 85w. The same thing goes for if you run two monitors, and if theyre both high resolution high hz it brings idle power on the board up to 100w+. This isnt dangerous but its not good.Another issue ive noticed but I'm still waiting for new drivers to see if it fixes it is a weird horizontal screen glitch. It happens rarely and usually only if I have 2 or more windows up or Radeon performance overlay up. If it isnt fixed with drivers or it gets worse I may need to return itThe 7900 series is still very new and AMD is usually a bit slow on getting drivers out for new series but they always do in the end. They are aware of the idle power issue. Just hoping to hear something about the odd visual glitch / artifact im experiencing with multiple windows / overlays.If you get this on sale under $750 is a pretty solid buy for the performance to dollar ratio.",
