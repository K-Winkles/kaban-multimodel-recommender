SAPPHIRE or our channel partners will send out a replacement fan directly to you! That means they\u2019re easy to remove, clean and replace, with just one screw holding them securely in place. Dual ARGB Light Bar With tasteful shroud design augmented by ARGB LEDs, you can change the colors of the LED, for a customized design. This can be controlled via TriXX software. Choose from different modes including Fan Speed Mode, PCB Temperature Mode or the colourful rainbow mode or turn off the LEDs. External ARGB Control Sync Enable the external synchronization of RGB LEDs between the graphics card and the motherboard using the 3-pin header in the tail. Gamers can then choose if the graphics card performs the RGB LED effects independently or if the motherboard acquires control.",

This card is a beast, delivering stunning graphics and smooth gameplay on the latest titles at 4K resolution and high settings. The card is also very quiet and cool, thanks to the Vapor-X cooling system and the dual BIOS switch that lets you choose between performance and silent modes. The card also has a sleek design and RGB lighting that can be customized with the TriXX software. The card is easy to install and comes with a generous 3-year warranty. I highly recommend this card to anyone looking for a premium gaming experience.",

Created a new build around this card with an i7-13700 processor in the MSI MPG 110r case (card fits perfectly, but may have issues if you want to put your AIO radiator in the front of the case, mine is on the top).Hardware: 10/10Card worked flawlessly from the beginning and rarely touches 70C without going past it. Fans are efficient and quiet, no real coil whine (using 1000W MSI a1000 PSU). Love the grey aesthetic and the customizable RGB lightbar that doesn't look ostentatious.Software: 9/10Sapphire Trixx boost is worth downloading and easy to use. Can quickly change Bios and GPU light color. Trixx boost also pairs well with Radeon Super Resolution (RSR). I personally like the Adrenaline software as well coming from Nvidia. It's easy to navigate, nice GUI, a lot of useful features like RSR (rivals Nvidias DLSS but can be applied to any game) and Virtual super resolution (can set individual monitors to have supersampling options.)Drivers: 8/10Have had no significant issues with drivers thus far, but Nvidia updates their drivers more frequently.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a EVGA 3080 FTW3 10G so I could get better performance on a QHD Ultrawide Monitor and I am blown away by this card. It\u2019s cheaper than the 4080 that I was looking at and is pretty close if not better in most benchmarks.My last AMD card was a Sapphire HD 7850 back in 2013\u2026 It\u2019s good to see AMD giving it to NVIDIA again as they were getting a little greedy and reckless and I never use ray tracing regardless as I prefer native rendering at high frame rates.I have had 0 issues since switching back to AMD and my games are running better than ever. I have had no stability issues at all!! I don\u2019t foresee a need to upgrade for many years given current performance levels. Temperatures are well controlled by the custom cooling system.Installation was also fairly easy. Make sure you have enough space in your case as it is a massive card, I had barely enough space towards the front of my case. The included anti sag bracket is a pain in the butt to install, definitely use a magnetized screwdriver and the screws they provide, fishing a screw out that falls into the GPU case is a pain. Once installed it definitely reduces the sag to acceptable levels (1/16\u201d lower on far side). The support bracket is well hidden especially if the Pc is below the desk. You may want to look at 3rd party options if you don\u2019t want to fiddle with it or completely eliminate the sag.With that said Sapphire, as they did back in the day, continue to make the highest quality of cards for AMD. I am glad they are still around and this card is stunning overall in my build!PC Case: Fractal Torrent Compact RGB (Stock Fans)CPU: AMD R7 5800X3DCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15 chromax blackGPU: Sapphire 7900XTX (this product)RAM: GSkill RGB",

                "reviewText": "I own two of these cards and they have both performed flawlessly. They are far quieter than I expected and they look better than any card I've seen. I've been a fan of Sapphire products for years, and this card only cements my loyalty to this reliable brand. The videos and pictures in most of the reviews do not truly do the aesthetics justice. This card is just amazing!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros:-Great GPU for 4k 144hz monitors-Aesthetically well-designed card-Vapor chamber cooling-Doesn't use the 12vHP new cable connector that's controversial with cable & GPUs melting-Extremely quiet GPU-Comes with a support bracket-Adrenaline driver software is well thought out and well designed-Good Price to Performance in accordance to Nvidia's offerings (RTX 4080)Cons:-Is a wattage eater (not energy efficient on default settings)-Lacks ray tracing performance compared to Nvidia-AMD driver install can be buggy (used DDU and clean Driver install to get AMD drivers working properly).This is my first AMD GPU and I would like to state that it wasn't a very good experience on the install. I already removed my Nvidia drivers prior to this new AMD driver install. I had multiple errors on my driver installs so I had to do a complete Display Driver Uninstall and re-download & install AMD adrenaline software. Apparently, this is a normal occurrence with many AMD users so I caution to buyers that are Nvidia users. Just prepare for some hiccups on the install. Also, I play older games and it will just log you out of the game due to a bug crash. Quite annoying, tbh - Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires 3.I am not a brand loyalty specific person - I just decided this GPU is a better deal than a RTX 4080. I am a regular PC consumer that usual just buys what has worked for me in the past. The RTX 4090 is too expensive for my budget.Overall, I am pleased with the Sapphire 7900 xtx. I highly recommend it for those looking for a top tier GPU experience without breaking the bank.",
