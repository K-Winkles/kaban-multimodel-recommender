The graphics card is expensive and large in size, and most chassis do not provide additional graphics card support.This GPU bracket can provide effective support for the graphics card's tail, allowing the expensive graphics card to be horizontal and its failure rate to be reduced.A properly installed graphics card bracket can help to improve the airflow inside the computer case by ensuring that there is enough clearance between the graphics card and other components. This can help to reduce the temperature of the graphics card and other components, leading to better overall system performance.A graphics card bracket can help to protect other components in the computer case from damage caused by the weight and movement of the graphics card. This can help to extend the lifespan of the computer system and reduce the risk of costly repairs.",

                "reviewText": "This GPU brace, which like most GPU braces prevents sag from large and heavy graphics cards, does exactly what it is supposed to do, but at a price that is significantly lower than most competing products. I paid less than 7 dollars for this, whereas most competitors seem to be in the 10-15 dollar range.The magnetic foot is a nice touch and helps \"anchor\" the brace to the PSU basement shroud, as is the rubberized top that gives a soft touch where the brace meets the GPU fan shroud.The only downside is that I would have liked the base of the brace to be a little bit wider, with a slightly stronger magnet, but I am being quite nitpicky here.Overall I definitely recommend this product if you have a large GPU that like mine is sagging under its own size and weight.",

                "reviewText": "This product is made very well and will work perfectly in most setups. That is if you take the time to measure the minimum and maximum clearance that it will allow for where you need to place it. I unfortunately did not and underestimated the thickness of my RTX 4080. Luckily, it had an extra spot that allowed me to place it at its maximum height and still offer enough support for the card. I will add another piece of rubber padding to increase the height at some point, but for now it will do just fine.Great product, just take the time to measure to make sure it will work for your specific application.",

                "reviewText": "The product quality is really good, I liked the look of it and everything but it was too long to fit in my Corsair 7000d. I have an MSI gaming x trio and unfortunately the gap between the psu bay and the gpu can't fit this brace. I did decide to keep it but unfortunately I can't use it. That's probably my fault for not looking at the length first.Either way, it is still a good product and I would recommend it for anyone who has a 40 series card.",
