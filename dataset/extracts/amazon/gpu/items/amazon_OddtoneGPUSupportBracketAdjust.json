                "reviewText": "I was so sick of my GPU arm, it barely helped cause it's mounted into the same place as the GPU and has no support in the exact same spot the GPU needs support, wasn't helpful at all...The GPU is already supported in the back with the IO shield, it's already supported near the back center area, it needs support in the front.Enter the Oddtone GPU support bracket! A very low priced, yet high quality support jack. Just put it under the spot you want it to support, change the height depending on your GPU to level it, and you're done! No extra screws or needing to mess around with your PC tower to get it in there, quick and simple!The magnet on the base is really strong, but only in a very close proximity, which is great as you won't need to worry where you're placing it. Mine is actually placed on the top of the shroud directly above my Hard Drive, but the magnet only sticks if it is extremely close (basically almost touching) so it's not effected at all!Not much else I can say, it's a simple design that's far more effective than any GPU arm I've ever purchased!",
