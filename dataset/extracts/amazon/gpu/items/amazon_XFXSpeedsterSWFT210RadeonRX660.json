                "reviewText": "If you're the kind of gamer who scoffs at frame rates below 120fps and measures performance in decibels of silence, then strap in, because the XFX Speedster MERC310 RX 7900XTX is about to blow your socks off. This beast isn't just fast, it's stupid fast. We're talking butter-smooth gameplay at 4K even in the most demanding AAA titles, and I'm not talking low settings here \u2013 crank everything up to max and prepare to be amazed.Now, I'm not one for fancy ray-tracing bells and whistles, but even I was impressed by the 3DMark scores. This card lands in the top 13% for ray tracing performance, which is pretty darn good considering I could care less about it. But hey, if you're into that shiny stuff, know that the MERC310 has you covered.But speed isn't everything, and AMD knows this. The software experience here is top-notch. The Adrenalin control panel is intuitive and powerful, letting you fine-tune every aspect of the card to your heart's content. I'm talking overclocking, fan curves, custom profiles \u2013 the whole shebang. Plus, it's surprisingly stable, which is always a win in my book.Just be warned, though, this card is a monster. It's so big, I had to say goodbye to my 3.5\" drive bays in my Phanteks Enthoo Pro case. Make sure you measure your case twice before taking the plunge, because this thing is no wallflower. Luckily, XFX includes a Z-bracket for extra support, but I opted for my own 3D-printed support for this monstrosity, for peace of mind (and because, well, why not?).But hey, all that size comes with a surprising benefit: silence. This card runs cool and quiet, even under heavy load. It's a far cry from the jet engine some high-end GPUs can turn into.Speaking of performance, let's talk about AI. This card is an absolute beast in NOD.AI SHARK, churning through complex AI tasks with ease. Whether you're training a deep learning model or just messing around with generative art, the MERC310 will have you covered.And to top it all off, my first game on this bad boy? OG DOOM (In GZDOOM engine). Because sometimes, classic is all you need. And let me tell you, ripping through demons at 200fps was pure, unadulterated joy.The Verdict:The XFX Speedster MERC310 RX 7900XTX isn't just a graphics card, it's a statement. It's for the gamers who demand the absolute best, who scoff at lag and live for smooth, stutter-free bliss. It's big, it's powerful, and it's surprisingly user-friendly. If you're looking for the ultimate 4K gaming experience, look no further. Just make sure your case can handle the beast.Pros: Blazing fast performance Top-notch software experience Surprisingly quiet Excellent AI performance Plays OG DOOM like a dreamCons: Massive size Pricey Ray tracing performance might not matter to everyoneOverall:This card is a monster in the best way possible. It's a bit on the pricey side, but for the raw power and user-friendliness it offers, it's hard to argue. Just make sure your wallet and your case are ready for the ride.",

                "reviewText": "Well it finally arrived after some wandering around in the mail. Just upgrading from an XFX RX 6800XT (that is an excellent card). Had some problems at first with the card. It would crash on the loading screen of The Division 2 over and over. Tried tracing what the problem might be, took a couple of days of research on Google to find some answers and fixes. None of them worked, including changing the associations in Windows. The thing was it would only crash on that one game, which is my main game. Everything else worked except that I could not overclock the card without a crash. Set to default and it would run Cinebench, 3DMark, DaVinci Resolve but not The Division 2. Checked my game folder and ran a scan to repair files but there was nothing wrong. After 2 days/nights (full days with lots of hours) I was ready to contact. customer service and see about a return. I had the latest drives already installed from AMD 23.12.1 for my RX6800XT. I decided to try one more thing, I went into Adrenalin and reset the card to factory setting. It came back online with the latest driver installed and that was it. Everything worked and I could overclock too. I have been through a lot of GPU\u2019s over the years and this is a first for me and every swap from AMD to AMD never had this problem. Once in awhile swapping between AMD and NVIDIA cards there might be a slight hiccup but easily fixed. Back to the RX6950 XT, basically the same size as the RX6800XT but it feels heavier. The card is quiet even when overclocked, undervolted, temps stay low in most extensive programs( I am running it in a Lian Li O11 Air Mini so there is lots of ventilation with 7 fans, not counting the two on the AIO). My AIO CPU cooler fans makes more noise than the card. It\u2019s a powerhouse. I have no complaints with this card now that it is performing so well. These cards are starting to get scarce, I see the price has jumped up to the same price as the RX7900XT and some places are selling it for even higher than the RX7900XT. I\u2019m just glad I got this at a discounted price. After some mis",

                "reviewText": "Im not disappointed switching from Nvidia to Amd, This card destroys any expectations I had about it. As I had an 3070 ti, Not only the Rx 7900 xtx is a hell of a powerhouse, but it also beats the 4080 in many games, I see that as an absolute win. Ray tracing performance is surprisingly very good, didn't had any issues with that, but i wouldn't rely on that for buying cards, but mainly a good msrp for buying one, wich this card really comes in a good price to performance. Runs very cool, hotspot doesn't go above 80\u00b0c and the die itself stays at 60\u00b0c in any extreme conditions and it's overclocking features really helps. With the bios switch and Adrenaline software overclock, i went from 450~ fps on Furrmark to 510~ fps, nearly a 60+ fps boost in rasterisation! The Adrenaline software and all it's features is really a plus, and the card still has some potential to gain with future driver updates, including the unused AI cores it has. The card is also GIANT, that's the biggest card I never holded and bought. See size comparaison image next to my 3070 ti.The gpu can get very loud when overclocked despite the temps being normal if you don't cap your fps, but if you prefer having better performance over noise just like me, that's a plus. It comes with a metal support for it's heavy weight aswell.",

This review just focuses on this card usage with Vegas.For whatever reason it my 5700xt driver or card, just refuses to play nicely with the Vegas pro. I would often get crashes whenever the GPu is utilized. In addition the GPU itself is under utilized with Vegas. I'm not sure what the issue is : Driver? Hardware? Vegas software?When the price of this 6800XT card came down and found a warehouse amazon deal, i jumped on it.First thing : THIS IS A GIGANTIC card. It barely fit my case. Had to remove a case fan to make it fit. Make sure you check sizing.I was able to get this card setup without issues. Initially i chose the regular drivers from AMD (adreneline?). Worked just fine but i tried Vegas with it. Vegas seems to really love this card. Much more GPU utilization, and on top of that, things rendered significantly faster than my 5700xt. (i looked online for tweaks for vegas + amd cards). I did have some hiccups (crashes) however. I then proceeded to use AMD's \"pro\"edition series of drivers which is basically slightly older drivers, slower cadence of patching, much more stress tested with various software. This was the best thing. Vegas works butter smooth with this series of drivers. Things just rock solid, no crashes yet, and even higher GPU utilization.For this reason, if youre specifically looking for a cost effective gpu upgrade for your pc for use with Vegas pro software, this is easy to recommend. If youre a gamer, then i'm not sure this review is applicable to you.",

A trend that XFX is really good at not falling into. Bought for around $20 CAD more than an RX 7600, if you can find it at an equivalent price this is definitely a better buy between the 2.",
