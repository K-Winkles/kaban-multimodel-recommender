I switched to it from a nvidia card so I had to use DDU to uninstall my previous drivers, But however I cannot emphasize enough! add a support bracket to this card right after putting it into your computer or you may end up with a bent pcb. this card is only fully supported by it's pcb after being screwed into a pcie express slot on the case. heavy gaming may increase heat to 59-60 degrees. enough to soften the pcb and cause bending under the weight of the heatsink. it's only supported by the pcb and whatever the pcie slot on your motherboard has to offer. you can see it from the pictures advertised. there's a bare space between the fan shroud where the card mounts.",

I had some hesitation due to the card being refurbished, but it may as well be brand new with the way it performs. This is a great card for a 1080p rig and is as quiet as other reviews on the net say. I mainly bought this for playing games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, the card knocks it out of the park with high frame rates on ultra+ settings but does struggle with RT enabled. I wouldn\u2019t knock off points for that seeing as this was a well known issue with this gen of card so it was to be expected. All in all it does exactly what I need it to and stays dead quiet while doing it.",
