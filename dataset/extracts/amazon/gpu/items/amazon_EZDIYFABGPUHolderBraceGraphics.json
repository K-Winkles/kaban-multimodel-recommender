                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice design, fit Asus TUF 4070 OC",
                "reviewText": "The design is simple but effective. Workmanship of the product is good. All the needed screws are included.It isn't that too difficult to install however since this is after every thing else in the system was already installed in my case it might not be as straight forward. Mounting the main blanket may need two hands as the bracket is long as it trends to tilt away from the hole to put the first screw in place. This was at least this for me. Once you get at least one screw in place in the back slot then the rest is one hand operation and simple.The rest is straight forward. However, you may want to try to test fit first with loosely screwed so that you know where to position the small supporting piece. There are two supporting small brackets with the kit. You need to see which one fits you the most. Next you need to know where on the main bracket you want to put the supporting bracket to screw on to so that the supporting bracket supports the flat surface of the GPU card. For Asus TUF 4070 OC card, I choose the middle two slots of the main support bracket which lines up with flat position between two fans perfectly. Also note that, the small bracket is an \"L\" shape. The lag of the \"L\" needs to face out toward the side of the closet case for line up with flat surface of the GPU card. I first put on with leg of the \"L\" face inward toward motherboard and that is too far into the GPU and it does not line up with the larger flat surface between the two fans.Last, you need to adjust the height position of the \"L\" bracket so that it touches or fully support the GPU card without gap. Once you've found this spot then you can hand tight the two screws to keep the \"L\" bracket in position.This is to it at least for the two slot graphic card with fan cover housing similar to to Asus TUF 4070 card which should be most of the GPU cards currently. Check this first however.An improvement would be allowing \"continuous\" position of the \"L\" bracket on the main bracket to adapt to more variety of GPU card design as opposed to currently the \"L\" bracket can only go in to those 8 vertical slots and nothing in between. Two horizontal slots along the length of the main bracket might address this. This is the concern that I had when I first try to install the kit.Aesthetically, the main bracket has 4 decorating shiny chrome screws. Those look nice against black bracket. It makes the whole contraption more like a construction in a space ship.One thing that is not easy to determine is whether the bracket creates any issue with air flow around the GPU card or not. The main bracket creates a partial channel that runs parallel to the depth of the case. This might impact how GPU's fans pull air around them. Now with the main bracket somewhat blocks the open space from without the kit installed. Hope this doesn't create a heat issue. Otherwise, a verticle might be another option (but more expensive one).",

                "reviewText": "Sturdy and stylish, I feel the clean lines will go with nearly any case and GPU. It's a katana, a lightsaber, an industrial beam, an aircraft component- depending on how you look at it against your build theme. The bracket also looks great with a variety of GPU designs, from straight boxes to contoured shrouds.The LEDs are of surprising quality for the price, and color match with my Corsair QL fan colors flawlessly; as well as being some of the brightest LED in my case. The strip does work with ICue, and in my case, I just have a bunch of stuff on an aftermarket ARGB hub- connected to a Commander Core XT- and it all defaulted as 3-pin LL Fans (not strips) in ICue and it just works.Even the logo is placed well and looks good, which is a dealbreaker for me sometimes.I bought this in anticipation of a heavier Sapphire Nitro+ 7800xt in transit; but in my images, it is doing a good job with my Zotac 3060ti, which isn't much lighter.No complaints here at all. This is a great bracket for the price, and EZDIY-FAB has become one of the names I trust to put out a good product.",

                "reviewText": "this could have been perfect for my GPU, easy to install, light but solid design. compatible RTX 30 series.but if you have a wider & longer GPU like mine with 3 fan close to each other this may not be applicable. Although it has slots and 2 support it gets in the way of the fan, could be due to high PCIe slots. Recommended for less than 11 inches GPU lenght. RGB lights looks great too.",

                "reviewText": "A nice sturdy aluminum (I believe) additional bracket to support your GPU that has addressable RGB lighting, and a nice straight line / 45\u00b0 angle aesthetic. Perfect for those builds where you want to avoid any circular RGB to achieve an all straight line RGB build. A good value, a great fit, and definitely a boost in performance! I got at least 60 more FPS just by adding this RGB bracket! (Sarcasm) but seriously as far as performance goes it doesn't hinder air flow and it does support the GPU so I would say it performs as expected. It mounts into the expansion slot at the rear of the case below the graphics card mount, therefore it can have multiple adjustment points, I think I installed mine one notch too low but that's okay it allowed me to route the wire between the GPU and the bracket to avoid covering the RGB. With multiple mounting point options based on your expansion slots, and two different height support bracket end pieces, this bracket should be adequate for most cases and cards. Based on the build quality of this piece, I give this company props, and will probably return to them for additional accessories.Recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this part for my first game in PC that I built and come to find out it was two big for the micro ATX frame due to the graphics card being on the bottom. So I bought adult another custom PC made for retro games only and now I have used for this graphics card bracket. It's a really cool design. The matches your frame makes it have that high quality load. It's very durable, really easy to install and I recommend having a magnetize screwdriver because if you plan on keeping your little side covers on the back and plus your graphics card you going to go hold all three of them at the same time. While you're attaching this bracket for to stay properly and I do not recommend if you using it in the micro ATX frame with the graphics card on the very bottom. It's mainly made for frames that have a graphics card in the middle because then you have those extra three slots to build a fit. The card this bracket requires three slots of space to mount correctly. It is not made for two. But please be aware this product does not have any moving parts. It does not light up. It's just a standard solid color bracket",

It's sturdy, easy to install, doesn't interfere with other things (I have a USB expansion card and the bracket attaches over top of it easily) and really pretty as a bonus. I've only got a 3060 so it may be a bit extra, but I like it.Unfortunately, the leftmost LED on mine is ordered incorrectly, so when I make the RGB do cool stuff, it's never the right colour. I didn't notice this for several months because until I got a new motherboard with ARGB I didn't have the RGB plugged in. It's not the end of the world, just something to note! I still really enjoy the brace and I feel like it ties the look together really well.(and yes I just realized I installed my CPU cooler upside down don't laugh at me I'm upset and not redoing the thermal paste a third time lmao)",
