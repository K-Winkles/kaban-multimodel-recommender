Amazon said is was one day to late to return this product. I had to wait for all my other parts to come in before I even started building this setup for my customer (who wanted this horrible case). I have never had a fan go out in a week since all my 20 years doing this. The case is a nightmare building in, the glass will hardly line up with the riveted section where the power button is, which is loose and floppy. There is a very small section to cable manage with. And you have to put it together in a exact order unlike most cases. Very disappointed in the build quality and it was even dirty under the plastic glass wrap cling. I tried to talk him out of using it and now I'm out the time of trying to get another fan or replacing all the fans so they will match. #sticktonamebrandproducts",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This case comes with 9 RGB fans, fan & light controller and a remote to change their settings. . If you want a case that glows in the dark, and puts on an array of colors, solid color or just about anything else you'll like this case's fans. They are more quiet than any other case I've had. Built in fan remote works well and provides plenty of LED and fan speed management.The case is easy to setup and the cables are easy to tuck away. The Case is larger then most mid sized case on account the PSU is in the back behind the MB; This does lead to better cable management; more space for the cables and it keep the cable overall shorter; EG. power cables are all centrally located and easily connected to any device over a short distance.It's called GAMEing case; apparently due to its sparse design. having no actual disk-drive, floppy, DVD or similar device slots. It does have a plate behind the MB where the PSU resides to mount up to two 2.5\" SSD's or similar form factor dive.If having a bay for DVD player R/W etc is important this case isn't for you; ore be prepared to use n external USB device.The construction is pretty basic, simple and visually pleasing. In part this is why it is so easy to use. I chose it due to the price, its white and simple.The bag of endless little black screws includes three to four types. They are rather small but once you have enough light and perhaps a magnifying glass you'll be able to sort them and use for mounting the PSU, MB, SSD's etc.I'm using it with the Asus Prime Z790 A WIFI-6 MB. Unfortunately the top panel's USB Type-C cabling isn't compatible with the MB so it is unused (unconnected). Though it seems the connector is pinned to use a USB type-II MB connector (YUCK); I guess that's why the case docs call it a USB. I'm unsure this USB-C is useful or what I'd use it for. I'd be concerned that any device I'd plug it in would overwhelm the port since it's rally just plain old USB. I'll update if I figure something out. The motherboard has a Thunderbolt header but it too is unused at this point.Monday my GPU arrives unless the weather holds it up. Even without a GPU this thing rock's. I'm currently running Linux Mint while I burn it in.",

But there is a glass (top part) holding the circulation of the air. So the exhaust is stuck and goes back to the case.I find out after heard my aio fan ruttling and make noise, I check the glass was warm, the top glass kinda hot (warm).
