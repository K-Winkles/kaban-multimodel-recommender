I recommend using authoritative software of GPU-Z. A: Why does the memory speed display 1500 MHz in GPU-Z software, but it's described as 6000 MHz on Amazon? B: Because of GDDR5 data rate type, the amount of memory speed must be in multiply by 4, which is 6000 MHz.(If it's DDR3, memory speed is multiplied by 2) A: Why is GPU speed of the card not as it is said 1183 MHz? B: About GPU speed, it correlates with your CPU, motherboard, computer's accessories and power, also a game of scenes. GPU speed can reach up to 1183 MHz. A: Why does the card would not support multiple monitors? B: You need to set multiple monitors with the computer's system and update the drive from AMD website. A: Why does the card not compatible with PC, such as the display has lines, fan works but no display on monitor? Is the card dead? B: Graphics card you ordered from us is brand new. The caused problems may be the older CPU, power issue, wrong PCI Express slot and GPU installation, etc. Please check and update the newest drivers firstly. However, where problems still exist, try to install to another computer or change motherboard if possible. (If you have any concerns, we'll try to help you solve the difficulty.)",

But the value for the price is great, and if you just want to moderately upgrade your system, it works great.I currently have a pretty barebones PC which didn\u2019t have a graphics card and also didn\u2019t have a ton of space to accommodate larger graphics cards. This one fit perfectly in the tight space and was able to get the PC to play even new open world games with decent performance.Again, you\u2019re not going to get top-of-the-line performance, but you\u2019re also paying 1/10 of top of the line prices.",

                "reviewText": "So\u2026 you PC game and you want to share it with your kids? Dell and other manufacturers make 9th generation intel processors that are good for low end systems, and you can pick them up for $300, and this budget GPU is the perfect match for them.Pros: PCIE power only. Single slot with no overhang. Almost whisper quiet.Cons: plays decently at 1080p output but at low settings and antialiasing off or very limited. Often you have to choose between vsync and AA at this resolution.Need to build a budget gaming setup for a child? This will fit the bill and also pay for itself if you consider steam sales for games. It\u2019s about $550 up front for this setup mentioned but it\u2019s cheap enough to invest in. My son has around 57 stream games and they cost me around $250 over time. That\u2019s about $4.25 per game. Factoring the cost of the system setup, it\u2019s about $7.50 per game. Great value for the patient consumer.",

Temps are in range for the card despite it's size. Also my PC only has a 180w power supply and this works just fine in it. Very pleased.",

Watching videos on my 4K TV and they look really really good, even low res AVIs.However, this card has some serious quirks. I have a Windows theme going, and whenever the pictures on the monitors change, they all blink rapidly over the course of two or three seconds. There have been times when the screen has just gone black for about the same length of time. At first, it was annoying but livable. Lately, however, they are happening more and more. In my experience, that means the card is getting ready to fail. We'll see.There are absolutely no instructions anywhere for this card, not even a recommended location to download drivers. That's not a problem if you're experienced with PCs, but if you aren't, that could be a stumbling block.I am also irritated that they didn't include any SFF brackets. This is not a cheap card (granted, it's not an expensive card either). Selling them as an add-on seems unnecessary. (I happened to have an old card with brackets that fit.)I will probably continue to look for another card, though I'm hoping prices will become more reasonable.EDIT: Well, the card continued to decline until it locked up the PC. Swapped out and put in my old card, which at least works. I'll leave the rating at 3 stars and assume I just got a lemon, but I'm not impressed with the quality control.",

The ability to take off or reroute the VGA port is important in the SFF case.After install the card worked immediately in windows 10 as a generic video port.The most difficult and time consuming part of this process was the subsequent downloading and installing of the Radeon driver and software from the AMD website. That would be the case with any card or manufacturer, though.My goal has been refurbishing business dells marked for recycling into a light gaming pcs for kids capable of running fortnite and rocket league decently on a single 1080p monitor. The games were literally unplayable before install and now they are as good or better than the PS4.Durability remains to be seen, but so far this is the best deal for a capable (even if somewhat old technology) 4gb ddr5 card.
