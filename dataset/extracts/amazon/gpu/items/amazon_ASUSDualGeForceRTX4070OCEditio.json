                "reviewText": "Great all around card, absolutely no issues on medium settings 3440x1440 Fortnite. I got this card for around the same money as a 3070 in mid-2022. In fact, this 4070 is a lot cheaper then. Speaking of the 3070, I upgraded my GPU from the 3070. Noticeable improvements and greater stability than my 3070. It does get slightly loud when playing graphic intensive games, but it isn't deafening! The style will look great in any build and will perform extremely well for 1440p and/or 1080p. Temps aren't bad either, when playing GTA V or Fortnite, it gets warm at around 51C-53C consistently it rarely gets higher than 55C.In conclusion, this is a good value despite others saying it isn't. It truly depends on what your coming from. From a 10-series or 20-series it is definitely a great card to future-proof your PC for years. And it shouldn't break your bank!",

                "reviewText": "I debated for a long time on upgrading my GTX 1080. Whether to get a 3070 or 4070 and ultimately landed on the 4070 due to it being more recent and having higher memory, 12GB. It is 100% worth the price and is amazing at gaming. Currently use it for 1080p gaming and the temperature never exceeds 55c. Am able to play God of War at a stable 120 FPS and the card is barely hot at all, low 50s. Hooked my computer up to my familys 4K TV and was able to play Cyberpunk 2077, God of War, and Spiderman Remasterd at a solid 60 FPS the whole time. The card also never went over 60c when playing at 4K and God of War looked beautiful. The new card is allowing me to go back and play all the games I love, to enjoy them even more, seeing more fine details in the graphics that my previous GTX 1080 was stuggling at.The card tempartures are incredible, better then my GTX 1080. The sound from the fans are normal, slightly better than the other GTX 1080 I gave to my brother, belive it was an ASUS as well.If you are like me and debate for a long time on what card to pick, brand, and series, this ASUS 4070 OC is amazing, and I am the type of guy who never upgraded past the GTX 1080. This brand of 4070 is amazing. Dont overthink it, just do it! Won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "Couldn't be happier with this thing. Full disclosure: I spent the last 3 years with a Gigabyte 2080 Super in my machine that I'm pretty certain was a complete lemon from the start. It had a very loud coil whine while under load and performed under average for a 2080 Super on 3DMark benchmarks. None of that was grounds for a RMA according to Gigabyte (and I'll never buy from them again). It eventually started black screening 2 months after the warranty expired. Anyways - this ASUS GeForce RTX 4070 OC is its replacement, and I couldn't be happier. It more than doubled my performance on 3DMark stress tests (again - take with a grain of salt. My 2080 Super was trash) and runs dead quiet and maxes out around 60C even when under load rendering as many frames as it can. Absolutely thrilled with the performance gain and the price/value ratio of this card. GCs are overpriced in general and that's no secret, but given the current situation, I think this card is insanely good for its $599 MSRP.",

                "reviewText": "I bought an HP Victus 15L after Christmas.It had a GTX 1660 Super graphics card, and only a 500-Watt power supply.I wanted to upgrade my GPU, so I looked at an RTX-3070, which uses all the power that my power supply has and produces a lot of heat. Remember that I am in a very small case with little ventilation. It is also several years old and costs almost as much as the RTX-4070. I can now run games at Ultra settings at very high frame rates.Game RTX-1660 SUPER RTX-4070Shadow of the tomb raider average 108 fps high settings average 157 fps Ultra settingsHorizon Zero Dawn average 74 fps Ultra settings average 146 fps Ultra settingsRed Dead Redemption 2 average 75 fps high settings average 85 fps Ultra settingsRise of the tomb raider Overall 52 fps Ultra Overall 192 fps UltraThese are real recorded numbers from running the built-in benchmarks at 1080p.I can also game all day and not overheat or have any problems with heat or noise.I am extremely pleased that I ordered the ASUS Dual RTX-4070, because it fit within the HP Victus case, that the power requirements are much less that any of the older cards that I could have used, and it performs a lot better than the last generation of GPU's. Also, with the continuous updates, the performance just keeps getting better. The ASUS Dual RTX-0470 has allowed me to play games that I thought a \"low end\" pc that was \"not upgradable\" as some reviewers have said, would be slow at low settings. With the GPU upgrade, I can run any title at ULTRA settings, and not have any problems.The ASUS RTX-4070 has been the best upgrade that I have done to my pc.",

                "reviewText": "The 4070 is a very capable card and I haven't been disappointed by its power at all. It's excellent at 1440p and it can even drive 4k on slightly below max settings in many games (whether using a 4k display or downscaling from 4k with DLDSR), though I should note that its disappointing 12 GB of VRAM may start to be a real issue at 4k. But the real issue is that $600 is a lot of money to spend on a graphics card.If you don't mind being 1-2 generations behind in terms of ray-tracing performance and you don't need CUDA, AMD's 6950 XT and 6800 XT both offer much better price-to-performance in raster gaming and can even beat the 4070 in raw raster performance, all with an extra 4 GB of VRAM. It's not out as of writing this review, but if the 7800/7800 XT has released by the time you're reading this you should take a look at that as well.If you want top-of-the-line RT or need CUDA, this is pretty much the best you'll get without spending another $200 for a 4070 ti (which is even more VRAM limited). But before you buy, make sure to check the competition from team red (or even Intel Arc, though that may be less relevant if you're looking in this price range) to ensure that your requirements really require you to pay the Nvidia tax.",
