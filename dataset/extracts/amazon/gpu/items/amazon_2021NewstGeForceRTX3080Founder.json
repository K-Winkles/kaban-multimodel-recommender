When the card first arrived I was having visual issues after installing and contacted the sellers to get a refund as I was sure the card was bad. They responded within 24 hours and offered and 100% refund and I spend the weekend doing research on the card to see if I could make it work. Silly enough, I didn't have a power supply that could handle the new card. I ended up upgrading to a 1000w power supply from corsair and the card has been flawless ever since. 5/5 product and seller and when I'm in need of a new or another card, this will be my first option.",

I've had it for about a couple months now and gaming at 1440p, paired with a 5600x has been a pleasure. In Dirt 5, it almost reaches the 165 Hz refresh rate of my monitor consistently but I'm thankful for VRR and G-Sync for when it doesn't. If you can find this GPU for ~$500 I'd say go for it.",
