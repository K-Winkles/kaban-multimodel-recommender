                "reviewText": "I have this PowerColor ITX RX 6400 for couple days now.I have a very old PC that has a i7-4790 and a GTX 745. The 745 won't cut it anymore. The 745 can run old games ok but newer games run like slide show. I am looking for the cheapest GPU I can find. The PowerColor RX-6400 is the cheapest and is available.I pulled out the 745 and plugged in this 6400. Downloaded the latest driver from AMD and started playing some of my games. The latest driver crashed Tomb Raider. So, I downloaded an older driver version. The game could run with the older version ok.This PowerColor fits nicely in my case. It runs fast and cold. Temperature is between 50 to 65C most of the time. The fan comes on only if there is a load. The 745 runs very hot around 75C when under load.This card has a HDMI and a DP ports. My motherboard also has a HDMI and a DP ports. I can have a total of 4 monitors plugged to my PC without any problem.The AMD Adrenalin app is pretty good. I can overlay the metrics on the screen to see the fps, fan speed, and other info while playing the games.The only thing I miss is the video encoder. I can use the HD 4600 in the i7 to encode but it is hit and miss. The Intel encoder driver does not like 2 GPUs in the PC. It crashes during encoding all the time. If I remove the RX 6400, I can encode with the iGPU without any problem. The HD 4600 is not as fast as the GTX 745 but it is much faster then using the i7 alone.Games run over 60 fps at 1080p now. Very old games run over 300 fps. I am happy with this PowerColor.I have some pictures.5 stars.",

It handles everything extremely well prior to 2016 without lag or screen tear. However, when running multiple tasks the gpu gets very hot and begin to run slow. The unit will get up to 85 Celsius and beyond which is above the rating for most thermal pastes that is used so I have to let it rest every once in a while. It was easy to install, I would recommend putting in with a pc with multiple fans. It came in a nice box and had a great sleek appearance.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A niche \"upgrade\" for an HP Pavilion Gaming PC",
                "reviewText": "My wife has a HP Pavilion 690-0010 PC. HP marketed this as a gaming PC. We all know better.I bought the Pavilion at the time for my wife to have access to the typical web browsing and email. She is not a gamer but on occasion she will play games with the family. Things like Overwatch 2 and Diablo 3.As with the other PCs in my household, I have done my best to upgrade this PC. Ove the years, I upgraded the RAM from 8GB to 16GB, added a WD Blue M.2 500GB SATA SSD and made this SSD the OS/app drive and now the stock WD Blue 1TB 7200RPM drive is a data drive. (I had to find my own M.2 screw. HP did not include one.) I even swapped out the stock Ryzen 3 2200G CPU with a Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. This was a neat upgrade. While on the original Ryzen 3 2200G, the PC did not qualify for Windows 11. After the CPU swap, the PC can now run Windows 11.With the PC being a small OEM box, upgrades are limited. The last wanting part to be replaced is the dedicated stock GPU which is a Radeon RX 550. I have been hoping that either Nvidia or AMD would release a newer non PCIE power required inexpensive GPU to replace the Raden RX 550.As an aside, my daughter has an HP Pavilion 790-0010 and about a year ago I replaced her stock GPU which was a 2GB GTX 1050 with an Asus Pheonix model GTX 1650. I was not able to get a second GTX 1650 at that time for my wife's PC and my daughter actively plays games more than my wife, so my daughter got the GTX 1650. The GTX 1650 upgraded the VRAM from 2GB to 4GB and made her PC VR ready. Though I take that with a grain of salt even though the Windows Mixed Reality Utility says she can do VR.Back to my wife's PC. I have been waiting for a GPU deal. So, I saw this PowerColor RX6400 come on sale. I knew that this was a severely nerfed GPU compared to even the RX 6500XT. Spec wise, it has a narrower memory bus and lacks video encoders. However, the RX6400 is more powerful than the RX550. Even with a narrower memory bus than the RX550 and only 4 PCE lanes in the PCIE connector, it still performs in my wife's HP PC which only has a PCIE 3.0 bus, about the same as the GTX 1650 in my daughter's PC.The RX6400 supports Raytracing. However, to be realistic, the 4GB VRAM is not enough memory for most Raytracing games to run and this GPU is still not that great compared to modern offerings in a similar price range. However, this was the only upgrade solution for my wife's PC, and it does provide more performance than she had.The card is 2 slots wide is full height and has a short length. Installation in her PC was easy. I did not have to do more than take the cover off the HP and swap GPU cards. For other upgrades, I had to move drive cages and things to get to the innards. The old GPU and this GPU were physically small enough that I had ample clearance to make the swap with only removing the case cover and opening the expansion card latch on the case. I did have to break out one of the metal slot covers on the case to fit the double wide card.The old RX550 had an HDMI output and a DVI output for video. The RX6400 has an HDMI output and DisplayPort output. I needed to use a DisplayPort to DVI converter so that I could still use my wife's monitor. Or I could have bought a new DisplayPort to DVI cable. So be mindful that you have the right cable or adapter on hand since the RX6400 lacks a DVI output.Once installed and powered up, I reinstalled the current AMD drivers without issue. I tried playing vides off YouTube and doing normal everyday tasks and I noticed no difference compared to the RX550. I mention this because this means my wife will not notice any detrimental difference compared to what the RX550 delivered.I also want to mention that this card has no video encoders. Not that my wife will try any streaming but that will not happen realistically on this card. No idea if the RX550 had video encoders.As did the RX550, this card is also quiet in the HP case, so it feels as though it is still a stock OEM card.I did run the Windows Mixed Reality Check tool, the SteamVR Performance TestTool. The WMR tool said my wife's PC is ready for WMR. The SteamVR tool indicated her PC is now Capable of SteamVR but recommended the RX6400 should be upgraded to be Ready for SteamVR. The result indicated some titles would work, others would not. This is better than the stock RX550 which could not pass either VR tool. To be clear, I do NOT recommend attempting VR on this GPU as it is still a low-end GPU.Lastly, I bought this PowerColor branded RX6400 during a promotion which netted me a free copy of The of Us Part 1. To get the game, you are emailed a coupon code which you need to redeem on AMDRewards.com. This triggers the download of the AMD Product Verification Tool and after it checks your coupon code, performs some sorcery, I was able to redeem the game on my Steam account once I linked my AMDRewards account to my Steam account. So I got a AAA first party title with my purchase that I was not expecting to get.The TLDR, this was a small upgrade that was imperceivable to my wife but at least gave her something more modern than what she had with a performance uplift that she will probably not realistically see. At least it should ensure GPU driver support going forward over what the RX550 will receive. This is a niche product that I bought at a marked down sale price, and I am happy for the game I received and the price I paid at the time of purchase.",

This card should be perfect to play 1080p games released before 2016. It's GDDR5 makes it a big difference with memory clock and the core clock can easily overclock at 900 mhz with keeping 68c at 70% fan speed using the latest AMD driver which was from 2021. I am impressed from its performance even though it's been bought for basic use rather then gaming but it is way better then the on board Intel gpu. Using Intel G4620 @ 3.7ghz and 8gb (2x4) DDR4 2133 cas 14 rams. I would give this card 10/10 for it's price and 4gb of GDDR5 vram.",
