                "reviewText": "I have had a few upHere products over the years, and their overall product quality has imporoved immensely! This gpu brace does its job, and looks really nice, too. I got the polished aluminium (think they call it white) and it is a good, solid quality, easy brace. You cant mess it up. I only used 1 of the 2 poles included because my case is small, but I would say, with the second pole attached, it would be about a foot long. The base is nice and heavy and magnetic, so that works perfect. The leaves which the card sits on are the same brushed aluminum, and have rubber pads for extra grip and so the card isnt just sitting on metal. My only con, is that the locking mechanism, a tension screw on the back of the leaf, if also just aluminum, so it will slide pretty easily with no weight on it to push the leaf into the pole. Could easily be fixed my adding a rubber grommet/liner to the hole on the leaf. Still works though, no biggie. My gpu, a Galax HOF 1070 probably weighs 4-5lbs without the Crota Pop figure ontop, so, this is much needed so my poor mobo doesnt loose a pcie. The stock HOF support brace system was just a bit too long for my case, so you will see that at the bottom running horizontally.Ryzen 1600x16GB corsair vengeance rgb1tb samsung 960 evo m.2 with an xpg cooler1tb firecuda hdd8gb galax hof edition gtx 1070Asrock x370 killer mobo850w thermaltake psu3x 140mm bitfenix fans (white)1x riotorro 120mm pwm (black and red exhaust)1x NZXT 140mm pwm for the radiator1x enermax 90mm magma pwm for hdd (under the hood)NZXT Kraken x52 AIO (i think... the 140mm variant)Silverstone rgb lights (do NOT recommend)",

It fits perfectly, is not too large, it's made from decent metal, and there is an extension if you need it.The grips easily glide down the pole. The black paint looks great in a system, and you barely know it is there. I only use a bottom grip, and you can either hand-tighten or use a tool. I used a tool. It will scrape off a tiny bit of paint, so use a rubberized wrench if you want. Not a big deal either way. A screwdriver tip might have been preferable on the fasteners.This is way better than the first piece of junk I ordered. Should fit almost any height needed to support a GPU. Works with my 3080 perfectly. No more sag.",

                "reviewText": "This product has such a simple design and very simple to use. So my 14 year old son has been doing virtual school as I am sure many other kids have also been due to COVID. So before school started, my son came to me with a suggestion. He said, \"Dad, I need a computer.\" This made perfect sense since he did not have one and my office is literally set up in his room. So we had been sharing a computer. I decided to just give him my entire setup which would leave me without a computer so I decided to buy one, until my son told me to just build one.Never built a computer before but I watched a Youtube video and went all out and purchased all high end components from Amazon. I purchased everything except my 34\" LG Curved Gaming monitor from Amazon. So I have a Sapphire Nitro Plus 5700 GPU and after about 3 days of using my newly built computer, I started hearing the fans were making a noise. I saw that the GPU was sagging down a bit and when I lifted the corner up the noise would stop. Figured there must be a fix for this on Amazon and there it was. This \"UP HERE\" GPU bracket holder. It was at a great price and it immediately fixed the issue. It really does work.I have attached some pictures for you to see what it looks like. I don't think anyone would regret this purchase. Just a side note, the GPU holder pole is longer than what you see in my pictures. I only attached one pole as I did not need to use the second pole and that is why mine looks smaller. It does come with 2 holders as well in case you are using two GPUs. Good luck with your purchasing decision.",

                "reviewText": "The upHere GPU Support is an excellent product that works exactly as intended. It provides sturdy and reliable support for my graphics card, preventing it from sagging. The installation process was straightforward, and the support fit my GPU perfectly.However, I have to dock one star from my rating because I was a bit disappointed with the product's appearance. I was expecting it to be more chrome like based on the product images, but it was a bit less shiny in person. While this is only a minor issue and doesn't affect the support's functionality, it's worth noting for those who are looking for a more aesthetically pleasing addition to their PC.Overall, I would still highly recommend the upHere GPU Support to anyone who needs reliable and sturdy support for their graphics card. It does the job perfectly and is easy to install, even if it isn't as shiny as I had hoped.",

                "reviewText": "No logo! I almost bought another similar product because almost every customer image shows it with a big fat \"upHere\" logo painted on the base. Some reviews just said \"color it black with a sharpie\" but I worried I would then have an almost visible logo that was obviously painted with a marker. I understand their desire to build a brand name, but not when it's a $10 part in my $2000 computer. Fortunately upHere must have heard all the anguished crying about the logo and decided to omit it on newer versions of the product. This things is pure black, anodized aluminum (not spray painted).My only gripe is that I worry that the retention screw is engaging directly with the shaft when tightened and might damage the anodized finish after repeated tightening. If this is the case, you will of course never see it as long as you're not trying several different heights.The magnet holds on well. Not too strong, not too weak. I was worried about using a magnet around hard drives but after some research I found that it takes an industrial strength magnet to destroy hard drive data, magnets like this are not a problem.Thank you upHere for removing the logo! Don't worry I'll still remember your products are high quality and recommend them to friends.",
