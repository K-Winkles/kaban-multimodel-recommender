                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Card for 1080P gaming at max.",
                "reviewText": "Before I get to my review I can say that the box for the 300 dollar card is the same box on there 80 dollar cards very cheap, If I spend 300 dollars there should be a very nice design box with black foam, some coupons for games, some adapters. The card came in a cheap box with the card in a esd bag.The Goods news, The card is a great card for 1080 gaming a max settings. It does have DLSS and Frame Generation but the tech is only good for games that take advantage of it, I seen no boost in many games. I turn the tech off and played at native 1080 and still got amazing frames. When I put Frame Gen on Cyberpunk it took some fidelity away and felt a little off, so I turn it off and keep DLSS on. I turned off Ray Tracing, I could not tell with it on and off if the graphics change. If I'm in a battle I will not stop to look at some reflection that cause frames to go down. I rather have PhysX back then this. Anyways, The backplate of the card is a must. The two fans is a plus and the power consumption is a win. Truly if you want to game all night, buy a low powered card that get great fps. Don't buy a 300 watt card to bring up your power bill just so you can see high fps in 4K it doesn't make sense. My 1080P with 144hz is perfect.If you are wondering weather you should buy this or and last gen card, I will tell you this, I really wanted to RTX 2080 ti ,that card will get you 20 plus more fps but power is 250. or RTX 3060 ti is on par with the 2080ti. Please note that the RTX3060s are 128bit bus like the RTX 4060. Also note they will not tell you this but if your board has M.2 that is sharing your PCIE bus you will only be getting 8x speed and not 16X.You will not take a performance hit trust. In conclusion, If you have 200 dollars go get the RTX 2080ti or find a 3060 for 220. Trust me if Frame gen is all your worry about get RTX 4060 just for that tech. But if you want and in between card your options are Unlimited, What happen to the 3070 you ask ? You will have to spend 350 to 400 so that will not count in this review. Shop around and see if you can get a better card for 200 dollars or less you will be surprise on how many person is selling for cheap. This card was purchase through a gift card. My rating out of 10 for this card is a 8. The first gen RTX 2080 ti is a beast with 20 fps over this and 3GB more VRAM.",

                "reviewText": "This card is small enough to fit in very small form factor pc\u2019s, only draws 115 watts of power (which is insane for the performance) and is a perfect price point for performance. I was able to upgrade my HP Pavillion gaming desktop from a 1650 super to this and the difference is night and day. Small enough for little sleeper builds and will play anything you throw at it in very high settings at 1080p. Best GPU purchase I\u2019ve ever made",
