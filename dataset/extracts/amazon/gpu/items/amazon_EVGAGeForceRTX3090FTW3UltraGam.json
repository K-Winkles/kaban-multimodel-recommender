I tried a few driver installations and finally got the right magic that took the temps down toe 50+ but this is not a good spot to be in. I subsequently updated the bios and it added 4 degrees. I downloaded fancontrol (get this!) and was able to get idle temps about 46c. I'm not happy with what was required to achieve an acceptable temp.I purchased a different 3090 that doesn't give me the headaches that this one did and popped this one into a different, and new, PC. The PSU popped and the horrible odor made it apparent that something burned out. It was, in fact, the PSU. I worried that this took the mobo down with it but that was not the case. I can't say for certain that this product test drove the apparent bug inside the PSU but I ended up getting a different brand of PSU just in case and I returned this 3090, for which I got a prompt refund.I ended up buying a 4090 instead of replacing this as it was, which I'm very happy with, and put it into its intended target with a new PSU. Everything is working great and the mobo did not suffer.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Wary but works",
                "reviewText": "Made sure I did extensive research before ordering, and even contacted the owner selling the cards to ask a few questions. Was told by the owner that most cards shipped in their original packaging, with all original components included. Mine didn't, and I was very wary upon it's arrival whether I got a working card or not. First off, the packaging looks like it went through a war zone, probably more of the fault of UPS than the seller, however the packaging itself left a lot to be desired also. Was wrapped and packed fully with bubble wrap so at least the card didn't move around to much in travel, but still low quality packing effort for an expensive card. The second issue/red flag is the card itself, the metal backplate lining the video outputs was bent in two places, and unable to fit into my motherboard upon first try. With some elbow grease and a pair of pliers, I was able to bend it back fairly easy into a shape that would fit into its slot, without damaging the card. It is a renewed card, so there is some leeway for being a used card, however I would have expected the metal backplate to be replaced at least. Despite the emotional rollercoaster of red flags I got upon its arrival, I finally managed to slide it into the motherboard, wire it up, turned it on, and it worked like a charm. No weird sounds, display came right up the first time. I used furmark and a couple 3rd party programs to benchmark the card and make sure it draws power fine and is working like it should, and it absolutely does. So far all my games have run great, and modded skyrim runs especially well with the 24gb VRAM. Felt like a risky buy, but for the price I would have no problem bending a metal plate back again if that's the only issue I'll run into from this seller.",
