You\u2019ve never created and enjoyed games like this before. Ray tracing is the definitive solution for lifelike lighting, reflections, and shadows, offering a level of realism far beyond what\u2019s possible using traditional rendering techniques. NVIDIA Turing is the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. GeForce RTX gaming GPUs come loaded with next-generation GDDR6 memory, support for DirectX 12 features, and more. This is graphics reinvented.",

It\u2019s super quiet and does what it needs to do.If your someone like me who neeededd to upgrade there card ( for example a 1050ti) then this card is for you. I run tarkov flawlessly with no issue. Not a single frame rate drop (which is a heavy GPU game)I do have to say if you do get this card make sure get a cpu that can work with it wel so it doesn\u2019t bottle neck on you.I highly suggest the AMD Ryzen 3600xWorks perfectly with it.Does it run hotter? Yes without a doubt so get your fans all set! Make sure there is good airflow through the system.If the fans are loud for you. Lubricate then with 3 in 1 oil. Works great I did it to my really old card and runs like a charm. Lubrication goes a far way with fans and keeps them running quiet as hell not a peep it will actually sound better than what it did when it first came in the package.",

                "reviewText": "So to start off, I was very iffy on buying a new graphics card to upgrade from my 1050ti due to not wanting to be scammed out of $500. But I took the chance on the MSI Ventus 2060 and I can honestly say it was a W for me. Before I couldn't play my VR games without screen tearing or lagging graphically. But once I upgraded to the 2060, my VR games are running at a clean 90 frames and sometimes more. Not to mention my other games like Call of Duty: Cold War now runs at a solid 135fps. Apex Legends runs at 260fps and so on. This is definitely worth the money if you are planning on upgrading graphics cards. Very powerful and very quiet, even when running graphically demanding games like EVA Online.P.S. all my games are on running high settings.",

                "reviewText": "MSI makes good cards. About this one:- It is not that big (not small either) but you don't need extra clearance in a normal computer case.-Games of 2023 require cards like 1660super to play, thus with this 2060 you will be able to play even the most demanding games.- It is the best budget card out there, where you still can play everything but the price is a consideration (it is still expensive for a pice of hardware, looking at you NVIDIA!)-Nvidia new releases are geared to high end market. Chances are if you had that kind of money to trow around you would not be looking at this 2060-For the money this card and the 1660super are the best value, so look at the 2, check their price fluctuations and wait for a good opportunity to strike! (buy).-Quiet. i upgraded from a 960, and this thing is very quiet. I thought I should get the EVGA since it had a 'no fan spinning' mode, this one does not, here the fans spin always, BUT they are so quite under browsing mode, I dont hear them, I hear my case fans, then I put the card, used it and all i could hear were still my case fans. Ha!-Under games they are also quiet under load, not like a plane is taking off and passengers needed to fasten seat-belts, like with my old card. There are quieter cards models out there, but for the price this one excellent.-Very reasonable power supply (you need 8 pins) - a 550watt Power Supply is enough (if you dont have other crazy demands from your system) thus you will not need to upgrade your power supply unit in most cases.-Has a good port selection in the back. Me likes for my duo monitor set up.Good Luck!",

Super easy install, Great price, works right away, so far no problems, all i can say is I'm In LOVE with this GPU. so thankful the performance lives up to my standards",

                "reviewText": "This card in 2022 is a great bang for buck for budget gamer PC. Based on many professional reviews, this card performs better than the newer 3050 which was a successor. Installation is smooth generally but if you are upgrading from an earlier gen Nvidia card you might want to uninstall that driver first. I went from GTX 1650 to this rtx 2080 and there was a fatal driver error that prevented win11 boot up.... I fixed it by booting to safe mode and installing rtx driver. Then it reboot properly in win11.The card is pretty plain looking so not a flashy card for gamer PC that has LEDs and glass cases. But who cares. It runs fairly quiet. Fans are mostly silent until you really run the GPU hard.Having 3 do ports and 1 hmdi is handy. Gone are the dvi ports. I don't have 4k nor 2k monitors. Just regular 1080p. Runs just fine for that.Very budget friendly upgrade for gaming. Easy to recommend if that's what you're looking for. I lucked out on Amazon warehouse deal for under 400 so that really makes it an attractive upgrade.",
