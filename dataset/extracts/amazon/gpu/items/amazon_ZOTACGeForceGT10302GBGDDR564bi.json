                "reviewText": "My 9-year old daughter recently got into PC gaming like her older brother and wanted daddy to build her a computer for her birthday. Well....daddy is a sucker when it comes to his baby girl. I was fortunate enough to come across this GPU just before the things got real bad in terms of supply and demand. Paid a little more than I should have, but it wasn't outrageous.Popped this in her teal FD case surrounded by 5 pink LED fans and it runs perfectly fine. She currently only plays Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft so the 1030 does just fine paired with her i5-8400 and 16GB DDR4. Fortnite was running 100+fps on high settings, Minecraft was running well above 150fps, and I never really checked Roblox but no hiccups at all there either.She asked me the other day if I would buy here a RTX 3090. I about stroked out and explained that daddy only has 1030 money, maybe 1060 money. We're not RTX-rich!!If you're looking for a good budget GPU for entry-level gaming or for emulation gaming, this is defintely a good choice. Don't expect to play newer AAA titles at blazing fps with this.",

I've had video cards with fans that were quite noisy, this one is very quiet.I use Linux Mint and have had a GT 1030 in my main computer for 2-3 years, and just replaced a GT 710 with this card a few days ago. The 710 had a nasty habit of 'blinking' text as I scroll down the page. This card 'blinks' but only slightly, I can continue to read text while scrolling with it. Nvidia has wonderful support for Linux users, unlike some other manufacturers. Installing an Nvidia powered card is no problem for Linux users.I don't use my system for gaming, mostly internet videos and movies and the performance is good for audio as well as video.Nvidia. It just works!",

Runs retro style Indie titles smooth as butter, Runs Ion Fury fantastic. I optimize most games at 1920 or 1366 res (mostly 1366) to get the most out of the games I want to run at 60fps. It wont run cyberpunk, but if you want a snappy 4k desktop experience including Video, it kills at that, and if you want to rock games from pretty much the 360 and back at 60fps, it kills at that too. Again, makes for a FANTASTIC livingroom PC setup on the cheap",

                "reviewText": "I had to replace a failing 10 year old 24\" VGA HD monitor, so I bought a 28\" 4K monitor that I plugged in to a HDMI port on the back of my 10 year old desktop PC that I hadn't even known it was equipped with! The image quality was tremendously better, but the onboard graphics processor was limited to HD resolution. I'll need to replace my PC in the next two years to accommodate Windows 11 (or 12), so I was limited to finding an \"older technology\" graphics card built for a PCIe 3.0 interface which happened to be available on my PC's motherboard. My research led me to this card which I purchased two months ago, and I finally took the plunge to open up my trusty (and dusty!) old computer to install it. The installation was easier than I'd ever imagined, and after I powered up the PC again (and it struggled through multiple Windows 10 and other assorted application updates since it had been powered down for a week), the computer discovered the new graphics card, and then the graphics card identified the monitor and configured its output for full 4K resolution. I was literally awestruck at how finely detailed the monitor's display is now! I of course don't use this \"vintage\" 3rd gen i5-based PC for gaming, but the increase in image quality and fine-grained detail literally changes the experience interacting with Windows, viewing images and data on web sites, and working with documents and spreadsheets. Anyone who has an older PC that they'll be using for a few more years but wants the full benefit of a 4K monitor in the mean time should truely consider this graphics card!",

It took awhile to get everything set up just right and now all the AI analysis is done on the Nvidia GPU instead of my computer's CPU. This allows my mediocre computer to handle eight, 4K IP cameras without skipping a beat.Definitely a great value!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, so this graphics card is wonderful and actually capable of playing new games at medium 4k settings or high hd settings.Here's the problem. If you're a person like me who likes to use large screen tv;s as computer monitors then you might find some issues with using this card with a 4k tv. Some 4k televisions support 4k at 60hz when it comes to things like streaming media players and blu-ray but not when it comes to pc's. The reason for this issue is not the graphics card or the tv, it is just an issue of the difference between tv and a computer monitor and is wh large screen computer monitors are so expensive.The only way I know of around this issue is to set the fps to 30 Hz at 4k or at 50 Hz at 1080p or possibly 30 Hz at 1080p.If you are using an hd tv and not a 4k tv then you should have no issue with this card at all and should be able to use the highest graphics settings on any game(only at 1080p of course)Personally I consider this as an acceptable trade off for screen size but either way it has nothing to do with the graphics card itself.Also for those who would like to know, this card is compatible with any Linux system and uses the noveu driver if you prefer not to use the proprietary one.All in all I am very happy with this card. I would much prefer an ATI but an ATI equivalent to this card with gddr5 ram would cost at least $150 more, if one even exist.",
