        "description": "NVIDIA Ampere Architecture NVIDIA RTX A4000 is the most powerful single slot GPU solution offering high performance real-time ray tracing, AI-accelerated compute, and professional graphics rendering. Building upon the major SM enhancements from the Turing GPU, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture enhances ray tracing operations, tensor matrix operations, and concurrent executions of FP32 and INT32 operations. 2nd Generation RT Cores Incorporating 2nd generation ray tracing engines, NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs provide incredible ray traced rendering performance. A single RTX A4000 board can render complex professional models with physically accurate shadows, reflections, and refractions to empower users with instant insight. Working in concert with applications leveraging APIs such as NVIDIA OptiX, Microsoft DXR and Vulkan ray tracing, systems based on the RTX A4000 will power truly interactive design workflows to provide immediate feedback for unprecedented levels of productivity. The RTX A4000 is up to 2X faster in ray tracing compared to the previous generation. This technology also speeds up the rendering of ray-traced motion blur for faster results with greater visual accuracy. CUDA Cores The NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based CUDA cores bring up to 2.7X the single-precision floating point (FP32) throughput compared to the previous generation, providing significant performance improvements for graphics workflows such as 3D model development and compute for workloads such as desktop simulation for computer-aided engineering (CAE). The RTX A4000 enables two FP32 primary data paths, doubling the peak FP32 operations. 3rd Generation Tensor Cores Purpose-built for deep learning matrix arithmetic at the heart of neural network training and inferencing functions, the RTX A4000 includes enhanced Tensor Cores that accelerate more datatypes and includes a new Fine-Grained Structured Sparsity feature that delivers up to 2X throughput for tensor matrix operations",
