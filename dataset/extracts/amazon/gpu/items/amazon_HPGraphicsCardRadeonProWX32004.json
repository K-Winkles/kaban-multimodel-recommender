Much better than my Radeon Vega 8 in my laptop or my integrated graphics (Intel 630). On pro drivers too, which are not optimized for games.",

                "reviewText": "Card feels solid, fits snug. Has no instructions or driver disk but a quick Google search linked to AMD's site which has current drivers (free) and date of next driver update/release. 4 mini DP 1.4 ports; they are dual-mode, as is required by DP 1.3+ standard, so they work with passive mini DP to HDMI adapters/cords (not included). It came with 2x mini DP to DP adapters in the sealed box. It also came with the full size expansion slot bracket(?) attached to card and the half-size one is in the box as well. Packaging clearly states that warranty is void if product is not used in a HP computer - not that I care since I don't recall any warranty mentioned in the ad. Don't be fooled, this is merely a rebranded AMD card and works fine in non-HP machines if the other (common sense) requirements are met. I upgraded my power supply before testing, but I think I read that it only draws about 50w if I'm not mistaken.Not sure if my only issue experienced is standard for video cards in Windows 10 (current 4/5/2020 version of Win 10) in an Asus M32CD-AS51, but any time I unplug or plug in a monitor, all of the monitors flash and reconnect in a seemingly random order; this made setting them up quite interesting. Once set up as desired they seem to be holding arrangement properly.",
