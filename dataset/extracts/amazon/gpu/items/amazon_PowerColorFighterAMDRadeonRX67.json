I went from a watercooled R390X to this PowerColor Fighter AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT. The difference is night and day. I have had a 4k monitor but never really could utilize it to its full potential. I am also using only a gold 750 watt psu, so I wouldn't be worried if you don't have a 850 watt psu. This card is NOT LOUD and does not eat up my entire case in size (why I went for the 2 fan vs the 3 fan RX 6750 XT) It does get a bit hot, 70ish, but my case is properly cooled so not a problem. I do recommend this card. As for long term, IDK.",

I couldn't see spending a ton on a new top of the line card because I don't play a ton of games but i still wanted an upgrade. I have no problem with a previous generation card. The price on this one was acceptable and I have been blown away by the improvement. The games I play run great at 1440p with max settings. I get 100+ FPS on the games I play. The fans are quiet, and I like that it isn't flashy with all the RGB stuff. It has a small RGB light but it faces towards my MOBO and that is perfect for me. This is a quality card if you are looking for a reasonable priced upgrade and dont need the latest top of the line card.",

                "reviewText": "I'm loving the card so far after having it for over a month. I got the card for myself for my birthday after seeing it being a reasonable price and watching multiple reviews.Pros- Runs any game in 1440p at high settings no problem- Temps stay really low in the 50s to 60s- The UI for AMD is really nice after getting used to it- AMDs video encoder for either streaming or just recording is really good- Amazing performance for the price. Honestly in my opinion the card can be equivalent to a 3080 TI in certain situations without ray tracing- More than enough VRAMCons- The card sometimes has a loud coil whine that can be heard even with headphones on. Not sure if it's just because the card is still brand new and hasn't been broken yet or not.- The card works best for me undervolted slightly. When I first got the card my temps were always very high no matter what game I played. After undervolting a tiny bit my temps went down 20 or 30 degrees.- I love the UI AMD has...but it can be a little annoying trying to find certain things you want.- Since the card is big and heavier than my last one it had a little bit of sagging going on when I installed it. Would definitely recommend either getting an actual bracket or if you want to save some money and don't care how it looks use zip ties.- Not counting this against just AMD, because it happened with my NVIDIA card too. Sometimes when clipping things in games the sound won't be captured even though you have the correct output being used in the software. It's really annoying because I would have friends say or do something funny and I would clip it to watch it later, but it would have no sound.Overall- The card is amazing and definitely worth the investment. Doesn't matter what side you are on when picking a GPU they both have their issues. I personally chose this card mainly for just the price to performance aspect and since I don't really care about ray tracing too much.",

                "reviewText": "Besides the fan whine at high speed, this card is every bit as capable of it's more expensive \"big name\" cousins. I actually rather like that it's only a double wide as apposed to a triple and the stock cooling works just fine for avg persons need. Even under full load I didn't experience temps above 75c. After disabling the power limiters and beginning to overclock above stock boost, yes I experienced some thermal throttling under full load. All in all I cannot think of a better valued balanced bang for your buck card in the AMD 6000 lineup. The 6500 has only x4 bandwidth and a limited 4gb of memory which seems tragic because it's got one of the best performing chipsets dollar for dollar in the bunch. The 6600 accommodates the vram issue at 8gb and has a larger x8 bus but painfully underpowered processor and ram. For only a tad extra you can get this 6700 which has the ample 12gb of high performance memory anyone could need, an x12 bandwidth (192-bit), an outstanding chip that's boosts to 2500 stock, and of course, the luxurious infinity cache. I want that cache slapped on everything. A 7900xd paired with 2 of these bad boys, I'm still trying to find something capable of pushing it to and beyond it's limit. For another 70 dollars(still cheaper than the price of the next \"big name\" GPU maker, I was able to acquire an aftermarket AIO liquid vga cooler and install it almost shockingly easily (my first time attempting such a thing) and now I am experiencing 20-30c decreases in temp. 0 thermal throttling, cannot seem to push it over 55c. Plus it like looks really freaking cool now with the aftermarket cooler appointments. Do yourself a favor, remember that more money does not always mean better. Look at the hard data, and then see if there's a workaround the make the lesser serve for the more. For the price, this card is unbeatable. If the noise bothers you, fan kits are cheap and easy. If you're gonna push it to the max, all the time, you're probably already familiar with liquid cooling and planning for this need. This was my first purchase from power color, barring an unforeseen catastrophe in product lifespan, it will not be my last. Seriously I saw a couple cards with the exact same specs going for nearly double the price all for double the useless gimmicky features. I like machines to perform first, become a nightlight and sing me to sleep second. Please note that this picture was taken after the aftermarket cooler was installed and that the LCD display reads \"CPU temp\" not \"GPU temp\"",

Like other reviewers have said this card gets hot so I'm going to add an extra fan in the case (once I find a way to mount it).I have two complaints.1. I'm pretty sure I got an open box product. The box looked resealed and the LP wasn't in the little bag in the bottom of the box it was just floating around in the bottom out of the bag.2. I selected hide the item in an Amazon box since it ships in the manufacturers box and I didn't want it sitting on my porch but Amazon dropped the ball and shipped it in the powercolor box.",
