This feature is ideal for compact chassis and simplifies the installation of large cards. Be sure to verify that there is at least a 23mm gap between the side panel and the GPU.",

The 180-degree angle adapter is well-suited for setups with constrained space or for individuals who favor a more condensed layout. Conversely, the 90-degree angle adapter is well-suited for more spacious builds and provides enhanced flexibility in cable routing.

It also makes it so you can run slightly shorter cables as well, in case yours don't reach right now. It's smaller than the pictures make it look, so keep that in mind. It's not much bigger than the size of the 12VHPWR connector itself.",
