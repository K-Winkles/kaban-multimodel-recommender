                "reviewText": "I wanted to upgrade my MSI Trident X 10 desktop (with MSI RTX2070s installed), which is quite a small PC. Not every video card can be installed because of the size of the tower.The new RTX40XX series commonly requires a different power cable than old PSUs provide, but this RTX 4070 is powered by a standard 8-pin cable, which finalised my decision to buy it - this didn't require the PSU change.When I de-installed my MSI RTX2070s and compared it with this RTX 4070 I was very surprised how light the last was! It is almost two times lighter than the RTX2070s and this is definitely a great advantage!Installation was pretty easy, no problems at all - again, thanks to dimensions and weight. I got a huge performance increase in comparison with the 2070s. FPS in demanding Flight Simulator 2020 increased by more than 2 times, and video editing became more comfortable, too.The card works silently even during high loads, but there was one issue I want to highlight.After the installation there was a nuisance noise, like scratching sounds, coming time to time. If you read other reviews you will also found reports about this issue. But I managed to deal with the problem by slightly adjusting the videocard in the slot. All is fine so far!",

So far, I've had 0 issues, thermals are solid even at high loads.The card is powerful enough to play most FPS games like CS:GO & Valorant without issue at > 250fps without any additional overclocking, thus it should be a great pairing with a high refresh rate display, especially if you want to play more competitively.Used the card for running some local AI models, and the overall performance is very solid. Of course, it won't compare to those data center cards, but for an upper entry-level/lower mid-range card, it is very capable.Overall, while none of the 4000 series cards offer good value, I believe this card strikes a reasonable balance between performance and affordability. For me personally, it's a long overdue upgrade, and I don't regret my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so glad I waited for the Raytracing and DLSS technologies to mature. This GPU was plug-n-play. This is a great value.I'm averaging 80 fps on Forspoken on a 27\" G-Sync monitor at the native 2560x1440 HDR with everything maxed out with my old i7-4790k on a Z87 mobo. (updating everything to i9-13900k eventually)Frame generation (new with the 40 series) works great to reduce the effects of the cpu bottleneck and keep the FPS up on titles that support it.Disclaimer: I actually know how to build PC's so Forspoken was already quite playable on my 980Ti just with out all the modern GFX that does add tons of details to the image. If you put this GPU in a box full of canine feces, you'll still have a box full of canine feces.",

It is very quiet. The MSI RTX 4070 I placed in my rig benched 203% on gpu userbenchmark right off the bat. Very happy! Highly recommend this product!",
