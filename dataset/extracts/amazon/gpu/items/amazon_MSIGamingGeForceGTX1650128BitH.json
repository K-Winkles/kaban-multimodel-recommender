                "reviewText": "Just in case anyone else is planning the same thing: I have been running a Ryzen 5 2400 APU, with no graphics card. It did pretty well and I could play most games on moderate settings. I chose the 1650 video card because it has pretty low power consumption and was not too expensive. I bought a refurbished one. It said no additional power cable was required, but that's not the case. It has a six-pin socket like many PCI-E cards do. It installed and booted with no trouble. It took about 10 minutes for my PC to automatically find, download, and install the new driver (I did nothing). The APU automatically saw and used the new card. Aaand....Whammo! Every game I have now runs at 60+ fps. What a difference! I never knew it, but I was running under 30 fps on many games.My battery backup says the power load is the same as before. It could be that it takes the same amount of power as the Ryzen GPU, which is no longer used. It might draw slightly more at max load, but in any case you're looking at roughly the same power consumption as with Vega 11 integrated graphics.It's beautiful. Highly recommended for gamers not wanting to spend a fortune on a rig. Note: The refurbished ones do not even come with an anchoring screw. Most of us have a spare one, but in case you don't, you'll want one or two.",

                "reviewText": "i got this for my pc and it works great!! i wasn't aware of what bottlenecking was and now 2 months later i do!! (it basically means gpu is too weak for cpu, minimizing gpu and overall performance) this gpu is great if you're not playing gpu heavy games (which i do.) i currently have a ryzen 5600x cpu which is waaayyyy too strong for this gpu. i wish i would've known about the bottleneck before i purchased! if you're not gaming this is a perfect budget gpu but for those who are gaming please check a calculator and do your research before purchasing anything :D",
