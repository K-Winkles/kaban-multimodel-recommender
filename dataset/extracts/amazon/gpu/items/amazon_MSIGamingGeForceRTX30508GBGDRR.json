Render times on Daz went from 1.5 hrs to just under 6 minutes. Gaming was great. Now one must consider two things, this unit was longer than the 1660 by about 2 inches. May have to consider extra time installing if you have non factory water cooling or a small case to put it in. Check measurements and available room first. Second, this does not have the audio p[lugs that some gpu's have. Not an issue when most pc's have onboard audio built in. Despite taking some extra time to plan installation it is very well worth it. Easy install.",
