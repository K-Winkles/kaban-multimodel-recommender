            "EASY TO INSTALL-With its 100% tool-less design and straightforward adjustment of the support, installation is painless. The solid base is reinforced by a strong magnet to secure it in place.",
            "MULTIPLE ORIENTATIONS-Includes two supports with different orientations for you to either place it at the tail-end of the GPU, or on the side of the GPU closest to the side panel.",
            "PROTECT YOUR COMPONENTS-Relieve the stress on your motherboard\u2019s PCI-e slot and protect your card while moving. Thorough strength testing shows that the glass can withstand the heaviest of cards without flinching."

This one has great lighting and seems stable, but none of the units I have tried to use have strong enough tape or magnets to hold them in place. The minute you move the computer their position changes and has to be reset. I have drilled several and permanently attached them with bolts and that seems to be the only answer. Realistically you can't have them held with a powerful magnet as that may affect your drives, and double sided tape can only be so strong. So a good product that needs some genius engineering.",
