He doesn't do much graphic work, mostly research and translations, so text heavy stuff would be displayed on all 4 of his screens. No gaming, so he didn't need a state of the art card. The v7900 is an excellent card but it's been running for over 5 yeas. It's starting to show its age and had recently began to overheat constantly even though the thermal paste and thermal pads were replaced. This Quadro card worked perfectly to replace the v7900. The system is now much quieter and all 4 screens are working without any issues. Great card that serves its purposed without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "I was amazed that this card JustWorked\u2122 with Linux and multi monitor, for a 3x 4K setup.Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Unity Desktop. Just make sure you've got the Nvidia drivers installed. I'm using the 495 build. Independent scaling and fractional scaling per monitor works as well.Fullscreen playback of 4K video on YouTube was a little jerky, but I think that has more to do with Chrome and the OS, as I've had the same problem on other systems.Best video card I've had yet on Linux.",
