                "reviewText": "I was looking for a GPU bracket for the past few weeks, they all were either too expensive or will take too long to arrive; until I landed on this product. The delivery was spot on. The product itself looks fabulous in my pc, the pcie riser was in a way better quality than I expected! It probably doesn't say in the listing, but the argb of this bracket is actually compatible with gigabyte motherboards (because an adapter from the standard 3 pin to VDG adapter is included) and I managed to use the VDG adapter to connect the bracket to my corsair RGB hub, so that's a big plus!I would personally give this item 5/5 stars, but it had a small problem. The bracket arrived with a massive amount of glue residue at its bottom, but this wasn't a problem at all; it was easy to clean and won't be even visible after installation. The problem I was facing is the sturdiness of the product. I installed it in my midtower case and then tried to plug the display port cable in, but as soon as it started to insert, the whole bracket bent forward... just really feel bad because it is such a great value for money and with great esthetics, would've been perfect if was a bit more sturdy.To fix the issue, I took the measurement of the hight between the psu shroud and the temporary gpu, then edited atlas to lift it and tape atlas, GPU, and the PSU shroud with 3m double sided tape. To be clear, I\u2019m not disencouraging anyone from buying this bracket, as a matter of fact I recommend it, especially if you have a full tower case (to use the piece that comes with the bracket (its alternative in my case was atlas, since it can't work in my midtower case)). Really great product overall, with great riser cable, great paint job, great ARGB, and a better price. I will buy again!Update: I drilled screw holes in the PC case, now the product is actually sturdy and will give it the fifth star back!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this before buying new computer case and started a new build. It worked for holding the card in a vertical position, somewhat. It is kind of flimsy and the card sagged, it came with foam squares your supposed to wedge under the bracket to hold up any sagging. The ARGB only lit up on one side a dull bluish color and never did more than that. I emailed the seller, they wanted pictures, videos, and essay on how I installed, and wanted me to send them all that and they would decide if they would do anything. That's the last I ever heard of them... I think I sent them a pick of it installed. I would not recommend this bracket and would find a better one. I lost my money on this, and will not be buying any more stuff from this seller.UPDATE: This Seller has GREAT Customer Service. They read my review, and contacted me immediately, and after a couple back and forths, they made things right. I have upped my star rating because of this. Even though my ARGB Video card bracket might not have worked for me, maybe one of those bad apples that made it thru QA, everything else that I had bought from them has worked well, my fans are looking good and doing the job. Now, I have no problem ordering more things from EZDIY in the future, because they stand behind their products with great customer service. But still one star short for the first bracket not working...",

                "reviewText": "Well that was a great purchase. This mount gave me a lot of options for placement. I opted to install the support bracket on the front of the mounting plate and it gave me space behind the gpu to keep the installed usb 3.0 pcie card. (You can see the space in the second photo.) Keep in mind that this does move your fans closer to the side panel and can restrict airflow. My case has just enough depth to maintain decent space and the temps are just on par with the standard horizontal position of the gpu. It also helps that the case is an open frame design so airflow is awesome.I have a radiator on the front of the case with a push/pull configuration and being able to move the support bracket back and forth allowed me to have just enough space to fit the gpu in its place without having to remove the pull fans. Mind you my case has a different shape to it (as you can see in the photo) so the radiator is at an angle opposed to being vertical and straight. Gpus come in different lengths and mine is a very long length for a 2 fan. It\u2019s pretty close to a 3 fan length. PC cases also come in different lengths so having the option to slide the mounting bracket around can help you fit your gpu and fit the monitor cables too.The ARGB was a nice touch. It was easy enough to plug into my Razer Chroma hub and get synced to the lighting. The diffusion is nice but you can see the individual led diodes. Doesn\u2019t look bad but just take note.The whole setup is a bit hefty and does move side to side if pushed so included are a few support options. You\u2019ve got a few foam pads and 2 hefty metal L brackets that you can screw together to create support and that screws into a slot so it\u2019s adjustable along the length of the support bracket. It would be very sturdy if installed with the bracket but my psu was right beneath the gpu and sticking on one of the foam pieces did the job of supporting the back end of the gpu.The riser cable is flexible and I didn\u2019t have difficulty installing it in the slot on the motherboard. I was very happy to see that the through holes on the pcb were plated so I don\u2019t have to worry about the screws causing a short and then a fire. #NZXT My gpu popped right into place on the riser and I screwed it in place with the provided thumbscrews to the mount. I ran some benchmarks and the performance of the gpu was unchanged. Only time will tell how long it will last but it seems good and quality is very nice.Overall I\u2019m extremely pleased with the installation. The manual was very easy to understand. I just looked at the pictures and followed along. I don\u2019t really even remember reading any of the words, the pictures did the job of explaining just fine. To end this I\u2019d suggest giving this gpu mount a try. For $35 I think it\u2019s a great option and can yield a terrific result.",
