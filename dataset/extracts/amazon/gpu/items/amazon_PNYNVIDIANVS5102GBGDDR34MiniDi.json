Initially, after installing the card and rebooting the computer I received what Windows 10 calls \"beep codes\" and a blank screen when trying to reboot. I finally looked this code up -- 5 in this case -- and it signaled some sort of trouble with the motherboard. I had installed some new RAM in the computer about six months ago and thought maybe it was defective. Ultimately, this led me to remove and reseat the RAM in my computer worked just fine. Before I bought this card I was unable to run DaVinci Resolve with my old 512k card. Now it works fine. Also, videos that used to hang up set to HD now run smoothly and clearly.I didn't bother replying because I expected to follow up. Not only did they follow up, THEY CALLED ME ON THE PHONE!

I installed the card but never got a response from either video monitor (LG G-Sync). I did try installing drivers downloaded from NVIDIA but they failed because the hardware cound not be found.I returned the card and got a replacement.The replacement came with an installation CD but there was no documentation, only drivers. The one sheet of instructions indicated that the installation guide was on the CD. It was not, and not in the unzipped contents of the driver as well. Undaunted, I installed this second card and the result was the same, no display. Actually the monitor said no signal and went to sleep.Additionally, installing this card into an HP Envy is a nightmare. I bent a couple of grounding fingers, attached to the case, because of the card's output panel small size.I'm returning this card also.I do not expect to buy a PNY card in the near future nor can I recommend one to anyone who has an HP Envy.",

                "reviewText": "I recently built a new computer. I wanted a strong computer for video editing, able to comfortably run virtual machines, image processing and just general computing. Well I built a quite nice computer but it kept locking up and was quite unstable. I spent months trying to track it down. After swapping out a few components to no avail, I came to the conclusion that it just had to be the video card that was causing the problems.I have 4 monitors' so I went looking for a video card and I had already spent a lot on the computer and I really didn't know for sure that the video card was the culprit so I didn't want to spend a lot. After a bit of research, I ran across the NVIDIA NVS 510. Decided to take a chance. I've had it installed for almost a month and I have not had one computer freeze. All of the problems that I was having before are gone. I am very pleased with the video quality and all is well in Smallville.I don't play games so I cannot speak to refresh rates or video lag or any of those things gamers worry about, But for a home/office environment I don't think you could do much better. According to my research the video card was introduced for over $400 but the price has come down quite a bit making it a real value. I'm running Windows 11 64 bit and I'm quite satisfied with the quality and price.",

Installed two boards for trading with eight screens.I called Customer Service and they were very helpful in providing a credit so I could order another cable to replace the defective cable. What great customer service. Amazon is a great company and they provide great customer service. Thanks",

                "reviewText": "This is a great device for the cost. Comes with everything noted, including four solid miniDP to DP converters. Card came in sealed bag, shipped with a DVD with drivers on it as well. I'm actively driving four 2K monitors, and its doing so effortlessly.Hardware wise this card has a GPU, but it's not one really designed for games. It's got enough power to do most basic things while driving four displays. That includes things like video encoding, decoding, and some 3D boosts. To be super clear this is NOT DESIGNED FOR GAMING, but for business use. And it does exceptionally well at doing that with most apps one would use for business (CAD software, editing, etc).The only minor disappointment was that the GPU driver is apparently not versioned correctly (or possibly not strong enough?) to support enhancing zoom conferencing with virtual backgrounds. It may be that the hardware could support it, but Zoom doesn't see the version info it wants and simply refuses to try. Hopefully that will be corrected if it can at some point in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I have 3 screens connected to my PC, one of which is a large-screen TV. My old setup was having trouble with the big screen even though it was supposed to be supported. The picture would break up regularly. Then I replaced one screen with a newer DP model. There wasn't room for the massive video cards on offer these days, nor the desire for all the cooling noise they create.The NVS 510 was a great solution - compact and quiet, but supporting 4 high end screens. It does use mini-DP ports to fit a single slot but includes 4 adapters with clips to easily attach screens. I found and ordered one HDMI adapter from NewEgg for the TV connection. It might be cheaper to use an adapter cable. Now the TV signal is stable, the new screen is supported, and the unit runs cool.For some reason, Windows didn't order the screens in the sequence of connection but I was able to correct the issue in the NVIDIA control panel (downloading the latest version from their web site).",
