                "reviewText": "Pros:*Very easy to install in a O11 mini - literally takes 2 minutes*Thumb screws only for install*Leaves the bottom two PCIe slots open on a full size ATX mobo, which is nice*Has slots in the bottom plate for more airflow to the GPU*Overall is pretty secure and solid when installed properly, my GPU sits nice and level*GPU fans sit at least 2 inches from the side glass (and thats with a 3 slot GPU), plenty of room for cooling. I have already confirmed no change in temps for my GPU.*Bridge cable appears to be decent quality and is also flexible enough to move around a little.Cons:*If you have a current gen GPU (RTX 4000 series in particular) you are definitely going to lose the rear fan slot - look at my pic (thats an MSI gaming trio RTX 4070ti). The rear fan doesn't even come close to fitting with my GPU. I could install the fan on the outside of the case, that is actually an option and there is a slot to get the fan wires back through into the case, but I'm not sure yet if I want to do that or how it would look.*One of the tabs on the left side of the mount (that interlocks with the case) is located where the mobo I/O shield is. This shouldn't be there because it actually interferes with installation. I had to flatten it out with pliers to get it to install correctly. I guess it would install right if you put this mount in BEFORE your motherboard install, but otherwise it doesn't.*Its expensive for what it is. There are a lot of whole cases that don't cost this much. But if you have a O11 mini and you like the look, its worth having the one that is made specifically for this case.NOTE: Depending on your GPU you may have to loosen the little screws holding the PCIe port down to the bottom plate, mine was too far back and the GPU wouldn't mount up properly. For a second I thought it wasn't going to fit, but luckily the port position can be slid forward/backward by a few millimeters as needed.",

                "reviewText": "I was relieved to find the 4.0 riser cable worked just as it should. Disappointed to find I could no longer fit a 120 fan in the rear. Pleased with the look at the adjustability of the bracket placement. You can also adjust where the riser sits on the bracket, three positions so you can move closer to the glass or to the mobo.In my case, with huge MSI Gaming X trio 6800xt, it is a tight fit still. The two tiny screws attaching the riser to the bracket can barely hold my big card in place. Provides a great look, and more support than the sag from traditional mounting. However, it hardly seems worth the price. High quality all around then a mediocre way to fasten down all that weight to the bracket was a bit of a let down.Still recommend this product, especially if you are sure you will never need to access other PCIe slots and have a lighter or shorter card.",

                "reviewText": "Decide on vertical mounting before you put everything together!I decided later on that I wanted to vertical mount my GPU, but it turned out to be a bigger task than I thought. First of all, since this mount replaced the whole back mounting wall of the case, anything mounted to it needs to be disconnected. After installing the GPU to the mount and attempting to install it to the case, I realized there were huge interference issues with the fans at the bottom of the case. Luckily the case allowed for the mobo to be positioned higher, but that also would require a decent amount of teardown. My fan facing the backside of the case could also no longer be mounted there due to interference with the GPU.In the end, I decided it wasn't worth the effort and the loss of 1 fan. Again, strongly recommend to build with the vertical mount in mind, and not do this AFTER the build.",

                "reviewText": "First, the build quality is right on par with the quality of the 011 mini. This replaces the entire back panel and it feels like it was built with the case after installation. The pcie 4 cable worked without bios changes with my evga rtx 3070 ftw3 and msi x570 gaming pro carbon. I have 0 sag as well with this mount.Couple things to note. With bulky cards like mine, you will no longer have access to the rear exhaust fan. Between losing that and the lose of natural heat convection mounting vertically, I did see my card go up 5c at full load from 55 to 60c. Not a huge issue as that is far below thermal throttling or excessive heat damage anyways. If you are using an air cooler for your cpu, this is not for you. Lastly, it was a huge headache getting my card properly slotted onto the mount, but i feel like thats an issue with how bulky my card is and not a fault with the mount itself.",
