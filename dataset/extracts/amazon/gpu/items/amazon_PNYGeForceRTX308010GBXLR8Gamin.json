                "reviewText": "This PNY RTX 3080 GPU has been the perfect fit for my motherboard and case. I had been using a GTX 1080 for 6 years, and I felt it was time to upgrade, especially now that 3080 prices have dropped to MSRP. Initially, I was worried about the size of the 30 series GPUs and whether they would fit in my mid-tower case, but this one was only 11 inches long, which was only 1 inch longer than my 1080 GPU. The card now sits nicely in my case and runs like a charm.With this GPU, I've been able to enjoy 4K quality gaming with consistent 60 fps (though some games may vary). It's also been very quiet in my room, and I'm confident in the decent warranty from PNY in case something goes wrong.Overall, if you're looking to upgrade your graphics card but have a somewhat dated or small case, this one is perfect for you, especially if you can get it for around $750 or $700. It's the best purchase I've ever made, and I hope it lasts for the next half-decade for upcoming game titles.",
