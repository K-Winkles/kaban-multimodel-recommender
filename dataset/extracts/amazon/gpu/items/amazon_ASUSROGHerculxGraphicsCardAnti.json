                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on the ASUS ROG Herculx Graphics Card Anti-Sag Holder Bracket, and let me tell you, it's a total game-changer for my PC build! First off, the solid zinc alloy construction feels incredibly sturdy, giving me confidence that my pricey graphics card is in safe hands. The installation was a breeze \u2013 no tools needed, which is a big plus for someone like me who's not too handy with hardware.What really sets it apart is the included spirit level. It's such a small detail, but it made adjusting the height to perfectly align with my graphics card so easy. The wide compatibility means it fit my setup without any hassles, and I think it would work great for most PC builders out there.But here's the kicker \u2013 the Aura Sync RGB lighting. It adds such a cool vibe to my setup, especially when I'm gaming in the dark. It's not just functional, but also adds an aesthetic appeal to my rig.So, if you're looking to give your graphics card the support it deserves while adding some flair to your setup, I'd definitely recommend the ASUS ROG Herculx. It's a small investment for a big upgrade in both functionality and style! And who doesn't loves a bit of RGB in their life, right?",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Cool but ridiculous",
                "reviewText": "The herculx by Asus ROG is a cool, helpful, but ridiculous product.It's very useful for propping up these massive new RTX 30 series and later cards, which I just bought for myself after using a gtx 1000 series for many years. Though for me this was very much optional as I have an Asus ROG Strix motherboard which has reinforced anti-sag PCIe ports. However I like to baby my electronics, so I got this anyways.If you're like me and you are a big gamer, and love all the fancy RGB stuff, and gaming knick-knacks, then you'll love this. If you also don't have a reinforced motherboard, you'll definitely need this as the RTX 30 series are huge cards, they feel like something that belongs in a vehicle engine rather than a PC part.The herculx is a very well engineered device. It has a small little \"foot\" on it which can be dialed to adjust the height down to the millimeter. It's got a push-button that allows you to manually adjust the height in bigger volumes so you don't have to sit there and turn the dial forever, it fits a wide variety of spaces so it should work with most cases/PC setups, however keep in mind your measurements and spacing just in case.I call the herculx ridiculous because it's so over the top, it's got RGB lighting of course which plugs into an addressable RGB header on your motherboard, and can be setup just like any other RGB peripheral device. The colors are also very vibrant and the device has this \"holographic\" look to it which is really cool.This thing also has a detachable, magnetic level that fits right on it for storage which is another reason I call it ridiculous, however it is still very useful if you're paranoid about your card sagging.The one down side to a GPU stand like this is that GPUs aren't exactly designed for stands. I say that because GPUs tend to have a lot of fans, and you have to be careful not to place the stand touching one of these fans or you may damage your GPU. In fact I bought a ROG Strix brand RTX 30 series card and I found very little spaces for the stand's little \"foot\" to sit under, I had to place it in a tiny little space along the edge of the card between two of the fans in order for it to hold the card, but also be out of the way.TL;DR This is a great item, and it'll hold a GPU up for sure, it's well engineered and is very smooth operating, it has RGB via an addressable header plug (3 prong) and even comes with a magnetic, detachable level. It's got a cool holographic style face to it which makes the lighting look super cool. And lastly it is covered in ROG branding so you can show off your ROG dedication.I wouldn't recommend this to just anyone, however I WOULD 100% recommend this to someone who has the money for it, and needs to prop up their GPU to prevent sagging/damage to their motherboard. It's a great product and though at the time of me buying this it was $40USD, I would probably buy it again, there are cheaper GPU stands out there, but this one is so well made it just screams quality. Even the packaging was incredible.",

In fact, it looks so good that even though it doesn't fit with my ASUS z790 motherboard because this design of motherboard moves the video card down one slot to put in an extra M2 card slot, I'm keeping it. There's like a little part on the back of it that is slightly holding the corner of my video card. Just enough to say that it's being held so I think that's good enough for me. I could see how where the proper install it would really look great but unfortunately doesn't work quite right with my system. I'm still going to give it five stars though cuz I see the potential and it looks amazing.",
