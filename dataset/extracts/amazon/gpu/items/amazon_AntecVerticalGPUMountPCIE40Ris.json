I would say the toughest part is if your case doesn't fit this perfectly, you'll have to mod your case a bit, but that's with most of these vertical brackets unless you get a huge one that takes up a ton of space but is adjustable. Also, you can clearly see it will take all your slots, so don't complain when pictures clearly show that with almost every vertical mount except the large adjustable ones. I needed a clean tight fit with a good riser cable and this was closest of all the mounts I tried. No I structuons which also sucks, but anyone with any experience will figure it out quickly. Good luck, just wanted to share this mount is solid, well built, no sag, stays far away from glass panel but is a bit of a pain to install in some cases.",

                "reviewText": "I have run numerous vertical GPU mounts over the past view years and this is indeed a complete package option that works well with a variety of cases. I recently installed it into a 500D Airflow with a few modifications to the existing knockout panels on the back of the case. It will pass enough buss speed to keep up with a liquid cooled RTX 3090 Kingpin... HOWEVER, It will cause problems with a RTX 4090, even at 90% power and undervolted I still got instability, the occasional crash from GPU device failure, and numerous frame errors in the 3D Mark family of benchmarks. Bypassing the cable (on 2 separate orders and a dedicated 15cm cable) and plugging the card directly into the motherboard resulted in no further errors, no crashes, and scores in the upper 99.3% in 3D Mark, Time Spy Extreme, and Port Royal.Works with 4080 and below, don't count on it for a 4090 though!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bracket to install into my white Fractal Design Pop XL Air case. As many others have stated, no instructions were included, but with only a handful of screws it is kind of self-explanatory how it all goes together. That being said, the machining of the screw holes between the various pieces does not line up perfectly, so there is some manipulation required to get the thin metal pieces to go together. After some trial and error, I was able to get the bracket assembled. Installation into my particular case requires trimming the edges of the \"fingers\" that go into the expansion slot covers; that's not a fault of the bracket, as they can't engineer it to fit all variances between cases.The white color of the bracket is a great match to my case, and the aRGB base works as expected.The reason for 1 star is due to the cable. This cable is advertised as a PCIe 4.0 x16 cable, but mine only operated at x8 speeds. I initially thought it was due to both of my m.2 slots being used, but have since determined that is not the case; I can achieve x16 when the gpu is plugged directly into the motherboard. After about 4 months of use, my computer would no longer boot with a display, and after much troubleshooting I determined the riser cable was no longer operating. I disassembled the cheap plastic ends to expose the contacts between the ribbon cable and the contacts for the motherboard, and discovered that all of the contacts are secured with what appears to be hot glue, and that all the pins for the last ribbon cable were not aligned properly and each contact was bridging multiple pins, creating a short. The cable quality is poor.I've contacted Antec support via the email provided on Amazon. I was informed by a representative that I had to contact a different email address, which I did, and have not heard a response back. I will update the review if anything gets resolved, but at this time I'm not impressed with Antec at all.",
