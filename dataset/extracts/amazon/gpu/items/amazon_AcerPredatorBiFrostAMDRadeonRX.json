                "reviewText": "The installation was simple but lengthy. I have a 10850kf cpu and my motherboard needed a BIOS update for the rebar. After installing the drivers and before doing the BIOS update, the GPU was running like a slide show. BIOS update took a while, lots and lots of reboots but finally had the rebar enable option in the BIOS and GPU started working well.I have the GPU mounted vertically and I thought the RGB would look good but it is kind of dull looking in real life. The first fan has a very dull looking RGB and the second fan has some RGB but barely there. I don't think the RGB quality looks as good as they advertise in the box. But, it is OK enough looking and not too bad; just not as good as I thought it was going to be.The GPU came with the Assassin's Creed game and the code came in the next day after delivery. It is running 60 fps on high settings on ultra-wide 1440p system. The game runs smoothly enough that I'm immersed and enjoying it. There are some hitches when loading levels but gameplay is smooth.Overall, for the price it is a good card and happy with it. Aesthetics could be better but its not too bad.",

I start hearing a bad wine during startup and gameplay, I took it to my local computer repair shop and they said the middle small fan is loose and causing the issue. So, I recommend not buying the ACER version, the tech told me that the small fan is prone to brake, bad design and cheaply made.Well, I took a chance on trying the Intel arc a770 in my new system build and I can say it was a big mistake. Constant issues from the beginning, it will not run my favorite older shooter games like Soldier of Fortune II, it constantly crashes during game play, playing COD2 and it crashes after about 30 minutes of gameplay with the \"fatal error\" notification, it is a great looking video card and seems to run pretty cool.I notified new drivers were increasing performance according to intel, but there is so much wrong with the Arc intel video card, that just did not help, so I will be returning it. I wanted to give it a shot, but intel really screwed this up, I just thought a high tech company like intel would do a lot better job in creating a gaming discrete graphics card, especially since they brought on high level AMD employees to help out, I guess it did not work out. I still hope they can fix the issues and release a better video card in the near future, since I am getting tired of AMD and NVIDIA charging over 1,200 - 2,000 graphics card that no one can afford or obtain, we need more tech companies involved in making GPU's to bring down the prices and give us alternatives to AMD and NVIDIA's stranglehold on the GPU marked. Common Intel, figure it out already.",

It runs 3440x1440 well enough though I suspect it would really shine at normal 1440p. It\u2019s a nice looking card and temps aren\u2019t terrible. I mostly bought it to support intel and try to get another player in the game. Intel Arc control is crap and after two fresh installs of windows, it still freezes instantly any time I try to run it. Not really needed software anyway. Just don\u2019t forget to make sure resize bar is enabled.",

I swapped out my Nvidia 3060 for this and the VRAM is the biggest bonus. All the newest cards are coming out with yesterdays memory specs of 8Gb and charging double. I have this card running my whole Adobe suite, Davinci Resolve and Blender and it just smokes through everything.You absolutely need a motherboard and processor that has a Rebar option to take advantage of it's power or this card will NOT work. Z690 or Z790 and a 12th or 13th gen Intel is the ideal setup so you can also use the Deep Link technology. This card also has AV1 encoders and decoders which is the future, especially if you do Youtube channels. You would have to buy a RTX40 series for that at 3 times the price.If you set up your card with new complimenting hardware, it really does work well. If you are installing this on a 4 year old computer and complaining it doesn't work....well.",

Insane the hoops you have to jump through for this card.Now, just a few days ago, I get a notification that the card has new drivers. Great! Maybe this will help the lag and problems with software I have been experiencing.Nope. Another 4 hours spent ( so far ) and I cannot get this card working at all. I am back to on board video and this card is once again just an EXTREMELY expensive night light. I have had to wipe my entire computer to erase the faulty divers and am now back to where I was before with the constant loop of trying to install drivers to a card that isn't being detected because there are no drivers.Avoid at all costs.
