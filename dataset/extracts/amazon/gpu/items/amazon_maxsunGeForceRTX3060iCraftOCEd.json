Haven't tested it with anything SERIOUSLY demanding yet though. Coupled with a 5700x, for those wondering.",

Which isn't good nowadays, I would much rather have a slower card that can still deliver than a card that is bittlenecked by its VRAM. Less lag spikes and jitter when playing because the system is moving Video Data from your Storage to VRAM (and system RAM if SAM or ReBar is enabled).If your contemplating about buying this or the new 4060 series of GPU, I would buy this or wait until NVidia releases the $399.99 version (16gb VRAM). The 8gb of VRAM is not worthe your money at this point and time.",
