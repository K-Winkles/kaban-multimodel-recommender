Holds a PCIe-x16 external graphics card in an EXP GDC dock and a ATX PSU.What I find missing is there is no hold downs to keep the EXP GDC Dock in place and no cable management for the PSU but other than that it really works. Would be nice if there was an optional handle to buy",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It does the job could be better with more support",
                "reviewText": "First off, there are no assembly instructions. I had to refer to the pictures in the description to assemble. After assembling, I had to completely dissemble/reassemble the entire support because my graphics card fans were facing the power supply. The advertising picture shows two cross members on the bottom supporting the graphics card and the circuit board. The one received only has one cross member to support both the graphics card and circuit board, causing the interface board to flex. I would have paid extra for the second support if it were an option. The other issue is one of the extensions that holds on to the top of the graphics card had no threads on one end and at the other end the threads were completely smashed & stripped during the manufacturing process, that is poor quality control. It's very flimsy with only one top extension mount and one bottom cross member support. The structure will have to be handled very delicately if it needs to be moved. Could have been much better and sturdier if I had all the support pieces.",
