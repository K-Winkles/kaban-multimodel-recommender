Just download AMD Adrenalin software and it'll do the rest. No need to get the manufactuers download. I purchased this card to complete a project by replacing an MSI RX560 that was acting flakey and unstable. I was shocked to see this thing run circles around the MSI card. After all this RX550 is supposed to run slower. Belive it or not I'm running MSFS2020 at medium settings with it. It's flawless. Don't know what all they put into it but I'm getting alot out of it for the price. $79 for a RX550 that runs as good as a 4GB RX560 and approaches the performance of my RX570 at half the price and power consumption. Seems to be running well under 50W. I tested it on an external GDC Beast powered by a 12V 6a power adapter and it ran flawless there as well. I recomend this GPU and I'm temted to buy another one.",

                "reviewText": "using this to replace a dead nvidia gtx 970, this looked like a great price, and since my motherboard only supported PCIe 3 I couldn't upgrade much.my pc sounds a little louder than before but i had to replace my power supply at the same time, so i'm not sure which caused the noise increase.My PC is again able to runs games like Satisfactory on normal settings.I was a little distraught that the power slot only takes 6 pins, but eventually found out 2 pins come off of one of my 8 pin power cords.the user manual (v1.0) says\"Go to www.szsongrui.com or GPU chipsets official website to download the drivers for this card based on the operating system.\"there are 6 downloads for this card, (3 fast 3 slow)the top one is not labeled, but hovering over it shows a file name that indicates windows 7the middle one is labeled for windows 10, and is from 2019.the bottom one is labeled for windows 11, but the file name indicates it should work for windows 10 also, and is from 2022.but here is the odd part, if you click a download button, a download does not start.if you wait, your screen will go black, and then come back on and adjust resolution and the drivers are installed for you, no menus, nothing to click or see, no history of a downloaded file in my downloads folder nor my browsers downloads folder. they must have some sort of script that puts it in temp space and headlessly handles the installation, but that is unexpected and scary.Feeling like I might have installed a virus along with my graphics drivers I ran a virus scan and it came back clean. So perhaps everything is okay.Giving \"Tech Support\" a 2 star rating for how their website handles downloads.included the user manual incase anyone else needs to see it before buying, useful information.",

                "reviewText": "I was replacing an old Gateway that I nursed along for an extra decade, but it was never going to be Win11 compatible, so I scrapped it and built a new one from scratch. I was using an old video card from the Gateway and it worked fine with the new PC I built, but my son had been pestering me about building a starter gamer PC. With the rebuild, I decided to go part of the way on that, but wound up doing way better than I had anticipated on the gamer front.This card went in when I found it for $89.50. Knowing it had the capability to play the Epic Spiderman Reboot, I decided to give it a go. Well, I'm happy because it serves our tv and monitor with HDMI cords and it renders the Spiderman game on the tv to the point I thought he was watching a movie. Crystal clear on both outputs for movies or computing and no skipped frames or pixelation on the game.The only way it will lose stars if it doesn't last.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased the SRhonyra Radeon RX 580 8GB GDDR5 to replace an older GPU which was failing to deliver HD videos reliably. So far the RX 580 GPU has handled all HD video that my family has been enjoying to watch. Now, I know this GPU is not a real RX 580, due to the fact it uses 2048SP, I consider this GPU to be an RX 575 :) My computer has AMD Adrenalin 23.7.2 software installed, all I did was to install the SRhonyra Radeon RX 580 and it booted up. Once my computer was up, Adrenalin showed a dialog box telling me to reboot in-order to install new GPU drivers. The process of installation couldn't have been easier! In reality I'm glad SRhonyra didn't supply me with a software disk. Like my title states this GPU exceeds my expectations!",
