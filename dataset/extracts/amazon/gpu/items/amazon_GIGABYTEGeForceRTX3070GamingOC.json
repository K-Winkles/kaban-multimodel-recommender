Oh yeah, good luck sending in for warranty services if you can manage to find Gigabytes address and they fully expect you to pay shipping costs. Also heres the warranty address, took me awhile to actually find it. Heres the address: 17358 Railroad Street City of Industry, CA 91748. Also the main auros site will let you setup the warranty claim process but gives no info on where to proceed other than your rma number. I\u2019d recommend another brand that is clear on how to rma products and has to access customer service. Evga for starters has stellar customer service, choose them instead.When it worked it was working fine, but Gigabyte does a crap job on the pasting for the boards. Where the memory modules are at, there isn\u2019t usually good pasting or pads in some cases. Imagine seeing the paste or thermal juices running everywhere, yep it happens to people with Gigabyte gpus. Usually ends up being the primary reason why the gpus fail and good luck actually having their engineers do a better job of patching a failed one. If you consider out of all the aib makers, Gigabyte gpus are constantly having overheating issues.Honestly, I\u2019d recommend to stay far away from their products. Considering my gpu is dead currently, the ratings site at ones across the board. If it ever gets fixed, then ill update this review.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased from TeckyStore item came in the mail fast with some small bending on the securing tabs. Gtx3070 performed what seemed to be a flawless benchmark test. The card was very loud during the benchmark but I thought nothing of it.Fast forward about 8 weeks and while playing Half life Alyx the card crashed. Then my son managed to crash it twice playing Rec Room.I contacted the seller-TeckyStore and they will not assist in any measure to correct it. I was sold a bad second hand card. It is out of the 12 week return window so now I have a useless brick. Since I have integrity I will not sell it to some poor fool like myself as TeckyStore did. Congratulations TeckyStore you officially duped me over like I'm sure you have so many before me...",

                "reviewText": "The graphics card itself works great, amazing performance, and runs very cool in my H710 case. The graphics card has a weak point, though, in its power pin plugs on the card. I plugged the 8-pin in the first time, and something didn't feel right, and it turns out one of the pins was bent! I thought that I had done this, but I have seen several others mention the same problem, so this will warn others who buy it. Just be careful plugging it in because you may break something! Other than that, it's a great card. IF - you can manage to buy one, unfortunately.",

Price is much higher that MSRP but given the current circumstances I am happy to have secured one of these. No regrets at all. Will be a very sweet deal when prices drop. I intend to keep it for a long time.",
