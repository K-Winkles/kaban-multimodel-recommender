                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works great, except OC or downclocking the VRAM on Linux, great benching, MST works fine",
                "reviewText": "EDIT 2: Have now tested the card with 6 monitors (first newest pic -- not to be confused with the older, mismatched size monitors in previous pics, where one was running off an RPi). The active/powered MST hub I attached works, and it DOES support all 6 screens, no additional configurations needed (even on Linux! as that's what I use).[NOTE: MST stands for Multi-Stream Transport, and it is the ability of later DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort to attach 2 or 3 monitors to the same DP connector that show as physically separate screens (NOT just duplicating the screen the way some HDMI \"splitters\" do)].I have tested this with both 1080p and 720p (I use 720, because my eyes are just too bad to see the smaller text, and previous scaling settings sometimes conflicted with certain programs), and both settings work fine.I am very impressed, overall, with how much this card is able to do.Other than OC on Linux or downclocking the VRAM, the only other things I can think another user might need to test are higher res monitors (I will NOT be testing that, due to eyes) and VR performance (probably will not be able to test this myself for at least a while, if I even am able to, at all, with my awful eyesight).Looking back at the original review, though, I DO have to update a couple other things:1) I have not experienced that screeching noise in a long time. It might have been a wire I was using.2) When I wrote that fan controller, it is no longer quieter than my RPi, although it is still quieter than my new high-powered fans (in other newest pic).3) I have tried it with some games, and it plays them fine. It also benches really well on Heaven -- I tested it a while back across a 2x2 of my monitors (before buying the newest ones) with max spec and 3D anaglyph, and it still ran well, so you can easily use this for most games.-----EDIT 1: Have now had card for about a year, and I've added more monitors to it, as you'll see in my newest pics. It's still going strong, but I did replace the thermal paste on the sink with Arctic MX 4.I find that I was able to lower temps on it by getting more powerful fans and improving cable management.Have written software to control the fans and clock on it from a Web UI, but I have had no luck getting it to overclock to the supposed 1386MHz, nor have I had any luck clocking down the VRAM. Perhaps that is the curse of using Linux, but I USUALLY use it just to run many screens, so I don't particularly NEED to OC the GPU clock. Would be nice if the VRAM clock rate could stay down, though, to save power -- the issue I've had with that is that it keeps going back up to 2000MHz right after I write to the /sys/ driver file; screens flicker as it clocks the VRAM down, but then it goes right back up. IDK if such an issue exists on other 580s, so I can't rate that down, b/c it might not have anything to do with XFX.---------ORIGINAL REVIEW:So far, seems to be working quite well. I am currently using it with 3 displays (2x 1080p monitors and 1x 1680x1050 TV -- aspect ratio sucks on the TV and can't display 1080p w/o part of the screen falling off the sides -- not the card's fault; it does that on whatever it's connected to).All of them are connected to the displayport connectors using DP to HDMI cables.Monitoring it from my sensors program, it tends to run (after having warmed up) between 47-50\u00b0C idle, or around 49-52\u00b0 with a YT video playing. Have not actually tried it for gaming or mining yet, though.Pretty much noiseless. My Rasp Pi with coolers is actually louder than this card.Do, however, recommend that your case be designed with airflow in mind, and maybe get more powerful fans. When I was using a positive-pressure design, the air passing over it and through the holes in the PCIe slots was not enough, and it both idled around 53-55\u00b0C, AND it pushed my CPU temps up by around 5-7\u00b0, as well (CPU is right above it). Changed this, and both cooled down by several degrees.Running it with Debian GNU+Linux, and as long as you have the amdgpu driver installed, it seems to have no issues. Sadly, have not found any software to control its clocks or fans through GNU+Linux, though.NOTE: It's important to know that it actually registers as an RX 470/480. I talked with someone about this, and it's because it uses the same Polaris chips, just clocked up and updated.Couple little glitches that sorta irk me, but not enough to bring down score:1) Sometimes, it produces a low screeching-like noise on startup for each monitor. Probably a signal transfer thing. Weird, only happens sometimes, a little annoying, scared me a bit at first.2) It also causes my BIOS screen to flicker several times after POSTing and before the bootloader runs. Also freaked me out the first couple times, but now I'm used to it.Neither of the aforementioned glitches occurred when using my Ryzen 5 2400G iGPU (before purchasing this card), so I think it has something to do with the card itself (could be the wires, though, but I have no other DP devices to test them with). Not major, but things that I paid attention to, nonetheless. As far as I'm aware, if you experience this, it's not an actual issue, just a quirk -- will update on that if I need to, though.",

The card is amazing in performance and can run games like Ark Survival Evolved on epic settings. Although there is a little issue which is the Gpu fans they do not turn on unless under load, this is an easy fix you have to go into the AMD adrenaline software and go into the Gpu tuning section and adjust fan speed. By doing this it keeps the Gpu cooler. It also seems other people had this same issue so I hope this helps someone.",

I purchased the XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition in the following condition:\"Condition: Used - Very Good - Cleaned, Thermal paste freshly re-applied, may have some scratches.\"The GPU was relatively clean, however, the heatsink fins were dust encrusted and there was some pet hairs that collected in the corners of the heatsink. In addition, there was quite a bit of fine dust on the front and back of the GPU card. I would recommend that if you buy this GPU in Used condition, you should examine it carefully and clean it if you find it in similar condition as mine. Keep in mind, this is a used GPU, so you have to expect to find some dust on the card and heatsink - it probably will not have been deep cleaned.",
