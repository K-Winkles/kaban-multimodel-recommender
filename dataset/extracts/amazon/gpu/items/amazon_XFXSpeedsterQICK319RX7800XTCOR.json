I've experienced absolutely zero issues with my RX 7800xt so far, and I couldn't be any happier with it. I play everything on 3440x1440 Ultra settings, with or without FSR/FrameGen.Upon purchasing I received a code to download a FREE copy of Avatar : Frontiers of Pandora.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Big step up from a 1070 - VR and installation tips",
                "reviewText": "It seems like there are very few written reviews for the 7000 series GPUs. Maybe that's normal for AMD. Either way, I want to share some info to make sure others have a smooth experience. I came over from the green team, specifically, an EVGA GTX 1070 SC. That card is getting long in the tooth, doesn't have a lot of the more modern features, and definitely struggled with newer AAA games.Getting right to it, this XFX 7800XT has been doing a great job. I tried Hogwarts Legacy on ultra with raytracing. That was stuttery, so I played around and could get pretty solid performance on high settings. I disabled ray tracing expecting much worse visuals. Honestly, I think RT is overhyped. I'll take all ultra settings with no ray tracing and smooth performance any day. Maybe RT is poorly implemented on Hogwarts? I didn't expect to see things like hanging spoon shadows in shops rendered well, but they were there without RT. The card itself has stayed cool and quiet. I haven't noticed it being any louder the the 1070 it replaced.I promised tips, and I feel these are very important. If you're swapping from nvidia, it's recommended to use DDU - Display Driver Uninstaller. I'll assume you're a Windows user for these tips.-First, make sure to check Windows Update for any system updates. Give the computer a reboot to make sure everything is installed and working before doing driver surgery.-Download DDU (it's free) and the AMD drivers.-Click Start, click the power icon, then hold shift while clicking reboot --> advanced options. Most tutorials show a blue screen with options right after clicking reboot. That must have changed recently because my safe mode options were the first thing I saw after it rebooted.-The goal is to reboot into safe mode *without networking*.-Run DDU to nuke all remnants of nvidia drivers. Make sure to tick the box that will reboot after its done. Windows will reboot, using a generic video driver.-Install the AMD drivers/Adrenaline software-Careful running Windows updates - Microsoft seems to think it knows best and installed a driver over the one I just installed, causing Adrenaline to be missing update buttons. If this happens, open device manager, double click the AMD display driver, go to the Driver tab, roll back driver. Your update buttons in Adrenaline should be back.VR tips (assuming Oculus 2 using AirLink)-Firstly, you may want to just use Virtual Desktop Streamer. In some (probably most) cases it's better than Air Link. I read that Virtual Desktop keeps GPU power draw up when not in use, so you might want to close that when done.-For Air Link, I experienced weird warping or distortion. The Oculus Debug tool can fix this (or did for me). Even with these steps, the Oculus software will complain that you're using an unsupported GPU - ignore the warning.-Find the Oculus Debug Tool - by default it is in C:\\Program Files\\Oculus\\Support\\oculus-diagnostics-Someone on reddit said warping had something to do with needing an Encode Resolution Width that is a multiple of 64. The value they cited (and I used) is 3712.-While you're in the debug tool, set video codec to H.265 - this helped with color banding in Beat Saber.-Click into another field in the debug tool for the tool to save what you entered. If you just enter the text and close, it won't save.TADA! You should be up and running! I've only had the card for a week or so, but after getting these things ironed out in day one, it's not been a problem at all. Even streaming to my Steam Deck in the living room via Moonlight/Sunshine has been 100% fine. I don't usually write reviews, but I'm rooting for AMD (even if they're *still* a bit over priced). I also hope these troubleshooting steps being in one place might help another person. If I notice anything horrible with the experience in the coming months, I'll post an update.",

But if you\u2019ve already installed the card and can\u2019t access the switch, don\u2019t worry. There is no performance difference between them.Main gripe is that the fans are a bit loud, but that\u2019s been my experience with all XFX cards.",

Tenia mis dudas para adquirirla por la fama de los drivers de AMD, pero ahora que veo como funciona la tarjeta y los drivers, me doy cuenta que la gente tiende a exagerar. Esta marca XFX no es muy comercial en mi pa\u00eds por lo que generaba tambi\u00e9n algunas dudas, pero me ha sorprendido lo bien la hechura. La recomiendo 100%.Excelente vendedor, la tarjeta llego antes de lo programado por Amazon.",
