My concern was heat, loudness under operation,cuda core count and total VRAM size for doing computational fluid dynamics using Lightwave3d and TurbulenceFD. More ram is critical in those situations and even though its a 128bit memory bus, it was a very affordable, much needed upgrade from my GTX 1080Ti.I have zero complaints about this card.",
