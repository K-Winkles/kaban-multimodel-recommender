I suspected a power supply problem but needed to make sure it wasn't the BIOS since I've seen these issues before. After about 10 minutes of research I found to disable UEFI Secure Boot. It booted after the change was saved. Also, I have Ubuntu Linux. I didn't even need to install drivers. It worked right out of the box which almost never happens. I'm so happy I didn't waste time introducing new hardware. The machine has a tiny footprint. It fit fine where other graphic cards didn't fit. Glad I gave it a try",

Worked at first startup after installing but on a basic Windows driver at a lower resolution. Very easy to go onto the website and update the driver, and within a few minutes it was working with all the features and at optimal resolution.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the 1G model of this video card.My computer is old. It's a Lenovo M93p small form factor machine that I bought reconditioned several years ago, and when the Lenovo web site detected it, it told me that the warranty started in 2014, so the machine is now 9 years old. I'm frugal, though, and I try to squeeze all the use I can out of my things.I recently bought a new 29-inch wide monitor. The monitor only has HDMI inputs. My computer only had display port and VGA outputs for video. So for a short time, I had to use a VGA to HDMI adapter to use this new monitor. Using the adapter, my alternatives for my screen were a resolution that filled the entire monitor but with distortion, or a resolution that did not distort but left black \"sidebars.\" I needed a new video card with an HDMI port to make good use of my new monitor.I looked online at video cards and saw that for most of them, a power supply of 300 watts or more is recommended. I found that the power supply for my computer only puts out 240 watts, and apparently replacement power supplies for my small form factor computer are not available, or would be too complicated for me to install.There are people on YouTube who have used higher powered video cards in the very same model of computer that I have, with the original power supply, to turn them into gaming machines, believe it or not, but I didn't need anything like that. I am grateful to those YouTubers, though, because that's how I learned to open my computer case to install the video card.The hardest part of the installation of this card was replacing the long metal slot-cover that is for full size computer towers with the included slot cover that is for small form factor cases. It's tricky to get the tiny screws back into place. You will need a very small Philips screwdriver.I'm happy to report that this new video card with its HDMI outputs allows me to use all the \"real estate\" of my 29-inch wide monitor and at the proper resolution. Windows 10 recognized it right away.I do notice a little bit of fan noise. Overall, though, I'm satisfied.",
