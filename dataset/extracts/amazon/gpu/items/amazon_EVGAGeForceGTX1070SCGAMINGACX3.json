                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Card without breaking the bank",
                "reviewText": "This card is crazy good. An excellent price point with excellent performance. This card handles all current titles with reasonable frame rates 30+. While it may not provide the crushing performance of the 1080, it gets the job done without totally blowing the budget, maybe just a little stretch.If you have the money, the 1080 is a much better card and will run games faster, farther into the future than the 1080. Also if you already own a 980 TI, R9 295X2, R9 Fury X, or better, the 1070 will not be an upgrade and you should consider the 1080.http://amzn.to/2upKr7UI purchased the FTW with 1797 clock, the 08G-P4-6276-KR version. EVGA makes several versions of this card and it can be difficult to determine what the difference between them is. I will try to do so here.GlossaryBlower Cooling - Cooling that uses a blower style cooler and heatsink. Economical design.ACX3.0 Cooling - Advanced cooling system using variable speed fans and heatsinks. Good design.iCX Cooling - Evolution of ACX3.0 including additional thermal sensors and technology. Best fan and heatsink designHybrid Cooling - Closed loop water cooling that requires mounting a radiator on the back of the case. Very effective coolingBackplate - A metal sheet that is placed over the back of the card further protecting the electronics, and improving heat handling capabilities.RGB LED - An LED that can change color programmatically to any color. Easily match the color of other items inside your case to maximize flexibility in design.10 Phase Power - An enhanced power supply design that will deliver more consistent power to the graphics processor to insure reliable operation. More phases means cleaner power, and greater power capacity. The other design is a 4 phase design.8 pin connector - Add in graphics cards need additional power provided to them. This is typically done with an 8 pin connector from the power supply. Some older cards used 6 pin connectors, so some power supplies provide 6+2 connectors, while others provide 8 pin connectors. You need to make sure that you have the proper number of 8 pin connectors (or 6+2) or you will not be able to power your graphics card and it will not work. A 6 pin connector will not work, it does not supply enough power, or fit for that matter. If you do not have either 8 pin or 6+2 pin connectors available, you will need to upgrade your power supply. This is common in older computers, as well as name brand computers from Dell and HP. The power supplies were not designed for high power add in cards.08G-P4-5170 1683 MHz boost with blower cooling, requires only a single 8pin connector and draws 150W, no backplate (Blower)http://amzn.to/2v2fkms08G-P4-5171 1683 MHz boost but adds ACX3.0 advanced cooling requires one 8-pin and draws 150W, no backplate (uncommon model)http://amzn.to/2hsIA1408G-P4-6170 1683 MHz boost with blower cooling one 8pin 150W White LED, adds backplate (Founders Edition)http://amzn.to/2v3WauV08G-P4-6171 1683 MHz boost ACX3.0 cooling one 8pin 150W adds White LED (REF)http://amzn.to/2vnJPV908G-P4-6571 1683 MHz boost iCX cooling and thermal modules single 8pin 150W White LED (Not on Amazon)08G-P4-5173 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) ACX3 cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED, no backplate (SC Black)http://amzn.to/2v2iDKF08G-P4-6173 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) ACX3 cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (SC)http://amzn.to/2v2t3tm08G-P4-6178 1784 MHz boost Hybrid cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (HYBRID)http://amzn.to/2vnDrNt08G-P4-6573 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) iCX cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (SC2)http://amzn.to/2v2oOhN08G-P4-6274 1683 MHz boost ACX3 cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, Enhanced 10 Phase Power Supply for overclocking (FTW 1683)http://amzn.to/2v2G0DF08G-P4-6276 1797 MHz boost super clocked ACX3 cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW 1797) (The card I purchased)http://amzn.to/2v2pDHp08G-P4-6278 1797 MHz boost super clocked Hybrid cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW HYBRID 1797)http://amzn.to/2v45O0t08G-P4-6674 1683 MHz boost iCX cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (Not on Amazon)08G-P4-6676 1797 MHz boost super clocked iCX cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW2 1797)http://amzn.to/2upMLMpI chose the model I did, because it had ACX cooling, and the 1797 clock with the 10 phase power and RGB LED. The more expensive cards offered very little benefit.If the 1070 is just too much of as stretch for the budget consider the 1060 at 6GB (not enough savings to go to 3GB). Be aware that the 1060 is comparable to the 970, 708 or Titan. It is also comparable to the Radeon RX580/570/480/470, R9 390/290 or Intel HD7990. If you own one of those it will not be an upgrade.http://amzn.to/2vyqP6KIf the budget is really tight you should look at the 1050. Be aware that the 1050 is on par with the 950, 760 or 660 Ti. It is also comparable to the Rx460, R7-370, R9-270 or Intel Hd 7870. This card will not be an upgrade if you have one of those or better.http://amzn.to/2v4S4CO",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE now over 2 years later (oct 2020) this card still works perfectly. I have it in one of my secondary computers now which I am giving to my nephew. It still can run new games in 1080p at high to ultra settings. I have a 2080ti in my main computer now, but if you can wait for the RTX 3080 to be more available, do it because it retails for 700 and is way better than the 2080ti. But if you are cool with 1080p, you can still stick with this GTX1070 for a while.UPDATE (Sept 2021) Nephew still has this card in the computer I built for him. Still works great. He is using a 1080p monitor/tv and gets 60fps on most new titles just fine. If he had a higher refresh rate he could be getting more but tv is limited to 60fps with hdmi input from PC for his model. This card is a workhorse. I built one for my niece in 2017 with the same card but used and that PC is still working well too. They both have Ryzen CPUs (R7 2700, and R5 2500) at least 16 GB of DDR4 RAM 3000, and nvme hard drives. So as long as you have decent components like that this PC set up would still work for modern casual gamers.I spend a lot of time building/fixing desktop PCs. I have several I have built that I use at home, and at work. It has been a hobby since about 1994. I used to surrender to the urge of getting the very best component you could possibly get when building a PC or whatever electronic system. And if that is what you want, there is nothing wrong with that. But in the last few years, I have made it a goal to make the best desktop PCs for workstation, and gaming at the lowest possible price. This card is amazing for how cheap it is (yes 380 dollars plus tax is cheap). I spent $400 on a card back in 2006/2007 just on the cusp of AGP going out and PCI-E coming in, and that wasn't even as much as I could have spent back then.The processor in the card is pretty decent. It can run the best games at high graphics (and with 8gb of ram it has no issues there). Where you may run into trouble is if you want to play the latest game at high frame rates on ultra graphics... say you have a 144hz 1440p monitor and want to sync the FPS with the refresh rate... I don't think that will happen for you at that high of a refresh... so if ultra frames are important to you (if you are a competitive gamer playing in tournaments or even just for fun against others) that may be more important to you... but for most gamers I do not believe it is.In this range of cards, the 1070 is in a sweet spot. So unless you plan on spending 1000 or more, this card is the best for the price in this range.",

                "reviewTitle": "A good card, with almost no downsides",
                "reviewText": "This card provides a good chunk of the performance of the GTX1080 when overclocked. The slower memory is the only thing that really holds it back, but for the games I'm playing it's not overly relevant (no FPS games). I'm getting boot speeds out of the box that are over 2000Mhz. I've seen some comments that the card runs hot, but in reality the card is not. In fact runs reasonably cool, more so after you setup a custom fan curve. By default the fans will stay off below 60c, but that just creates needless heat build up in your case. Running the fans at 5-10% minimum is still silent, and keeps the card at 40c idle.Pros:- Great performance with every game I play at 1440p- The card is modestly sized, not a big deal because I have a big case, but for someone with a smaller mid-tower that could be important- Runs cool with a custom fan curve, hardly ever goes over 65c, even on hot days.- Price (was $515 when I got it)- Not covered with tons of useless RGB LED's.Cons:- Cannot turn off LED's without EVGA software, which you must register on their site to download.- A little on the pricey side (I remember that days when the top of the line GPU's where $500)",

Farei l'applicazione nel caso avessi bisogno di OC esagerati (che portano solo a spremere la GPU per miseri incrementi di prestazioni).Con il casino dei miners trovarla verso i 300\u20ac adesso \u00e8 impossibile.Tuttavia se avessi i soldi penserei alla recente 1070Ti, con prestazioni simili alla 1080, anche se a quel punto dipende tutto da prezzo.",
