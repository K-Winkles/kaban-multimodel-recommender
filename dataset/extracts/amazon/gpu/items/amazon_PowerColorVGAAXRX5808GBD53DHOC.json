This card was advertised as \"refurbished\" so I was somewhat cautious and didn't know for sure what to expect.Card arrived a day earlier than expected and upon opening the Amazon packaging I found the Power Color box to still be in it's original shrink-wrap, unopened. I was very happy to see that. Everything inside the box confirmed that it had never been opening. I got a new GPU for the price of a refurbished one, nice!I paired this Power Color RX580 Red Devil GPU with a Ryzen-5 2600 CPU and ASUS B350-F Gaming motherboard, along with a 500GB SSD for the boot drive and a 2TB HDD for storage. All was placed in a NZXT H500i case with white power cable extensions and a Rosewill Photon 650 80+ Gold PSU.Works wonderfully! Not overclocking the GPU or CPU because I want it to be 100% stable for her. She plays WOW and SWTOR with my son and she couldn't be happier with the build. Will have no hesitation to order from StallionTek again.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box, this card was working perfectly fine, but after installing it in my PC less than 5 hours ago, I started to get really random artifacting in certain games(Vermintide 2 and GTA V) where if I tried minimizing the game and reopening the tab, the entire monitor screen would basically look like a kaleidoscope of artifacts and odd colors. Keep in mind, the card was working fine all day, UNTIL, I overclocked it from stock 1380Mhz Core to 1400Mhz and the memory from 2000Mhz to 2050Mhz and had the BIOs switched obviously selected to \"OC\" mode on the card itself. As of this exact moment, I currently have the BIOS switch set to \"SILENT\" mode and all the clock speeds are set to stock. I'm gonna run some more tests to see if it was just my overclock but I'm unfortunately expecting and dreading the worse, that the card itself is screwed, because never in my life have I ever seen a card artifact so badly from a +20 and +50 overclock offset. I am giving this card 3 stars, primarily because when it works, it works extremely well, but also because I'm not entirely sure how stable my particular card is or how much longer its gonna even last in my system. I just hope customer support takes pity on me and makes the RMA process nice and smooth if/when I inevitably have to return it.",
