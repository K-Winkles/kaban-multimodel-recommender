                "reviewText": "After having a 1650 for a couple of years, I really wanted something a little more powerful to be able to properly run, stream and play big open world games that have a lot of resources in them. Well, I can say after testing out Ark Survival, Palworld, Minecraft and others with the 2060, it does the job! The graphics don\u2019t lie here. I was able to play games smoothly on the highest graphic settings. I got no lags nor frame drops.Now, here\u2019s the thing. I was a little worried at first that I wouldn\u2019t be able play with this card, because of the 8 pin connector that is needed to be installed into it. However, you don\u2019t exactly need the 8 pin. You actually can just use a 6 pin and then easily squeeze a 2 pin making it 8. It\u2019ll still work that way. Your power supply should definitely have both the 6 pin and 2 pin. If not, then you would have to buy an 8 pin connector or simply buy a new power supply. Plus, this card isn\u2019t that expensive or at least it\u2019s not in my budget, but if you\u2019re considering on wanting to move up from the 1000s, get into streaming or playing in much better quality, then the 2060 I highly recommend. Of course we will have different PCs. Therefore, it really depends on what kind of graphics card your PC can take or not.",

The fans work well and make little noise. The inside of my case stay cooler than the house. No lights which is a plus for me because im not trying to stare at my card. Im trying to stare at my tv to see what the card is making. It automatically installed drivers and set itself up for my tv. Full auto-graphics recognition on newer games. Downside: It is huge, as large as a size 11 mens sneaker. It blocks 2 slots on the board. Requires external power from PCI/E power. Thats pretty normal nowadays though so have at it!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the RX 580 8GB graphics card for a while now, and I couldn't be happier with it. This card is an absolute powerhouse. What's even more impressive is the affordability. I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the price. It's a budget-friendly choice that doesn't compromise on performance.Reliability is a big deal for me. It runs smoothly during long sessions, and I've not had any overheating issues or crashes. The cooling system keeps the card at a comfortable temperature, and it's surprisingly quiet.This card's versatility is another highlight. It's not just for gaming; it handles content creation tasks like video editing and 3D rendering like a pro.In a nutshell, the RX 580 8GB graphics card is an absolute joy. It's affordable, powerful, reliable, and versatile. As a happy user, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional productivity experience without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "This card was used to upgrade an older ASUS gaming pc, removed the old OEM card,, and did not need the OEM bracket. Plugged this card in, tightened 2 screws, plugged in the power cable and BAM - was running in no time. The PC goes through a self update - taks a few min, and then its set. (Coudl be unique to ASUS) but no issues at all. Games and editing were fast! Definitely worth buying!!!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. i grabbed this after my DELL 990 SFF w/ a r260 card was USELESS too try and play BFV, OR BF1.. tHIS GOT ME UP AND PALYING, I let this hang outside the case, grabbed a PCI extension cable, 500W atx PSU, (LEFT IT OUT OOF THE CASE) and a used intel i7-2600k or w.e.. all in i think for 168$ I got a older Dell too now play games I played on PS3... AND i can surf web etc..I just got into building PCs... And i figured outquick that trying too build a SFF gaming rig CAN BE DONE.. But for now, im just using a full size case, after i built the dell.. I used this GPU, THE 35$ MBOARD, 13$ rgb fan, 35$ PSU, ram from the 16gb DELL, and HDD & SDD...Threw in a fullsize case i found in junk pile (AFTER I CLEANED IT UP) grabbed a 13$ amazon special LGA115# AIR COOLER (THE WHITE ONE THAT STICKS OUT THE SIDE, 6X COOLER PIPES? IDFK.. And another cpl cheap fans, IDK, it saty down in the 90'* so guess they work also...Used a old car alarm LED & MINI DPDT ON-OFF-ON toggle for the power on, and POWER/HDD lights..And hey, IT WORKS!.. the #idgafgamepc AINT PRETTY. But man its alot faster, easier too work on then a SFF dell..I can play BF1-BFV with like hardly any interruptions. My brother says its plays as good as his $ALIENWARE used gaming laptop.. idk.. lolBut really happy with this GPU.. I AM NO PC GURU.. did not try overclock it.. BUT i didn't have too.. I just tuned the fan too come on sooner, adjusted the power use (it works fine with AMD ADRENALINE software) and at pretty much stock settings with all the other cheap AMAZON COMPONENTS, except for CPU AND RAM) BUT.... I can play BFV pretty well.. think i had it set on 1280../720, and all graphics at low, filters off etc.. On medium/auto? it still works decent too.. But its best at low settings, Im perfectly happy way it plays and looks on low settings.. oh yea, It brought my PC BENCHMARK SCORE UP FROM A \"LOG (R270) -UP TOO A SAILBOAT\".... and for now, im gonna run it, while i search for my next plans and pc parts too build..the MB i used..https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBMFSWY9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI noticed it this GPU Def likes a better PSU, and CPU, And a open case too keep it cool.. that goes without saying for PC.s again, im a newb.. but not too building hardware and stuff.. And this thing has been running, nonstop for like 2 months now.. No problems.. I just made sure too add a case fan in back, too get heat in-out, then i added another, smaller 40mm? fan out of a dell on the front of my case also..The fan on the GPU is a little loud, when gaming, But honestly i dot mind louder fans on a PC.. and thats why i got goo soundbar.. Usually keep desktop away from screen anyway..IMHO.. Dont wast you time with othe GPU's, especially thos BS little 50-70$ ones.. Just grab something like this.. Its not the best.. But its awesome if your at a 100$ budget for a GPU.. and if you just wanta hookup, and start gaming, It will.. Im happy.",

I will also note the first card that worked came with the back plate screws lose and almost unscrewed. I had to tighten them to keep the back plate from raddling when the fans spun up. Over all its hit or miss with this card.",
