                "reviewText": "NOTE: I downloaded the Windows drivers, but the installer kept complaining about an unsupported OS. I was installing on Windows 11 Home, which is on the list of supported operating systems. In this case, Windows detected the video card and installed the nVidia app without my intervention. I suspect, based on this, that Windows 10 will behave the same way.I do contract IT work, and one of my clients bought a new desktop with monitor. Client had three 32\" TVs already wall-mounted. Client wanted to have stock market info on the wall-mounted TVs. I'd never done that kind of setup before, so I took a chance on this card. It worked perfectly on the Win11 desktop - Windows installed the driver automagically and I was able to easily extend the desktop across all four monitors/TVs.Give this card a chance - it's an excellent deal for the money.",

I only needed to use the Windows 10 Monitor configuration window. Also, no problems with \"active vs non-active HDMI cables when using HDMI-to-Mini-Display Port cables. FINALLY!!! someone has made a reasonably priced 6-monitor PCIEX16 card that works without headaches!!! BRAVO!",
