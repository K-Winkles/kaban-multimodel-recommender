It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.",

The fan pushes on the WiFi adapter in the PCIe slot next to it, bending both cards away from each other. As it doesn't interfere with the heat sink side of the WiFi adapter, and the fan on the video card may cool the WiFi a bit, I'll see how it goes, but I'm not happy about the fit. I can see why the width isn't given.It's a full height card and won't fit into any SFF cases,It appeared to run at 100% of the video settings from the old GTForce 710 NVidia card that it replaced. I installed the Gigabyte drivers and Adrus Engine anyway and accepted the defaults.In HWMonitor I can now watch the GPU fan RPM that I couldn't do on the old card.4 stars - plays videos OK but not for gaming and a bit wide.",

I wasn't able to restore old version since I needed to erase all info and My project was almost done.I got this card and I installed it myself (never done that). It was easyWorks perfectly. But I can notice a little bit of issues while opening 2 videos on HD or 4K, my mother board didn't have issues at all. But I can use Davinci so I'm okay with that",

We are not tech savvy by any means and this took us less then 10 mins to install. At first the computer said it was not compatible with the graphics card but that was a simple fix when I learned I needed to run an hdmi from the new card to my monitor.",

I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.",
