It really solved a problem for me where I had a couple of extra GPUs to run in my mining rig, and it did exactly what I need it to do. Excellent product! Highly recommend it to anyone need to add more GPUs to a mining rig when you don't have a enough PCIe slots on the motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this riser for a small mining rig, specifically outfitted onto a 3070. I understand that some cheaper risers have had instances of burning, it hasn\u2019t happened yet. The board is sturdy with very little flex and can maintain the weight of the GPU without difficulty, although I wouldn\u2019t recommend holding it up for long periods of time without stabilizing the GPU. In general with all risers, I would strongly suggest that you avoid using the SATA to 6 pin adapter and use a 6 pin pcie adapter to power the board - SATA power can often be risky to both the card and board.",
