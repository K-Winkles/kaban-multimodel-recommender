                "reviewText": "I purchased a Maxsun RX 580 8GB 2048SP to test and review.In regards to connectivity, Maxsun\u2019s RX 580 2048SP has three DisplayPorts, an HDMI port, and a VGA plugin. This allows users to easily connect multiple monitors at high refresh rates.Not to be confused with the standard RX 580 8GB, the 2048SP model has fewer shading units and a lower GPU clock, putting it slightly below the standard 580 8G in performance.This AIB features a dual-fan cooler that\u2019s largely made of plastic and feels very cheap. That\u2019s par for the course when buying a graphics cards of this caliber, and doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a bad buy.During testing, the cooler actually performed rather well. At stock settings, the GPU rarely exceeded 65 degrees, even when running at maximum load for extended periods of time.In titles such as Fortnite, VALORANT, and CS:GO it can easily handle 144FPS gaming, and it\u2019s not bad for 60FPS in many AAA games, especially if you dial down the graphics a little bit. All things considered, for the cost, Maxsun\u2019s RX 580 2048SP isn\u2019t a bad choice if you\u2019re looking to put a solid GPU in your budget gaming PC.",

I had Grand Theft Auto V working very well although I had to reduce the graphics quality to medium to make it work right.",

I bit the dust and bought the card anyway as vanilla visa cards are now blocked by Amazon's competitors so I couldn't get a used GPU for cheap. The price is a bit higher compared to the Chinese platform market, but regardless, this card does the job at a good brand new price. Wish they had the option to ship the GPU in a box.... And yes it comes up as a legit RX580 8gig",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've been using this GPU for about a few weeks now and so far, it's working very well. I'm getting over 100 FPS in games like Fortnite, apex legends, and Valorant. Furmark gave it a score of 4283. Keep in mind this is a 1080p card so it will struggle at 1440p or 4K gaming. Definitely would recommend as a budget card on a mid to low end gaming setup. Also make sure to keep in mind this is a 2048SP version so it has less stream processors than the original RX 580 so the performance won't be as good, but it can still handle most games.",

                "reviewTitle": "RX580 8 GB + FX8000 series CPU",
                "reviewText": "I just bought this card for my old AMD FX build to extend its life. I own some of the more recent versions of the builds like one based on 3900 series (3900X) and another on 5900 series (5950X) and I use both AMD and NVidia cards. What I am frustrated about is that something like AMD FX still has plenty of power and potential in it; it's 8 core CPU with still OK cache. I never had issues playing games or developing software or even virtualizing with it. Lately I am disappointed with Windows, let's face it - after Windows 7 all the other versions ended up being complete crap! Windows 11 now requires TPM module, my Asus TUF 990FX R2.0 has the slot of it but I don't want to order that card. I just figured I'd put Linux Mint Debian Edition on it instead of Windows. System has 32 gigs of RAM and I also setup 4 TB RAID 5 and put SSD as a main drive. This computer flies! now! It boots up super quickly, entire Linux Mint install is clean and it only took me 1 day to load all of my additional software on it like JetBrains IDEs - full pack, Steam, Games, etc... I had HD7950 in it at first with 3 gigs of VRAM but it was obviously not enough to use PROTON for my type of games. So I ordered this card. RX580 I think is like the last card you can probably load into system such as mine with 8 gigs of VRAM but it's worth it for the price that seller offers it for! I just got my card today and I already installed it and the first thing I did is I ran Steam and PROTON layer to test how it all worked. With 7950 I did not have enough VRAM to run games but with 8 Gigs of VRAM now I do! This RX580 is relatively compact in comparison to the one I loaded into my wife's PC. Aorus RX580 is much bigger than this card, also the voltage connector on this card is the 6 pin one and not 8 so just another awesome addition I think. First thing I checked is Battlezone 98 Redux and Battlezone II and guys these Windows games ran just friggin fine on full settings with PROTON layer on Mint! in fact, I think they looks even prettier on Linux than on WIndows! I have them on both types of machines but they look great on Linux! Huge thanks to Valve and Steam and Mint team for developing such an outstanding software! Love you guys, you all made my day! Before I move on to things like FarCry 5 and 6 I am loading FarCry 3 right now which is about 11 gigs of download from Steam. I can't wait to see what this card would do and how it'll handle it! So far, I believe, I've made the right choice here by purchasing this GPU from this vendor. If you want freedom from Windows OS and don't want to spend an arm and the leg on the GPU (I did that I got my 3090 during COVID times because I really needed that type of GPU for work but the price was C.R.A.Z.Y! No GPU should EVER cost that much money because guess what?! 6 Months later, not even that, it'll be obsolete or not current. I'm also avoiding 4000 series from NVidia because they are not well designed.) anyway, where was I; and you want to play relatively new games and you need to make sure that you have at least 8 GB VRAM this is the GPU that you would want! This seller delivered the card on time and so far with no issues. My only note was that I did not notice any protective tape on the GPU box itself so I was not sure if it was a brand new card. Only protective tape I found was inside the box on the bag that was housing the card itself. It seemed that all looked new but I can't ever tell. Either way I have a GPU that works with 8 GB of VRAM and it was delivered to me quickly. I'd buy this again from the same seller. If I'll have any issues in the future I'll post additional notes but so far everything is looking well and good! If you are in the same situation where you just don't want to throw your old, still capable system out and want to repurpose it then this GPU might be for you and, honestly, you should see how quick the system is running Mint and games play well too with high settings! I do development and .NET 8 and Python and lots of other stuff and all works well! I'll be testing more games on this system later but the product was made for this type of situation! Very happy with my purchase and service provided by this seller!",
