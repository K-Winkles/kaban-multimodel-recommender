                "reviewText": "I spent 85$ on this GPU and for the price it runs pretty well! I used it to build a cheap LAN PC so I could bring it to friend's houses for gaming sessions.(Don't forget to DL Drivers from AMD, and turn off the Zero DB fan option in the AMD driver suite, keeping the fans running keeps the card cooler from the get go)Pros -beefy cooling system - with the right fan curves, my sample stayed around 48-54C under load. I have had other rx580 2048SP models that regularly heat right up to 60-65C under load with fan curves.Easy setup - downloaded drivers from AMD's website, and was right to work testing games.Size - at 235mm it will fit most builds easily!Cons - noise - the fans are a little loud on my sample, not a big deal because I wear headphones, but just a heads upNonstandard power plug - this GPU, like many other rx 580's comes with a gaudy black and yellow power adapter that you have to plug in to your pcie power cables and the run to the card, really wish that wasn't the case.Legacy Driver support - recently the 580 series cards are being fast tracked to legacy driver support, these cards are still great budget cards, but you might not have day one support for newly released games.Benchmarks - This GPU isn't gonna win any rewards, but if you're just looking for a GPU to get you into gaming, this is a great starter! The build specs are; I3 10305, 16gb ram, and Surallow rx580 2048sp, a great snapshot for a low end system.Genshin Impact: 1080p medium graphics, 1.0 render setting 60 FPS avg 54fps 1% low (this was testing in fontaine, which is harder graphically than other regions)Fortnite: 1080p medium graphics, TSR medium, 100% render res, epic view distance, with reflections off but global illumination on. 60-70 avg 50Fps 1% lowHorizon Zero Dawn - 1080p original graphics 50-55 Fps avg 48 fps 1% lowWar Thunder - 1080p high graphics 60-65 fps avg 52 Fps 1% lowHalo MCC(tested in Reach) - 1080p enhanced graphics 60-68 Fps avg 54 Fps 1% lowConclusion - The Surallow RX 580 2048SP is a solid performer amongst other RX 580 2048SP cards on the market, and would make a solid starter or budget option for a GPU. Don't expect to get insane performance from the card, but for the price(85$), it really does hold it's own, and well I'd 100% take it over onboard graphics anyday.",

Used the AMD utility to look at the RAM utilization, GPU temp etc. Temp was between 45 and 50 C idling.Uninstalled the AMD driver and it it install the Micro Soft AMD driver. It will only display one screenAt this time I can't recommend buying this device based on my experience.I was expecting great things! What I got was an unusable GPU with no support.Returning this and will replace it with a better brand that has support.",
