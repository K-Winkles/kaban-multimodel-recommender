                "reviewText": "If you're spending the extra coin on water cooling a GPU especially with the shortage pricing, you want extra thermal headroom and no noise.Out of the box the water block's contact with the GPU die was poor enough to warrant immediately repasting it before putting it under load. This fixed that issue, but come on now...Far worse is the coil whine I discovered when load testing. It is absolutely insufferable. My case is modified pretty heavily to deal with fan/pump noise, but when the card is under load the coil whine is so loud I can sometimes hear it though headphones. None of the usual tricks- overclocking, undervolting, or swapping the PSU out helped. Changing the frame rate just changes the pitch of the whine- at low FPS it sounds like an ignition click and at very high FPS (e.g. on really old games) it's a high-pitched squeal. It has not gone away after a month of regular use. With a freesync panel the pitch changes with the frame rate. It gets real annoying real fast.Unfortunately I didn't get all my parts in until Amazon's return window closed on this so I didn't discover this issue timely. If I could have I would have returned it here rather than be stuck trying my luck (and my patience) with GB.This is absolutely unacceptable at any price point, but especially sucks given how expensive this thing was. At this point, it's either bite the bullet, try risky surgery, or cut my losses on fleabay and get another brand of card.With the repaste the thing performs fine, but the coil whine just ruins the mood.Oh... and just to add a little insult to injury, they included a little mascot figurine in the box. Cute, but that money would have been better spent on QC.Learn from my mistake, and load test your card before the Amazon return window closes.",

Beyond that - the GPU has 3 power connectors, and ALL have to be connected to the PSU via *separate* cables. Otherwise, there will be no video output. Not realizing that had me running around in circles, sending it to Gigabyte for warranty repair... I even considered returning the GPU. But, once mated to a compatible AIO and plugging in all the connectors - there's no problems, I'm drooling over the card's potential. I have seen info online that top-end cards run hot and loud, and that liquid-cooled units get better cooling (and are thus less prone to failure) than fan-cooled cards.",

New Egg has it for 1799 which is prob best price your going to get. With all other components you need it comes out cheaper than the Liquid Devil.So if you want the best premium card for your money 6900xt Reference @$999, If you got extra and want a cool waterblock then this @$1599 is preem.Screw the Scalpers and screw the Resellers like NewEgg, MicroCenter, BestBuy, Amazon and everywhere else. The only MArket for GPU's is msrp thats it. But unfortunately thanks to stupid consumers the next Gen of GPU's will have a new msrp bar set and thats all our faults for empowering these Morons.Save your money and wait for next gen also dont be a moron and use bots to try and get your own you just add to the crashing of these sites.And dont buy any used GPU's let them choke on their cards",

                "reviewText": "Package arrived on time. The card itself and packaging were fine.Installed the card, leak tested the fittings while unplugged, made sure all the power connectors were installed properly. This card requires 4x8 pin connectors. They must be separate power cables. I made sure of this. I followed the directions carefully.After powering it on, the card flashed red and the power connectors flashed white. There was no display. Clearly something was wrong. Started to troubleshoot the issue. I have a 1000W corsair psu which is more than sufficient. Messed around with the fittings to ensure the leak sensor wasn't being triggered. Still couldn't resolve the issue. I checked my RAM, MOBO, NVME, plugged in another graphics card to ensure it wasn't any of the other system components.I checked Gigabyte's website. They don't even have a user manual which is ridiculous, considering you're spending nearly 2000 dollars. I tried calling their support number, they didn't answer. I would try emailing them, but I shouldn't have to wait 7 business days for a response for buying their flagship AMD card.All in all the experience was awful, Gigabyte support is unresponsive and irresponsible. Amazon support was great in dealing with it. Even if you've built multiple hard tube or soft tube loops before, this card is painful to diagnose issues with and you'll get next to no support. If you need your PC for any crucial tasks, I would avoid this card and get something else otherwise you'll be stuck with a 2000 dollar paper weight after the warranty expires.",
