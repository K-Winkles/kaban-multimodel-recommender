If you are still using VGA, do you really need a discrete video card? Amazon monkeyed around with the price of this, ended up costing me $20 more than it should have, you know one of those one day bumps in price because you looked at it or added it to your card, and then the day after you buy it the price goes back down. I don't like that practice and would have bought local if I had more time. This card offers a great performance boost over the Geforce 1650 card, for not much more money. And one of the few decent performing cards that still has DVI, if that's important to anyone anymore.",

So far with some minor setting adjustments, It has done well with newer games such as Forza Horizon 5, Cyperbunk 2077. Just to name a few. If you are looking for high FPS, this may not be the graphics card for you. You may be able to squeeze a little more than 60FPS. So far it stays cool within 30-58\u00b0C. Also it seems very quiet for the fans, Can\u2019t really hear them over the main Computer fans. (Also I have 6 fans running on my PC case.) Overall satisfied with it.

                "reviewText": "I got this as an upgrade for a 5-6 year old GTX 970. The 970 had served well but was struggling to run modern-ish games and also developed very significant GPU sag. This was on sale for 250$ and I was able snag it immediately. I can run games like Overwatch 2, World of Tanks, Fallout 4, etc on maximum settings at 1k 60 FPS no issues.I'm only giving this a 4 of 5 however because of the fickle fan controller. It's not bad but it's just ... twitchy?This GPU has passive cooling meaning the fans won't turn on until it hits around 55C this usually isn't a problem. If you prioritizing a silent build I wouldn't recommend this card. When the fans are spinning, it's relatively quiet. HOWEVER, the fans will click-clack for a few seconds when the motor kicks on and it gets up to speed. It's not very loud and it's considered \"normal operating behavior\" of the GPU.What's annoying about this is that if you're playing a game and your GPU is bouncing between 54-56C the fans will continuously keep turning on and off. This makes the click-clack of the fan motors constant. Again you probably won't even notice the sound unless you're specifically listening for it. However like said, if you're trying for a silent build then you will probably hear it.",

                "reviewText": "Love that this consumes less power (less heat) and is more powerful than my previous card, in addition to being smaller in the case (helping air flow). This two fan size is 1/3 smaller than my previous three fan card, which I have to imagine helps keep air moving throughout my case to keep things cool.Playing Diablo 2 Resurrected, my suggested graphics settings went from Medium on my 970 to Very High (highest option) with the 1660 Super. I got it for $240, which is easily the best value for an upgrade I have ever done. I debated going to a higher resolution monitor, upgrading my CPU and going with something like a 3070, but that all in cost would be about $1800 when you factor in all the components. Terrible value compared to this little sub $300 upgrade! I'm digging 1080p gaming again (actually for me it's 1920x1200 with my 16:10 monitors).",

                "reviewText": "For people that are like me that (a) don't need to chase the latest and greatest, (b) are budget conscious and (c) needs something that'll satisfy their gaming needs for at least several years, this is a nice middle ground card to get in 2020 and maybe even beyond without having to go into that next step of $500+ cards that will eek out relatively very little extra for the purposes of most people's gaming needs. This card is especially a huge upgrade for me coming from the ol' dependable (Zotac) GTX 970 which has served me well but really didn't mesh with games released in the last 1-2 years or so.I love that this card is very short compared to most GPUs, so you can easily fit it into compact mATX cases or maybe even some (m)ITX cases depending on your case. It also doesn't compromise on cooling either whereas a lot of compact cards do with only one fan - this one has two so it stays plenty cool even under load. Metal backplate as well will help with the heat dissipation - not many cards in this range tends to have the metal plate, most are either just bare or plastic. So another +1 to EVGA for including that.It'll run pretty much any modern game fine on the highest settings at 1080p, and possibly high to ultra at 1440p depending on the game and game settings.EVGA as a company just has a stellar and solid reputation. Not advertising for them, but I have a 5 year old power supply from EVGA as well (Supernova G2 750) that's still running well to this day in my new computer that I carried over from my last build. I can absolutely recommend this EVGA card no problem.",

With Windows 10, there was zero fuss from upgrading from my GTX 770 to this GTX 1660 Super, just swapped them out, and was immediately gaming again.Playing Risk Of Rain 2, highest temp is 63\u00b0C, and the VRAM doesn't even max out with all game settings set to ultra.
