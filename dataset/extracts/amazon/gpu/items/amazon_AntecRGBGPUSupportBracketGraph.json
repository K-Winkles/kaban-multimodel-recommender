                "reviewText": "I hardly write a review, but I had to on this product. A couple of weeks ago, my machine started to all of a sudden power off during boot up. I thought it was my power supply giving up on me, however being a 4-year-old machine, decided to change it. My PC worked, and a couple of days later did the same. Powers on and about 2\u20133 seconds turns off. So, it was time to take parts one by one to determine which one was the culprit. Starting with the graphics card, I pulled it out, and my device booted perfectly. I was oh gosh - please not my 3070TI going bad, :( I reinsert my graphics card and my PC worked again. I was alright, it's not my 3070ti! But then 2 days later back again not booting, :( I remember reading an article in Tom's hardware that if you don't support the heavier cards properly they will begin over time to bend the PCI connector down. Well, that was my case. I started by lifting it up with a piece of foam and notice, I didn't have any more boot problems. I could have left it with the foam, but the aesthetics of my computer look bad with a piece of foam. Let me tell you my friends, this GPU holster is top quality and easy to install. You can daisy-chain it with your other RGB products and it looks awesome. No more lousy foam.",

My case the power supply is mounted in the bottom with a shroud hiding the power supply that runs clear across the bottom of the case . That means My motherboard has a floor even with the shroud . So it works well in my case. Some computer cases have about 4 inches between the floor of the case and the motherboard . THAT will NOT work. You will need a taller support bracket , so choose wisely. Fit and Finnish were spot on , supported my 3060TI just fine . Easy to install .",

                "reviewText": "I use a Corasir Obsidian full tower case where I like to have room when rebuilding my system. This GPU support is not tall enough to reach my GPU (ASUS Tuf RTX 3080) without modifications. I was able to re-engineer the parts, remove the top support, and make it just barely tall enough to at least sit beneath one corner of my GPU.Otherwise, the support is precision machined, made of sturdy aluminium, comes with preapplied adhesive on the bottom of the stand, and include extra double-sided adhesives strips.",

                "reviewText": "Installs and works solidly as it should. Have it daisy chained with the case led and then using a 5v rgb header splitter with a lian li fan hub, directly interacts with the motherboard lighting control itself (more specially Gigabyte).Having my video card in a vertical position, it greatly helps reduce the slight sag it had where the vertical bracket ends prematurely. It just didn't look and feel right, and I really just wanted to prevent things from possibly escalating any further.Led-wise, it is very aesthetically pleasing to my eyes. It's a chunk of glass that lights up pretty much. Although if it isn't flush with your video card correctly, your card will simply slip off the small adjustable foot bar it has.The only bad things that I could really mention isn't due to the item itself though, using a Lian Li o11XL, the bottom isn't entirely flat after removing a case fan because you can't exactly fit its magnetic base atop a 120mm fan (or I was too lazy to think of a way). And underneath awaits a cutout base for a fan to give it some space for air i guess but took some finagling to have this item perfectly fit.Unifying led software is a pain, and I cannot place any blame on the item itself. Communicates with no problem to the Gigabyte Fusion software but had to use other software that not only communicates with lian li strimmers, fans, this thing, and razer accessiories, corsair ram, and through trial and error ended up using signal rgb.",
