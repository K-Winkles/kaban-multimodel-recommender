                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.First and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.The fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.One of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.The build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.In terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.One minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.Overall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.I highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product.",
