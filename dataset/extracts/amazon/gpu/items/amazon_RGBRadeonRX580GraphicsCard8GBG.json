Played Prey from Arcane just fine and was without lag. Witcher 3 and Diablo 4 benched over 60fps and clearly if you are playing CS go or an esport you\u2019ll be fine. If you are on a budget and just want to upgrade from your GTX660 2Gb or something before this. Extra vram and the driver support still gives this card legs and viability.",
