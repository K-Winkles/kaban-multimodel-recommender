                "reviewText": "First off, here's some brief context:A brief history of the 2048SP 580 models - AMD released them to Chinese markets, and they're basically an RX 570 with 8GB and negligible chip differences.Brief AMD history on these cards: When it initially came out, the 570 and 580 were negligibly close in performance for the most part, especially in esports titles. They both held up well even through the 5500XT-6500XT eras and against their main rival from NVIDIA the 1060. Only since the 7600/3050 cards were any real improvements offered in this middle area segment.Inside of the box, it comes with the graphics card, a USB stick with driver software, and Molex power connector. It's recommended to just use the VGA/PCIE plug that your power supply comes with, or if your computer did not come with any like a prebuilt might not have then just to purchase a 3rd party one from a reputable cable brand (the ones that do those braided/colored cables are always a safe bet). AMD recommends a 450W PSU, but if you know how to undervolt and have a low powered system then you can get by with less.The card itself works fine, it shifts through a preset of colors and the performance meets expectations. It didn't get too loud for me which is nice. It's also recommended to just use the AMD driver since the software on the USB is outdated. The card size works for mATX sized systems and just fits barely in my case (Fractal Core 1100).So why is this card still good in 2024? Because esports level cards of current generations cost more. The amount of games this can run for the price is pretty insane. On average, the current generation of upgrades costs double the price for less than double the performance. If you're running anything up to 2023, this is a good card to use for 1080p.Why 2023? The only downside to consider in my opinion is that AMD is removing non-security support from it, so future drivers won't optimize the 500 series for newer games anymore. That's perfectly fine for me though and that it still has any driver support at all still is pretty great. I'm very satisfied with the ARDIYES and do recommend it if you fall into any of the categories where this card makes sense for you.",
