                "reviewText": "I started out with a 1050 ti for just basic gaming, then got me a 3060 which could run most games at high settings, but now with the new stuff coming out I wanted to play games that support Raytracing but also having a steady 60fps experience, and so I decided to pull the trigger and get me this 4060 Ti. When compared to the previous generation it really isn\u2019t that BIG of an upgrade because most games out right now don\u2019t even support RTX or NVIDIA DLSS 3.0, but for next gen gaming it handles it pretty good. Graphics wise at least, because performance is just about the same as my previous 3060. Fortnite with Unreal Engine 5 looks ridiculously good with everything on Epic settings I hit about 60 fps with casual drops to 45 or so. The one thing I love about this thing is that despite it having 3 fans, it\u2019s really quiet. I thought it was gonna be louder than my previous one since now it was bigger and had more fans, but if anything it got quieter.Overall I\u2019m happy with it. Could I have waited for the 50 series instead? Yes. But, as new games come out, they all look shiny and pretty but not being able to play them myself would have felt like missing out. If you have the money and just wanna try out newer graphics and dont care about performance ALL that much, then I think this will do great things for you.",

                "reviewText": "I was seriously considering the Gigabyte 3070, but when I came across this and saw that it had slightly better specifications and that it was about $70 cheaper at the time, I decided to go with this, and I couldn't be happier. I can run the newer Call of Duty games with very high (almost highest) graphics settings, and I can run fairly high graphics settings on sim racing games using VR. If you are very serious about playing VR games from a PC with insane graphics settings and could afford to go with a better spec GPU, then I would recommend doing so. However, I'd say that this GPU is more than enough in most circumstances.",

Arrived right on time, and was packaged well to include an anti static bag. As soon as I put this in and I optimized for balanced use, all of my settings were set to max and it handles it without hiccups. I see no reason to buy a 4090ti unless you are doing some major rendering, because for gaming, this card does wonderfully.",
