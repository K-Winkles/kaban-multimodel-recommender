I had a problem with this unit and gave it at bad review. The problem turned out to be a gpu riser cable supplied with a ThermalTake case, that was a PCIe 3.0 protocol. It wouldn't let the system run and dropped it into a perpetual blackhole reboot cycle. My apologies to Gigabyte!",

I don't own it anymore, but when i did it flowered.On 1080p, I could play every game, except for Hitman games with render resolution at 100% instead of 150%, at max graphics with well over 60 fps. And whilst gaming, the gpu NEVER went over 66c!!!It stayed super quiet and looks super good.The only thing is that it is somewhat large, and for the gaming performance, it wasn't worth the 430 dollars with tax. It would have been much better if this was 300 instead of 385",

El renderizado de un v\u00eddeo de 7 minutos con premieres, lo hace en aproximadamente en 1.5 minutos, claro que depende del formato y la resoluci\u00f3n. Con los juegos sin problema entrega 60 fotogramas por segundo (el ojo apenas y logra procesar 24 cuadros por segundo), como se ve en las im\u00e1genes los muestra bien, a mi parecer no se requieren muchos m\u00e1s.",
