                "reviewText": "I bought this graphics card for my older PC, a Dell xps 8930. The original GPU was a Dell OEM GTX 1060. I decided to upgrade it to a modern GPU that can handle more demanding games and after weeks of research I found this card. First I upgraded my PSU to Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Gold.The rtx 4070 ti ventus 2x is very quiet, and fits very well inside my small case. It has added more pressure on my older CPU (i7-8700) and by far that has been the only drawback. It handles 1080 and 1440 games very well (even on my system) and the performance on 4K settings is acceptable (at least for me - for most games that I play fps reaches 50-60 on 4K). The price is a little bit high but I think I can keep it for at least 5 years and use it on a new PC with better air flow and CPU.I have been watching the CPU and GPU temps and I didn't notice any issue with GPU temperature but my CPU needs to throttle under higher pressure. Under regular work load GPU fans aren't even spinning.Overall if you have a smaller case and looking for a high end GPU, this could be your choice, but if you have enough room and air flow , go for a 3 fan model or even rtx 4080/4090.",

Frame generation is a game changer for single player games too. Kind of even makes the RTX 4060 , 4060 ti and 4070/Super cards worth it too if I\u2019m keeping it a buck.",

It was intentionally hobbled by NVidia so not to compete with it's even more expensive brethren, so the bus bandwidth is extremely limited. That being said, performance generally comes close to an older 3080-3090.I also REALLY appreciate the comparatively small size of this card - the 40xx line is known for enormous coolers and high power draw. This card is a relatively small 2-slot, 2-fan model that will fit in many more cases than the rest. But I haven't had any issues with overheating or anything else, which implies to me that most of the larger cards cooling systems are substantially over-engineered...",
