                "reviewText": "I paired this GPU with I5 13400f it absolutely delivers with game performance and value . Honestly I was on a 1400 dollar budget build and this worked flawlessly. I think the think ppl overlook is having to tweak games settings for best appearance and fps .I was looking for GPU around Xmas time which is a terrible ideas fyi . This thingnis absolutely a beast for the money .",

It seems really solid/well-built for what many would consider a 'low-end' card.This Sparkle ARC A310 4GB paired with an older i7-8700K is performing better than expected and runs much cooler/quieter than my previous card(quadro).A quick test encoding a 60-minute 1080p60 movie give the following averages in Handbrake:-450fps with AV1 10-bit at 'fastest' encoder quality setting, 20-30% CPU-226fps with AV1 10-bit at 'slowest' encoder quality setting, 20-30% CPU-450fps with H265/HEVC 10-bit at 'fastest' encoder quality setting, 20-30% CPU-220fps with H265/HEVC 10-bit at 'slowest' encoder quality setting, 20-30% CPU",

                "reviewText": "Ok i know this sounds like an exaggeration but this is the god to honest truth, i bought the sparkle a770 o.c. 16gb edition specifically for converting 2d 4k video into 4k 3d full sbs video. I own an rtx 3070 by nvidia and an rtx 3090. And when it comes to video editing in davinci resolve, the arc a770 by sparkles not only is blazing fast but it absolutely murders the rtx 3070 at rendering 4k in davinci resolve. When i used to deflicker a 4k 3d depth map with my rtx 3070, it would take 17 hours to run a deflicker filter on my 3d depth maps. Well on the arc a770, it takes me only 4 hours and 49 minutes.My rtx 3090 would take 5 and a half hours to deflicker a depth map in davinci. So the arc is 30 minutes faster at deflickering a two hour 3d depth map video than my rtx 3090. I don't know what intel has done but their drivers have vastly improved for video rendering. Now when i want to combine a depth map with a 2d video to make a 3d video, my rrx 3090 would take 26 to 30 hours to render a 4k 3d two hour video. With my arc a770 by sparkle it takes only 18 hours. So in that specific task it is 8 to 12 hours faster at rendering a 4k 3d video. This puts it on par with a 4080 for video rendering specifically when it comes to editing 3d video in a software called 3d combine. Im so impressed im gonna sell my 3090 , because why would i keep my 3090 when it cost more and my arc is faster. Now im a video editor so i can only speak for video editing, that this card is better at video editing in some instances of 4k than an nvidia card, but i can't speak about the gaming aspect because i did not buy this card to game, i did hear that this card is slower at gaming, but if you are a content creator, and u dont game, this is a better card, it has improved my conversion times at lot on video renders, the reviews on YouTube are outdated and all the reviews are mainly about gaming, so im speaking from the standpoint of people who are looking for a card for video editing and rendering, this is the card to go to.",

                "reviewText": "My older AMD Ryzen 7 5800H laptop feels snappier in some applications than my I9-13900K build, although the latter on paper has superior components in everything except the graphics card. I don't play games, so I upgraded to the Arc 380 to improve the \"2D\" experience. However, the 2D results with the Arc 380 in Performancetest turned out almost equal to the built in graphics, while the laptop has about 30 % better result. So far the Arc 380 has been wasted money and electricity. The worst part is the fan. It turns on and off a few seconds maybe every minute or so, even when it's under no load. The OLD intel Arc drivers offers control over the fan curve, so fine. But the NEW drivers has removed the fan control. I might just rip the stupid thing out of the cabinet and continue with the built in graphics. When I installed the drivers the first time the computer crashed, and the computer seems generally a little less stable. Some annoying notifications from Intel appear every time the computer restarts. Maybe Intel should stick to making processors and let others make the software. I don't game, but a few games was included with the card. I could install them even if the promo period was over. In Steam I found a few games my son played maybe 12 years ago. I installed Portal and tried it for a few minutes. I might have had a framerate of maybe 3 FPS. I gave up quickly without trying to fine tune the settings. If the card struggles with 12 year old games, I don't thing it would stand a chance with new games.",
