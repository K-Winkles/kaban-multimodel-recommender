It hold up a 3080 ti pretty well, although the brace itself sags from the weight. Though this isnt completely the fault of the brace considering my card has sloping edges which BTW, I was dumb with the rubber feet, installing them horizontally instead of vetically which would just make it slip out of place.Overall, good quality for the most part but doesnt work out of box, as mentioned before and if you see other peoples photos, the brace has to be bent down towards GPU if the card height is lower.",

                "reviewText": "I almost bought a not RGB bracket for like $3 less, but bought this one, figuring with my recent RGB addiction, that Id risk a couple bucks and give it a shot. It genuinely impressed me, the LEDs aren't perfectly blended like an ultra premium product, but the lighting array is pretty dang smooth, especially the sub $15 price point, I feel like I got something I would have been willing to pay $40 for. And for those that don't care about the lights and just need a bracket for gpu support, it does great. I have a heavy Zotac 3090, and it holds it up great. If you have a heavy GPU like mine, I wild recommend while the PC is on its side, load it so that the GPU looks slightly pushed toward the CPU, and then when it's vertical and it's taking the weight, it will be horizontal",

                "reviewText": "It works but it there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind before you purchase this: If you have an evga rtx card you are going to have a hard time. I have a 3080 ftw3 and I had to bend the bracket towards me for it to have something to push of. The evga shroud does not cover the fans. They are fully exposed. If you installed this without bending it you wouldn\u2019t be able to place the stand anywhere. It does work but it wouldn\u2019t be lined up to my card. It looks good, it\u2019s solid metal and the lights work. I\u2019m going to keep mine simply because all other brackets are similarly designed and the gpu itself doesn\u2019t lend well to this kind of support.Update: I got it to work but moving the little holder bracket near one of the plastic dividers on the fans. I used both pads and put them in the middle and just adjusted them until they supported the card. Be very careful though as any kind of movement on the computer and the support could budge and send it straight into the fan.",
