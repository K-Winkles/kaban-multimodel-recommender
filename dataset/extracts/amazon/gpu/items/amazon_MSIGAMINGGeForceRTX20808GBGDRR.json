                "reviewText": "I'm absolutely speechless on how awesome it looks. Everything in it's design screams premium and also, loved how MSI is slowly moving away from the Red accents. I know Red typically represents the gaming gear across the board, I just hate it when all these companies force it and ends up in either mismatching our build colors or, if you're like me you simply don't like the red color.This card is chunky, make sure to check if you have plenty of room in your case if you're planning on buying one. It measures exactly 327 x 140 x 55.6 mm. My radiator placement is at the front of my case so, this along with it's front fans needed at least 380mm of clearance.The card itself it's a nice upgrade from my GTX 1070. It dominates everything at 3440 x 1440p. It's silent and the cooling is perfect, considering some people are worried that one of the fans is smaller in comparison to the other 2.I advise you to download MSI's Afterburner beta and use OC scanner. If you're on the conservative side, this API overclock tool is for you. After you open Afterburner > Press CTRL+F to get to OC scanner > Scan > Let it run until is done (time varies depending of your components and you may experience some screen flashing since it's running the stress tests for you) > Go back to Afterburner and crank up all the way Power and Temp limit. Enjoy easy overclocking. Be aware the OC scanner won't touch your GPU memory though.This GPU comes with an Anti-sag brace support, making it a triple slot GPU...no...just...no. It looked way too bulky for my taste so I decided to use upHere's GPU Brace Support, which is a small stand that you can use even for SLI configs. Best part it uses a magnet instead of adhesive, kudos for that!",

I now have 1080Ti like performance with the potential for even higher performance from DLSS and eyecandy with ray tracing. This card is BIG. No joke, maybe the biggest I have ever had. It is heavy, but comes with a special support bracket to eliminate and offset any sag that the card may have. It is quality built. It is fast! Factory overclock that consistantly runs 1950-2070 MHz on boost clock. The card runs cool and quiet. RGB is a nice touch. Yes it is a tad overpriced I feel, but I look at it as a 1080Ti with future proofing. Recommend this one if you want to part with the cash.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is a BEAST. It has handled everything I've thrown at it from MK11, Starcraft with full setting and 2000 units, Black Desert at maximum ultra setting and everything else.I can stream and play games at the same time at high quality no lagging this card is beautiful (also literally speaking) the RGB on it is subtle but pretty.Forwarning this card is HEAVY. It comes with a under bar to help hold it up, it hold mine up pretty well, though some might want to put a little stand underneath. I would NOT recommend just letting the card hold itself with just the motherboard. Be very careful when installing, I recommend installing this card with the case on its side.Also heads up this card is LONG. So long that I had to leave a fan off of the cpu liquid cooler vent becuase my case was about a half centimeter too small to fit both, so bear that in mind if you have a smaller case.Overall I was nervous about getting this type of graphics card cause a lot of reviews say bad things about them crashing, I got a warranty plan for this just in case anything does happen in the future. But I'm glad to say that so far (*knocks on wood*) this card works beautifully and quietly. It's actually really quiet which is another plus.Super happy with this card. :)",

                "reviewText": "Was a bit concerned when I looked at the product number showing it was manufactured in October, as October was the first wave of the 2000 GPUs with defective problems.But 2080 is actually nice and I learnt that 2080 is probably the card with lowest defective rate among all 2000 GPUs.Also this specific card is a solid card. Came with for sure brand new (not opened for sure compared to my just received Rog Strix 2080 ti). The card is kinda silent and no bad noise that has been seen on other 2000 cards. The temperature is pure coldness.One thing to be careful is that this card : the gaming Trio is probably the largest card in the market of 32.8cm. But other cards for example FTW3 is 30.2 ish, ROGis 30.4 ish, some others are like 26, 28. So you might want to make sure your case can actually hold your card without a problem, which is the case for me (Carbide740 - using a 360mm radiator+fans in the front and made this beast unable to settle in unless I remove one fan from the 360mm raditor)So I either use a 360mm radiator with only 2 120mm fans, or I have to remove the gaming Trio and get a smaller card.Hope the info helps, highly recommend the card, a balance of performance and budget.",

                "reviewText": "Probably the worst graphics card you can buy. It runs hot, crashes constantly, and it you call MSI they'll gladly tell you it's your fault. Attempted an RMA but was denied due to \"plastic\" under the heat sink. Plastic.. that was on the graphics card in the box.... that you can't peel off because it's shrink wrapped around it. They then didn't replace the \"voided warranty\" sticker on my heatsink screws so now I can't return it period without being denied RMA again.The GPU constantly runs above 90 C even for minor games like RuneScape and on a 1440p monitor. Absolutely abysmal temperatures are even recorded at idle, hovering around 50 C. Ambient room temperature is 70 degrees and the airflow in my case is tremendous. FPS drops are also a constant issue. You'll turn down every setting known to mankind and you'll still get maybe 30-40 frames on low.All of my other temperatures are within normal and some even below normal operating temps so I know it's nothing else with my hardware. I can pop in my old 1070 and run games without issue.I would not recommend MSI in any form. The product is terrible and MSI refuses to even remotely assist after botching the first job. I quite honestly want to be refunded as the first RMA was botched and MSI has left me unable to RMA my card further.",

                "reviewText": "Been using this card for months now and with a DDR3 build with a i7 4790k this 2080 runs every AAA title between 80-140 fps at 1440p. I wouldn't recommend this card if you are native at 1080p - gross overkill. Highly recommend a monitor which is 144hz capable.Pros:- Unbelievable performance: Anything in 1440p will run North into the 100fps range (assuming highest settings).- Not warm at all: This card under load peaks around 65C (depending on case cooling setup).- Very quiet: This depends on case and whether you use headsets or not.- Accessories: Comes with a support bar to deal with sag.Cons:- Need 144hz monitor to appreciate the horsepower of this thing.- Heavy card: Expect a large amount of sag - USE THE SUPPORT TOOL.- Does not come with an installation guide for support bar. Although, quite easy to figure out with Youtube.What do you really want to know?This is for people who want to max games out at 1440p and even 4k resolutions. However, 4k is still in the esoteric unicorn hardware specific, this isn't far from it. This card guarantees highest quality game experiences on every AAA title and having nothing sub par dragging you under your already expected 60fps.I can't stress it enough, 1440p at 144hz should be used to get the most of of this card.",
