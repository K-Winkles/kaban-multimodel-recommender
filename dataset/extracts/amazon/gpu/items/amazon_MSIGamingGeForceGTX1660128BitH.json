Stays pretty damn cool and I was so impressed by that. Playing Witcher, b5 at high setting and saying under 58c.. this was for a customer but even my 2080 ti doesn\u2019t stay that cool with those games. I would def recommend this card to anyone. For 250?!! This is a steal imo. I had zero problems running anything B5,the Witcher , final Fantasy,sea of thrieves, gtfo, the forest, and other games. If I knew about the card sooner I would of got this instead of my 2080 ti and save money. Lol but for real great card for the money. Oh the rgb is dope af too",

                "reviewText": "As of writing this review, there is a Graphics Card shortage due to CoVid-19, Silicon Shortage, Scalpers, and Bitcoin Miners. While this card WAS sold well above MSRP, $551 compared to my firstborn child was a no brainer. This graphics card curbstomps the old Radeon Pro 555 in my old 2017 iMac, and runs Warzone on 100+ frames, on a 1080p 144hz monitor. Minecraft with Sildur\u2019s Extreme Shaders will run at about 80-90fps on 1090p 144hz. Attila: Total War, and Rome: 2 Total war run very well on ultra settings, though WILL significantly drop when you zoom in to where the fighting is thickest (probably due to all of the blood effects and bodies it is rendering), but overall allows a very good experience.The fans are very quiet on automatic (using MSI afterburner), and hardly noticeable. As an entry level PC gamer with my very first PC build, I would say this is a good card to wait out the shortage with. If you can snag this for about $500-$550, then by all means buy it, as it is a hell of a lot better than paying $1500 for a RTX 2060.Overall the GTX 1660 was a very good upgrade for me, and I hope to grind out many more hours on my favorite games with this beauty.",

                "reviewText": "I can't really speak to gaming as I'm not a gamer but not being the highest powered or most expensive card I went 4 stars on general principals. This went into an older Intel DQ77MK motherboard with a Gen 4 core I7 processor, raided SSDs for the OS and raided mechanical drives for data. It replaces a Nvidia GTX 650.This card barely fits the motherboard but it did fit.I had to change the SATA cable for the 5th connector from straight to 90 degrees at the mother board because the end of the card falls over the connector. There will be no replacing of motherboard memory without taking the card out as the card sits flush against end of the memory sockets with them locked in, no room to swivel the locks.I also replaced the power supply, as this card requires an 8 pin VGA connector and the old PS only had a 6 pin. The old PS has quite a few miles on it and the odds are that electrolytic capacitors will eventually become problematic, so I didn't mind springing for a new supply.The change in performance is very noticeable, streaming video is smoother, pages and photos pop faster, the fans are nicely quiet. Based on the Passmark comparisons with more expensive cards, I would agree with other comments that this card may be one of the best at Bang for the Buck.It has only been in play a short time but I am very happy with the purchase",

                "reviewText": "After saving up and holding out for the past two years I finally saved enough to upgrade from a potato PC to a new rig.My new build features this GTX 1660 and a Ryzen 2600 and a B450 motherboard.I'm able to play all my games at 60+ FPS on ultra settings with my 1080p monitor. Turning down graphics to medium/high with flashy graphics off I'm able to hit 100+ FPS in some games. I'm fine with 60FPS ultra because I currently do not have a good monitor. So far I am very satisfied with this graphics card. it looks amazing with a black/gray color design. The RGB is a little extra and I really do like the backplate for this card. This is one of the pricer GTX 1660 but MSI has proven to be worth the extra $20 with their design and cooling. Hopefully I do not have any issues to report. For now this is definitely a nice upgrade from my old GTX 750 Ti.I saw no design to go for a RTX 2060 because I did not see myself using the Ray Tracing feature. If you're looking to upgrade from a old video card this is definitely worth considering.PS - If you're playing APEX LEGENDS this card will handle it without a problem :)",

Graphics card is wonderful and works great unfortunately due to scalpers some prices have risen. Techzone Tips is doing a wonderful job at keeping these on the more affordable side. They were fast and courteous enough to write me a hand written letter. My largest issue come with the fact that they required an \u201cadult\u201d (age 21 or older) to sign for approval of the package. Seeing as I am only 19 I had issues getting the package for legal issue. Had my dad help me out and otherwise was fine. In summary:1. Great product highly recommend for mid-high end gaming.2. Great company in progress and I hope to see their business become a great company.3.New company still in the works of ironing things out so although I had an issue acquiring the package just a small hump to overcome.",
