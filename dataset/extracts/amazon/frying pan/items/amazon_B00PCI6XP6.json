Scramble eggs in the 8 inch and then just run under hot water & watch the pan get clean. Nothing sticks, these pans are a joy to use and clean. I didn't get lids with the OXO PRO's, so I ordered the 12 inch frypan that comes with a lid. The PRO warms up a little faster and will go into an oven at 430 degrees, while the Good Grips will go up to 390 degrees. That's just about the only difference I can find. BUY THESE PANS!!! You will love them too! They are anodized so hand-washing is best, and remember to use non-metal utensils to avoid scratches. Otherwise they're work horses in the kitchen. Fantastic pans!",

                "reviewText": "We've used the 12\" version of the pan heavily for 2 years now. We cook on it almost every day, usually multiple times a day. I estimate that we've made well over 1000 meals with it, probably closer to 2000.It's the perfect pan from a performance perspective. Very nonstick. The sides are angled out and not too tall, just right for tossing food or flipping something in the air if you want to get sketchy. The handle is still very sturdy and the bottom is still perfectly flat. It's just the right thickness to not be too heavy, but it distributes heat very evenly and it feels premium. We never used it in the oven so no comment there.The longevity was a little dissapointing. At 1.5 years I started noticing the first tiny bubble of delamination. At 2 years it's now obvious that it needs to be replaced. We almost always hand washed it becuase it was so easy and never used metal utinsils on the pan. It may have gotten too hot once or twice but there was no immediate signs of damage from that.Longevity considered I would still probably give the pan 4 stars. But the customer service bumps it up to a 5. Within one day of emailing back and forth with the warrenty department I have a new one on the way.With how much we use the pan, if we can get another 2 years out of our purchase price, that's more than fair. I was initially hoping for at least 3 years. I'm very happy with my experience though, so I'll defineitely be looking for more OXO kitchenware in the future.",

                "reviewText": "3.8 year update.. Replacing mine used everyday.. unfortunately replacement was mishapen and being replaced, but I've had 3 of these pans and great general purpose pan works well for eggs, bugers, fish and when the pan is round, accepts a glass lid to control spattering.. Highly recommend... and current sale price is right.. so getting 2...3 Year Update: Purchased in 2020 and this is used nearly daily. Coating has some nicks, wear and is coarser than it was new, but still servicable... My wife cooks very hot on gas so this PTFE coating sees a lot of heat history... cleanability is reduced as is the no-stick but still very happy with the durability and qualify.. we haven't babied this pan at all...but mostly use wooden or nylon spatulas and spoons...Really outstanding fry pan.... I've been using for 11 months and put a few scratches in it using a butter knife, but it has maintained its non-stick surface... easy to clean. Great pan for grilling fish, bacon, eggs, everything... with fast and even heating..",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Usable solid even heat easy clean 12 inch (30cm) diameter usable aluminum fry pan - OXO model 6198",
                "reviewText": "Fits nicely on 2019 Whirlpool the largest sized electric glass top electric element. Base of pan is 9.5 inch diameter. Top outer rim of top of pan is 12 1/4 inch, inside rim at top is 11 13/16 inch, bottom inside diameter is 9 5/8 inch diameter. Inside depth is 1 5/8 inch. Elliptical hole in handle end for hanging at its maximums is 3/8 X 9/16 inch, roughly 7/16 deep, don't use that but if you had spot to hang that is hole size. If one had weak wrists, this isn't a super light weight pan, but who would want one of those, they don't perform as well. This beats any of the standard pry pans that those celebs seem to endorse and license their names for the Asian importers. Granted this is an Asian import too, but is a cut above the standard pan and at a reasonable cost on Amazon as of Jan2021 that is holding at $40 USD still. And trust me, I hammer Asian imports hard when they do not perform, people grant too many reviews without thought and actual use, not to mention all the fake reviews out there!! Pan is perfect for our new work at home Covid lifestyles!I like the 12 inch pan size much better than the 10 inch I used for years. one can actually do hamburger, sauces, and prep an entire tater tot hot dish 9 X 13 pan for the over and mix in and heat up everything without risk of spilling over the edge and getting on ceramic glass top surface so no cleans needed if careful. This is my go to cookware outside of a standard 6 Qt InstaPot.Coating after 6 months like coatings will, begin to show some very light scratching with the non-metal spatulas. But absolutely no flaking. Treat with respect and it should treat you well too.I've used every other day for over 6 months now. Quite happy with it, solid pan and light enough to handle (for male of species at least, cannot speak for better half) and more robust base than some pans. Handle is solidly riveted and had not loosened but I'm not throwing it around either. The only thing is if you accidently touch exposed 1 inch by pan connection that is not coated get careless and you'll know it when pan is up to temp and won't soon forget about that small risk! ;-)Handle has a comfortable grip over solid aluminum handle. Believe the entire pan is aluminum, but the thicker base does become a good heat reservoir for more even heating. I tend to cook on lower heats for longer periods, more idiot proof for me and less challenging to the coating. Plus lower heats are safer for the coating to not transfer chemical extractables into foods in all likelihood too.I hand wash this pan after use and do not put in dishwasher to prevent any potential warping. Try not to slide the pan on any surface, it does have brushed aluminum surface on outer bottom and side surfaces, just treat with respect and it'll be looking good for a long time.A definitely worthwhile purchase, good value, good construction. Don't abuse the non-stick surface, now abrasives ever use fingers and a small amount of detergent and water and quick rinse after cooking a quick paper towel wipe down each time.This pan should last many years and I would most assuredly purchase this OXO pan variant again.",

I had to return/exchange 2 of them as the metal was warped/dented and waited over a month until they came back in stock for the final one which was not damaged.I am finding the reviews were correct, and the pan is completely flat, so that the heat is evenly distributed. The non stick surface is truly that, I am watching not to scratch it of course as most pans end up being crap when that surface wears off.It also has a rubberized handle which is comfortable to hold.I think the pan is a little expensive for what it is, but it does work very well. Long term longevity we will see.",

I wanted a lid so I bought a second one with lid that I will use when I need it.Now used for about 12 months, these pans last about that long. The coating is still mostly non stick but it has started to break up in places. Gets small marks or holes here and there and then coating gradually gets areas where it has little bits come away. While they last they are great though. For $60 AUD, they are cheap enough to just buy a new one each year. Love the shape and super slippy surface for as long as it lasts.",
