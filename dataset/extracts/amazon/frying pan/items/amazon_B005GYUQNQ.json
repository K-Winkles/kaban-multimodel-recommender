                "reviewText": "02-04-2014 Review, 5*Scrambled eggs wipe off easily with a damp paper towel (I wait until its cool to the touch). I also fry skinless chicken breasts, pork, & hamburgers. But one needs to be careful not to overheat the skillet. Also, although they say the skillet will handle metal utensils, I just can't bring myself to use them.I didn't plan on such a long response but one thing leads to another. I'm new at cooking and didn't realize that there's more to it than I realized. Especially when it comes to pan frying chicken at the proper temperature. I've got to say that I admire the knowledge that you cooks have & that I've just taken for granted. So, maybe you'll have a good chuckle at my lack of cooking knowledge.Turns out that all non-stick skillets have a temperature limit before the surface gets damaged. Apparently, I was supposed to read the instructions before bringing fire into the mix. So, please follow the instructions so that you don't exceed the temperature range like I did. I overheated (>525 deg F) one of my 2 skillets without realizing it, multiple times, when frying hamburgers, skinless chicken breasts , and pork. I've since dedicated the overheated damaged pan to only frying the meats as they have their own fat/oil to reduce sticking. I can't use it for eggs anymore because they stick and I don't want to use any oil. I use my 2nd Circulon Symmetry skillet for eggs. One thing nice about frying eggs is that it's easy to tell when the heat is too high, the eggs quickly burn. Meat, however, takes a while to burn & even longer for me to notice that the skillet is way too hot. What can I say, I'm an amateur.The temperature limit is in the skillet's instructions. For the gas range, I now use the same 400 deg limit that they state for oven use. Ever since the tainted chicken scare, I've been using an old infrared thermometer to check the temperature of the top of the meat (& now also the bottom of the skillet). Just point the red dot and read the temperature on the display. It's an easy way to make sure that the top of the chicken reaches 160 deg F without overheating the pan.I've just recently noticed/realized that chicken breasts take longer to cook when I don't use oil. Without oil, I have to flip the chicken more often to ensure that it gets cooked throughout at over 160 deg F. The temperature of the top of the chicken barely gets to 160 Deg F when the frying pan is at 400 deg F (I think they invented infrared thermometers just for me).This made me realize another reason for using some oil, heat transfer. The oil transfers the heat of the skillet into the meat a lot quicker/better. This means that: 1) By using oil, the meat cooks hotter & quicker, at a lower skillet temperature and/or does NOT need flipped as often. 2) By NOT using oil, the meat reaches a lower temperature & takes longer to cook, needs a hotter skillet and/or needs flipping more often.That's all I have to say about that. Time to finish my box of chocolates.",

My husband who only cooks bacon loves them too. But, he does the dishes and he likes the way they clean up because he doesn't hear me complaining how he washed them. They are made to withstand everyday cooking and cleaning! So many wonderful dishes come out of the one large pan and for cooking eggs in the morning you can't beat the small fry pan. Best thing is the Circulon Symmetry pans work great on an induction stovetop! Do I love these Circulon Symmetry Pans - Yes I do!",

                "reviewText": "1, Reason why I chose :I was looking for PFOA free nonstick. I first purchased 12\" nonstick pan and liked it a lot, so I ended up buying the entire family of this series.2, like & dislike :I'm not a professional chef but cook dinner daily. After I used this for 8 month, I should say this is probably the best nonstick pan I've had. It's well built and durable, yet it's not too heavy. Plus, the handle softly sticks to your hand. So, when I shake the pan, it holds pretty well.Cooking surface is nonstick and it really does work well as advertised. I can cook with or without oil. Like other nonstick pans, as long as you handle with care, such as not using metal silverware to stir food, or using only soft sponge to wash, coating should last a long time. Mine has been used at least every other day for 8 month, but the surface still looks like brand new. It works for any temperature from low to high.Like the other 10\" or 12\" pans , the way edge is designed (sort of steep wall ), that holds food better for my use, compared to round shape edge pan.3, Recommend this product to :If you're looking for a good quality nonstick pan, this should work great.4, Price :Fair price",

                "reviewText": "I found what I was looking for in a pan; non-stick, it has lasted through a month of regular use and still no sticking. Given the number of not-so-good reviews, I hem and hawed over my decision to by this pan or not . I decided to buy the skillet for a lesser price from Amazon Warehouse Deals (a part of Amazon.com that specializes in offering great deals on returned, warehouse-damaged, used, or refurbished products that are in good condition but do not meet Amazon.com rigorous standards as \"new.\" We also offer products in new and open-box condition) just to see if it was what I wanted without a bigger investment. sure enough, it arrived with a couple of minor scratches not on the surface where it would affect cooking directly. It is a great skillet. I will wait to see if the coating lasts longer than previous non-stick pans I have owned but at this time, I have absolutely no complaints. I like the weight of the skillet too, it has cast iron pan feel to it. I gave it four stars because I am sure there are higher quality pans available but for my budget, I LIKE IT A LOT!",

                "reviewText": "I used my skillet for the first time today. We own two other Circulon pans so I was expecting a well designed and well finished product! I was not disappointed! For even heat distribution the skillet is some what heavy, again as expected. The non-stick surface preforms very well as it does for all of our Circulon pans. The handle of the skillet deserves special notice. It is insulated and the insulation is fixed. You won't have to look for the handle cover each time you go to use the skillet or fool with the handle covering when you go to wash the skillet. The handle itself is well designed, riveted to the skillet and adds somewhat to the skillet overall weight, again as you would expect. BUT while holding the skillet the handle does not give you the feeling that the skillet is about to \"turn over\" in your hand. I totally recommend Circulon products. However, I was slightly disappointed the skillet was made in Thailand, but not as disappointed as I would have been if it had been made in China!",
