                "reviewText": "This is a well-made cooking pan that I've put to use on a few steaks, eggs, and cheese sandwich or two. I'm not much on cooking but compared to the default induction pans I have in the kitchen; this beats them by a mile as far as construction and heating up quickly and evenly goes.Pros:-Well-made material. It certainly looks and feels better than others I've seen and the handle isn't some flimsy thing that's going to break off easily.-Heats up quickly and evenly. Very few if any cool spots on the pan while using an induction stovetop. The cheaper pots and pans I have always had some spot that wouldn't heat up right and it was noticeable.-Can be used on any kind of cooking surface Gas, electric, induction, etc. it has you covered.Cons: (or things to take note of)-It will tell you in the manual about needing to apply some oil or something to keep things from sticking. So, maybe not entirely \"non-stick\" if you just throw something in there from the start, but I've had no problem with anything sticking and cleaning it off after use is hardly more than rinsing it off.-They state that a wooden cooking utensil is best to avoid scratching/damaging the surface. It's durable but you can still scratch it (and any pan) if you are using metal utensils.-You'll likely want to read the pamphlet regarding the manufacturing oils that could be on it. I followed one suggestion and boiled some vinegar and water in the pan and then wiped it down. It hasn't had any weird flavors or odors, but you might want to do the same regardless.",

                "reviewText": "Comparing this to Hex-CladFirst, the instructions are a bit lengthy and tend to be over translated. More info than you need.Washing before use, I just did what was recommended for my Hex-Clad. (Scotch Bright NON SCRATCH sponge with warm soap and water) I did this a few times and it was fine. No black residue like other's have mentioned. I then did a simple seasoning. (A little oil and heated the pan on high). Wiped the oil out with a paper towel and the pan was ready to go.This heats up/cools just like my hex-clad and I was able to try it on gas and induction.The one thing to remember with all pans is making sure they get to the right temperature before adding food. Skipping this can cause certain foods to stick.We've cooked a few dozen items in this since owning it, but it's really my go to for a small breakfast of Potatoes, eggs and chorizo.I would say if you're in the market for hybrid pans, do your research first. Make sure you're comfortable with functionality and requirements before moving forward.If you simply want a non stick pan to quickly cook things without taking care of them, these type of pans are probably not for you.A keeper for me.",

                "reviewText": "So for this pan lives up to its description.Overall diameter is just short of 9 inches.The bottom is flat and it is induction ready.It has an aluminum handle which is securely riveted to the pan and it did not get hot in my tests, using an induction cook top. The glass top is also of high quality, with the handle secured by two screws and it has a small vent hole to allow steam to escape.I tested it with eggs and sausage patties, (several times) first heating it up, as with most non-stick pans, & it performed very well. Just wiped it clean with a paper towel.It has a bit of weight but is easily handled because the handle is very user friendly.I was a bit sketchy about the textured surface & I'm not sure why it is textured but it seems to be OK.At this time I cannot say how long the non-stick surface will last & only time will tell.It does spread the heat very well and that is good to prevent hot spots.It is a little pricey so I was finicky in this review, demanding near perfection & so far it has passed every test I've done. Only longevity cannot be determined so I will update if necessary.As always, this is an honest & unbiased review based on my personal experience.Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I am enjoying this pan/skillet!I immediately put it to the test upon arrival.Washed it, dried it (no special seasoning needed before first use).I cooked 2 eggs without oil/butter/spray, just dry pan (I covered with its lid and cooked on low and slow), the eggs cooked perfectly over easy without flipping them. Delicious!I cooked with oil/butter..same results, delicious.I cooked sliced potatoes with a little olive oil, not flipping until slightly browned and browned the other side as well...DELICIOUS.Everything I cooked in it turned out delicious, including pan cakes and even a cake that I backed in the over (perfect size when you don't want a big cake around).The honey comb bottom heats evenly everytime and absolutely no sticking (so far).The pan is a nice weight, looks high end, oven sade, dishwasher safe and can be used on different modes of cook tops. I like that the sides of the pan is higher than most pans/skillets this size.This is definately a Go To pan for most of my daily cooking.The pan and its top are sturdy, nice weight, durable, non stick, reasonably priced for the quality you get and attractive.When going to my son's home to try it out on his stove, the cute bag came in handy to carry it in.I'm pleased so far.",

                "reviewText": "The pan is nice and heavy duty, it feels quite sturdy. My favorite thing is that the lid fits nicely, so many pans don't have that much it seems. What I didn't realize was that the design you see in the pan is textured, and I assume that is a part of why it isn't specifically very non-stick. It cooked the food I've had in it nicely, but depending on what it is, I don't feel like I can use this pan for items that are more delicate (eggs for instance).",
