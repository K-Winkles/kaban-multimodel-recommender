The cost is much better and the design is better, they just feel good using them.Even temperature across them, start medium heat and they heat quickly and evenly, no need for high.Tfal skillets sides tend to gently flair out from top to bottom. The sides on these are straight up and down so less splatter.I don't put them in the dishwasher but they are so easy to clean they are fine hand washing.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic VALUE! Bought these to use in a roommate situation. These have held up after almost 2 years of constant use (Mostly large pan and large pot). Because the lid is shared between the large pot and large pan, the lid handle detached after a year. I tried to put it back as it was, but could not. I ended up removing the rubber sleeve and screwed the bare screw directly against the glass lid. I'm sure I could buy a Calphalon or some other brand lid for this set, and it would be perfect. The set heats mostly even, works flawless for the many dishes I make.I use the accompanying solid spoon for most everything, it looks worn, but it is to be expected. The plastic isn't thick, but it has done everything I've asked of it.This set is everything you need if you're looking for a.) Affordable cookware b.) Community cookware that may get mistreated. (The only damage is from roommates using metal forks to stir/mix)I highly recommend this for young adults. If you're looking for better value, I don't know where you may find it, for as inexpensive as this set is, why take risk of saving a few dollars on a worse, less trusted product? This is a STARTER set with everything you need.",

                "reviewText": "The nonstick coating is fantastic - incredibly easy to cook and clean with. The rubberized handles are very comfortable. If you're cooking for yourself or maybe one other person, the pots and pans are perfect.However, I do suggest that if you regularly cook for multiple people and you buy this set, get an extra, larger frying pan. The larger of the two that's provided is not really adequate if, say, you're sauteing two whole onions for a full pot of soup, or if you want to make a quesadilla using large tortillas. Because I mostly cook multiple meals' worth of food at a time, I don't use either of the frying pans in the set all that often. I also never find a use for the smallest saucepan.I've also found that the utensils are of somewhat questionable quality. In particular, they don't react too well to heat. I'm not sure if it's from normal use or from one of my roommates frequently leaving it resting on a hot frying pan, but the end of the spatula has some damage from melting or burning, which causes small strips of black plastic to fall off occasionally. And there are several deep gouges in the handle caused by letting it rest on the edge of a hot pan and melting.But the bottom line is that this is a very nice cookware set at a pretty good price. Maybe buy a bigger frying pan and a better spatula to supplement it, and that will basically fix the minor problems it has.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: (04/28/2014)So I am taking away two stars because of something that bothers me with this product. The lid is very, very tough to clean. See, there is a metal ring that holds the glass of the lid but food gets stuck between the small gap of the glass and metal. You can hold up the lid and see tomato sauce and oil and other crud in the small gap. And trying to clean it out is pretty much impossible. Spent over a half hour on one lid and wasn't able to get any of it out, seems really stuck in there.---- Original Review:We bought these as a cheap set for our new apartment and in general we are pretty happy so far. It has only been a couple weeks though, so can't comment too much on longevity. But in terms of cooking and cleaning, they worked well enough without any complaints. The sizes are okay, may be on the small side for more than two or three people though. But for a couple or for college, these are a good set to pick up. They do seem to be easier to clean than stainless steel pots and pans (the pots seem to be non-stick too, which I never cooked with before).The only thing I noticed so far is that the handle gets a bit hot and it is made of rubber or some such and I worry about it starting to degrade. Haven't noticed anything yet, but something that I'm keeping an eye on.",
