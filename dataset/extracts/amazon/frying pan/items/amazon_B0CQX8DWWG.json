                "reviewText": "I've never bought a full-sized frying pan that requires assembly before. That being said, it was easy to attach the handle, and came with a wrench to do so. This 12 inch pan easily fits inside my 12 inch All-Clad pan, so I'm doubtful that it is actually 12 inches (more like 11 or 11 1/2). It does seem well-made, and closely resembles my KitchenAid frying pans. The descriptive booklet that came with it is garbage, with some things not making sense at all (maybe a poor translation). It also mentioned something about the magnet test not working to determine if it was stainless, so I did worry for a moment. I do know that not all stainless is magnetic, and only that which is will work for induction. I tested it with a magnet, and it did stick, meaning it will work on my induction stove. It does not have a visible non-stick coating, other than just the inherent properties of stainless, but I did not expect (or want) one. I like that the screws are internal, so there is not a rivet on the frying surface. I am also slightly confused about why many of the reviews are actually for a different product, which I recognize as a four-egg pan I ordered and reviewed a while back (and it no longer seems to be available). This pan, while the same brand, is very different from that one!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hands down this is the best cookware I could have ever ordered. It is stainless steel from the handle to the skillet. It is very durable. I\u2019m not sure if it is nonstick as I have not dared to cook with it yet. What I love about the skillet is that obviously it\u2019s composite steel it has multiple layers that can solve any heat problems or uncooked areas of your food. It also is rivet free meaning on the inside of the skillet itself, there are no bothersome rivets that might hinder cooking your food properly. It\u2019s very easy to clean just wash and dry.Another feature that I really enjoy is that you can use either iron or steel, spatula or tongs. Whatever you\u2019re cooking with or frying or stirring it won\u2019t scratch. I have a glass top stove that works perfectly for this skillet and I just use a small thin layer of oil before I fry or cook something unless I\u2019m deep frying it. Wonderful quality product. I am completely satisfied and I highly recommend. Also, just a sidenote from any of you, that may be asking, this steel skillet automatically creates a nonstick effect when I use oil to cook with and the way to prevent ruining your beautiful skillet is make sure that your oil is heated up enough prior to cooking something and not sticking and burning the pan. I wish this had a lid that came with it, but because I love the product so much, I will be looking into a whole set of this fabulous cookware for any chef that is Eyring to be a top chef in their home",

                "reviewText": "This skillet arrived nicely and securely packaged to avoid damage from shipping. The handle was not assembled to the skillet, to allow use of a smaller package. Directions for assembly were included, but not needed, as it required only two nuts to be tightened over protruding threaded studs on the pan itself.A small wrench was provided to assemble the handle to the skillet, however it shouldn't be used as it fits too loosely and it's likely to either deform itself during tightening or damage the nuts. Instead use a 12 mm wrench, socket, or nut driver. In addition an extra nut was thoughtfully included, just in case!The pan itself performed nicely with even heating, no discoloration, and it was easy to clean. I used it on an induction plate and an electric stove with no problems. The handle is smooth, comfortable and remained cool during heating. I did not try the pan in an oven.It remains to be seen how this pan will hold up over time, but for now I really like it and do recommend it.",
