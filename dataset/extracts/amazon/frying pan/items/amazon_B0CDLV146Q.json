The first think I cooked was saut\u00e9ed fresh green beans in olive oil and garlic. The beans came out tender enough but not over cooked. I did have to get used to using a medium heat setting and was concerned it would not cook as well. That was not the case and the beans cooked evenly and were delicious. The clean up is minimal due to the non stick coating. It also stores well with my other pots and pans in my cabinet. I do recommend this product for its affordability, versatility and effectiveness.",

I\u2019ve had it for months and looks brand new. I couldn\u2019t believe the price. Just buy it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This truly is an All In One Pan! My daughter bought a similar one and told me how wonderful it was. I searched it on Amazon and the All In One Pan also showed up. The pans are almost identical. However, the All In One Pan is deeper, which I especially liked, and weighs slightly less (not heavy at all). It is more than big enough to hold a large roast along with potatoes, carrots, and onions! The overall reviews of the All In One Pan were higher than my daughter's pan. I hesitated for a moment because the All In One Pan is one-third the cost of the other pan. But, based on reviews and the deeper size, I ordered the All In One Pan. I received it in less than a week and used it that evening and every day since. I love it! I've made a complete breakfast in it, grilled cheese sandwiches (wonderful!), a full pan of goulash, etc. It is everything it is advertised to be. Clean-up is a snap - nothing sticks! The video shows a pasta dish in a cheese sauce - slides right out of the pan. I let the pan sit for an hour before cleaning. Absolutely no scrubbing. Washed in less then a minute in warm, soapy water and sponge. I highly recommend this wonderful pan for its ease of use, ease of clean-up, and ease on the wallet!",

You also do not have to add any oil or butter to the pan because the non stick interior makes the good cook and slide out of the pan fantastic. The ceramic coating also makes it very easy to clean. Overall one great product!",
