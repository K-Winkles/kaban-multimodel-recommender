                "reviewText": "Perfect skillets and truly non stick...if you are used to cooking stuff at a high heat on the burner, DON'T do it. No need to cook on high...maybe that is why some people complained that food stuck. Some of the photos that I saw in the 1* reviews had food stuck & looked as if the food was cooked way too high. I cook fried eggs, scrambled eggs, potatoes and rib eye steak and never once have I experienced sticking. I do know the instructions say NOT to use aresol sprays like Pam...they say only to use the pump type or mist type non stick products, so I do.The skillets are easy to hand wash (with soap & water) as well. I do not put my skillets in the dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "The only reason I'm having to buy these pans, is because of my son-in-law. He has ruined my other pans by NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. These are the rules with any non-stick pan that you want to KEEP non-stick. 1) No high heat! These pans work exceedingly well at low and medium. Even pre-heating these pans on high will warp the metal and damage the non-stick coating. 2)HAND WASH ONLY! Automatic dishwasher detergents have caustic agents in them that will damage certain metals and will ruin non-stick coatings. 3) NO SPRAYS! Things like Pam have a propellent in them that will also damage the non-stick coating. 4) NO COLD WATER ON A HOT PAN! Who does that? I've seen him take a sizzling hot pan and run cold water right out of the faucet on it. Really? I'm sure that he does that to get the grease out, while the pan is still hot. But, doing so will warp the metal and ruin the non-stick coating. 5) NO METAL UTENSILS! Again, who does that? I've seen metal spoons, ladles, forks, spatulas and even KNIVES used on my pans. Don't do that. Just.....DON'T.Calphalon brand pans are some of the best on the market and will last YEARS if they are treated with care and respect. I have a full set of Calphalon pots and pans. I am very pleased with them and have full confidence that everything I cook in them is going to turn out great. Good purchase. Five stars.",
