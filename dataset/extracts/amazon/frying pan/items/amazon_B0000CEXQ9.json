But despite cleaning them carefully and not using metal utensils, they eventually begin to lose their non-stick properties. So when replacement time came, we opted to get the exact same pans. That's how much we think of these.These pans have a fused aluminum bottom that keeps the pan absolutely flat on our cooktop surface. They eat evenly and are great pans. I don't understand why \"designer\" pans costing hundreds of dollars more can justify their prices, when these Cuisinart skillets are so well designed and manufactured.We don't do anything special maintaining them - use plastic utensils and limit metal scouring pads to the aluminum bottoms (not the sides - you don't want to scratch the polished exterior). A good 5 to 6 years with almost daily use is their life-span, which I understand is typical for a non-stick pan.",

The old one still works well, but some of the non-stick coating is worn due to being treated poorly by a roommate. Anyhow, I consider this the perfect 10-inch frying pan. As with all nonstick pans, I suggest using utensils that won't scratch the bottom. Even so, the coating is very hard, and it takes a lot of misuse to mess it up. I've been using the old one for around 15 years, even with the misuse it got, which is pretty darn good.",

The old school stuff had a bit more carcinogens in the coating that made them slick.I normally use a well seasoned cast iron skillet so I manage the utility of the pan like it should be.

                "reviewText": "This is a 10 inch Cuisinart frypan. I had the 8 inch for quite a while now and love it. Needed a 10 inch one, so I ordered the 10 inch, but discovered upon arrival 10 inch means outside dimension top and 8 inch inside bottom. Guess this is really 8\u201d Fry pan not 10 unusable surface. Appears to be downgraded saying 10 inch but really 8 inch usable bottom space! \ud83e\udd14",
