This pan is completely different. Wish I could order a complete set. This pan has a little steam whole in the top. I've never owned one that does. Whatever I cook in it comes out fork tender. No, I'm not a member of this company, nor do I know anything about the. I just know, I want more of these pans. This is one frying pan I truly give 5 stars without reservation. Have one at my own home and one at my mom's home.",
