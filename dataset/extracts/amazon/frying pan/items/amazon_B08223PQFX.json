                "reviewText": "I wanted some nice pans that would make cooking easier so I bought a set of ceramic pans, but wanted a larger pan too so I purchased this 12 inch one. I would rather it came with a glass lid, but since it didn\u2019t I purchased that as well. Cooking on these ceramic pans is like a dream come true with nothing sticking and easy cleanup. Food slides around so easily that I can flip things like a professional chef. Somehow, breakfast tastes better when cooking in these pans. Perhaps because I\u2019m not having to scrap it off the bottom of the pan. However...Upon receiving the pan(s) the first thing I did was season it along with my full set. It then went into the cupboard. Each pan with it\u2019s own lid. It sat in there for a month. Although I have used all the pans in the full set I purchased, I have never used this particular pan, but please keep reading. My rules for my pans are: \u2022 Do not go above medium heat \u2022 Silicone and wooden utensils only \u2022 Hand wash only with sponge \u2013 no scouring pads - not even plastic ones \u2022 Let pans cool before washing \u2022 No nesting the pans \u2022 Season pans once a monthI season by coating the pan with oil. Place it in a 300 degree oven for two minutes. Let the pan cool and wipe out the remaining oil. I feel the little bit of time this task takes was well worth it to keep the pans non stick ceramic coating from degrading.I went so far as to post a notice on the exhaust fan above the stove listing the rules for family members. Imagine my dismay when I went to season my pans for the second time only to find a chip in the ceramic coating and gouges along the rim of this pan \u2013 even though the pan has just been sitting in the cupboard with the lid sitting on top of it. Is it possible that the lid caused the gouges? Hard to believe the pan could be so easily susceptible to damage, but there is no way the lid can cause the chip in the ceramic coating as the lid can\u2019t touch that spot. Note that there is PLENTY of room in this cupboard so the pans are not packed in there stacked on top of each other. Is this pan really so vulnerable that it becomes damaged just sitting in the cupboard?I\u2019ve examined my other ceramic pans and have found no damage so I\u2019m hoping I simply received a defective 12 inch pan and have arranged to receive a replacement. Not wanting to risk potential damage on the rim of the new pan, I have also ordered a new lid with a silicone rim. It will protect the rim of the pan. This should be unnecessary as the pan should be able to tolerate putting a lid on it without causing damage. Chips in the ceramic coating is another story. We\u2019ll see what happens.Putting aside my negative experience with this particular pan, they are all great to cook with. The only issue might be the handle. It\u2019s metal, but it\u2019s hollow. This allows heat to travel up the handle more quickly than a solid handle. I haven\u2019t had any problems with the handle getting too hot as others have had, but I do notice that the closer the handle is to the pan then the hotter it is. Sure, that\u2019s normal, but this gets hotter quicker. As I said, I have not yet hat an issue with the handle getting to hot to handle, but as a precaution I also purchased silicone handle holders that are used like pot holders. So far I\u2019ve only used them when removing the pan from the oven after seasoning. I recommend the silicone handle holders \u2013 whatever style fits your fancy \u2013 as they provide a better, safer and less awkward grip than cloth pot holders.I love this (these) pans and am so disappointed that this one turned out not to be very durable, but hopefully the replacement will fair better.",

                "reviewText": "These pans are a good value for the price. Sturdy, thick, construction. I haven't had any problems with paint chipping, etc. Handles work well to disappate heat.The ceramic nonstick works very well. But, in my experience, the lifespan is not as long as with Teflon. But if you are trying to avoid PFAS, this is the next best thing.All ceramic nonstick I've bought (across several brands including GreenPan) all wear out in about a year (of almost daily use and hand washing). I've found cleaning with a soft sponge, not the scratchy side of a ScotchBrite or ScrubDaddy, will help prolong the life a little. But, even then, be prepared to buy new ones after 12-18 months or deal with some sticking.",
