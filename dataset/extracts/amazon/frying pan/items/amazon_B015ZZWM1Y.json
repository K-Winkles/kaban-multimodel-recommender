Each additional layer provides improved durability and ensures superior nonstick performance. Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware features 3 nonstick layers which create a durable, longer-lasting nonstick surface that is metal-utensil-safe. Why Choose Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware?

Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware is constructed with our thickest gauge, for reliable, professional-grade durability that holds up to everyday use. Why Choose Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware? The more evenly cookware heats, the more consistently your food cooks. Even-heating cookware provides predictable and improved cooking results. Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware offers our highest level of even heating, allowing you to cook consistently and confidently, every time. Why Choose Calphalon Signature Nonstick Cookware? As the # 1 hard-anodized aluminum cookware brand in America, Calphalon was also the first cookware brand to adopt this technology from the aerospace industry in 1968. All Calphalon nonstick cookware is made from hard-anodized aluminum, which provides a durable cooking surface that is resistant to both corrosion and warping.

                "reviewText": "great heat distribution! and best non-stick I've had!! it is made from heavy duty heavy thick metal so the heat distribution is excellent. do not use metal utensils on it, even tho they say u can, because it can scratch. this is the best non stick surface i have ever had, i've used it dozens of times. it cleans like magic cuz nothing sticks to it. for comparison, i have purchased copper colored non stick, (which was nice but too thin and not as good nonstick as this) and even a 120 dollar swiss diamond dust impregnated pan and this one beats them all. the only draw backs are, no lid is included, and the shape is rather rounded on the bottom which can narrow the number of flat item u can cook at once, like grilled cheese or pancakes, but that is probably the purposeful intended shape for cooking certain other things. the handle is so heavy duty that my other pans are ashamed of themselves. lol this pan is so worth the money. and the shipping box was astoundingly huge and protective of it!!",
