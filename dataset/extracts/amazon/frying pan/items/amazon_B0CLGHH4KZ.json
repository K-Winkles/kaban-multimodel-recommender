I followed directions, I put some oil or butter and started at low heat. When oil is hot or butter melted, I add whatever I want to cook and increase heat a little bit. I use wood or silicone spatula to stir. Even though the manufacturer claims it can take a lot of heat, I rather prefer to cook a lower temperature. The cooked food looks and tastes great.
