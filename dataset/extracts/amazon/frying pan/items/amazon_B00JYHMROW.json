                "reviewText": "First let me say that this skillet is big! And I\u2019m happy about that. I needed something larger, but with low sides, as this one has.The blue is pretty\u2014it\u2019s blue only on the handles\u2014and is a sort of blue-green.The bottom came with a scratch\u2014I can barely see it but it\u2019s there and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a manufacturer mark, shipping, or what, but otherwise it is perfect. I almost took off a star for that but I\u2019m so pleased with the skillet and the price I bought it for, I left my stars at 5.No sticking so far. I washed mine by hand and though on the bottom is indicates it is dishwasher safe, I\u2019m likely to hand wash it most of the time\u2014due partly to the size of it; however, it does fit fine in the dishwasher.There are two sturdy handles: both handles are stainless but with the colored covering that feels like rubber\u2014cool touch covering. There is the long handle side, firmly attached and sturdy; there is the shorter handle on the other side that is also attached firmly and sturdily\u2014the shorter side helps if you have to pick up the skillet with something heavier in it since it is a large skillet so you aren\u2019t trying to hold it with one hand.The skillet sat evenly on my stovetop without any rocking or movement at all.The price is very reasonable. I had a anodized nonstick skillet from Anolon that cost over $60 and it began peeling very badly after about a year or less; this Rachael Ray is half the cost of that\u2014time will tell how long it will last but at least the price is more reasonable and it\u2019s a bigger and nicer looking skillet than the Anolon.The only other items I have from Rachael Ray\u2019s kitchen collection is a set of blue bowls and I\u2019ve really loved those bowls! They\u2019re quality, they look good on my countertop, and they\u2019re made very well; the price was reasonable on those as well. So I\u2019m likely to take a look at some of her other kitchen items.I\u2019m happy with my purchase and hoping there\u2019s no peeling. It does come with care instructions and I read those to make sure I do everything to care for the skillet properly\u2014it comes with a lifetime warranty as long as you care for it properly!This fits exactly what I needed and I\u2019m so glad I bought it!I hope my review helped you today.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this skillet in the 14\" size to replace a 10 year old skillet I had that wasn't nonstick anymore. This one retails for about $100 and I got it on Amazon for about $39, so I was thrilled with the deal and was amazed at the size of it when it arrived. It is a little bigger than the biggest burner on my stovetop, but it still cooks evenly. I've used it almost daily for the last 2 months and I've made a variety of things in it: stir fry, beef stroganoff, scrambled eggs, saut\u00e9ed meats, grilled cheese, and French toast to name a few. Because it's so large, I can make 3 grilled cheese sandwiches at once and 4 pieces of French toast at once, so it cuts down on cook time for some of the things I make.The pan is excellent quality and the nonstick aspect works wonderfully even without using olive oil or butter. I don't use metal cooking utensils with this, so I've had no issues with nonstick coating coming off as others have mentioned. I also wouldn't store it underneath other pans, which may have contributed to other reviewers having the coating come off. The rubberized handle is easy to grip and I love the bonus handle on the opposite side, which makes it really easy to pour food out of the skillet. Cleaning it is very easy using a non-scratch sponge. I love this skillet and I highly recommend it for all your cooking needs - wish I would've bought it sooner!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this in 2018 for the wife. She wanted a large skillet for some recipes and the current set based skillets just were not large enough.This thing is huge in comparison. Perfect for her pastas and just about anything else we throw at it.There is no lid with this, or at least not when I bought it. So if you need to steam something you have to get creative like a cookie sheet, sadly. It also doesn\u2019t fit in the dishwasher well. Would probably look for a mode with a lid next time I am in the market. But if one doesn\u2019t exist, I will come back to this.",

                "reviewText": "This skillet is LARGE but easy to handle. It is shallow so perfect for bacon and eggs, browning meat, hasbrowns, etc but not so good for sauces, as the non stick coating works very well.... food slides right out without issue and the low sides would make it challenging to stir without making a mess. As far as even heating, I have a gas range that has a power burner (flame is larger than the rest) and it heats the entire skillet, so for me, it cooks evenly. ... Not sure how it would do on elecric burners. The coating has not scratched using silicone utensils. I hand wash it after it cools completely, which is how non stick surface pans should be washed, no matter what brand. Nylon utensils WILL scratch non stick pans due to the firm edges... use silicone and your skillets will last longer. Is it perfect? No. ... but overall, I really like this skillet and recommend it for anyone needing a large skillet.",
