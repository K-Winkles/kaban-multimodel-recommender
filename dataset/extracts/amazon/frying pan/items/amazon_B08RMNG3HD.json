It has transformed my cooking experience, allowing for easy food release without the need for excessive oils. This not only contributes to healthier cooking but also simplifies the cleaning process.The addition of a well-fitted lid is a thoughtful touch that speaks volumes about the pan's attention to detail. It locks in flavors and moisture, creating a culinary symphony with every dish. The transparent lid allows me to keep a watchful eye on the cooking process, adding precision to my culinary endeavors. If you're in search of a well-rounded frying pan with a thoughtful design, the SENSARTE skillet is a commendable option.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this. I'm so tired of these \"non-stick\" pans that start to bubble or peel after you use them for a bit. I was also looking for a bigger, deeper frying pan. This fits the bill.The pan is really sturdy. It's attractive and a change from all those black non-stick pans. The lids and handles have to be put together but they send a screwdriver to do the assembly (really easy).It's a bit on the heavy side, but I think that it will hold up longer because of that. They advise hand washing, which is fine if it's going to last longer that way.Fried up some ground beef it in for chili, and it heated very evenly, no sticking.I liked it so much I bought a set!",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy, well made, perfect capacity frying pan. Back in July, I was looking for an 11\" fry pan with a lid that has straight sides that could be used on a glass top electric stove. The 11\" skillet met all of the criteria and as a bonus the 4 qt capacity is perfect. I purchased the 11\" skillet from Walmart at twice the price that it is sold for on Amazon.After several months of using the 11\" skillet, I learned that the Sensarte fry pan met & exceeded all of my cooking needs so I decided to look on Amazon to see if other Sensarte cookware was available. I was pleasantly pleased to find that there are many Sensarte cookware items available on Amazon at extremely reasonable prices.I purchased a 8\" & 9.5 egg/omelette skillet, 10\" 3.5 qt skillet, 12\" 5qt skillet, and 1.5 qt, 2 qt & 2.5 qt sauce pans.This cookware is non-stick, cooks evenly, is sturdy and cleans easily. Additionally every single skillet & sauce pan came with a lid, another huge bonus.I have several very expensive pans with the handles attached to the pan itself with rivets, when the rivets come loose, the pans become unusable garbage because the rivets cannot be tightened. The glass lids are a plus and the larger skillets (9.5\", 10\", 11\" & 12\") each come came with a really nice screwdriver to attach the handles. I love it!!! a pan with the ability to tighten the handles with a screw driver is a huge bonus.",

                "reviewText": "The pan is distinct looking, more so than the other standard dark brown-gray non-stick pan color. It is speckled and unique-looking. The faux wood handle is cool though evidently fake. I like that there are very few seams and nook/crannies that collect food debris, burnt stuff that makes it hard to clean. As noted in the description, the pan walls do not have rivets for the handle which makes cleaning this pan much more enjoyable. No more burnt schmutz around the rivet getting brown and nasty. The non-stick works well, I cannot complain about it. I like to turn my flame up to medium -high to almost high and it has held up without turning color on the cooking surface. It also has not gotten tacky/sticky from high heat use so far. Only time will tell. I will report back if it gets bad.We use the pan for stir-frying, making bacon, warming tortillas, pretty much everything. Nothing has stuck and it hasn't turned color. After much cooking in it, I will occasionally fry an egg without oil and it still comes out without sticking, though nothing makes things crisp up like a little oil in the pan. It seems to handle everything like a champ. It can go into the oven with moderate temps in the 300Fs. I haven't tried that yet, however. The lid fits well and works nicely. It has a round knob that screws into the lid so you do have to contend with the occasional loosening screw. I do prefer the metal U-shaped handles because of that. The drawback of the u-shaped handle is that you cannot lay the lid flat on its back like you can with the flat top round handle that comes with this one. It's personal preference.The pan is also lighter than my cast iron (as most pans will be) and we tend to use this more for everyday cooking though for searing meats and hamburgers, nothing beats the infernal heat you can inflict upon a cast iron pan.Overall, the pan seems much more high quality and unique than some of the common non-sticks out there. We are pretty rough with our cookware since they are used a great deal, so I will report back in a little while. It's a nice versatile pan for almost all of your cooking. I would get two for multiple uses at the same time, if it were not for my cast iron skillet.",
