Cooks great and keeping foods from burning is easy. The handles stay cool, which is a nice feature, and the domed glass top is another. For this price, this is a sure bet. Nice work, Michelangelo!",

                "reviewText": "Most of my cookware is stainless steel or cast iron, but I like to have one small, non-stick pan, and my old one was scratched and needed to be replaced. I looked for a pan that was not Teflon that had some thickness and looked like it might last. I also wanted a pan that was guaranteed food safe.This pan is thick and sturdy, and it heats evenly. It is raised very slightly from the outside towards the center, which has both pros and cons, but the raised middle is so slight that it is barely noticeable, and I would not hesitate to cook an omellete in it. It does let the grease drain towards the outside of the pan rather than staying under the food, which it nice. I like the glass cover that lets me see food as it cooks, and it is about as easy to clean as any other glass lid.One caution: the directions say to never use the pan above medium heat, and I have been careful not to do that. Even on medium, the pan heats quickly and gets hot enough, and I have found that at medium temperature the pan cooks very evenly without burning or scorching. However, my gas stove does not have a really high flame or get as hot as some other gas stoves even on the burner with the highest btu, and people with stoves that get really hot will need to be very careful and might need to use low heat rather than medium to avoid damage to the pan. It will depend upon individual stoves. So far, nothing sticks, although I have not tried really sticky cheese yet. It cleans up very nicely with soap and water, and I have not had to scrub it. Time will tell whether or not that lasts.The handle is wood look-alike, and it stays cool when cooking on a stove top. It is very wide - especially where it joins the pan - which makes the pan steadier to hold and pour with less strain on my hand and wrist and without slipping or over-tipping.The only reason for 4 stars is that I personally find this pan kind of ugly because of the speckling and the light-colored wood look-alike handle. That is just my personal taste, and it isn't a serving dish.",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased one of these non-stick pans at the same time my husband purchased a different brand non-stick pan. Me - no trouble whatever I cooked and clean-up was a breeze! My husband's - not so good. I ended up buying him one of these for his use!...pancake and easy-over eggs and things that you \"flip\" - because the food actually flips and doesn't stick! I would highly recommend this. I do not put mine in the dishwasher because I don't want the detergent affecting the wooden handle finish. Actually, no need to put it in there anyway because the clean up is easy - wipe out!! Once in a while I do use some dish detergent to give it a fresh clean, then season it a little like you would an iron skillet. After two years, it still looks new!!",
