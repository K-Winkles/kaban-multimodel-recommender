I bought this 10\" skillet which is the perfect size and I use it all the time, I also have a 12\" skillet but I rarely use it. This 10\" skillet comes with a lid which is great when saut\u00e9ing or frying eggs. T-fal skillets have a nice heft and thick walls, not as heavy as cast iron. The riveted handles and silicon grips are a nice touch.The T-fal skillet I bought is made of all aluminum so it can't stand high heat or work on an induction stove. They also make a skillet that has a stainless steel base for induction burners for a few dollars more.",

                "reviewText": "Does this pan need another review? Well, probably not, but a few thoughts on how it compares to far more expensive non-stick pans.A pan of this size (10 inch) is my regular go-to pan 3 to 4 times a week. In the last 12-15 years or so, I have worn out the non-stick properties of the following (all saut\u00e9 pans of approximately the same size): an early version Emirlware (made by Calphalon), a Calphalon, a Swiss Diamond and a Scanpan. These pans were all relatively expensive, made in either Europe or the U.S., except for the Emrilware, which was made in Korea. They were (are) all excellent pans, Over time, however, each became less and less non-stick. (Also, along the way, I bought one of the those \"green pan\" things, but the non-stick on it didn't last six months, and from the start, it really wasn't that non-stick)UPDATE 3/31/2017It's almost a year later, and I am still using the T-fal The nonstick is holding up surprisingly well; not quite as slick as a year ago, but still works fine. I don't baby this thing either. I am a fan of America's Test Kitchen and if you watch the show you will notice they frequently preheat these pans to fairly high temperatures , something that T-fal actually tells you not to. Following ATK's lead I preheat mine also, and while I am sure it doesn't do it any good, it certainly has not destroyed it. I will mention again, I have no complaints about the other non-stick pans i have had in the past (other than to say the \"green pan\" really wasn't very non-stick) but I have concluded there is no any reason to spend the extra money. I am not a shill for Scanpan by the way, just reporting my personal real world experience.Based on the \"Cooks Country\" recommendation I decided to try this pan, It is a surprisingly hefty pan. It is not a true saut\u00e9 pan, but deep enough. I thought I would be giving up some performance because of the price. To my surprise, it performs just as well as the other pans which cost 5 to 10 time more. I don't know how long the non-stick will last, but even if it lasts half as long as the others, it will be much more cost effective to use and replace than the others.Non-stick pans are obviously not the right choice for every use, but used as an \"everyday\" pan I have concluded, as apparently as have many others, that non-stick pans are temporary. (Not here to take issue with the non-stick qualities of well seasoned cast iron, but for all of its virtues, cast iron has its own disadvantages.) By the way, I cook on a gas stove, I don't know how this pan will perform on other heat sources.Update 12/08/2018Still using this pan as my everyday pan. The non-stick is still effective to some extent, but not of course as effective as when new. For saut\u00e9, most fried foods that use a little oil or butter, still working fine. Not so good for fired eggs, but i have a small dedicated non-stick I use only for eggs. After two and one/half years of use on an average of 3 times a week or more, I can say that I have been as happy with this pan as any of the far more expensive pans I have used in the past. I will probably replace it sometime in the next year with another just like it to get back to the full non-stick properties it had when new, but for most uses I really don\u2019t need to.As long as they make this pan, (and don\u2019t change it!) and sell it at this price point, this is the one I am going to continue to buy and replace every few years.Update. 12/08/2018In my 2017 update I referred to the this pan (the T-fal) as a Scanpan. I have tried to (unsecessfully) correct did the review. I hope it is clear in context that I was referring to the T-fal.",

It\u2019s a breeze to clean up with just a paper towel. I have washed it a few times when something was burnt on, but all it needed was warm water, no detergent. I only had to let it sit for a few minutes and the burnt food slid right off. I\u2019m very impressed, having had disappointing experiences with non-stick fry pans in the past which lost their non-stickiness very quickly. I\u2019ve had it a couple of months now, and use it practically every day. Looks just as good as new. The other thing I really like about it is that it is perfectly flat, and with a ceramic top, this is important.",
