                "reviewText": "To alleviate some of the doubt the negative reviews might generate, you can never go wrong with cast iron. New cast should be brought up to temp gradually to avoid warping or breakage. If not thoroughly dried (towel then heat), moisture will creep through the seasoning and rust will appear--it is iron.I bought this as a filler set, small pans to fill in for the larger skillets. In the photo, the skillet on the right is the 10\" from the set. On the left is an actual 10\" skillet 30+ years old, complete with \"10\" clearly marked in the handle. By today's standards, it would be a 12\".While using dish soap is OK with some and taboo with others, I'm with the no soap crowd since dish soap is a degreaser, which softens the seasoning, which can also lead to rust spots from the moisture in the air. Instead, I clean my pans with baking soda as it not only cleans the pan, it removes left over odors, such as fish, then hand dry before putting it on the stove to heat through. If you want your cast iron to be non-stick, never use metal utensils as it scratches the seasoning the same as it would any non-stick pots or pans.Any oil is good for daily use, but once or twice a week (depending on use) I recommend using Crisbee Rub, which contains beeswax, for an ultra smooth surface. Keep in mind that pre-seasoned pans are not seasoned pans per se. Rather, they have an initial coating to protect them and get the buyer started. Still, with a little cleaning, they are good right out of the box for many uses where sticking isn't a concern.",

This nifty little triplet come in different sizes, with the smaller two hardly being big enough to fit anything more than one or two fried eggs in. Oh, and they're pretty hefty (but manageable).Size often doesn't matter, it's what you can do or want to do with it, obviously. However, I used only the largest pan. They come \"preseasoned\" that makes it appear and the average person think that it's ready to use out of the box; but do not be fooled by this claim.I put it to the test and used the largest pan right out of the box - the meat was sticking and left an awful residue on the bottom of the pan. I scrubbed it until what seemed like my fingers would bleed and finally got it to a point where I thought it was clean. Onto the next trial!I stripped the pans. And then I reseasoned them quite a few times over a 12 hour period, and then once more the next day. Yes, the smell was not nice but I figured these seemed durable and well made so might as well give them a second chance. I tried the same meal later, unfortunately same issue - things sticking to the bottom and making it nearly impossible to clean.I've never had a problem with cast irons sticking so much. Not sure what's up with these, but preseason or self season didn't seem to want to stick on the pan.",

Aber die Skepsis ist unberechtigt, qualitativ kommt es nicht ganz an die Burnhardt heran, aber dennoch, nach einigen Einbrenndurchg\u00e4ngen mit Lein\u00f6l im Backofen, entsteht eine sehr sch\u00f6ne Oberfl\u00e4che, die ein tolles Bratergebnis liefert und danach nur mit hei\u00dfem Wasser und Schwamm einfach ges\u00e4ubert wird. Die Oberfl\u00e4che ist im Vergleich nicht ganz so homogen verarbeitet, wie die teure Pfanne, aber das ist jammern auf hohem Niveau und f\u00e4llt nur im direkten Vergleich auf. Von schlecht kann man hier ganz und gar nicht reden. Generell gilt aber f\u00fcr alle Gusseisenpfannen, das sie etwas mehr Pflege ben\u00f6tigen. Man sollte sie nur komplett getrocknet beiseite stellen und mit dem ein oder anderen Tr\u00f6pfchen \u00d6l verteilt auf der Oberfl\u00e4che, macht man sicher auch nichts falsch.

I washed the pans with clean, hot water. Dried them thoroughly, then applied a very small coating of oil to the surface. I cannot stress enough that only a small amount is needed for this. The best thing is to put oil into the pan and wipe it around with a clean cloth. Remove as much as you can.Then remove some more. It looks as if there is no oil in the pan. Now I put the pan onto a medium/high heat and watched it. It will smoke but that's ok. When it stops smoking, it is done. Let it cool down and it is seasoned.Tip: for eggs, use butter to ensure a non-stick fried egg.",
