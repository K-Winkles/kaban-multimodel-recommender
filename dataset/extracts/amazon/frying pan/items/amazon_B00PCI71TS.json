                "reviewText": "This review is for OXO Good Grips Pro 12\" Frying Pan Skillet, 3-Layered German Engineered Nonstick Coating, Dishwasher Safe, Oven Safe, Stainless Steel Handle, Black. I purchased this for a house member who really likes nonstick cookware. I ordered this one, because Cook's Illustrated America's Test Kitchen rated it the best. It's a very nice pan, and we have used it many times so far. The nonstick surface is holding up very well, and it is definitely nonstick. We have cooked eggs, meat, chicken, fish, and other items in it. Nothing stuck to the pan. We only hand wash it, and we only use non-metal utensils with it. The weight of the pan is good, and the handle is comfortable and ergonomic. All-in-all this is a great pan if you are looking for something nonstick.A side note about nonstick pans:I am generally not a fan of nonstick pans. I don't like cooking with something that is a part of planned obsolescence. All nonstick cookware slowly starts to wear down with use. It is just the nature of it. So, eventually all nonstick cookware has to be replaced, as eventually it will lose its nonstick properties. This brings me to the other part that I don't like. Nonstick cookware uses chemical products to make it nonstick, and those chemicals wind up in your food. Reports claim the chemicals are safe, but you have to judge your level of confidence in the reports. I don't see a benefit to having added chemicals in my food. Also, you can't use metal utensils with nonstick pans, as the metal will damage the nonstick coating. This generally means one set of non-metal cooking utensils and a separate set of metal utensils to use with your standard cookware. So, I have two sets of cooking utensils. Also, different nonstick cookware will have different maximum temperature ratings. This pan is rated up to 430 F degrees. If you go above that you breakdown the chemical nonstick coating, which not only ruins the nonstick coating, but it also puts those chemicals into your food. I once had a different brand of nonstick pan many years ago that I cooked an omelette in. The nonstick coating had broken down and left all sorts of black flakes on my omelette, so both the omelette and pan went into the garbage. Personally, I prefer to go with a high-quality, multi-clad, stainless steel set of pots & pans that I can use any utensils on that I like and will last me forever. However, if you are going to purchase a nonstick pan this one is an excellent choice because it is a good pan and at a good price point for replacement.",

                "reviewText": "This was featured in America's Test Kitchen as their \"best value\" pick and I agree. There are cheaper pans, but the OXO product is dependable and solid. Try this: take your current non-stick pan and heat it to 350 F and crack an egg right onto it. Dry. No butter, oil or non-stick spray. Make yourself an over-easy egg. Did it release, or make a mess? ATK claims they do this 50 times per pan in their stress test. I tried it, and it works perfectly every time. I didn't realize you could cook eggs without a thick layer of non-stick spray, but this pan does it with ease. The handle is comfortable and makes it easy to manipulate. It's my new 'go-to' pan when it's time to make breakfast.",

                "reviewText": "This is a replacement after I sent back the pan bought previously due to defects. There was a deep scratch on the coating that was too obvious and may affect the usage. I was refunded shortly after. On the flip side, it shows how thick the coating is which is great, as well as a good reminder to care for pan. But overall, its light, has a good handle and heats up evenly, and with no sticking food. Have had Tefal over the years, but this feels even better to the hands and performs really great in comparison. May get the 12\" next, but for now this is good.",
