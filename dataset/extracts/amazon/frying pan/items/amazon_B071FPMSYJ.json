Seasoning is cooking oil that has been baked onto the iron, forming a natural, easy-release finish for less sticking. The more you use your cast iron, the better your seasoning will become, making your cast iron darker and smoother over time. Lodge products are perfect for everything from baking to braising, frying to roasting. MADE IN THE USA Tucked between the Appalachian Mountains and the Tennessee River you\u2019ll find the small town of South Pittsburg, TN; a town that Lodge is proud to call home. It\u2019s built on family values, American history, and high quality cast iron. All Lodge products are proudly made in the USA, meaning you\u2019ll get the craftsmanship that has been passed down through generations. For over 100 years Lodge has been dedicated to manufacturing quality cast iron products, that can be passed down from one generation to the next. Lodge is happy to be at home on your table. CLEANING & CARE There\u2019s nothing better than a home-cooked meal, and Lodge\u2019s rust-resistant line just made that easier. Items in this line undergo a patented heat-treating process to inhibit rust. Hand washing this pan with warm soapy water is recommended to preserve the cookware\u2019s seasoned finish. For extra stuck-on bits, an occasional trip through the dishwasher is fine, just apply a thin coat of cooking oil to it afterward to maintain the seasoning. Lodge prides itself on high quality and timeless design, which has now been matched with new technology and convenience.",

But they're extremely prone to rust (I can already see some developing on the bottom of mine) and due to their nature hard to clean, you can't just toss them in a dishwasher. Otherwise great cookware which has the potential to last forever.",

                "reviewText": "I was raised with a cast iron skillet on the stove top. We prepared most of our meals in this one skillet. It really takes a while to truly season this type of skillet. My husband was low on iron which was the initial reason for my purchase. The second reason is that I have had numerous Teflon coated products over the years and none last. Stainless steel will not give you the iron supplement that these skillets do.",

I also rated 2 of 5 for 'Heat resistance' only because the pan heats up very well and you need oven mits to handle when it's hot. Great product to have for health benefits with iron content; don't need iron supplements. I'm very happy with these lodge pre-season pans.",

Pre- seasoned nennen die das aber besser ist es die Pfannen noch mal einzubrennen (einreiben mit Pflanzen\u00f6l und im Grill oder Ofen bei 200 f\u00fcr eine Stunde einbrennen). Ansonsten bin ich jetzt happy mit den Pfannen- sie werden immer besser. Mir ist aufgefallen dass die kleinste Pfanne eine etwas grobere Oberfl\u00e4che hat. Ansonsten hat bei mir Lodge klar gewonnen. Am besten zu reinigen! Es sei denn man vergleicht mit Staub aus dem Elsass... aber das ist eine andere Geschichte und eine andere Preisklasse.",

I bought a 10.25 inch last year and have used it everyday, a few times a day, ever since I got them. Love it so much that I kept an eye out for this set because I needed the 12 inch/30cm pan and it was a fantastic price on Amazon. $120.83AUD delivered! Of course at that price I had to buy 2 sets!I love my Le Creuset Dutch ovens and I also have the Le Creuset 10.25 inch/26cm skillet however as soon as I got my first Lodge 10.25 inch skillet I have never looked back. With Lodge you can be really rough with it.I caramelise onions in a jiffy, create nice crusts on steaks, brown mince in no time, cook the perfect eggs, the list is endless. The reason why I prefer my Lodge Skillet over my Le Creuset Skillet is the heat up time (Le Creuset takes a much longer time to heat) plus there's a HUGE difference in price.",
