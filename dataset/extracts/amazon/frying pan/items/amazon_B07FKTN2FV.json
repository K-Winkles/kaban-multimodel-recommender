Used to a heavier unit... the non stick is non stick and proven to be extremely durable... This is the real deal... I use this pan more than any other... it cleans up easier than ANY pan I have ever used... been cooking since I was kid so that would be 50 years of experience with expensive cookware as well as more affordable..... the 100 year old cast iron pans are great...certain recipes will always use these.....but, honestly this one takes so little time to clean and care for and produces wonderful results... truly impressed... A great pan... awesome",

Tried making an omelet -- no butter in pan unlike what I usually do. When i tried to flip it, oh no, it stuck to the pan! Clean up involved the rough side of a scrubby sponge. Used medium heat. Maybe that was too high. Tried again with fried eggs today--low heat. Flipped the eggs --stuck again!Not sure if I'm going to keep it. Will try again using my usual butter or olive oil. Too bad it's just not what I expected -- or as advertised!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this pan Nov 11 2018.It is now July 17 2019, I specifically waited a long time to review this pan because I wanted to give it the test of time and day to day use of cooking.This pan has been amazing since day one, the build quality, the design of the handle, the aesthetics, the functionality, everything. Everyone in my family has been loving it, especially my sister who recently went on a diet which she had to cut oil from her cooking for chicken and eggs and everything.Everyone knows when you cook eggs or chicken without oil on a pan, It is going to stick no question about that..That is where GRANITEROCK comes in.. This pan is probably one of few as seen on TV products that doesn't lie in their exaggerated infomercials, I put through all the tests and it reigned supreme, some crumbs and residue might stick but minimal amount but the cleaning of this pan only requires light scrubbing and everything comes off with ease, no hassle with cleaning.. The handle is designed smart that it doesn't give off heat when you hold it, it keeps cool to the touch no matter what.After this pan came out a lot of big household companies that we know like T-FAL and CUISINE-ART made their own but this one is the OG and really is the best, don't waste your time and money on the others.I will include a video of cooking eggs on the GRANITEROCK with ZERO oil added, watch it glide off the pan with no residue or left over egg. It's quite amazing and this was after a 8 months of ownership, it still does it like the first day I got it.Get this pan, you won't be disapointed.",
