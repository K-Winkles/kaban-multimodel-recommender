                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best non-stick pan I've ever owned - a few tips on care...",
                "reviewText": "This is an absolutely phenomenal non-stick pan for the price. I'd actually pay twice the price for it, honestly. The base is hefty and thick, the handle stays fairly cool (unless you put it in the oven, of course) and it is very durable. There's not a single scratch on the coating so far, although I will note that I try to avoid using metal utensils on it as much as possible. It's still super non-stick and food just slides right out of the pan, even gyoza!I believe that the issues some other reviewers have had can be remedied by these tips:- Do not use olive oil for sauteing in this pan, if you can avoid it. Butter, coconut oil and vegetable oils like sunflower, avocado (my favorite), grapeseed or peanut oils are better choices. I believe that olive oil tends to leave a residue on the pan when it is heated too high, which is difficult to remove. Also DO NOT use non-stick spray in this pan! It's worse than olive oil and can bind to the ceramic.- Although the coating can stand up to metal utensils, try to avoid using them during cooking. I've found that serving out of the pan with metal spoons or tongs has been fine, but wood, bamboo or silicone should be used for the actual cooking process just to be on the safe side.- Do not heat the pan to hotter than 400F, or a medium to medium-high heat on the burner.- Don't heat up the pan with nothing in it. Always have some oil, butter or water in it while heating.- If you find the pan is becoming difficult to clean or seems to be losing its non-stick properties, try using Le Creuset enamel cleaner. This will restore the surface of the ceramic and remove any baked on residue from oils.- Never put this pan in the dishwasher. Ever! Only hand wash with mild liquid dish soap and a sponge or plastic brush.Following these steps, my pan is still like new after daily use. It really is a high quality pan at an amazing price- you just need to take care of it and use it properly, as you would any specialty pan like an enameled cast iron or Teflon one. Each of them have special care needs and this one isn't any different, but it's definitely worth it for such an excellent, non-toxic pan!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a square pan after seeing it on a video. I love to cook and make nice looking omelettes. Plus, I love to cut and fry spam, which has a weird shape for round frying pans. So, I researched all the square pans on Amazon, as well as elsewhere online and settled on this. I was hesitant because some buyers complained of things which concerned me, like the pan burning, etc. I use this on an Inversion Stovetop exclusively and have been using it for about a month, multiple times. I spray it with non-stick spray prior to frying (or no oil at all with spam) and have had absolutely no problems. No burning, no difficulty washing, no signs of the coating coming off and no burning marks. Very easy to clean and it is my go-to pan most times. I use a larger round cover if I want to steam anything or I can even cover with foil, but no lie, this pan is sturdy, very well made and worth every cent!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pan at the same time as a Vesuvio and a Moneta Azul Finegres. i know that some reviewers here have said that their box said tis pan contains teflon, it does not, that was a misprint, I contacted Techef USA from their website and asked, this is truly PTFE (Teflon) and PFOA free. I was looking for cookware not made in China, so I love that this pan is made in South Korea. The non-stick performance of this Techef Cerraterra is great and I already knew very well how to care for it to keep it performing. It is a great size for small crepes and omelets, the slope of the side is little more than I'd like for sliding things out but the release is so good it still works very well. The handle is comfortable and ergonomic, and this pan cooked evenly and heated up quickly too. I did find that the rivets tended to retain stuff it seemed no matter how hard I tried to clean around them and I would sometimes get dribbles coming out of them as I preheated the pan, but on my next Techef I will be more careful to not get food/oil/butter that high in the pan as to collect under the rivets. I say next pan because I did end up killing this pan. I accidentally left it unattended preheating oil too long and it carbonized really badly, and though I was able to remove all of it there was a small coin sized patch that was never non-stick again even despite the baking soda trick. This pan is affordable enough though that I have no problem buying a replacement and I also plan on buying one for my mother who has arthritis in her wrists and could use a small, light weight, high performing non-stick, healthy pan.",
