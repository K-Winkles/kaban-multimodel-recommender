                "reviewText": "I previously used metal pans when I worked in restaurants, but that was decades ago. I've been using mostly teflon pans since then. After I got these, I ruined the first one by trying to wipe water out of a hot pan with a kitchen towel that had some sort of plastic texturing. STUPID. I've been trying to clean/repair it, but I think the pan is a loss.I moved on to the second size, confident in my ability to resurrect my old kitchen skills. After one or two rough starts and watching a few videos, I finally figured out the basic \"formula\" for using a steel pan. Now, I love it. These pans are sturdy, easy to clean, and make you feel fancy. Just watch a few videos and practice cooking with them.",

                "reviewText": "The bottom isn't as heavy as I'd hoped but warming the pan on low or medium heat before cooking . The heat distribution is a little more complicated. I prepared the pan per the instructions, fill the pan 2/3 full of water and white vinegar and boil. The only boil area was in the center of the bottom which was over the burner, and it was a very well-defined border. I do like the removable handle, it makes it easier to wash in the sink. And hand washing is necessary. The ultra-cheap little 'wrench' they supply is too small, it doesn't fit. You'll want to get an inexpensive 10mm nut driver to keep in your kitchen junk drawer. In spite of these less than perfect characteristics, I still give it 5 stars because of the low price. You can easily find a better pan but you'll pay a lot more. I try not to have champagne expectations on a beer budget.",

Like the weight, like the high sides (much higher than most every brand in the stores) and you can remove the handles and clean if you want (when food gets gunked up). Just not consistent with what sticks or doesn't, no matter how well we've followed directions on seasoning, oil, heating and such. And, we had lids that \"mostly\" fit on the two smallest and one that fit perfectly on the big pan. All in all, a very good buy. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using my Delarlo pans for 2.5 months, 2-3 times per week. Cleaning after frying is very difficult, no matter what tips and tricks I use. I made sure to study up on all the right methods of taking care of stainless steel, from how to prevent food from sticking to how to clean them. These pans are a nightmare to clean after frying, no matter what, especially the sides, and even if you don\u2019t burn anything. A lot of elbow grease plus a lot of baking soda and a scouring pad, and even with all that, I have to wash the pan 2-3 times to get everything off. Oil bakes onto (gets brown and stuck on) the sides of the pans extremely easily. The pans also don\u2019t seem to heat sauces evenly (bubbles aren\u2019t evenly distributed), which makes me question the quality of the tri-ply design. Also, the smallest pan got a random large scratch/streak on it that I have no idea how it developed.The handle design is great, though, and doesn\u2019t overheat/burn my hands, and I like that the rivets aren\u2019t on the cooking side of the pans. The edges of the Delarlo pans aren\u2019t sharp or uncomfortable like some other brands (Cuisinart, for example). It's also great that they come with extra rivet screws. The price of the set of 3 pans is unbeatable; I got mine on sale for $88.55. Overall, I think these pans are practically as good as other more expensive brands of stainless steel. The nightmare to clean has me questioning whether stainless steel frying pans is the right call for me.",

                "reviewText": "The diamond like pattern works well at keeping food from sticking. I bought the pan to test the technology. This was the cheapest pan that had the hybrid technology. I think it was a good buy. When the pan came, I washed it and decided to cook an egg. I put the pan on med heat and put some olive in the pan. Like the manufacturer claims, the oil stuck and spread itself evenly. I put the egg in and it cooked evenly. I think I had the heat up a little too high, but will test it as I use it more. Maybe Med-Low next time. The egg cooked evenly and didn't stick as advertised. I used my silicone spatula so I haven't yet tested the claim that you can safely use metal utensils. The egg slid right out of the pan and clean up was super easy. The only concern I have is the rim of the pan is turning brown... After just one use...! We'll see how it holds up. Also the pan is a very lightweight and I am a little concerned about how even it distributes heat. But I will admit, the egg did cook evenly so I'll need to test it a little more to get a feel for how well heat is distributed. The diamond pattern is attractive to look at and the 6\" pan is barely big enough to cook an egg or hold a slice of bread. The egg did taste great though. So for the moment, I'm impressed.",
