                "reviewText": "For this price, this pan is pretty good value! I bought this as an every day non-stick that I don't have to worry about too much (in addition to my Zwilling for french ommelettes and such). It heats up very quickly with decent heat distribution. The base is even and does an alright job at keeping oil in the center of the pan. I haven't experienced any distortion of the base yet, even though I've left it on higher heat than I should at times. The non-stick seems to be holding up too and it's very easy to clean. Definitely not the best nonstick I've ever used, but I'm happy using this for every day quick scrambled eggs and such :)Edit: I ordered the 8 inch first and it was TINY! Looked smaller than the 8 inch pan I was replacing. Reodered the 10.5 inch and it's the perfect size for making a large omelette or a quesadilla.",

                "reviewText": "I have used it several times and its great. However if after months the surface comes off I have no way of knowing that and not sure if it will allow me to give another review after a period of months. Be sure the buy the lid which I did not since I have alot of the glass lids which I thought would fit since there about 3 main generic sizes but the 10.5 diameter is unusual so you should pay for the lid. I am 68 and the people that say the coating can come off I bet they were overheated or food got forgotten and burned dry. It is non stick however eggs dont slide around which I prefer they dont but you touch the eggs they fly right out. also the black color helps with heat--white or copper colored pans do not cook right and you can tell it. also the handle is light weight--it does not force the pan to tilt--such as pans where the eggs slide over to one side-it sits flat and with the rubbery handle you can pick it right up. The pan does not have a super thick stainless steel bottom like expensive pans but the benefit is its very light weight such as for picking it up also for moving where you dont load up a ton of cast iron. If people are older its hard to pick up a super heavy pan and exerts extreme force on the wrist this one dosent. BUT BUY THE LID. lid is specifically designed for the exact pan. you wont find one at goodwill.",
