                "reviewText": "Quick review: Best pan I ever had, I am looking to buy more of these because every time I buy something and I truly love it, they disappear, so I am going buy more and put them away for future use.I was so tired of trying new pans, only to have to get rid of them because they warped, or were not as non-stick as they promised, or the coating on the pan started to deteriorate, or you had to \"Season\" the pan, which never lasts. I like using non-stick pans because I do a lot of cooking. I cook for the VFW, the Moose Lodge, and for disabled Veterans that are in need of some help. I was out shopping one day and found the 7\" pan on sale, I bought it as an egg pan and put it in my cabinet, three months later when my last pan warped I took it out and used it. I was impressed and after using it for about a month, decided to search for other pans of the same brand, make and model and found these ones. I bought them and I have never been more satisfied. So much so that I send a set of them to my mother on mother's day, and she now thanks me all the time for them.Here is what I like about them. First, to say that they are non-stick is truly an accurate description, I make gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches with three types of cheese and the cheese does not stick, I cook eggs with less than half a teaspoon of butter, and if you like you can cook them without butter, and yes you can use a spatula and the eggs do not stick. Cleanup is even after cooking bacon where the bitts and bobs stick to the bottom of the pan is as simple as running water in the pan and they slide out. Plus the outside of the pan is coated with something that grease does not stick to very well. Every pan I have had gets a black crust on the bottom because I flip things without a spatula and a bit of grease always runs down the outside of the pan and gets baked on, but with this pan, an easy, and I do mean easy wipe with a scrub pad and it's gone. The pan has a 2mm diffuser at the bottom build into the pan and it makes it durable, strong and warp proof.The one and only problem with the pan. When I first started to use the pan there was a chemical smell that come off the pan or the handle, I think it was the handle. I might have had the flame up to high and it heated the silicone rubber or whatever the handle is made of to a higher temp and the smell was not pleasant. I now keep the pan slightly off center of the burner so that the handle is further away from the flame and I do not have that problem anymore. This may be due to my new stove, I hate it as the flames are an inch further away from the bottom of my pans and I have to use higher heat to even boil water. So, I don't think it is the pans fault, but my stoves fault.",

                "reviewText": "These pans are amazing for their non-stick surface. The entire brand is an excellent value for the price/product. However, I've done everything recommended to extend their life and I still only got a year out of the pan before things started to stick. I use felt liners when storing the pans to keep the nonstick surface from being damaged. I only use silicon cooking tools, keep the heat medium-low, and I use oil, not cooking spray. That's a lot of effort to keep a pan and it only last a year. Two years is what I would expect. However, the pan is affordable, it's not a terrible thing to have to buy one annually. If i find another brand that works as well and lasts longer I'll switch.",
