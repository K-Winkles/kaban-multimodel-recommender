More importantly, this pan actually delivers on its promises of quality, unlike pretty much every single pan under $100 out there. It is truly nonstick, without the toxic materials. It\u2019s heavy, but you don\u2019t need a crane to lift it like cast iron. And it truly sits flat and steady on my glass stovetop. It doesn\u2019t wobble around, and oil sits in the dead center without rolling to the sides. It heats and cooks very evenly, as well. If you\u2019re between this pan and one of those $40-50 14\u201d pan options on Amazon, don\u2019t hesitate and spend the extra $10-20 for this pan. You won\u2019t regret it.",

What I mean is that the sides are taller, the pan is thicker, and the coating appears to be better. The coating on my set has worn off of two pans. Thankfully Analon made it good via the lifetime warranty.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this 2 months ago. Have used it several dozen times.Will it wear out in a few years? Maybe. If so, I'll buy another without complaints. If they only rented this pan for $10/year, I'd sign a lifelong agreement, it's that good.This is an awesome pan, and no matter what else you own, spring for $20 and change and get one of these. Great price for gifting, too, which I'm considering right now.This is my go-to pan now, and I only pick another if I need bigger or want cast iron. Otherwise, this is it. You can NOT go wrong. Silicone handle means it doesn't get hot and can go in the oven up to 400\u00b0. The metal tip at the end does not get hot on the stove, although the metal part of the handle right next to the pan does. So you do have to be a little careful.The only thing that would make me up my rating to 5.5 stars is if the silicone handle extended another 1/2\" or so closer to the pan, but then it would be exposed to gas flames and might melt, or whatever silicone does when it's overheated. But the silicone part is big enough for my hand; just be normally cautious and you'll be fine. I wasn't once and I didn't burn myself much, just an annoyance that taught me to be a little more careful.Eggs for one or two people are what this pan is perfect for.It is the only pan I've ever owned that I considered more than just a utilitarian pan. This is a work of art. The color, the weight, the balance, the handle, the temperature tolerance. I guess that's both art and engineering. Even if you don't need the pan, buy one and use it as a coffee table conversation piece.One last practical comment. If you own an infrared thermometer, I encourage you to use it the first few times you use the pan to see how hot you're getting it based on your burner settings. Then you shouldn't have to worry about it. The pan is so small that it will heat up fast and hot, and you could go over the 500\u00b0 limit if you went to high heat and weren't cooking much in it. No reason at all to destroy this pan if you use a little common sense. The 400\u00b0 limit for traditional Teflon was one I never seemed to be able to stay within, and I cooked many a Teflon pan in the past. This Dupont Autograph 2 coating is wonderful and should last years if you don't abuse it.Oh, and if you don't own an infrared thermometer, why not? Amazon has them as cheap as a dozen bucks. I can't attest to how good one would be that's that cheap, but do your research. I bought a Maverick on here a couple years ago for $38 and it's been one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's extremely accurate; I have a Thermapen and have tested both with ice water and boiling water and the Maverick is within 1\u00b0 accuracy (Thermapen is obviously the gold standard here and it was right on as well). It'll pay for itself by helping you avoid ruining food and pans in the kitchen, and will let you run around the house checking temperatures of walls, furniture, whatever. You'll be able to better balance your heating system by adjusting vents. You'll be able to test sleeping people to be sure they're still alive. And the laser beam is great entertainment for pets. So many uses!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "The first thing that impressed me with this pan was its weight. Of course, it's light compared with cast iron but heavier than most non-stick pans I've had. The fact that it's 8.5 inches makes a difference when flipping bread for French toast. I used it to cook a cold sear steak. I'd seen a video on youtube using a non-stick pan for that method and it worked very well. I hate to think how difficult cleaning was with cast iron because with this pan it's so easy!",

                "reviewText": "My old 10 and 12 inch non stick fry pans finally died from overuse, and I was forced to replace them. Little did I know how many choices and price points were out there. They ranged from dirt cheap to ridiculous. I eventually came upon my new favorites made by Anolon.I have nothing but praise for this company. The pans are a joy to use in part because of the handle design which give the pans a nice balance and a more secure feel. This is especially important if you\u2019re in a busy kitchen or at home. The construction is first rate; heavy aluminum with a nice nonstick surface. No short cuts here in quality.And the best part is the price: I got both pans for what the fancier brands were charging for only one.",
