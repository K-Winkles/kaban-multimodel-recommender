                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this pan. Now, to be fair, I've only had it two weeks but I've used it nearly ever day, often multiple times a day, and don't exactly go easy on my pans. I was looking for a large, deep pan to make life easier when preparing stir fries and other single-pan meals without having to resort to a heavier pot or wok. I was specifically looking for something with tall, curved sides that enabled the tossing/flipping of food, yet had a nice, large cooking surface like a standard 12inch frying pan. I have a couple 'deep' pans with straight sides and they're okay but you can't toss/flip food with them.I tried a T-Fal pan first that was listed as 'deep' and the photos seemed to confirm that (and was $20 more than this pan), but what I got was no deeper than any of the other 'normal' pans I have. Very disappointing and I returned it right away.Next I tried this pan (Rachael Ray Create Delicious Deep Nonstick Frying Pan / Fry Pan / Skillet - 12.5 Inch, Blue, $29.11 at time of purchase) and was immediately thrilled right out of the box. The size and shape are exactly what I was looking for. It's not super heavy, making it easy to use and clean, and the curved sides makes tossing/flipping food easy peasy. While the pan didn't come with a lid, the glass lid from my 12inch Calphalon stainless steel pan fits perfectly (I think the lid fits this pan better than the Calphalon it came with), so I lucked out there.I've made all kinds of dishes so far, including stir fries, pasta dishes, salmon filets, pan fried chicken, burgers, fried eggs, scrambled eggs and hash, omelets, grilled cheese, breakfast burritos, etc., etc. Not a single \"uh oh\" moment along the way. The pan cooks evenly with no sticking or discernable hot spots.Physically the pan is doing great (again, only two weeks along). No dings or dents, no chipped or scratched paint, the bottom looks great and the cooking surface shows no signs of abnormal wear or warping. That said, because this pan has already become my daily driver I'll do an update down the road to see how it's holding up. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this pan. If this pan holds up it'll be the best $30 I ever spent on cookware.",

                "reviewText": "I perform a moderate level of cooking (I am no pro, but I can feed myself reasonably well!), and what I needed was a larger pan to cook bacon (no, I don't cook bacon in the oven, nor do I use a griddle--too hard to control grease splatters). It is indeed easy to clean, and after perhaps using it ten times in the last month, I see no scratches on the bottom. If I see them after further use, I will add an additional review.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this pan! It\u2019s a great size diameter and has a great depth to it. I use a large lid from one of my other old pans and it fits perfectly on top. Unfortunately, after just its first use, when I want to wash it, it had light scratches on it. Not through the coating but they were there and I used only silicone utensils on it. Since then, I have noticed two or three more scratches that have actually gone through the coating. The only metal utensil I ever used on this, and only ONE time was a whisk. I was very careful not to make contact with the pan itself. Even so, the rounded edges should not have scratched this the very few times I may have lightly brushed the whisk against it. For some reason when I left a similar view right after Buying this, Amazon flagged it and blocked it, saying it does not meet their standards. I don\u2019t know what they meant by that because there was nothing offensive in the original review. We\u2019ll see if they let us go through this time.",
