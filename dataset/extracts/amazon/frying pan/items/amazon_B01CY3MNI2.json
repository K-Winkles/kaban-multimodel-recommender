Aerosol cooking spray leaves a gummy residue that is difficult to remove, and that residue will cause food to stick. Instead, use an oil mister filled with olive or vegetable oil, or dab a bit of oil on a paper towel and carefully wipe the interior of the pan. - Use the correct heat setting. Use low heat for warming, simmering and preparing sauces; use medium heat for frying, grilling, saut\u00e9ing, searing or stir-frying; use high heat for boiling or reducing liquids. - Preheat the pan. Nonstick cookware can take a minute or two longer to preheat compared to aluminum or stainless steel cookware. For best results, make sure your nonstick pan is heated to the proper temperature before adding food.",

                "reviewText": "The size and contours of the pan are fine for omelets - smoothly sloping sides and capacity for a 2 or 3 egg omelet. The finish seems fine. This is the \"Classic\" line which might mean it is less sturdy than similar \"restaurant quality\" pans. The weight is noticeably less than some pans and the handle is way to short. That may be because of not wanting to overbalance the weight of the handle relative to the weight of the pan, but it makes it difficult for me to grip the handle without getting my hand uncomfortably close to the heated pan. All that said, it made a good omelet, first try, no pan seasoning needed.",

This is a great weight, handle feels great, and really holds up. For the size and weight, this is my perfect workhorse for a single serve meal-in-a-pan, a saute prep pan, or a quick fry.",
