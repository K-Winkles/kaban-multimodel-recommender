                "reviewText": "Update: The handle is a great concept. However if you push the pan too far in on top of stove you will melt the handle. Didnt think about that, thought it was much sturdier. So now when i hold the handle as i cook the handle makes it slip and rock and its not as tight of a hold anymore because the insdie of the handle that connected to the pan melted. Ill have to come back and update after I figure out the warranty.I am really surprised with this non-stick pan. Most that claim that they are non-stick are really just terrible. This.... this one right here! This is the one. If that wasn't enough the pan comes with a class cover, The FLIPPING HANDLE COMES OFF!!!!!! I LOVE THIS FEATURE SO MUCH!!!!! It also came with a really good spatula, tongs, an apron, AND a scrubber! For the price thats an amazing, AMAZING price!!! You really cant go wrong with this one!",
