                "reviewText": "Farberware brand has been synonymous in our family for as long as I can remember. My mother had Farberware, my sister and I have Farberware and our children will ALL have Farberware products in their households. I even snagged all my mother\u2019s Farberware pots when she passed away and still use them to this day. I just bought my grandson's wife her first set of Farberware pots and pans for Christmas. She called me immediately when she opened the huge box I sent to her in Canada and she couldn't stop screaming with delight over her new pots and pans because of the quality, the shape of the handle, and the ease of cooking with them. Yes, she had already started cooking in them when she called me. I bought her a starter set - one 0.625 quarts, Stainless Steel Butter Warmer/Small Saucepan, two 1-quart, two 2-quart, two 3-quart Non-stick Pan/with lid, one 16-quart stock pot/with lid, one Glide Deep Nonstick Frying Pan-12.5 inch, and one Glide Ceramic Nonstick Saute Pan with lid and Helper Handle 4-quart. I know what all of you are thinking right now \u2013 that this was an expensive purchase on my part. However, when you have a growing family of five and you want to have the best tools/pots to make the best meals for a lifetime \u2013 you buy Farberware. I\u2019m 69 years old and through the years I\u2019ve tried a lot of different brands. I\u2019ve thrown away all the inferior pots and pans (or sold them for pennies on the dollar in garage sales) that advertisers have said were better. I now have nothing but Farberware in my kitchen cabinets for superior-quality cooking and ease of cleanup. So, if you want a \u201cwork-horse\u201d set of pots and pans that will stand the test of time \u2013 buy Farberware \u2013 I highly recommend them. - enough said!",

                "reviewText": "This cooking vessel is worth adding to your kitchen menagerie. I have had large covered skillets with good handles opposite each other for two hand lifting before...but THIS skillet goes a step farther...and I love it. One side has the long handle, and on the other a short handle...which gives a solid control when lifting and manipulating the skillet.The versatility of this skillet is sweet. You can prepare anything a Dutch Oven can. Roasts, chicken, turkey, stew and more...all on your stove top...with the same capacity as the Dutch Oven. Cooking is even and does not leave cold spots.The surfaces are well done, smooth, and elegant. Inside, the copper coating insures your food will be harvested easily, it's non-stick coating a lasting feature, if not abused. Proper care will give you cooking ease and joy for years.The lid fits well, and is heavy clear glass... (The top knob gets a tad warm, so use a hotpad or cotton dishcloth to remove the lid. Lol)Cleaning is no trouble. A Scotch Brite scrubbie does the trick, and protects the non-stick coating, yet allows for adequate scrub action for whatever residues you encounter.Breakfast foods can be used in this skillet easily too, but it's large capacity is a bit of an overkill to produce eggs over easy... I would save eggs for a smaller skillet...but bacon is easy.Versitile, practical and durable. All in all, this covered skillet is well worth the price. I would buy it again anytime.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to use, large size so we can make 4 chicken breasts or 5 small ones at once. It's super easy to clean i rinse with soapy water a soft sponge, rag or even a paper towel. Make sure not to use metal utensils, I use a wooden spoon/spatula or silicone. We are using a glass lid that came with one of our pots and it fits perfectly because I know it would have been twice the price to get one that came with a lid. So it's great if money is tight I've always liked Farberware pans the most. Get one!!",

Por otro lado, se form\u00f3 una capa ocre oscuro, que no pertenec\u00eda a ning\u00fan alimento y la cual no desapareci\u00f3 con ning\u00fan m\u00e9todo de limpieza, por lo que decid\u00ed devolver los sartenes.
