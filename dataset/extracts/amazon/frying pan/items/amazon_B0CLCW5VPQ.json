                "reviewText": "The Bakken 5.5 inch egg pan and spatula are a fantastic duo. They both are well made, it is not a flimsy aluminum pan like some brands sell and the spatula is equally sturdy. I washed and oiled the pan then let it sit for one hour prior to using. Before cooking I added a bit more oil. The pan accommodates one extra large egg and an extra large egg white. I mixed the egg in a bowl then poured it into the pan because trying to mix it in the pan would be tight. The heat distribution is great and the scrambled eggs cooked quickly and evenly with low flame on a gas stove, with no hot spots. Nothing stuck to the pan and cleaning was a breeze. I highly recommend this pan and will buy more of their cookware. Five stars!",
