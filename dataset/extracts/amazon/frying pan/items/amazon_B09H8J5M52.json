                "reviewText": "I just got these yesterday, January 5, 2024, and immediately through everything in the dishwasher.They came out just fine so they are dishwasher safe.I really like how heavy and solid they feel and the silicone coated handles on the pans and lids are great to get a firm grip on and avoid the heat.I've only used the large frying pan this morning, January 6, 2024 to make my breakfast of a quarter pound sausage pattie, hashbrowns, 2 pieces of French toast, and 2 scrambled eggs.Normally with my old frying pan, I would weigh my sausage and flatten it out and then put it right in the frying pan before turning on the burner. I've figured out that it took 20 minutes for the first side to get done and then flipping it over for 10 minutes for the second side.However, I noticed with this new frying pan, it started burning after 10 minutes and flipped it over and the second side started to burn after 5 minutes so it only took 1/2 of the time to make my sausage pattie.This was a pain because I always had time to wash my potato and shred it for the hashbrowns, get out all the ingredients for the French toast and scrambled eggs before I even needed to flip the sausage pattie but today, I really had to bust my butt to get everything else ready.Grabbing the lid handle was easy with the silicone coating since my old frying pan had a glass lid with a glass handle and the handle would get really hot.Hashbrowns also cooked in 1/2 of the time and they stuck a little bit because I forgot how fast the sausage pattie cooked so the hashbrowns also cooked much faster.The French toast also stuck but only a little but I kept close to them flipping them after 2 minutes.The scrambled eggs also only took about 3 minutes instead of about 5 minutes.Haven't cleaned the large frying pan since it's still hot and wanted to get this out right away.Now, what I don't like about these is the steamer pan because it only fits about 1/3 of the way into the medium sauce pan instead of all the way down. I was really hoping to use it like a strainer for making spaghetti so I didn't need to get the large colander out to drain the spaghetti.I was hoping to boil the spaghetti right in the steamer pan and pull it right out draining all the water at the same time.Other than the steamer pan, I really like the feel, weight, and sturdiness of these pans so far but I've only used the large frying pan and lid. If I have any issues with the other pans, I'll update this and post about them but I'm guessing there won't be any issues since how well the large frying pan did this morning.",
