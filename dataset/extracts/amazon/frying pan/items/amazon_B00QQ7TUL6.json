                "reviewText": "After 14 months, this is still a 5-star pan! I use it to cook EVERYTHING. I cook meat and sauces in it, brown onions and potatoes, scrambled eggs and omelettes. EVERYTHING just slides out, and the pan wipes clean with a soft sponge.I also bought Cook-N-Home's 8-inch and 10-inch pans for making cr\u00eapes, plus the 12-inch wok. They all work great on my induction cooktop, and nothing ever sticks at all. But this 12-inch frying pan is my favorite, and it still spends more time on the cooktop than on the shelf. I'm seriously thinking of buying another just to keep for that far-off day when this pan finally needs to be replaced -- but that day is not yet!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this pan because I needed just ONE non-stick pan to cook eggs and cr\u00eapes over my new induction cooktop.I've owned the pan for three months, during which I've used it about six or seven times a week, more than any other frying pan I own. I don't ever use it on a conventional stovetop or in the oven -- it's my one and only go-to pan for cooking with induction. I use it to brown meat and onions, cook eggs and omelets, fry bacon or potatoes -- nearly everything that needs a wide, shallow, non-stick pan. It spends more time off the shelf than on it.After three months, its non-stick finish looks as good as the day it arrived, and works as well, too.I do take care of it. I never use metal cooking tools (at all), and I never overheat the pan. Induction cooking is generally lower temperature than conventional cooking because you can control the heat more precisely -- so this pan has never been used at temperatures higher than 320F.I wash it by hand with a soft sponge. It never needs scrubbing -- just a soapy wipe, rinse with the sprayer, and towel dry.I'm pretty pleased with the pan overall, especially considering how cheap it was to buy. There are only two reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 --(1) The induction layer is a paper-thin disk on the bottom that is very slow to heat the rest of the pan. Since induction works by heating ONLY the ferrous metal layer, if that layer is very thin then it will take much longer to collect enough heat to distribute to the rest of the pan. It would be better if it the ferrous layer were thicker and did not have so many holes in it.(2) The bottom of the pan warps upwards when it heats. This means that it is not suitable for making cr\u00eapes and other thin-batter foods, which flow off the center and to the sides. I will have to buy another pan strictly for making cr\u00eapes, which is disappointing and somewhat annoying, as I had intended to use this one for everything.But I guess \"everything except cr\u00eapes\" is still a pretty useful non-stick pan!",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit worried that an induction pan this inexpensive could be of such a high quality, but all the positive reviews were right, and I was not disappointed. Heats and cools quickly, has even heat, works on induction, very non stick, lightweight, dishwasher safe, and inexpensive!Edit: 18 months later, this pan has some scratches from rough handling and having other pans stacked on top of it, but the non stick coating has stood up much better than my teflon pans. And it *ALWAYS* comes clean out of the dishwasher no matter how much gunk has been cooked on to it. The 'dents' patterned in the underside of the pan show some etching from daily dishwasher use, but it does not affect the function, (who looks at the underside of a pan anyway?) and it's now apparent it's an aluminum pan with a stainless bonded induction plate built in to the bottom. And it works great! The rivets on the handle are a tiny bit lose, but again.... .this thing have been used/washed probably 500 times at this point, and it's had some rough handling. It can't be beat for the price!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a larger saute pan for use on an induction cooktop that had relatively low sides so I could also use it as a pancake griddle. In fact, that's what I use it for every day. About two days a week, I'll use it to saute vegetables or a combination of meat and vegetables. I have used induction cooktops for the last 12 years and appreciate their responsiveness. But, it's sometimes difficult to find reasonably priced cookware that works well, even when it's advertised as being induction compatible. This pan meets the reasonably priced criterion. It's no-stick qualities, to this point (after about 40 days), are excellent. In fact, they are the best of any cookware I've ever owned. Many times after use, it can simply be wiped out and there is no residue left. There are no signs of use. It's also very easy to deglaze while cooking. It heats very evenly. I can tell this is the case, because I make pancakes that virtually cover the entire bottom of the pan. When I flip them, I notice that the bottom surface of the pancake is evenly done across its entire width. The only downside for me is that I have to use a higher setting on the cooktop to get the same amount of heat relative to an aluminum clad induction-compatible pan (8 vs. 6.5 for the same heating). This means that the high end of the effective cooking range is lower than it might be for another pan. For most of what I cook this isn't a problem, but if you're cooking a very full pan-full of ingredients, you might be a bit short of the temperature you need or it might take longer to get done than you expected.On balance, knowing what I do now about the pan, I would definitely be willing to buy it again.",
