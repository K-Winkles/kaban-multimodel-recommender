                "reviewText": "I love, love, love the color of this pan, and the weight of it is not too light and not too heavy. So far nothing sticks to it and I\u2019ve been using it for about a month and a half. It\u2019s a great size and easy to clean. Yes, the underside will discolor at some point from your burner but I expected that when I bought it. I mean it\u2019s a light colored pan so it\u2019s a trade off for having a lovely cooking surface on top. They could opt to make these with all dark colored bottoms but really it doesn\u2019t bother me since the rest of the pan functions as it should and looks beautiful. What guest really needs to be looking at the underside of my pan anyway?? We will see how the nonstick surface holds up over time though. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t buy a whole set of these yet, because I want to see how long they last before I dive in lol.",

The set's non-stick ceramic coating is truly exceptional, making both cooking and cleaning a breeze. I've cooked a variety of dishes, and nothing sticks to these pans, maintaining their pristine look and feel. The lightweight design is a significant plus, making it easy to handle the pots and pans even when they're full. The cream white color adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen, and I've received numerous compliments on the set's aesthetic. The durability seems promising, as I've used them frequently without any signs of wear. The set is also dishwasher safe, which is a huge convenience. While I've only been using them for a short while and can't speak to their long-term performance, my current experience has been very positive. This cookware set is a great choice for anyone looking to combine style, functionality, and ease of use in their cooking routine.",

Center of pan seems to peak and liquids go toward edges but did not bother me. Center of pan no longer works as non stick, more like insta stick now and it\u2019s only a month old. Week later and throwing it away, wife said change rating from 2-1 saying one of the worst we have owned",
