The eggs do not stick at all and it wipes clean easily. The weight of the pan surprised me. The pan heats evenly, the lid fits well, and its handle is comfortable to grasp. The larger pans from this set are now on my shopping list! I would recommend this pan to everyone looking for a small pan for eggs and omelets.",

Chantal, are top of the line, so I worried anything else would not be that great but I just wanted an egg pan to make omelets. A non stick one would be perfect! This pan did not disappoint! It is the perfect size for an omelet, or to cook any type eggs you can dream up. A small amount of butter and the best egg I have ever made. Nothing sticks to it and it heats up quickly! Easy to clean as it is light weight and a very pretty pan also. I cant say anything negative about this pan. I tell most of my family and friends about this cookware and have actually bought more to use instead of the seriously heavy Chantal Brand I have.",

                "reviewText": "First off, love the pan. It looks good, feels good and cooks good. I had a lot of confidence when cooking with this pan that I hadn't normally had because of the crappy pans I have been using. My first meal was chicken quesadillas. All of the ingredients cooked wonderfully.Cleanup was easy. After cooling down, I was able to simply wipe out the pan with a paper towel, then wash and dry. Nothing sticked to the surface of the pan and cleanup was a breeze.The negative- in my 3rd picture, you can see where I had a spill of the ingredients when I was flipping my quesadillas. The outside of the pan is not coated in the same non-stick as the inside. So there is a burn on the outside of the pan that I have not been able to completely remove. Inside of the pan is perfect. Just beware of messes on the outside.I would buy again and will most likely get the remainder of the matching set to replace the remainder of the pans in my kitchen.",

It seem very durable thus far I love the fact that when I buy a new induction stove, this will work on it. It is really easy to clean--, (thank you) and I plan to purchase another , larger pan from the same manufacturer. It is light weight, relatively attractive, and best of all, seems to heat evenly, cook well. Yes, I'd recommend it.For all around daily ue , this pan is most welcome in my kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "These are my observations using the CAROTE cookware:Pros: Even cooking, meaning heating up to desired temperature and staying there; attractive skillet for any kitchen; pinhole in lids to allow steam to vent; well-packaged upon delivery, foods do not seem to stick or burn easily (unlike my Anolon 12\" skillet that overheats AND developed a scratch/spot that kept growing with each use. I had only been cooking in it about 2 months and always used wooden spoons) BUT...I digress.Cons: Only one handle, no secondary grip like my Anolon cookware. This was on me, because I didn't notice at the time of purchase; both lids of the 12\" and 10\" have dents in the metal rings, and you have to work them to make them fit the skillets. I don't know if this is by design (it almost looks that way but not sure what purpose that would serve) or maybe this is a result of production defects, etc. As I stated above, both skillets and lids were very well packaged. Now that I think of it...maybe I just don't know how to maneuver the lids. That is a possibility.Overall, and even with the weird lids...for me, these CAROTE skillets had more pros than cons.",

I have a great 12 inch professional pan that is a tank, but there is no way i am going to be able to toss eggs in the air or other restaurant type techniques. I was afraid this pan would be too small but because the sides are high it looks like it will hold plenty. The other thing is the non stick. Great so far. I cooked some grilled toast and nothing stuck. Did not feel the need to use soap because i had only used olive oil in the pan and it wasn't dirty so i just rinsed it under hot water. Not only was the pan completely clean but not one single drop of water was left in the pan- it all slipped completely out! now that is non stick!",

                "reviewText": "A small pan is one of my most go-to pans in the kitchen for solo work - scrambled eggs, fried egg, etc. I cook a lot so they get hammered. My previous pan was starting to have a few issues on my induction hob so I had a look around and found this. I was tempted to just replace with my existing brand but took a punt and am pleased I did - its better than my previous \"stone/marblesque coating\" pan by a distance. Two things for me make this better - firstly there are no handle rivet heads on the inside of the pan, which makes cleaning it easier. This is often overlooked by pan makers, and its a hassle when cleaning off scrambled eggs which stick to the rivet heads. Secondly, the coating is smoother than other types and so it makes it more non-stick and easier to clean. Didn't think I would like the handle as I prefer just plain utilitarian black but it feels comfortable and sturdy to use so I will live with that and it actually looks classy. Am so impressed with it I'm thinking of replacing my other pans with the other models in the range, even though I don't need to...",
