                "reviewText": "Alright. I\u2019ve had a chance to try this out for a few batches of scrambled eggs and just tried an omelet this morning. I like a nice plump-with-fillings sort of omelet and this pan was a pinch too small for that. There wasn\u2019t enough bottom of the pan width for the eggs to spread out enough to provide coverage for the amount of veggies I like. So that\u2019s the 1 star deduction. \u201cMake a less stuffed omelet!\u201d cries the peanut gallery. Surely a possibility, but I\u2019m not a fan of omelets where the innards seem like an afterthought rather than part of a balanced, harmonious breakfast meal. Plenty slick, nonstick-wise. I do use a bit of oil and butter to assist with flavor and slipperiness. I\u2019ve had enough of the soaking and scraping with my stainless pans, and don\u2019t want to be disappointed with this pan so I\u2019ll work up to an oil-less attempt at scrambled eggs later. Not sure what technology some of the nonstick offerings on the market are to justify their $50 to $150 price tags. This one seems much more fairly priced. The handle is advertised as Bakelite, but it has a really nice satiny feel to it and is very comfortable in the hand, making flipping veggies easy when saut\u00e9ing. Hopefully the seller/manufacturer will offer additional sizes for those folks who want a bit more real estate to work with when crafting omelets. It is deep enough to do some stovetop frying, and would handle smaller portions of French fries. Could probably fit a couple servings of tots, chicken tenders or fish sticks too. No lid included, so you\u2019ll probably want a spatter screen. Thumbs up recommendation",
