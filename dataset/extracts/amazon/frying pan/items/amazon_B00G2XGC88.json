What I don't like is that is SO heavy (well, what did I expect?) and I have to use both hands to hold it. It does have the lip on the opposite end of the handle to help with picking it up. While it was \"preseasoned,\" food stuck to it. I had to season it myself over a period of time. The trick is to keep using it and keep adding lard and heating it up and then letting it always have some grease in it. It takes time to get it where its really stick-free.",

                "reviewText": "I love this pan so much! I can't believe I spent so many years of my life without a cast iron pan. Fact is, I just never understood how easy these are to cook with and maintain. Yes, you have to season it. Yes, that takes a little getting used to at first. No, it's not hard and really doesn't take much time to maintain. It's much easier than I thought it would be, and I love the way my food comes out!Once properly seasoned, this pan is as non-stick as any other pan I've ever used. I did the initial seasoning in my gas grill. That way you don't fill your kitchen with smoke. You can certainly use a regular oven if you don't have a grill. Give it a good 2-3 seasonings before using it to cook. There are plenty of articles and videos online explaining how to season a cast iron pan.As for the cooking, if you haven't used cast iron, you don't know what you're missing. The heat distribution and retention are amazing. For best results, make sure to pre-heat to your desired temp for several minutes before adding oil or food. Cooking with oil also helps maintain the non-stick surface, so the surface improves the more you use the pan. I've used this for steaks, fried/scrambled eggs, bacon, arepas, and shepherd's pie. I find myself looking for more recipes I can use it for. I haven't tried using it on my gas grill yet, but I'm eager to try. This thing makes me want to cook more!I like the 12-in size, though many people may prefer the 10.25-in version. I can prepare a NY Strip and a Fillet in this pan at the same time, with room to spare for a butter baste. It's a bit large for a 3-egg scramble, but still works well.The one down-side is the weight. You're not likely to flip an omelet with this puppy, unless you have very strong wrists. Of course, that's not specific to this brand - it's a cast iron thing. Maybe the 10.25-in version would be easier to handle for some purposes. That said, this pan feels like it's going to last for generations to come.Oh, and if it seems like I'm being sponsored by Lodge, please know that I'm not. I'm just a regular guy sharing his thoughts about a product I truly enjoy using. Happy cooking!",

I fry EVERYTHING in it & it pleases me to know that you\u2019re also gaining some health benefits from frying in a cast iron pan, because iron gets put into your food. Cooks everything so even & the pan acquires more flavor with the different foods that you fry. Also love the little silicone handle cover. \ud83d\udcaf % recommend the \u201cLodge\u201d cast iron pan.",

This thing could survive a bomb.My partner also has a stand alone induction top. It doesn\u2019t not seem to work well with that. The cast iron take forever to heat on induction and seem to only get hot in the very center.The cast iron is so heavy it\u2019s challenge to lift / pour food out of. This would not be a good fit for someone older / with mobility concerns.",

                "reviewText": "Well my skillet and glass lid arrived today in two different deliveries. I almost immediately tried cooking some bacon just to test it out. I put the bacon in the pan and let it heat to medium. According to what I had read online, that would let the bacon render, prevent curling, and make sure it wouldn\u2019t stick. When it was time to flip the strips over, I learned that they were pretty much adhered to the pan. I had to scrape it up in little bits.Refusing to be defeated by a pan, I carefully cleaned it with hot water and scrubbed to get off all the stuck bits. Then, I followed the directions to do the stove top seasoning method two times. Once it was cooled all the way, I decided on a major test. I cooked four more strips of center-cut bacon, two over easy eggs, and a kimchi pancake for supper. NOTHING stuck! Everything came out of the pan looking like it had been prepared for a magazine photo article. I waited for the pan to cool down completely, took it to the sink, and rinsed it with hot water. Then, I wiped it dry with a paper towel before giving it a rub down with a nearly non-existent coat of canola oil. It is now sitting on the stove waiting for my next adventure.I am 100% satisfied with this skillet so far. I do caution other buyers to just pretend it is not \u201cpre-seasoned\u201d and season it. These are the instructions I followed:Seasoning your cast iron skillet on the stovetop is a simple process that builds up a protective layer of polymerized oil, making it naturally non-stick and preventing rust. Here's a quick guide:What you'll need:Your cast iron skilletHigh smoke point oil like canola, grapeseed, or avocado oilPaper towelsTongs (optional)Steps:Wash and dry your skillet. Scrub away any food residue with warm water and dish soap. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely with paper towels or heat it on the stovetop over low heat for a few minutes to evaporate any remaining moisture.Heat the skillet over medium heat. Let it get nice and hot for about 5 minutes.Pour in a thin layer of oil. About 1 tablespoon should be enough for a 12-inch skillet. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides evenly.Wipe out the excess oil. Use a paper towel to spread the oil around the pan in a thin, even layer. You don't want any pooling oil.Heat the oil until it smokes. This takes about 2-3 minutes. Keep an eye on it and adjust the heat if necessary to avoid burning the oil.Turn off the heat and let the pan cool. The oil will polymerize as it cools, creating the seasoned layer.Repeat steps 3-6 two or three more times. Each layer builds upon the previous one, creating a stronger and more durable seasoning.Wipe away any excess oil and store your skillet. Once the pan is cool, use a paper towel to wipe away any remaining oil. Store your skillet in a dry place.",

It's true that you need to put effort in seasoning the skillet and even after each use it's good to one-season. But with all the helpful info on the web you'll get used to the process once you start.One thing I love about the skillet is the sear I get on meats and the fact that I can put it straight in the oven. Bought the 12\" which looks and feels big BUT sufficient space to cook for the family.Lovin it so far: )",
