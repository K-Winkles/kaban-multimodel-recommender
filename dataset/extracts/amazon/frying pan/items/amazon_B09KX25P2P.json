The non stick went away quickly and EVERYTHING, including hamburger in its grease, bacon, anything, sticks. Even with an insane amount of oil, butter, fat, you name it. It\u2019s been hand washed due to its size.It\u2019s out of the return range (conveniently), so Amazon cust service says to contact the manufacturer. Tried that. Since it was purchased on Amazon and not directly from their website, I\u2019m not getting any help.Buy at your own risk!",

                "reviewText": "We had high hopes for this non-stick fry pan but over 12 months in has lost the non-stick function. We have an older electric range with coiled elements and the pan is not a good choice for this stove. The pan does not sit very steady and it does not heat uniformly on the exposed coils.This type of electric coil can produce hot spots and 1 time we overheated the pan enough to produce smoke. After that happened the pan has lost more and more non-stick capability. The pan might be a better option if you cook with a gas stove, but I would not recommend it for an exposed coil electric stove.",
