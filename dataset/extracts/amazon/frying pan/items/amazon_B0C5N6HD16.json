I have really taken a liking to enamel caoted pans after buying and using a crepe pan that is enameled and this Kitchenaid pan did not disappoint. I do still use a tiny bit of oil when using it, but it's far less than I used in my old pan and it cleans up beautifully. I would love to have another, smaller, sautee pan version. Highly recommend this product! (And the color is gorgeous too.)",
