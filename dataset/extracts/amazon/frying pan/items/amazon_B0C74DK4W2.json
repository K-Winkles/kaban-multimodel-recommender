Drop water into the pan to check the temperature. If the water droplets evaporate quickly due to high temperature, it means the pan is not hot enough. If the water droplets swirl on the surface of the pan, adjust to low heat, and spray cooking oil. Then, put the food in the pan for cooking to achieve a non-stick effect",
            "[How to Clean Stubborn Stains?] If your stainless steel pot has stubborn stains, try these tips: Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the dirty pot and add the lemon peel. Pour in some baking soda and white vinegar, then boil over medium-low heat, stirring for about 2-3 minutes. Afterward, wipe the pot with a clean cloth and rinse with water. It's recommended to wipe the pot with a dry rag before storing it"

It cooks beautifully when used correctly. The fact that meat sticks until it's \"ready\" is so helpful to know, it truly has changed how we cook. The pan feels very heavy and sturdy. I do wish that this pan was solid construction because it does have a sort of plate at the bottom (not all one piece) but it is still useful and a good intro pan. We are able to make meat and use the fond for pan sauces and it has us eating like we're at a 5 star restaurant often. It is that good. Once you know how to use it right, it is life changing.",

                "reviewText": "Larger than I wanted and yet is great for large meals. Pan is heavy and heats quickly, holds heat well and browns meat well with a bit of oil. Handle stays somewhat cool, the lid handle can become too hot requiring a hot pad when handling. Clean up is not too difficult. I'd recommend this pan and lid.",

                "reviewText": "I own a lot of very good non-stick pans, but this has become my go-to pan for frying chicken breasts, salmon and white fish. Haven't tried it with eggs yet but it does breakfast sausage admirably. It is so nice to pour oil into this pan and watch it gather in a pool in the middle of the pan instead of running off to one side. My only problem, not having used stainless steel pans before, was heating properly before adding oil. I was using a laser thermometer, and the pan didn't seem to be heating up very fast on my induction stove. As a consequence, the pan was overheating, sometimes to over 600 degrees. The thermometer was giving me a false reading. When I finally figured out my error, things have been fine. I do love this pan and will consider Deluxe cookware if the need arises for another piece of stainless steel cookware.",
