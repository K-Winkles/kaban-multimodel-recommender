                "reviewText": "They still look like new. So easy to clean and cook in. We don't fry in them and only use silicone cooking utensels. It is recommended not to cook anything on high heat, like frying, so we use other pans for that. Great for all other cooking. Nothing sticks and they are very easy to clean. I feel the coating is healthier than some of the other non-stick pans. Highly recommend.",

I read the instructions that indicate you should not use high heat with these pans but I have a flat-top electric range and I use high heat always in order to get up to proper temperature, and then I descend to 8-7 (out of 10).Absolutely no problems. Great heat distribution; no discoloration and the clean-up is ridiculously easy. Fried eggs just glide...BUT let me see if this holds for 6 months..",
