Nothing sticks to it, and cleanup is a breeze.A long as you follow the manufacturers guidelines to clean using a non-abrasive sponge, never use metal utensils and only cook on medium heat or lower, this pan will last a long time.I season mine before every use by drizzling a small amount of cooking oil onto the surface of the pan, and then using a silicone brush to evenly distribute the oil across the surface and up the sides of the pan as well. I then heat it up normally and cook. Everything just glides on the surface with ease.Based on my experience with this one, I'm thinking of buying the 10-inch model now.",
