May save up my pennies and get one in a larger size.",

                "reviewText": "So, my wife is 'cast iron club' and didn't really want to get another pan. We are vegetarian, however, and use a lot of protein replacing products. They often stick really well to cast iron and are a pain to get off. (yes, it is seasoned well).So, because I didn't want to spend 10 min cleaning the cast iron after every egg, I bought this. The coating is amazing. With just a little butter or oil, nothing sticks to it. There is one problem, and its me, so I'm not taking a star off. The bottom/edges of our pan are already gross with grease. The inside cleans up very easily, but the edges don't seem to want to get clean. Even with baking soda and a gentle brush, or vinegar, I can't get them back to the original color. So, its not a showpiece pan, but it is a workhorse.We only use silicone utensils with it, so hopefully the coating will last. I know these do wear out after a couple years.TL:DR, this will make you not hate cooking eggs again.",
