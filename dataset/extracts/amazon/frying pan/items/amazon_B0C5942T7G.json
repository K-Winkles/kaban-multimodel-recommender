                "reviewText": "These pans are amazing. I moved to Italy a few years ago. When I arrived to my new house I found out I couldn\u2019t use my pans because the stove was an induction stove. So I had to shop around for induction cookware. I ended up purchasing very expensive Italian induction cookware and only lasted a few weeks and the nonstick feature was gone, the pans burnt, and were unserviceable as all the food stuck to the surface and burned. When I visited the USA I went and bought new pans from a very recognized brand, and again, they only lasted a month and became unserviceable. I had family coming to visit me from the USA and I didn\u2019t want them to see my ugly pans. So I started looking around for new induction cookware and I came across these amazing pans. The price was very reasonable, and considerably cheaper than the previous pans I had purchased. I read the great reviews and decided to give them a try. I received them very quickly, I had them now for over 3 months and they still look like new, they are awesome to cook any food, the food doesn\u2019t stick, and they look amazing. I received many compliments about how nice they look and how good they are to cook the food. I am extremely please with these pans, and I am looking at exploring and purchasing more products from this company. I recommend these pans!",
