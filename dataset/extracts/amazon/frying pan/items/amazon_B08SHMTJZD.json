Thru the years I've used the pricey and the cheap of many different brands - none (that's a big zero) have ever made it beyond 2 years of more than the once a week usage. AND so far after I'd say 50 uses this ones hanging there without issue other than the duller appearance of the 'green' inlay. The main thing is - heat has NOT bowed the base as of yet which most others do start showin' a slight crown by now. Still nothing has ever stuck - Still ez to wipe out - Still ez to final clean in the sink. NO issues as of yet thou its gotta long ways to go to get to that 2 year stage in life SO lets just say its Still kind of a pre-mature review thou cant drop stars due to that since its been a great buy so far - only time will tell.",

After being burned by other cookware, I decided to only buy one pan to trial run before buying the full set. Bought this pan, used it daily for over a month, It is amazing how well it cooks. Smoked chops, hash browns, and anything else you want to cook will come out just like you want. I have also been washing it in the dishwasher, only need to wipe off minor water spots. So I finally bought the full set andI am very pleased with them. Far superior to pans that cost 3 to 4 times as much! Don't waste your money on others, these are the real deal!",

                "reviewText": "Have had the thing for 2 weeks and used a metal spatula to flip burgers and it's already scratched. Very Disappointed since the 14\" we own has been used with metal items many times and is not scratched. This one probably made in China! Would recommend using plastic or wood utensils in this one. One other thing I noticed is that it is starting to warp on the bottom so it wobbles while on the glasstop stove. Just can't believe it went to sh17 so quick. going to try to replace it.My second package arrived and I was expecting EXACTLY what was on the box...but NO, not the same. Handles are way different was expecting the round stay cool handles like the box AND product said, and got the flat handles that get hot, WTF is going on, does anyone do a quality check anymore.",
