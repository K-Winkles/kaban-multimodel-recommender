I even cut food on it with a metal steak knife and no damage at all. The sidewalls are not high, so that\u2019s the only critique I\u2019d mention. But overall, a great fry pan for the money. I use the glass lid from my prior pan, so I do recommend a lid as well. Good luck. Mark in NY",

At the end I poured all of the grease into a bowl to cool and wiped it with a paper towel and it was almost completely clean\u2026 another gentle washing and it\u2019s dried and ready for the next time. If anything changes in the future I\u2019ll update this but it looks like it\u2019s gonna be a great pan.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent fry skillet. Used it to make pancakes and it performed better than expected. Heat distribution was great which made for perfect pancakes, and it cleaned very easily with just hot water and a little soap on a sponge. Just following the directions on the sticker for use an care will help this skillet to last for a long time. But it was an ordeal trying to get it.After ordering it and a few days later receiving notification that it was delivered, went to the door and it wasn't there. After waiting 24 hours based on instructions from Amazon, it still didn't show up. So asked and was granted a refund while putting in an order again for the skillet. A few days later, it showed up (this time) at the door but upon unpacking it was found to be smashed on one side. So contacted Amazon, ordered a replacement, and then returned the damaged skillet via Amazon returns with Kohl's. The replacement was delivered to our door the other day in good condition and as stated above, performed admirably, hence the 5-star rating which also covers Amazon's customer service. As for the shipping debacle...which was on the postal service...3 stars.",

The smallest lightest touch to the surface causes nicks to form. Not sure how long the pan will actually hold up. There are several nicks on the inside with careful and light use.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pan as a recommendation from a coworker- the Amazon reviews did not sway my decision. We needed a new nonstick pan to replace our last one that we had for 3 years.We bought this pan on October 9, 2023 and we use it for scrambled eggs on weekday mornings. We do not use a metal spatula, just a rubber one. Also, I hand wash my dishes and do not typically run the dishwasher.I noticed about a month after using the pan, little flakes of the nonstick coating had come off the surface to reveal the black underneath but there were only like 2 or 3 small chips so I didn\u2019t care too much. I did also notice that it was getting food stuck to it more and more but thought that was just normal.Today 01/29/024 my boyfriend uses the pans for eggs and he just finished cooking and he sounds very frustrated and mentions how the nonstick coating of the pan didn\u2019t last long and shows me the pan with a bunch of egg still stuck to it.The pan worked well for maybe a month. But three months later it\u2019s not great. I would return it but the return window is over. Oh well. I will buy a different pan I guess.",
