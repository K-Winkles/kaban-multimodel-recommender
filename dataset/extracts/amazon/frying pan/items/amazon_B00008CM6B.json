                "reviewText": "I bought this pan to see if I can use stainless steel and this is phenomenal. This pan is so versatile. I can make chicken, braise beef short ribs, saut\u00e9 and do so much more. This is great for one pot meals. It arrived in perfect condition. It is easy to clean. I let the pan cool then fill it with water. Most of the time I can clean it right away after using no problem.. I don\u2019t have any issues cleaning my stainless steel pans. It\u2019s nonstick if you use it properly. I use medium to low medium heat. That\u2019s more then enough heat to get a nice braise or sear because of how well this heats up. Heat distribution is also good. I\u2019ll be switching over to an all stainless steel set in the future. This is very well made. I scratched the bottom but that was my fault and it still looks beautiful. It\u2019s on the bottom and nobody can even see it. It holds up. Is very sturdy and can fit a lot of food as you can see I fit a whole butterfly chicken. It looks so nice. Great price. I took a picture of the pot after I used and cleaned it a few times. I\u2019ll get barkeepers friend to keep them shiny and new looking. I hand wash and dry right away to preserve them. This is going to last a long time I hope.",

                "reviewText": "I'm an avid cook and frequently use cast iron and stainless cookware. I needed a good saute pan and I was seeing prices close to the two hundred mark for the good, well known brands. I also saw the extreme of thirty dollar pans that were very light and extremely thin. I saw the Cuisinart Chef's Classic for under sixty dollars and saw the good reviews it had. I purchased it and I'm glad I did. It is not as heavy duty as Al-Clad and some of the high end brands, BUT it is considerably more robust than the cheaper pans. I cook on a gas stove and find that this pan heats up really well on a medium-high setting and doesn't have the hot spot like my cast iron pans have. Chunks of meat will brown evenly throughout the pan and I don't have to rotate pieces in and out of the hot spot like I do on the cast iron pans. This pan is a great size. I use it to cook for 3-4 people and can easily load it up to serve twice that many. Very versatile and easy to clean. I love using this pan for stews and such where I can brown the meat, saute vegetables and then add water and seasoning and let it simmer for a while. The lid fits well and the helper handle is a nice feature for when the pan is loaded down and is heavy. Even though only the bottom has the aluminum core, I find that it cooks very well and has good heat retention. The other brands are heavier and I'm sure are great for professionals, but for me, I think this this pan is awesome and I'll take the extra hundred dollars I saved and buy more cookware like this.",

I use this for family dishes and it's my favorite for a variety of multi-ingredient pasta dishes I make. It holds a huge amount of food to feed the entire family. It heats evenly and cleans up well. Stainless construction means you can cook healthy with no unusual coating concerns. And lastly, the rivets that hold the handles on the pan and stainless lid are just as tight as when the pan was new. And yes, this pan gets used weekly, and is definitely not babied.We're thrilled to have this 5.5 Qt saute pan and cannot recommend it enough.This is a solid 5-star item.",

So many dishes you can prepare with this, and the price is incredible. The quality is excellent, and very easy cleanup, this is why I keep buying Cuisinart products, they just work.",

                "reviewText": "When it arrived, it was warped upwards at the center, causing oil to run to the edges of the pan instead of spreading out equally, and the opposite for heat distribution I guess. Hard to tell about heat since I was making a sauce (pizza sauce, using homegrown tomatos; saute garlic in oil first, before adding the previously blanched tomatoes and spices, and simmering for 30 minutes or so, then cool and puree).After I cleaned the pan, I took it outside and beat it (thorougly) with a rubber mallet until it seemed flat.Tested it today ( I made the pizza sauce and used the pan for the first time yesterday), sauteeing some mushrooms (pizza topping). Idk if it's perfectly flat after I \"fixed\" it, but oil and seemingly heat both spread evenly across the pan now.It didn't warp back up while sauteeing the mushrooms, so it must've been some manufacturing defect or maybe I recieved someone else's return, idk. Or maybe damaged during shipping.In any case, I think I'll be pretty happy with it.",
