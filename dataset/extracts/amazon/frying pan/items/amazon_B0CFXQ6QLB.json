Oh and the lok and style of the pans really add some good looking character to ones home. DONT go paying 100's for those other high end fancy brand pans! U wont be sorry. P.S i only spend my valuable time writing a review if im truly impressed with a service or product",

My fault, I didn't read the reviews, I trusted the item description. The pans are beautiful, cook well on medium and low heat, and are easy to clean. I just wanted new pans so I could actually fry on high heat, which I didn't get.",

It is clear that the set was poorly and unprofessionally packaged and the coating is not strong as claimed. Unfortunately the overall quality is not as expected or as claimed. It is a clear waste of time and money. Will have to return it back and claimed a refund.",
