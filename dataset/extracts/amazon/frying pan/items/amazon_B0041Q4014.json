It needs little or no cooking spray or oil and food really doesn't stick. I can clean it easily with warm water and spray soap and a paper towel without struggling to get it clean. It has a nice solid feel to it almost something like a small cast iron skillet. I even use it like a small pot some times to cook things like frozen homestyle mashed potatoes.",

                "reviewText": "As my S.O. can attest, I am very, very picky when it comes to my cookware. The biggest issue I run into stems from the conflict between the brittleness of nonstick cookware (e.g. non-dishwasher safe everything) and my desire for easy cleanups (e.g. dishwasher-safe everything). I am also hyperaware of damage to my nonstick pans. If I find so much as a flake of coating missing from a nonstick surface, I will throw it away to avoid the risk of carcinogens that the damage presents. On the other hand, if I know that I am going to have to hand-wash a pan once I am doing cooking, I avoid using the pan altogether. Any pan that could cook a variety of foods and be cleaned with ease would become my go-to pan.This is now my go-to pan.I originally bought this to cook crepes for a tiramisu mille-crepe cake. Based on Alton Brown's guidance, I looked for an 8-inch, non-stick pan with mildly sloping sides to a vertical edge. This pan knocked the crepes out of the park, but it was only just getting started. Again to refer to Alton, this is a serious multi-tasker. Other foods that are pan-shape sensitive (e.g. omelets) cook quickly and evenly without issue. Cooking veggies, heating tortillas, warming leftovers, and everything else I've thrown at it has resulted in great success.As for post-cooking, its small size has the advantage over my larger pans in that there is almost always room for it in the dishwasher. After more elaborate dinners, sometimes the larger pans have to wait a cycle or two before getting their turn. This guy doesn't take much space, and easily fits in the top or bottom rack. The quicker it gets cleaned, the more it can be used, and the circle of (pan) life continues.Seriously, I really, really like this pan.Full disclosure - This pan has a \"rough\" non-stick texture, but this seems to be standard across dishwasher-safe non-stick pans (I have an anodized calphalon sauce pot with the same feeling). It's still a smooth surface, but it definitely has a textured feel versus a polished glassy feel. However, unless you are preparing something that requires the smoothest of smooth surfaces (e.g. thin crepes without the use of any butter to lubricate the pan), you wont run into any sticking issues. Even then, I think this pan would hold up to the task.Cookware rarely gets high praise from me, but I have zero complaints about this buy. Perhaps it's only strike against it would be the lack of a lid, but I have been able to use the lids of other pans without issue. I would recommend this pan anyone because of it's versatility, durability, and ease of use.",

If cared for properly these pans should last for years, unlike some brands. Remember you get what you pay for. If you need an everyday use pan that will hold up this is what you should buy. I have found everything Cuisinart makes is quality.",

But beware, the handle does get very hot if you are using it for an extended time. You'll find yourself dropping it right out of your hand when it starts burning. The handle needs to be ventilated somehow. Or insulated from the hot portion of the pan. Otherwise I like the pan and use it every day. Very high quality and heavy feel.",

Its weight assures you of its quality unlike many of the flimsy competitors out there in this category. The glass lid fits well and Cuisinart has done a very good job crafting this pan as they usually do. The non-stick surface performs as you would want it too, tolerates heat and cleans up nicely. I expect this skillet to get a lot of work and continue to perform well for a long time. Sometimes you do just get it right.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased 2 of these over the years. They work perfectly on an induction oven (a magnet definitely sticks to them) and have good heat distribution characteristics. I season all my pans with avacado oil (good to 500 degrees) in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Then only wipe them down between uses. Keeps them perfectly seasoned and totally non-stick (do not use PAM and other sprays as they cause the pan to stick over time). Despite having abused the heck out of the first pan, it still works well despite all the metal spatulas. I bought a new one just to have a shiny one again. I highly recommend over the thin aluminum pan junk sold in stores with the TFAL coating (where does the TFAL goes after it leaves the pan? Oh in the food) LOL.",
