                "reviewText": "I have used this grill pan for 5 months about 1-2 times a week. Structurally this pan is 11\" square and ~2 to 2-1/2 deep. It arrived intact, no scrapes of anything like that. I purchased the pan w/orange colored handle. The handle is ~9\" long, so if you are planning storage space, the overall span, then is about 20\" (see pics) and diagonally it is 13-1/4\", so I have it stacked on a 14\" round pan. The grill nubs/ridges are about 1/16\" high, ~ 5-1/2 \" long.The handle feels like a soft silicone and there is a nice indentation for your thumb to grab on to the handle. The handle is nice in that it doesn't within reason heat up (like a metal handle) or if you keep an eye on location, does not burn. The handle does not fold. The ad / info says it can withstand oven temps to 350 degrees. It is made of anodized aluminum and should not rust. The attachment of the handle to the pan is well done and study- with the rivets being a good size. The grill pan weighs 2 lbs-5 oz for those conscious of weight, much less than a cast iron skillet. No seasoning / pre -seasoning needed. I use it on a gas stove, but the Q&A info indicates it works on electric, ceramic, glass, and electric cooktops; but not induction. In contrast to cast iron, the pan does not hold heat once the burner is turned off.The gill is divided up into 4 sections, great for burgers, steaks, grilled cheese sandwiches, and seared AHI tuna, of course for longer cuts of meat such as a flank steak, it does not provide the continuous (pretty) pattern of the outdoor BBQ. I use the grill on a Viking gas stove with a 4\" burner with a grate of about 8\" and the pan heats quickly and evenly. I think I read somewhere to not cook at higher than medium-high. The non-stick surface has worked well thus far and I use less oil than maybe other pans. For splash/splatter control I use a round lid. Rachel Ray does not make a square lid, but there is one avail from another vendor (see link below), I haven't purchased this.Cleaning is easy with a scouring/sponge pad / brush designed for teflon type surfaces, sometimes letting it soak awhile after dinner. If overcooked in particular, the brush will work well to clean between the folds of the grill. Other times I just throw it in the dishwasher. Clean-up is so easy, I have gotten away from using the gas grill on the Viking gas stove.Overall pleased with this grilling pan, functional, easy to use, cleans easily, a great size for the typical burner/cooking appliance.Link to square lid:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CP1CL2T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",

                "reviewText": "This is my first experience with Rachael Ray cookware. When I first removed the cookware from the set, I first noticed how light weight it was. I then noticed the attractive orange handles they were made and the beautiful clear lids with clear view glass view. It's not high end cookware, but it would be welcome in many or most homes.I used this to cook maggi. It was so perfectly cooked and also i don't see any thing stick to the bottom of the pan. They are made beautifully and perfectly for the use of cooking. I love to cook in Rachael Ray cookware. The food was delicious and tasty whenever i use these product for cooking.I always use to cook dal. Unfortunately, one day I forgot to turn off the stove and i see all mess in my kitchen. I see the dal was totally overcooked and some part of it was sticked to the cookware. That could have resulted in quite a mess with some other types of cookware, but it cleaned up quickly and still looked brand new.What I liked:* The design is very modern and attractive.* The glass lids have a sturdy rim that is designed so food will not be easily trapped* The orange handles are non-slip and easy to grip, and they keep very cool while cooking* The small size pots are very handy, and the 6 quart stock pot is a nice small-size stockpot that I'm finding a much better size for my use.* Cleanup was super easyWhat I didn't like:* The pots seem to be about half the thickness of most of my other pots and pans. While I don't think they would dent easily if dropped, they don't have a sturdy, well made feel to them.* When compared to my Calphalon, they also do not have the same quality hard anodized finish on the outside.* The nonstick coating doesn't feel as high quality as other brands. So far, so good though!* The pans do not have a thick bottom, and seem to heat unevenly. My food scorched quickly, so cooking time and technique will vary from my other cookware.I think this would make a great starter set for someone just starting out on their own. Despite the few flaws that I noticed , I am enjoying using this cookware and cooking just became a little more fun!",

Other people complain the pans are not as big as they would like but I LOVE the small pan. Perfect for eggs.My only concern is that the finish appears thinner than I had hoped. I am being very careful, and as I can't afford to purchase other cookware. I am hoping they are more durable than they look.",
