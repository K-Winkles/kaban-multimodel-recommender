                "reviewText": "Having used this for a few months, the coating still looks brand new. This should last longer than just non-stick teflon coatings since it's supposed to be \"stone,\" so we'll see. It is very non-stick, eggs slide around no problem. The bottom is still not perfectly flat, eggs tend to slide to the outside edge away from the middle, but most pans have this problem. If anything my biggest complaint is it's smaller than my last good pan, so I'm having to get used to a smaller cooking surface, and that's my bad for not getting a bigger one! I'm definitely considering it if the price is right, I recommend this pan so far.",
