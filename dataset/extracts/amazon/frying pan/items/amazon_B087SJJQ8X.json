I still use a touch of butter, EEVO or coconut oil for flavoring but the non-stick on this pan is fantastic making it a joy to cook with and super easy to clean after. We recently go an induction cook top and the pan's heat distribution is excellent. This size was actually purchased to complement a larger set with smaller pans in it.",

                "reviewText": "It was time to upgrade when we bought an induction stove top. After much soul searching I settled on Le Creuset. I bought the10 and 12 inch pan. I have had them for two months and used both quite a bit. Fantastic. Even heating. Non-stick but still browning well. Easy to clean. No warping. Very comfortable handles which stay cool. Simply very very good frying pans. Still look like new. Photo: Spanish tortilla, started in the 10 inch pan, turned into the 12 inch. Clean and easy release.",

The Good:* pan is a great pan for cooking eggs with a super slick surface* it is slightly lighter than most in this range, and a comfortable weight to handle.* comfortable handle, low angle, round and soft.The Bad:* If using a glass top surface, the sharp edges on the bottom will scrape your cook top (The direction say not to move pan while cooking) Right!? I don\u2019t think that is possible.* The contact surface on the bottom of pan doesn\u2019t fit any of my induction heating elements. It should be the same size.* The bottom of the pan is much smaller than the cooking surface, so food around the edges of the pan have less heat.For the price, you would think these little bugs would be worked out.I would not recommend this pan for cooking with glass top due to the scraping the glass causing damage over time.",

                "reviewText": "Real person here! Ordered this pan via Amazon Used and got a $40 discount. $115! Score! Just a teeny little Nick along the top edge that you can hardly see. But not worth a dime if it doesn\u2019t perform well. But perform it does. I have a ceramic top GE range. That\u2019s always fairly slow to heat up. I have several other high-end pans that I always heat using a medium setting and then wait and wait. With this Le Creuset pro, it seemed the heat took less time. Not fast, but not super slow. That was nice but the real pay off was how well it cooked. My first use was breakfast with pancakes and eggs. I let it come up to full heat before starting of course. Added a drizzle of olive oil. The pancakes were nicely browned and perfect. The eggs were also absolutely perfect and of course slid right out. No clue how long it\u2019ll last but I am very meticulous in caring for my gear so I expect a long life. I loved it so much. I went back in and ordered the Le Creuset Pro 12 inch stirfry pan. Full price. It just has to last a few years to have the significant investment make sense. Fingers crossed.",
