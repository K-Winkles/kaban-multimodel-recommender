                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great pans",
                "reviewText": "These pans are tremendous at their price point, and work perfect on my gas oven. I love them.Pros:-Amazingly nonstick. I wanted a quick omelette for my first test. I only had to give the pan two shakes to finish my eggs. After letting the eggs heat up to firm on the bottom I gave the pan one shake to cause one side to fold over, and one final shake to flip it over and finish the other side. The omelette easily slid out onto my plate. I wiped out the pan with a paper towel, and it looks like new. That's true nonstick. No tools, no cleaning, the pan does all the work.-Inexpensive. There are 2 schools for nonstick pans. One says you should buy a really expensive, maybe a ceramic Le Creuset type pan, which will last a long time and give the best experience. The other says you should go with something relatively inexpensive like this T-Fal set, because you know over time someone in your family is going to be an idiot and scrape the coating off your pans with metal utensils. I'm in the latter camp, so I absolutely love this set.Cons:-None. As said, so long as you're in the school where you'd prefer inexpensive nonstick pans, these things are wonders. Sure they don't retain heat like a big ceramic, sure a heavier pan could distribute heat better. But these are amazing at their price point, and their heat distribution is way better than you'd expect.Overall:This is my go-to for nonstick pans. Get something inexpensive, and in 5+ years when they're starting to get scraped up from misuse, you don't feel bad about replacing them. My mom's the type to always go for the heavy ceramic nonstick, and it kills her every time she has to replace one - but that doesn't stop her from damaging the coating with metal implements all the time either! I'd rather use my T-Fal, it makes me happy.",

                "reviewText": "Used the smallest fry pan to fry eggs... seasoned the pans according to manual directions. Did not use commercial cooking spray (all of the cooking website reviews said not to) used canola oil, lightly. Everything went okay until it was time to flip the eggs.... they stuck just enough to break the yolks... but then slipped right out of the pan. Clean up was simple and easy. These pans cost $37.42 and for 3 non stick fry pans... that is a good price. I am replacing my Circulon fry pans after 10 years because the anodized coating is coming off. Checked many cooking sites and reviewing sites.. and bought these because they had good reviews at a price I was comfortable with. Preformed better than the \"copper\" and \"diamond\" brands and at a better price (from Amazon).I did have some problems registering for warranty... the model/serial number on the box was damaged. The product registration form would not accept any of the numbers I tried and I could not find the exact product combo on the T-fal website. I finally emailed customer service at t-fal.com and sent them a photos of the box info panel and fry pans and received a reply that says my product has been registered.",

The bottoms of these pans are very abrasive with any movement. Get some cheap silicone privets and put them between the pans when storing. And don't use anything metal or abrasive to clean them and they will last forever. Enjoy your omelets and easy cleanup!",
