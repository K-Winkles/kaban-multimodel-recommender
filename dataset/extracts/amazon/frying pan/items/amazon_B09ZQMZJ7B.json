                "reviewText": "I needed a replacement for a much-used 6\" Faberware skillet I've had for almost thirty years. This Deluxe skillet is slightly bigger, with tapered sides; just what I was looking for, at a reasonable price. Unlike some reviewers, I haven't had issues with food sticking or difficult clean-up, then again, I've only used either stainless or glass (remember Visions by Corningware?). I mostly use for saut\u00e9ing or a quick stir fry, with a silicone spoonula to prevent damage to the surface. A little cooking spray works well, as long as you let the meat release when its ready. Prior to washing, a quick scrub with a little vinegar and baking soda loosens any remnants that may stick. For me, this was a great buy.",

Desde el de m\u00e1xima calidad AISI316 hasta versiones m\u00e1s econ\u00f3micas, pero me hac\u00eda falta una sart\u00e9n peque\u00f1a. Este acero AISI304 18/10 tiene muy poco o nada que envidiarle al \"quir\u00fargico\". El acabado es excelente, la construcci\u00f3n se siente robusta, la distribuci\u00f3n de la temperatura apropiada. Mucho m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mica que otras alternativas, de marcas reconocidas, pero que usan acero de menos calidad. La uso casi todos los d\u00edas para todo tipo de preparaciones. Es muy IMPORTANTE tener en cuenta que para usar el acero inoxidable se requiere un manejo muy preciso de la temperatura para conseguir la antiadherencia. En el video estoy friendo un par de huevos con muy poco aceite de oliva. Esto hay que hacerlo con la t\u00e9cnica apropiada o sino se va a pegar. Con el uso, y dependiendo las preparaciones, pueden aparecer manchas. Sin embargo se lava con una esponjilla brilla olla suave \"steel wool\" y queda espectacular, como nueva. No se deben usar esponjas abrasivas de metal",
