The company didn't want to warranty it so I was looking for a replacement.I found this as a replacement as I like the fact this is oven safe, PTFE free and ceramic coating, which i feel is safer and healthier. It's a good looking pan and so far not bad. I like that you don't have to use oil or butter. I am a bit leary of non stick as I have gone through several non stick and they all wore out. This one has a 10 yr warranty so hopefully they are still around.I didn't give it five stars because long term don't know how this will hold up and wished this was 10\" instead of 9.5\" but for now it's a four star. I believe this is a good option for anyone looking for a non stick.",
