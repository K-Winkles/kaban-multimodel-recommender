A must have in the kitchen. <br>When you hear the story of housewives, you seem to have the problem of \"pans that will quickly become sticky...\" <br><br>These cause is the strength of the coating and the thickness of the body that supports it. <br>If the coating becomes scratched during use or cleaning, it will result in the effect of the coating and become sticky. So if the coating is strong and doesn't scratch easily, this is a decrease in the process. <br><br>Also, the coating on the pan is very thin <br>The pan is metal, so it will expand when heated by cooking and return to its original when finished with use. This expansion will adversely affect the coating. <br>For example, a liquid phenomenon, thin asphalt on the ground is affected by the movement of the ground/ground. However, if the ground is strong and firm the ground, the adverse impact on the asphalt is reduced. <br><br>As well as a frying pan, the thinner the thickness of the body, the more likely it will be adversely affected. For this reason, the thickness of the pan itself is important, and the thickness is a powerful ally that supports the long life of the coating. <br><br>The \"adamant\" series of Fisler's products have been developed to reduce the risk of making everyday cooking a little easier, allowing the product to be used comfortably for a longer period of time, and especially to reduce the concerns of \"becoming sticky...\" <br><br>In addition, the Fisler's adamant series is a hybrid type with fluorine resin and ceramic coating. <br>Common fluorine resin coating (non-stick coating) has a textured surface and a small surface to make it difficult to stick. <br>In addition, the ceramic coating is resistant to high temperatures and does not have uneven surfaces on the coating surface, giving it a wide surface for a crispy finish. <br><br>The Adamant series of Fisler's \"adamant\" has both the best of both worlds. The secret is in Fisler's proprietary coating. Combined with silicon carbide and fluorine resin which has excellent hardness and abrasion resistance and excellent heat conduction, it has excellent non-stick properties. This means the fusion of fluorine + ceramics is the \"adamant\" series of Fisler, Adamant Classic Induction Ready, Hand Wash"

                "reviewText": "This product just like other nonstick frying pan. The nonstick layer fell off in about 2 years. I took care it very well , because it is so expensive for me. But they told me I can\u2019t redeem the five years warranty for that. So I and my friends won\u2019t never buy the product from this brand. Customer service really really really bad I have ever countered.",
