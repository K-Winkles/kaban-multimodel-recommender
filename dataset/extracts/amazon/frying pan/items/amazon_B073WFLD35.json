We chose this set for their selection of sizes similar to the ones they have replaced and because of their described attributes. We have found the descriptions to be true and our experience with use has been gratifying. The pans are of good heft and they conduct heat evenly. We are happy with the results obtained when cooking delicate and frequently \"sticky\" foodstuffs like meats, eggs and cheese. The pans clean up easily and well and they sit on a level surface without rocking. The handles are firmly affixed, they are comfortable to grip, and they do not feel hot to the touch when the pans are heated during use. Note: our range is fueled by gas. These pans purportedly work on electric coil and induction range tops but we are unable to gage their functionality on those heating surfaces. We are, overall, pleased with these pans.",

I admit, I ordered them because I liked the color and it matches what I have in the kitchen, but now I am extremely satisfied with the quality. They were very well packaged, delivered quickly and even the man who delivered them to us, was amazing. So, 5 stars here on Amazon and 1000 in the sky for these products. Thanks!",
