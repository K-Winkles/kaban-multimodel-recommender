                "reviewText": "I love this nonstick pot so much and the aqua color is so pretty. It's perfect for all the basics. I usually use it to cook pasta, rice, or oatmeal. The size is great. It's a little taller than the average pot, but this is good because it prevents overflow. As an oatmeal lover, I've tried to cook oats in different nonstick pots, and this one is the absolute best. It cooks food perfectly and evenly, while with other ones I've tried, I end up with excess milk, dry oats, etc. Even better, despite being used almost every day for months, there's not a single scratch or mark on it. It survives being in the dishwasher regularly. I also like that the sides of the lid go down into the pot itself to make sure it doesn't fall off. Finally, the handle is great. Good length, and doesn't get hot.",

It cooks sausages and baco evenly and can be wiped out with a paper towel for butter of oil for cooking eggs or pancakes . Very little fat is needed. It washes out and also wipes out very easily and heats up reasonably quickly. Nothing scratches it, it\u2019s not particularly thick construction so mine was slightly bent in transport, not enough to damage the ceramic coating or the overall ability to conduct heat. Only the edge was bent out of round. I used a rubber mallet to reshape it. It\u2019s also lightweight which makes it easier to handle but I was surprised that the food on it can be well browned if desired but it didn\u2019t even burn the butter so can be used on medium high heat if needed. I think it would make a good omelet pan because it\u2019s easy to fold eggs and add them to a serving plate after they are cooked .",
