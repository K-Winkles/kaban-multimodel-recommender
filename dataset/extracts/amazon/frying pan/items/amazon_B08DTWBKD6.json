                "reviewText": "Very happy with our Ecowin Non-Stick Frying Pans. Having They have excellent non-stick properties and the pans have nice even temperatures across the cooking surface due to the large induction number of steel dimples on the bottom of the pans. We previously had expensive Swiss manufactured ceramic coated frying pans which had poor induction plates on the bottom that had to be run on higher power settings. As a result the pans produced uneven heating and food used to regularly stick in the hotter area of the cooking surface. The Ecowin fry pans are granite coated non-stick surfaces and because of the better induction plates on the bottom, we are getting nice even cooking at much lower temperature settings. Would highly recommend these fry pans to anyone looking for quality induction cookware that has excellent non-stick properties at a reasonable price.",
