This is not a lightweight pan, it has some heft to it, so if you are looking for a lightweight pan, this isn't it. The stainless steel is of good quality and the pan is durable and should last for a few good years of use. The only downside to this pan is that it has a shorter handle than I'd like, but that can also be a plus as it makes it easier to fit in the dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "I have an induction stove and this pan is from a brand I\u2019ve used before. Non-stick cookware eventually gets scruffy and this pan is a slightly larger replacement for a pan in my original induction set. Works great for anything you want to cook - a little big for a single omelette. It doesn\u2019t come with a lid but I\u2019m able to use a stock pot lid with it. Very nice pan.",
