                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing! Excellent Non-Stick Titanium Ceramic Frying Pans!",
                "reviewText": "Quick Update, as of March 26, 2017:It is now almost 10 months since I ordered these pans. After having owned these pans for over 9 months now, I can say that the two pans are still performing so well that if I could give this product ten (10) stars instead of the maximum 5 stars currently allowed by Amazon, I would do so.Perhaps the strangest thing about these two pans is that starting about a month after I had first purchased them, everyone in the house -- including even our overnight visitors -- stopped using all of the other frying pans in the house (most of them well-conditioned cast iron pans, and also one teflon-coated pan) and also ceased using stainless steel pots to quickly heat food or to reheat leftover meals from the fridge, and instead switched to solely using these two pans, simply because nothing ever sticks to them (ever see how badly egg and cheese omelet leftovers stick to a stainless steel pot if you try to use if for reheating them? ... it is quite gross, whereas if you put that same food in one of these ceramic coated pans, it reheats quickly with ZERO sticking!).So, I, along with everyone else in my house, love these pans more than ever now that we have been using them each many times per day for nearly a year!Simply amazing pans! They are truly nonstick!My Original ReviewI purchased two of these Gotham Steel non-stick titanium ceramic frying pans, one in the 9.5\" diameter size and one in the 12.5\" diameter size, a few weeks ago. I am a trained scientist and engineer, and thus i am not easily amazed by consumer kitchenware products that claim to be non-stick. However, I am amazed by the performance of these pans after 3.5 weeks of having used them daily.I want to briefly mention that I was an early adapter/user of the so-called non-stick ceramic frying pan technology back around 2010 when the very first generation of \"non-stick\" ceramic frying pans hit the market. I bought one of those early first-generation products back in late 2010 -- it was a \"Green\" brand frying pan bearing a so-called \"green\" so-called non-stick ceramic surface. That pan turned out to be horrible from the very first use; everything stuck to it, and when I complained to the \"Green\" manufacturer,, they acknowledged the problem, and advised that I condition the pan, using hot oil and an oven, in the same fashion that a cast iron pan is conditioned, to try to make it more non-stick, Needless to say, I immediately abandoned that first-generation \"non-stick\" ceramic frying pan, and resolved to wait at least 5 to 6 years before purchasing another non-stick ceramic pan so that the ceramic technology could mature over the years.Indeed, my purchase of the two Gotham Steel pans in late July of 2016, about 4 weeks ago, came about only because I was convinced, after having done some careful research on the web, that the non-stick ceramic frying pan technology had matured greatly over the past 6 years. It is my impression that the non-stick ceramic pans currently on the market -- including the Gotham Steel titanium ceramic pans -- are using approximately sixth-generation non-stick ceramic technology, and it appeared from my research that this latter-generation non-stick ceramic technology was far better than the first-generation product that I had tried back in 2010..Each of these pans has seen use multiple times per day since they arrived here about 3+ weeks ago, and they are still performing perfectly. Nothing ever sticks to the pan surface to any noticeable degree, and post-cooking cleanup of the pans takes just a few seconds, because nothing ever sticks. I am quite amazed at the performance of these two pans.Incidentally, I regularly use sharp-edged metal utensils in these pans, including using a steak knife to slice Italian sausages while in the pan, and neither of the pans shows even the faintest scratch marks!My only cautionary note, if you are considering purchasing one of these fine pans, is that it is very important to never allow the temperature of the cooking surface on the bottom of the pan to exceed 500 degrees F; this upper temperature limit is also firmly and clearly noted in the product information provided with the pan by the manufacturer. It is also very important to never allow cooked foods to dry out and burn onto the pan surface, nor to allow cooked foods to dry and harden on the pan.For full transparency, I want to disclose that I purchased each of these two Gotham Steel pans at their full listed price on Amazon Prime Marketplace. This review reflects my honest experience and opinion in having used these pans on a regular basis.",

I cleaned it in my dishwasher once and on the second use the eggs stuck to the pan and I needed to use a spatula. I bought this pan because it said you could use it in the dishwasher but it seems that this may truly affect the non-stick surface. I still give this pan 4 out of 5 stars because it cleans up better than any pan I've ever seen. I've since gone back to cooking spray and my eggs slide out once again.I would recommend this pan if you don't mind using cooking spray or olive oil. Knowing what I know now, I would still purchase this pan again.",
