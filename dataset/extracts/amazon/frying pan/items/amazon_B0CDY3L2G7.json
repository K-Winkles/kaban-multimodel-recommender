My only complaint is that the handles don\u2019t always stay cool. I have used each pot in various cooking methods over the last three weeks and at least three times I\u2019ve touched a handle that was too warm when it shouldn\u2019t have been.",

                "reviewText": "After using this to brown hamburger I came to understand the benefits of its size. More room allows for separation and flipping of meat and it browns more easily. High sides keep food in the pan. Before this, I was using a smaller skillet and when I'd stir the meat I'd lose some over the edge. My skills improved 100% using this pan.",

After 4 or 5 uses it started sticking in several places and my utensils couldn\u2019t even turn an egg over without destroying it. Not sure if it was a one time anomaly or if the product was just inferior (but the price was not!) I never washed it in the dishwasher or used sharp utensils in it. It\u2019s frustrating to pay so much and get a product that never performed right.",
