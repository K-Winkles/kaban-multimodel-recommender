It's very lightweight, which, at first, I thought I was going to hate, and feared it wouldn't heat well, but for this size, it's actually heated very evenly and performed very well.

                "reviewText": "The high sides are great if you're looking to do more than just fry eggs. I love using this pan to sear over high heat and then finish off in the oven. The non-stick coating is pretty good and cleans nicely. I still use a little oil when I cook regardless of how amazing they tell you the pan is. I really like the size of this pan. It's great if you're cooking for 1 or 2. It's on the small side at 9 inches, but it's very manageable and not too big if you're making a small meal for 2. Hopefully the non-stick coating holds up for a while.",

                "reviewText": "So, this is a nice little pan. Handle is very nice, and the bottom of the pan is a nice, sturdy design. That said, there are a couple of issues. First, the coating seems to be coming off. I cant tell for sure, because I cant actually see any spots where it seems the coating is chipping or anything, but there are randomly little black flakes in my food sometimes. I know the obvious answer is that its simply whatever im cooking being burned a little, but this isnt the case. It is clearly some sort of non-stick coating that is coming off, I just cant tell where or how. Additionally, the pan seems to be a touch ill-designed. What i mean by that is that its not balanced properly. When I put it on the burner to heat it up, the handle is heavier than the empty pan, so it will randomly tip over. Once I have stuff in the pan, this isnt an issue, but I have never seen a pan do this before. Overall, I dont think I would get this again.",

                "reviewText": "Made an omelet and that egg flipped without any problem even got some of the cheese in the pan and that slid right on out with the egg not a problem at all.The second attempt didn't go so well but that was user issue lol tried to flip the egg too soon and end up with scrambled eggs instead which was fine as I could easily add cheese to it without worry of it sticking in the pan.The pan works great as a frying pan though it is deep enough to use it as a shallow sauce pan.I like that it can go from the stove to the oven so you could brown up some meat and then do a one pot baked spaghetti in the oven all in the same pan.",

The non -stick coating is impressive; we've had zero sticking issues. It's easy to clean. I use one single wet paper towel and wipe and then dry with a dish towel. I will wash with soap sparingly. We do have some scratches on the bottom, however, that is due to family members using metal utensils in the pan, which is not recommended nor safe.",
