                "reviewText": "These pans have exceeded my expectations. The pans are heavy duty and non stick. The handles stay cool while cooking. I previously purchased a Granitestone cookware set and was so impressed with how they performed and the ease of clean up I decided do try the Pro cookware set of pans. These pans are superior to the original pans and the originals ended up in the camper. Much heavier duty with better handles with the same great non stick coating. I have bought some very expensive pans from Pampered Chef, SS with the nonstick hexagonal finish, and it is a awesome pan. It is also cost me 180.00 dollars. These pans cost only one third the price and work just as good. No doubt the PC pans will last longer but you can't beat the price and value of Granitestone.One thing to remember is you cannot use scotchbrite pads, or any abrasive pads not only on these pans or any nonstick pan for that matter. Running water cleans most of everything out of the pan. Nor can you use any nonstick sprays. The sprays leave a sticky residue that will that eventually lead to a unusable pan. I use a high smoke point oil like peanut or vegetable in a special hand oil sprayer. You can use one of the pump up sprayers but I found the hand sprayer is easier to use with no overspray.Ok now I have to debunk other reviewers claim that the pans are not non stick or their pans scorched while cooking. I really don't know how peoples perception of what non stick means is formed. If you cook food in a pan some will end up on the sides or bottom and WILL adhere to the pan. It will happen in all pans. How the pan cleans up is where the \"non stick meets the pan\" to coin a phrase! You can of course use a large amount of oil but that is not why you bought these pans. You can use a small amount of oil, which improves the cooking and flavor of your food. Why do you think when you try to make something at home that you had in a restaurant it never tastes as good. These pans are way better than Copper Chef or any of the pans that have a smooth finish. I did not think that would be the case.",

                "reviewText": "Bought over a month ago, and had to loop back to review this great pan set. I have been resigned to buying new \"lifetime\" pans every year, without fail. These pans are something different. In daily use I have not managed to burn, stick or stain anything onto these. Cleanup is better than any pan I have ever owned. For this set, I am going with lower heat, and avoiding cooking sprays that have an additive (lethicin?) that plates out on the surface, trying anything to make a lifetime pan last longer. But these seemed to have hit it. The surface feels rougher than normal pans, and oil seems to run right off and pool away from where you pour it, but it does not seem to affect the food quality at all.Overall, I would highly rate these pans. If they give out after a year or two, I will be suprised, but I will buy another set. Well worth it. Well Done!",

Easy to cook in and easy to clean up. It's been awhile since I changed brands but boy am I glad I made this move! I wanted to use them for a while before I made the review so I could see for myself how well they would work and I heartily recommend them. I confess I do still put a little bit of butter in the pan when I cook eggs just because I like the taste but I did try to see if I would be able to cook them without it and it does work without any oil or butter in the pan! Heat seems to evenly distribute and I've had no issues with anything burning or sticking at all.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always skeptical of the ads with the fried egg being blown across the pan or whatever similar food that just slides onto the plate. These pans, however, have remarkable nonstick capabilities! In full transparency, I do add a small amount of oil and butter, when making scrambled eggs. This is mostly for taste and habit, but no more than a tablespoon for the 12\" pan. We've used it to reduce sauces and it wipes clean. We've seared marinated meat and it wipes clean. I can't speak to the scratch resistance because we use bamboo or silicone tipped utensils, but I have no reason to use metal utensils in any type of pan other than cast iron. We've used the \"copper-colored\" style pans and they lost their nonstick ability after a few months, then began to scratch with the same utensils we're using now. These are light, easy to clean, heat quickly and evenly, and are absolutely nonstick. I would 100% buy this again, as a matter of fact I'm buying a set for my mom as we speak.",
