It's light in weight, cleans very easily and nicely, is large enough for a good-sized omelet, doesn't have aluminum or other materials that may be toxic, doesn't ship like ceramic pans can, and at least after about 20 uses, still is cleaning up /not sticking beautifully. Based on what I've learned about ceramic cookware I expect this will last far longer (so far as food not sticking and not chipping). It's a beautiful pan and definitely the best I've had in a long time!",

You can use your metal utensils with it and don't have to worry about scratching it like you would with a non-stick pan. It is non-stick. You can scramble your eggs and they won't be stuck to the bottom of the pan. It is so easy to clean. Try it, you will be pleased.",

I am happy with the nonstick coating. I think the heat distribution is really nice as well. Cleaning the pan was easy which is one of the biggest reasons I look for in a pan.",

                "reviewText": "I waited a couple months to write my review because so many pans I've owned in the past, I've ended up having to throw out. They'd warp or the bottom non stick surface would wear off. Not this one! I've never owned a pan quite like this and it is just fantastic. The botton still looks brand new and nothing sticks to it. The size is perfect also as I just cook for two. Would definitely recommend.",

For the price it's a no brainer. Very solid and well made. Ordered the 12\" measured more like 11\". Why I docked it a star. You do have to properly oil it. Otherwise food will stick a bit. Even if it does clean up is always a breeze. I'm pretty happy with it and ordered the 10\" version afterwards.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got the 10 and 12 inch pans. The REAL REASON I bought these is because not all induction pans work on my stovetop. These do! So I seasoned the pan with oil as directed and then washed it and used it the next day. Keep reading after this sentence, my over easy eggs stuck. BUT--when I went to clean the pan it was all loose. I did not have to scrub it at all. I don't know if it makes a difference but the first day I used country crock in the pan. After that I went back to my regular pan spray.The next day, my eggs over easy did not stick at all, so then I tried scrambled eggs. Easiest scrambled I have ever done. I honestly thought I was going to return the pans after my first use of the pan, but I wanna keep them now.These are heavier and thicker on the bottom. They feel like the will last, and like I said they work on my induction stovetop!! My other good set of pans are stainless steel with thick discs on the bottom and then the non stick I have are light weight coppery in color but only the small one works on the stove. I have to use the other pans on a portable induction unit.So I am really happy so far with these pans. I just can't afford those hexclad pans they are trying to sell out there.These look kind of similar so I gave it a shot. If they go bad I will change my review. I got them for me for Christmas, but they are not going under the tree. I don't even try to pull the old set. They are my go to pans now. Thank you for my new pans!! :)I attached a video of how nonstick these pans are. I made Gluten and Dairy Free Johnny Cakes. I use an ice cream scoop to measure the amount and the I have to press them down with wet fingers to a pancake shape. I use vegetable spray on the pan and my stovetop in induction. Watch how easy they move. I love this 12\" pan!!",

Just remember to wash it off quickly after it cools !I just use a ScrubDaddy brush..it's dishwasher safe as well! Heat spreading is fantastic!",
