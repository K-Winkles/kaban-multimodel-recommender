I needed one additional 8-inch pan, and rather than buy another Hexclad pan which costs $160 with a lid, I thought I'd give this MICHELANGELO pan a try since it would only be secondary pan in my collection. Like the Hexclad, the MICHELANGELO pan has a surface comprised of thousands of stainless steel nubs which are surrounded with recessed non-stick material. The result is a pan that is nearly indestructible and will last a lifetime. You can use metal utensils, steel wool, Bar Keepers Friend cleaner, etc. without harming or delaminating the recessed non-stick material which would otherwise be a concern with typical non-stick pans.Two important considerations for using these pans:1. Season the pans before first time use by placing a teaspoon or two of avocado oil in the pans for 2-3 minutes on medium heat, then let the pan cool and wipe off the excess oil.2. To maximize the non-stick qualities of this pan, use much lower heat settings than you'd use in other pans. Because of the stainless steel, these pans can get much hotter than other pans. If you don't lower the heat, food may stick. Not a problem though with lower heat settings! For example, if you cook eggs at a heat setting of 4 with other pans, use a heat seating of 2.5 with these pans.If you are looking for a good pan that you will never need to replace and at a reasonable price, try these!",

                "reviewText": "Nice little frypan. Perfect weight and size. Durable handle that doesn\u2019t get too hot to hold when cooking. Included glass lid also has an angled handle that allows it to stay cool and easy to grip. All cookware should come with this type of lid handle! I also got this particular pan because it\u2019s also induction capable even though it\u2019s mostly used on a gas stove. I also like that you can use metal utensils as there\u2019s no Teflon or other type of nonstick surface that would be ruined using metal utensils. BUT, it\u2019s NOT nonstick as advertised. I\u2019m ok with that though, just use oil etc. and put things in it after it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s a sturdy, perfectly weighted pan that has a nice appearance, especially the interior surface - nice design. I got the 8\u201d, looking to purchase the full size frypan as well now too.",

It would not slide out even when I slammed the pan on its side onto the paper plate. I had to pry it out with my fork and it left pieces on the pan. It did wash up easily.The pan etching is beautiful if you want to decorate your kitchen.i used it on my induction cook top at 75%.",

My 9.5 inch size is perfect for me, and it is nice to have a wide variety of other sizes to choose from. The handle for the lid is not to my liking, mainly because it is harder to store; but this is a matter of taste, and some might like that it is easier to hold. Looks like it will last, but of course only time will tell.",

I tried it on an induction oven and an electric oven without success. I've had Teflon skillets that act a lot better with minimal to no oil and no sticking. Other foods might fare well... Like meat or vegetables. But egg whites are out. It is sturdy and distributes heat well.The design is pretty. But I have better cast iron skillets that will do a better job. They hyped the non-stick up a little too much. If you let your burned food in the skillet sit in water... It does seem to clean up nicely without sticking. I don't cook on high heat... I cook on medium to medium low... With the same result. I'm glad I only brought the 8 in. I would have been pissed at the 9 or 12 in",

They are so easy to clean. Usually just a quick swish with a dishrag is all they need. They haven't seen the dishwasher yet. 2. The lids are also great. One for each pan. The handle is designed so you can place them vertically. 3. After almost a year they look just as new as they did when they came. Excellent product! Buy them with confidence.",

I also wanted a pan that could be used on the stove top and in the oven. This one fits the bill, at a price. It is very solidly constructed (i.e. heavy) with a nicely fitting glass lid that has a large handle. The non-stick surface is (apparently) environmentally friendly and has a honeycomb pattern of the base material. The sales blurb says that you can safely use a metal spatula if it has rounded edges. Which raises one negative point--there were no care instructions included, no dos and don'ts. This seems odd for such a pricey item. I would like to know how to take care of it in the long term.",
