                "reviewText": "This pan came securely boxed and was protected inside a drawstring bag so the ceramic finish was not scratched. The handle needed to be attached, and there was a screw driver included. I used the pan for fried eggs with just a little bit of bacon grease more for flavor than anything. The eggs did not stick at all and the pan cleans up so easily. This is a great buy for a very nice pan. I like that there will be no harmful substances leeching from this pan.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered new cookware for my new induction range, but needed a cheap nonstick pan to use for eggs while I wait for those to arrive. I bought for price and did not expect much but this surprised me. It is a hefty, sturdy pan, works really well with induction even on top of a silicone mat, and does not stick. It even looks nice, which isn't the most important thing for a pan but a bonus. I can't speak to durability since I just got it, but at least initially it was nice quality surprise.",

I just clicked on one of the first that came up on my feed.Now, I'm purposely going to the manufacturer's Amazon store page to find matching bigger skillets to make a set.This pan is one if the finest I've ever owned. Far better than any of the black Teflon type nonstick pans used in my past. This pan has a little heft... It's not flimsy/thin/easy-to-chop or warp.The color is perfect, it's a breeze to clean, it even came with a small screwdriver to use in attaching the handle.HIGHLY recommend!",

This is a very thick and sturdy pan. you have to put the handle on when you get it but they give you a really nice screwdriver to get do it with Can\u2019t go wrong with the seller. Fast shipping no hassles highly recommend.",
