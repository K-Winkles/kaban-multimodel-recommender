Super easy to clean , food doesn't stick or burn, and it comes with a lid , spatula and label/stew spoon This matches a small sauce pan I have and is a handsome set. You will have to screw the wooden handle on when you get it but the good news is they include a screwdriver. This skillet (or frying pan) is very lightweight, a nice charge from my heavy cast iron skillet. The handle is removable , but why would you need to do that?",

She was very excited and it teaches her that some things are needs not wants and she deserves it.",
