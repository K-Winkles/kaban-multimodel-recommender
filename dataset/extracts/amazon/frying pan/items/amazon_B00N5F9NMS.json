                "reviewText": "We got the lavender set of 16, = 3 pots, 4 pans, 5 lids, 4 low quality utensils that melt if leaned on edge while cooking.To not damage the pans, don\u2019t use on temp higher than medium! You really won\u2019t need to turn the burned over 5 (medium). All cooking temps are about one notch lower than in our old pans. The utensils that are included, Would be great IF they didn\u2019t MELT and/or SNAP in half the second use. It says to use oil or butter every time, you need like a dime sized drop. If you don\u2019t, and something sticks, put a half tsp water in the pan and cover with the lid for 15-30 seconds, it will be unstuck. It\u2019s a whole new slippery game when trying to flip things. Like an egg, you will want a fork to hold it still while you get a spatula under it. The handles are comfortable and the weight of the pans make it easy to toss diced potatoes up and over for flipping. Things cook more evenly in these than my old pans, and clean up is crazy easy. Toss a napkin in the grease, soak it up, wipe clean let the cool!! Then and wash with soft dishrag. We had issues with first shipping because color we ordered was unavailable, but second color choice finally arrived. We are enjoying this lavender color. Even though the coloring varies from pans to pot. The pans are mostly the same pinkish-lavender shade but the big pot is way different shade of pale flat light lavender. One bummer about this set is the lack of a large frying pan, my old set had a big 13 inch frying pan and the largest one in this set is like 10 inches. The tall sides on the largest frying pan are a nice feature.Yesterday I told my S.O. that these pans are my favorite \u201chouse needs\u201d purchase that we have made since the vacuum. I give these pans a 4 3/4 stars!",

It was reasonably priced, fast delivery! My daughter is very pleased with the set! You barely have to wash anything off the pans. Everything literally glides off! Great all around cooking heat! Best thing for a person who loves to cook daily! Highly recommend!",

I'm being much more careful with this set and will not be using high heat or putting them in a dishwasher. That all said; these are not only cute but also very easy to cook with and super easy to clean. I have one of those older style ranges with the heating coils and it did scratch up the bottom of my saucepan a bit, but a bit of scratch on the paint on the bottom of the pan isn't a huge deal to me.",
