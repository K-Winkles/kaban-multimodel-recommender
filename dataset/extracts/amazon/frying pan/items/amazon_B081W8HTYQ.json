                "reviewText": "I had a set of calphalon cookware, it's heavy & everything sticks to it. I had a set of t-fal years ago (lasted me 20 years) & decided to go back to t-fal. These are lightweight, don't stick, but have the feel of a quality pan. My husband loves them so much he told me to throw out all my old pans & get more t-fal pans. Great product and well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "These are the best non stick pans I've ever had. Had them for over a year. The non stick is still perfect and eggs still slide out perfectly. The reason for this review is that the bottoms chip and will scratch your glass top stove. Too bad because I just love them to cook in. They need to fix this problem. The one I used almost every day started chipping after the first month and continuously got worse so I started using the second one more often. Only after a few uses its chipping also.",
