I like this frying pan because I'm able to use a toaster bag and put a slice of cheese in between two slices of bread and make me a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. Of course it's good for basic frying as well. I also like the fact that you can use metal utensils if desired. The cooking finish is similar to using a cast iron skillet. The only difference is it doesn't rust and it's easy to clean.I don't know how it would do in a dishwasher. I wash mine by hand and let it air dry, and I've had no problems with it whatsoever.",
