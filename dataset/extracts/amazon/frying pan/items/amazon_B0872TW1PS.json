Food cooks very evenly and the flavors stay with the food rather than ending up burned on the bottom of the pan. This pan is truly non-stick, making clean-up a breeze.",

Lo ha hecho bastante bien.No le coloco las 5 estrellas porque ante todo lo sigo probando porque tengo pocos d\u00edas con el, la tapa el revestimiento de la perilla no aguanta lo caliente se escarapela en primer d\u00eda ,el sart\u00e9n no se le quita color ahueado que agarro en la hornilla y a\u00fan cocinando a fuego lento truena el material del sart\u00e9n . Lo seguir\u00e9 probando para saber si comprar\u00e9 otro en el futuro .",
