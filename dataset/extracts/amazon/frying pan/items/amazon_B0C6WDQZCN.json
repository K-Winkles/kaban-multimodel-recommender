This skillet is made from 3.5mm thick 3003 series aluminum alloy designed to withstand daily use in a commercial restaurant kitchen. This 7\" skillet features the Excalibur non-stick finish that prevents food from sticking to the pan requiring little to no oil. The Excalibur non-stick finish bonds directly to the aluminum creating a non-stick finish that is highly scratch resistant and superior to consumer-grade non-stick coatings. The handle is reinforced and riveted in place for a secure grip and long-lasting durability. A hanging hole in the handle allows this skillet to be hung for convenient storage. This fry pan is compatible with gas and electric ranges. Lid sold separately. Hand wash recommended. NSF listed.",
