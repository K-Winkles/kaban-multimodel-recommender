        "description": "Utilizing a custom-formulated stone-derived coating from Germany, the Stone Frying Pan by Ozeri reigns with its ability to deliver non-stick perfection while remaining absolutely free of toxic substances such as APEO, GenX fluorinated chemicals, PFBS, PFOS, PFOA, and the lesser known NMP and NEP. According to the FDA, many of these chemicals constitute a worrisome class of nonstick compounds that have found their way into the food chain, including grocery store meats and seafood. Both the EPA and FDA have conducted toxicology research on exposure to some of these compounds that suggest associations with several kinds of cancers and health issues. Although the harmful PFOA and PFOS acids are being phased out of production, non-stick coatings today are often made with the aid of a new generation of fluoropolymers, known as GenX fluorinated chemicals and PFBS, which the EPA has more recently cited as suggestive of cancer and when consumed, may affect the kidneys, blood, immune system, liver and developing fetuses. Also of concern are APEO chemicals, which are restricted in Germany due to environmental concerns and toxicity in the food chain. By not using any of these \u2018forever chemicals,\u2019 the Stone Pan's coating stands ahead of the curve, achieving the highest marks for food safety and environmental health. In addition, the Stone Pan\u2019s coating is applied using a water-based technique that is also free of the lesser known but potentially harmful chemicals NMP and NEP, sometimes found in cookware. The Stone Pan is far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces, and always a breeze to clean. The Stone Frying Pan is made of a heavy-gauge aluminum core that allows for fast and even cooking without hot spots. It boasts a magnetized bottom for rapid heat transfer on induction stoves, and a heat-resistant silicone-coated handle. Coating made by Weilburger GmbH, Germany. Pan assembled in China.",

The matte black and the cream color/granite style coat really great, simple, clean look. When it comes to cooking, these pans are fantastic. Heating is even and the ceramic coating is truly nonstick. The accidental test was the day I forgot to melt a pat of butter before adding the scramble eggs. There was no sticking during cooking and no scraping after. Anything left behind from cooking slid right off when I rinsed the pan. I\u2019m very happy with this brand.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pan (in the10in size) for use as an egg/omelette pan and it\u2019s phenomenal! Have been using this pan for about 4 months now with no issues. I\u2019m a little thrown off by some of the negative comments on here. Some picture posted seem as if the person used abrasive scrubbers to clean which is a huge No on any pan, with the exception of cast iron.This is NOT a Teflon coated pan. It is a non-stick pan which uses a natural stone-derived coating on an aluminum base. It conducts heat Beautifully thanks to the aluminum base. This is not a problem for those who fear heavy metal toxicity from aluminum cookware since the stone coating prevents food from coming in contact with the aluminum.I read and followed seasoning instructions prior to first use and always clean pan as instructed. I also use wooden or silicone spatulas and utensils (no metal!). My pan looks brand spanking new even after heavy use. My eggs slide off of this pan. I do use a little butter to cook my eggs because why wouldn\u2019t you? I have never encountered any sticking. This is a true non-stick pan, if used correctly.Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. Amazon delivered quickly and pan is exactly what I wanted. I will be buying another (this time a 12inch) to serve as my designated fish and seafood pan.",

                "reviewText": "So I have purchased this pan in October of 2018. It's now January 2019 and wanted to give an appropriate amount of time before leaving any sort of review.The quality of the pan is pretty good. It's fairly heavy, well constructed (including the handle) and the cooking surface really feels amazing.Some points that have come up during the course of using the pan.-It will absorb food/sauce color over time, the sides remain close to or the same color as new, but the bottom of the pan is starting to darken and change color.-Surface is starting to scratch from plastic sponge use, you will see those scratches when viewing the pan bottom close up and it looks like tiny spiderwebs.-Cooking surface still functions with out any food sticking to it which is great! No oil, no butter, no problem.-To this day and I know it hasn't been a year yet, but it seems to have a self seasoning effect every time you use it. Which is also wonderful. You wash it with dish soap and I guess the surface still holds that oily feel like it's ready to go again for your next meal, but still feels fresh and clean. We are happy with it's performance and would not hesitate to recommend based on the performance so far.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for the perfect non-stick frying pan ever since my mom got a Teflon one is the 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s. The one that lasted the longest was a professional one, and the last one I got was one of those copper colored ones. That one quickly lost its non-stick properties.So far, this one is perfect. Nothing sticks to it, and the surface heats evenly. It is easy to clean. It\u2019s so slick that you can always wipe it out with a paper towel. I love it!The only thing I don\u2019t know about is how it will hold up. Time will tell. I have a ding in the exterior finish, but that doesn\u2019t affect functionality. I\u2019m waiting for someone to drop it to see if the coating cracks. You\u2019re not supposed to flash cool it, so no deglazing.Finally a non-stick frypan that I love.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the best non-stick product at a very reasonable price! When this product is fairly new (like a few months in service), I done a non-stick test by making sunny side up eggs with out any oil and it was non-stick and glides off without any sticking! I do use medium to high heat for my cooking and even though not recommended but that is how I use it and it will last at least a year before showing surface wear. The pan is pretty heavy duty so it does not show signs of surface warp or deform even using high heat. My first set has been in service for about two years and now the surface is pretty worn and showing wear and more difficult to clean so I bought a second set of 10\" and 12\". If I can get over 1 year of service on any frying pan using high heat at these prices, I cannot complain and will continue to buy these pans until I can find better ones at comparable price! Definitely will recommended this product, not just the pan, even the 5 quart sauce pan with lid! I just wish they also make pots.",

                "reviewText": "Una sart\u00e9n muy s\u00f3lida y bien hecha, con materiales de calidad. Vale lo que cuesta, considerando que una de tefl\u00f3n dura un par de a\u00f1os y bye.Requiere sus cuidados para ser funcional. Imagino que la gente que puso rese\u00f1as con fotos de comida pegada, la utiliz\u00f3 como si fuera una sart\u00e9n convencional, y no lo es. Lo m\u00e1s importante es no someterla a altas temperaturas, para no arruinarla. Yo cocino a menos de media flama, y siempre con una liger\u00edsima capa de aceite, y cero problemas. Tampoco se debe someter a cambios bruscos de temperatura (hay que dejarla enfriar antes de mojarla), y limpiarla con una esponja, un poco de jab\u00f3n y agua caliente. Recomiendo, utilizar la tapa para cocinar, porque los alimentos se resecan muy r\u00e1pido. Finalmente, se deben usar \u00fanicamente utensilios de pl\u00e1stico o madera al cocinar, para no rayarla.Con esta sart\u00e9n se pueden hacer crepas, omelettes, verduras a la parrilla, y los filetes de carne y de pescado quedan perfectos. Como el mango resiste el calor del horno, se pueden hacer pizzas individuales.Cuesta casi 4 veces m\u00e1s que una sart\u00e9n de tefl\u00f3n del mismo tama\u00f1o, pero la facilidad con que se cocina, la distribuci\u00f3n perfecta del calor y el ahorro de gas justifican el precio. No compren las Jade Cook y Flavor Stone, son mal\u00edsimas y est\u00e1n casi igual de caras.",
