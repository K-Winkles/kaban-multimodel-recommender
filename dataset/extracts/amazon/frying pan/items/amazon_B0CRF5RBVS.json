It is easy to hand wash or throw in the dishwashing machine, no problem. The handle has a great ergonomic grip and finish and details look well thought out.

                "reviewText": "The pan seems to be fairly well made, with a good non-stick surface. The handle is comfortable to hold, and does no transfer heat to the hand when using the pan. The pan is very light. It's actually too light for my taste, but others may find that a plus. You can certainly fry eggs in the pan without using any oil. I actually had a hard time getting an egg out of the pan because it was slinging around in the pan while I was trying to use a flipper to remove the egg. I ended up just tipping the pan and letting gravity plate up the egg. Flipping the egg was a bit tricky, since the pan is so slick it's hard t get under the food to flip it. My only real complaint is the pan is not induction compatible, although there is no claim that it is on the product page. If this was induction ready, I'd order a whole set of them. It does work perfectly with my gas burner and an electric hot plate. I most likely won't ever use it in the oven, but it is supposed to be safe to use I the oven, up to 350 degrees. For en inexpensive pan, it seems to be very well designed and manufactured. Best thing is there is no PTFE to flake off into food, or off-gas toxic fumes when heated.",

I like that I can fry an egg without using any grease, butter or spray & the eggs just slide around in it. It can be put in an oven up to 350* but I've never found the need to do that.

                "reviewText": "While removing the cardboard packaging from the pan I immediately noticed that the handle was pretty loose. I looked at the back of the handle and could see it was held on by a Phillips head screw so I tightened it up and that solved the problem, at least for now, assuming it doesn't loosen up again.After washing and drying this pan I tried frying a single egg in it with no butter or oil and on medium heat. As you can see in the attached picture, the egg stuck to the pan and had to be removed with a silicone spatula. The egg was not overcooked or burned at all, but it still stuck to the pan to the point where it could not slide or be flipped without the use of the spatula.The pan did clean easily, so at least that wasn't a problem.So in my opinion this is just another alleged non-stick pan that doesn't perform up to the claims made by the seller. In my opinion, if it isn't non-stick when it's new it's not going to get any better.I hope this helps. Thanks for reading and liking.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great 10\" frying pan. I cook a lot and this is a good quality non-stick pan that's easy to clean. I love the granite stone coating over teflon. More durable for sure. It's a lightweight aluminum pan (will not work on an induction burner) with an easy grip resin handle that stays cool when using. The pan cooks evenly and, so far, I haven't had any problems with anything sticking. It works great and looks great too. I love it. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I got this pan because I am trying to incorporate healthier and cleaner living. Now that I'm aware of the dangers of Teflon, I am replacing all my cookware bit by bit. This isn't the most non-stick pan compared to others but that is just what goes with not having those chemical-coated pans. A little oil or butter and you're good to go. It's very sturdy, scratch-resistant, and evenly distributes cooking heat, as well as any cooking pan I have ever owned. I also love the non-metallic handles because they are heat-resistant and never get hot to the touch. Washing has been a breeze. Good price point for the product that you're getting.",

You can cook on top of the stove with it or put it in the oven. When you're finished cooking it is dishwasher safe. It cleans up very easily. I believe the price is fair as this feels like it's a quality material and will last for some time..",
