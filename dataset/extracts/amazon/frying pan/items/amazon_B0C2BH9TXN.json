The cooking oil is used to enhance the taste of fried eggs. While the pan works well, we see room for improvement in the manufacture of the pan and in the seller order fulfillment. The screw which attaches the knob to the glass cover arrived already showing rust; it appears that wrong screw material is used. The long spine screw which attaches the handle to the pan did not arrive with the shipment. We requested a replacement from Amazon.com, who promptly reordered it from the seller. The original shipment was returned, and the replacement arrived two days later. The replacement shipment contained all the components. Yet again, the cover knob screw was rusty. Another minus for the product/seller was that the instruction leaflet was not written in English but only in Chinese.",

                "reviewText": "The Buecmue Nonstick Frying Pan is quickly becoming a family favorite in the kitchen. It is easy to use and cleans beautifully. My 12-year-old actually looks for this pan and (gasps) cleans it when it is dirty because he likes it so much. Personally, I don't love the wooden handles on the pan and the lid. I feel like they are impractical for longevity and for cleaning purposes, and quite frankly, they feel a little cheap. However, that is just my preference/opinion, and the handles don't actually impact how well the pan cooks--and truly, the pan cooks very efficiently and evenly. Overall, we are a big fan of this frying pan and would definitely recommend adding it to your cookware.",
