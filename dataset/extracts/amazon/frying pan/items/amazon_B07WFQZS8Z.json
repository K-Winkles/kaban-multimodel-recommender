Ideal for cooking at high heat, flipping, and tossing foods is a snap, thanks to the flat base and flared sides. As part of our Essentials Nonstick Collection, this Fry Pan Set is engineered with 3 layers of our high-performing, nonstick coating, which keeps food molecules from clinging to the surface, making it perfect for cooking sticky or delicate foods. Constructed of hard-anodized aluminum, it\u2019s highly durable. The 8.5-inch pan is great for when you need to whip up small, quick bites and the 10.5-inch will come in handy when you need to cook a quick breakfast in the morning or delicious dinner for two in the evening. Once you\u2019re done eating, simply give it a quick hand washing to wrap up the easiest cooking experience you\u2019ve ever had.",

Two classic sizes, one great for solo cooking and the other for two. Good heat distribution, and eggs slide right off with barely any oil. Super easy to clean. Surface holding up well with wooden/bamboo and plastic implements. I love the weight, just enough to sit well on the stove and be taken seriously without straining my wrists. The weight of the pan itself balances nicely with the weight of the handle, no teeter tottering. The sturdy handle attachment design makes me doubt that there will ever be an undesirable angle in this equation. Great value for the price, I'll be hard-pressed to buy anything else.",

Handles never got hot for me, but I only cooked things for less than 10 mins, so far. Will update after cooking larger, more time consuming meals.Made pancakes, eggs, grilled cheese, which all came out great.Next up is stir fry.They should last for years if you properly take care of them. Most people sadly don't know how to treat non-stick coatings, and crank the heat up too high, let the pans sit empty on heat, stack them without padding in between, use metal utensils, all no-no's with any non-stick coated pans.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Overall I really love these pants they\u2019re heavy duty they clean excellent and they cook really good and are very nonstick. That being said I do need to mention that what is happening with the pans after I\u2019ve had them about six months now is what other customers complain about is the pans are with time warping . And what happens as you can see in the video I provided is things don\u2019t stay level so there\u2019s hotspots and not so hotspots on the pan. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve adjusted to. I still think they\u2019re great pans otherwise for the price. I\u2019m just not willing to pay three times as more for pants I don\u2019t warp and my hands can\u2019t handle an iron skillet so this is the best I can get. They came to in a set I use them every day and I really do love them.",

These are heavy, and heavy duty. Just what you would look for in quality pans. I can finally cook eggs without worry about cleaning the pan afterward. Look forward to purchasing more pots and pans from All-Clad!",

All Clad has been around forever and is known for being great quality so these should last a long time.",
