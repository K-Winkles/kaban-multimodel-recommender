                "reviewText": "This took a while to review because of the steps to get it ready to use (plus the lack of time to do it in), and requires constant upkeep for it to continue being non-stick. First off, the pan itself is ceramic coated aluminum. Though aluminum heats quickly, this has no steel surrounding it so you cannot put water in it right after cooking, or it will definitely warp it. The coating itself is even, though patchy in some spots on the rim (not that you cook with the rim or that it matters for cooking. But, you would not see that with a higher quality pan, and it also makes me wonder if it will eventually weaken around those areas and come off in nearby spots on the wall of the pan). Before you use the pan, the directions tell you to wash it. Afterwards, you are told to fill it to almost the top, then boil it for 5 minutes. Next, place the lid on and let it sit till it cools - this is \"supposed to remove any remaining chemicals used for making it\". Then a heating and oil process 2x. That's a lot for a pan that claims the coating is non-stick. I forget how often your supposed to heat/oil, but it's not a one and done deal. You will have to repeat that process for the life of the cookware. The lid is heavy duty and surprisingly well made, and far surpassing the quality of the pan - something I would expect to see on a more expensive product. I made eggs with this as a test (just for you guys...I don't like eggs, but they are best when testing out something non-stick) and I have to say it worked very well. I would NEVER put something like this in the dishwasher, so for me, it's a hand wash only item (not sure what the directions say, but I always hand wash my pots and pans) and it washed up easily. I do think the price point on this (at the time of this review) is too high. Overall, with the ease of cooking without sticking and effortless clean-up, it earns 4 stars. Would I get it again? No. Not with the base of the pot being an inexpensive aluminum, the work that is required to get it up and going, and the continual oiling process needed, and the current price. I'd rather have a good cast iron if I am going to put that much into it. That being said, I'm not going to get rid of it either....",
