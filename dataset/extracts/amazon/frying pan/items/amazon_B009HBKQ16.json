                "reviewText": "We bought the 12 inch and liked it enough to then buy this 10 inch. I can't speak to longevity, but they are sturdy, cook well, and The handle grip doesn't overheat. I find them to be excellent value at this price point. And i have looked at a lot of pans before buying these. I did buy a 12 inch Blue Diamond from walmart at the same price a few months ago, and these blow that one away by far. The walmart pan was what i expected at this price: serviceable but just ok with a non stick coating that's not very non stick (it requires scrubbing with a gentle faux-metal scrubber to get stuck food off). These are a big step up from that Blue Diamond. These are truly non stick and durable (at least in the short term, which is so far all i can speak to).",

                "reviewText": "As others have noted the handle is a bit long, just use safety measures and keep the handle turned inward to prevent clothes etc from catching the skillet. Cooks well and the nonstick surface is truly nonstick so far and I like the weight of it compared to many that are very light. I find most nonstick wears out over time making a big $$ investment a waste. This one was a reasonable price and if you follow instructions by not using nonstick spray or overheating it should last.",

The coating is always going to have a limited life.This pan has good weight, heats evenly, and is a good size at a good price point. The handle is a little long - that does not bother me much and the rubber cover helps keep it cool. The bottom scratches easily on my stove top but I don't need the outside of the pan to look pristine, I need it to work well. Holding up better than similarly priced pans from big box stores over the first few months of nearly daily use for me. I highly recommend.",

Most stoves probably can't take a 14inch pan and effectively cook in it though. Obviously you are out of luck if you need a lid for this thing.I've used lots of Tramontina pans over the years and love them, much better quality and price than anything else.The coating holds up great, but do not use bamboo or wood spatulas. I don't know what it is, but it will mar up the surface (as some pictures here show). It still functions fine, it's not really scratched, it just looks marred. If you use normal non-stick plastic spatulas and silicone ones the pan will last longer than any other pan.",
