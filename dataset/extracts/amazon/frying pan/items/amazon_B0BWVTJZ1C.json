No more wrapping foil around the top and easy carry handles.My only negative is I kept cutting my hand on one of the handles when I noticed the handle was damaged. It had slithers of metal on the inside of the handle. I took a metal file to it and finally got it smoothed out. Since I got it from Amazon warehouse I knew there could be defects. I am not going to send it back because I think I have solved the problem but I do feel it was too pricey for the damage and problems it could have caused. Otherwise I love the product.",
