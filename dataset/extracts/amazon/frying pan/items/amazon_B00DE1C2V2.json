Aerosol cooking spray leaves a gummy residue that is difficult to remove, and that residue will cause food to stick. Instead, use an oil mister filled with olive or vegetable oil, or dab a bit of oil on a paper towel and carefully wipe the interior of the pan. - Use the correct heat setting. Use low heat for warming, simmering and preparing sauces; use medium heat for frying, grilling, saut\u00e9ing, searing or stir-frying; use high heat for boiling or reducing liquids. - Preheat the pan. Nonstick cookware can take a minute or two longer to preheat compared to aluminum or stainless steel cookware. For best results, make sure your nonstick pan is heated to the proper temperature before adding food. Full Lifetime Warranty This product is backed by a full lifetime warranty. Calphalon will replace any item found defective in material or workmanship when put to normal household use and cared for according to the instructions.

The question is how often do you use it, for what kinds of food , what kind of utensils are you using and finally what do you really expect from a frying pan? Honest answers before hand will likely keep you from being disappointed. This one cooks well for a variety of foods on my flat top electic stove. It cleans up nicely with a non-scratch pad inside and outside. Only one small concern: all previous pans of tis size fit flatly in my stainless sink. This one has a handle 1.5 inch longer. Oh well, I will just have to enjoy its other great atttributes.",

It always performs and cleans up amazing if and has great heat distribution.We use our pan on a gas range so I cannot say how it would respond on an electric range.Definitely worth the buy and Amazon often has a Multi size two pack of this pan for a great deal as well!",

                "reviewText": "Forget the gimmicks-copper color, granite, green, etc. I\u2019ve used and gotten rid of most of them. They worked great for the first few to several months. Then, the non-stick feature fades away. I\u2019ve ended up having to soak them after each use, scrape them with a plastic spatula, and, then, scrub them with a nylon pad. This is a high quality pan (use it only for eggs). I have two other Calphalon pans that get daily use for everything else. Nothing sticks, nothing at all. Heat distribution is so great that I never have to use above a medium low temperature. Clean up is a breeze. They look new after years of daily use. I will never fall for a gimmick, again. You get what you pay for!",

                "reviewText": "When I first got this pan I thought it was a little heavy, but after using it...love it. I have been able to saute onions and potatoes to a flavorful brown, scramble eggs to perfection, cook pork chops and the pan still cleans up so easy. I also like the responsiveness to heat...it takes temp changes well..heating up and cooling off pretty fast. The shape is good with that nice little flair and deep enough to do a lot more than omelets. A plus is that my Calphalon lids fit - both the glass 10\" and the stainless lid. At this price this pan is a bargain. And of course I love that free shipping and good customer service of Amazon.",

The non-stick is a joy and super easy to clean (as expected). The best parts for me are: 1. the value - a substantially better value than what I've used before; and 2. the ability to \"flip\" food - the edge design and handle make it supper easy!
