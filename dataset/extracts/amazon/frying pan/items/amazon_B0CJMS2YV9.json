A great start to clams and linguine. Looking forward to using it again",

I probably use this more as a braising pan/dutch oven than a saut\u00e9 pan and it does a perfect job. Also love the strainer built in to the lid. It\u2019s also very pretty, but more importantly it cleans sooooo easily it\u2019s crazy. I did a lovely French style pot roast with veg that cooked for hours and it was clean in a few minutes with no scrubbing at all.",

You can dog it to death, it will look you in the eye and ask for more.I will be the first to admit I am hard on my stuff. You need to be tough to hang here. So my stuff has to be able to handle the abuse that is sure to follow. The granite stone is able to do that.This is a non-stick pan that truly is non-stick. I have done scrambled eggs in it with no butter or grease. They come out with little to no residue. Its one of those quick wipe out and call it done cleans even.I baked some biscuits in this pan, turned them out onto the counter to see how they were heating. As far as I could see, its a nice even heating with this pan. My crowd didn't have a problem eating them.I thought the pan was a bit weighty. Not bad, I was still able to spin it by its handle with no problem. This is really a good pan. I can see ordering a set in the very near future. Recommend.",
