                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Two months with this pan, and I love it!",
                "reviewText": "After discarding all our old cookware after buying an induction-top range, I wanted a nice, induction-friendly stainless frypan to compliment our T-Fal non-stick saut\u00e9 pan. This pan was a nicely priced option with some great reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try.If you're asking yourself, \"Why two pans?\" I'll give you three reasons why. The first is non-stick pans wear out and wear out really quickly if you cook over high heat, like when you sear meat. This pan doesn't deteriorate when you heat it on high and will last a lifetime. Non-stick pans also don't work well for recipes where a saut\u00e9 is deglazed into a sauce. Finally, as non-stick surfaces wear out, they deposit chemicals in the food you cook on them, and that bugs me.So I have this non-stick frypan, and I am very happy with it. It has a nice heft to it, heats evenly, does a great job of everything from searing to saut\u00e9ing, and is genuinely easy to clean. We do a lot of home cooking here and, two months in, it still looks like new.I thought I'd show you how easily this pan cleans up. The first picture I took was after a dinner where I saut\u00e9d all the vegetables for a veggie-heavy, one-pan zucchini-tomato-chickpea curry, then scooped up the leftovers and used a spatula to get the last of the sauce into two leftover storage containers. If you take a look at the picture, the pan was pretty clean even before it hit the sink. The second picture was taken a couple of minutes later after a drip of Dawn dish soap, some water, and few really quick swishes with a scrub brush cleaned it out, and this is what it looked like. No elbow grease was required. It shines!Here's one more cool thing about this pan: The lid for our 10-inch T-Fal E93897 non-stick pan is a great fit for this one, too. Having a well-fitting led comes in really handy so, if you're looking for that perfect pair of 10-inch standard and non-stick pans, this and the T-Fal might just be your perfect set.Pros:* Induction friendly.* Cooks evenly at every temperature.* No problems with warping.* Really great pan for not a lot of money.* Has been super easy to keep clean.* Mates well with the lid for T-Fal's 10-inch non-stick saut\u00e9 pan, E93897.Cons:* I couldn't think of any!",

Nothing stuck!! Cleanup is super easy too!!! I highly recommend these for everyone and I'm so happy I purchased these. I recommend letting your oil/butter warm up in the pan before adding your food just keeps food from sticking and if it was to stick when you are finished cooking let pan cool down and wipe out what you can and then add water, bring to a boil and scrap off any food stuck on pan \ud83d\ude18",

The secret to cooking with stainless steel is that you have to let the pan get hot before you put in your food and then it won\u2019t stick. Would definitely recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "If you are in college or just starting out then this pan will fit most needs. However if you like to really cook look for a better pan. The best pans are tri-ply pans but they cost more. I bought this pan just for one thing cooking sausages. Cleanup was very difficult. So now I just add water, cover and simmer for about 14 minutes. Drain water and roll them around in pan. If you really want to save money, spend the money and get All-Clad pans or similar professional pans as they will last a lifetime as they have lifetime warranty's.These are NOT professional grade pans as one reviewer claims. I am a Chef and professional pans are always tri-ply pans for even heat distribution. In allot restaurants that I have worked in and also at culinary school just use cheap aluminum pans make by Vollrath. I used a Vollrath pan to make a French Classic Omelette. They do not always want to spend money on good Tri=ply pans. However all chefs that I know used Tri-ply made of 18/10 grade stainless steel or Copper pans at home. Usually All-Clad or Calphalon. It all depends on what you are cooking. For non-stick pans I would say just go with a Vollrath non-stick pan. For cooking French Toast I just use a 12 inch T-Fal pan. I just bought a $135 Hex Clad pan combination Tri-ply and non-stick pan. I will write a review on that after I use it for awhile. And for good sakes when using non-stick pans DO NOT use mental utensils!",

                "reviewText": "VOTO COMPLESSIVO: 95/100LE PADELLE:In numero di 2 elementi di diametro 20cm e 25cm, queste padelle sono composte per la totalit\u00e0 in acciaio inossidabile 18/8 e con fondale in alluminio e non ci sono tracce di BPA, nocivi all'uomo. Sono piuttosto leggere per quella che \u00e8 la loro grandezza \u00e8 ci\u00f2 \u00e8 dovuto all'acciaio ed all'alluminio che hanno ottime propriet\u00e0 termiche mantenendo il peso basso. Un pregio \u00e8 il manico, in acciaio, che \u00e8 leggero resistente anche a padella riempita e mai si scalda per merito dell'aggancio alla padella effettuato tramite 2 rivetti sempre in acciaio che conferiscono un alta resistenza diminuendo la superficie di contatto con la padella e quindi la trasmissione del calore al manico. L'alluminio sul fondo della padella \u00e8 ideale per una trasmissione del calore omogenea e rapida.LA MIA ESPERIENZA D'USO:La cosa eccezionale di queste padelle \u00e8 il manico che non si scalda mai e ci\u00f2 \u00e8 possibile per mezzo di un'idea semplice ma efficace. Hanno una superficie piuttosto grande adatta ad un uso domestico piuttosto che professionale ma la qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 all'altezza di prodotti professionali. La resa termica \u00e8 eccezionale scaldandosi velocemente ed in maniera omogenea. L'acciaio in questione ha effetto antiaderente senza l'uso di pellicole dedicate che poi con l'uso si sfalderebbero nel cibo stesso. Padelle semplicemente eccellenti, migliori di tante e senza difetti evidenti.",
