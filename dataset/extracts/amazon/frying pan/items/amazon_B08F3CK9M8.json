I do everything from stakes to eggs in here and never have a problem. A quick two to 5 minutes soak and all of the food debris comes off. Also washed it in the dishwasher with no issues. With a lid as well. This came in a larger size. Love this pan. Great value.",

                "reviewText": "An unbelievable value combined with good performance. I largely own only All-Clad (expensive but good to very good performance) and Demeyere Atlantis Proline Pans (extremely expensive but superb performance). I needed a small fry pan but couldn't stomach another hundred dollars plus from any of the above sources.What a surprise! This 8 inch fry pan came in a box worthy of being a wedding gift; it was unusually heavy (a good sign) and finally seemed to cook evenly. I doubt it will cook as evenly as any of my favorites but that might prove impossible to notice given the pans' small size. I'm pleased with this pan but I'd be reluctant to even try their 10\" pan given the relatively thin 3 layers they employ.It is a small pan; it can accommodate the largest burger imaginable but not two small burgers side by side if that makes sense. A salmon filet for one, etc. It measures at the very bottom of the cooking surface 5 3/4 inches across. At the top, as advertised, it is 8 inches across.A superb value",

The chances of this pan getting damaged, during shipping and handling, is extremely low. This 8\", 3/ply stainless steel frying pan, with a stainless steel lid and high rim, is exactly what I wanted for making an omelet, or frying a large egg or small piece of meat or fish, for one person. It's extremely well made with a handle that will never detach and it looks beautiful. I've been a fan of stainless steel cookware forever. It never bends if dropped, it always looks new and the metal cleans easily. Just Put water in it and let soak for at least 30 mins. Food will detach easily. I'm going to purchase their 10\" frying pan, next.",

                "reviewText": "It feels like a heavy duty and durable stainless steel pan. It quite literally is a bit heavy compared to my previous aluminum ceramic coated pan so if weight is a problem I would take that into account. The heat distribution is very even and the handle nor lid handle does not get hot. As with frying on any stainless steel pan, it becomes difficult to clean especially if you do not preheat ur meats or oil properly. On top of that, it generally takes slightly longer for me to cook meals with stainless steel. It does get slight scratch marks since I need to use scouring side of sponge sometimes. However I switched to steel since I do not want the coating (ceramic or teflon) of standard pans potentially peeling off into my food. Therefore the benefits outweigh the negatives so far. It seems like it will last for years or decades, which is really nice compared to coated aluminum pans.",

                "reviewText": "I like to cook with tri ply stainless steel pans, and have usually purchased them from professional restaurant supply companies, which are often fairly expensive pans, just to have a cover for the pan. A premium maker of stainless steel pans for home use does not even have a cover for their smaller pans.The 8\u201d Fortune Cookie fry pan was completely surprising for two reasons.1- the low cost, since I was prepared to spend quite a bit more.2- the weight of the pan. Frying pans used in commercial kitchens are often 8 or 10 guage, which are very thick. A decent pan for home use is 14 guage. I am guessing that the Fortune Cookie frying pan is 14 guage.Although the pan is not a heavily used pan, it fits my needs perfectly.It turns out that the lid to this frying pan also fits the All-Clad 8\u201d non stick frying pan, for which a lid is not available. A frittata, is more easily made in a nonstick frying pan. I use the Fortune Cookie frying pan for poaching eggs in tomato sauces which may ultimately eroded the cooking surface of nonstick pans.",
