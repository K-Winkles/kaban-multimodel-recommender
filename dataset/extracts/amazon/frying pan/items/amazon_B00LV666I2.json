                "reviewText": "Great nonstick ceramic skillet! Like everyone else commenting here, I have had many experiences with ruining nonstick skillets. This is my second skillet of this brand/type, and the first one is holding up well because I am finally following the following rules: Never heat beyond low or medium. Heat empty for one minute \u2013 \u2013 no more. Never use oil spray! The propellant creates a sticky problem over time. After one minute of heating, add a very small amount of butter or oil. Heat 30 seconds, then add your food. Never, ever use any utensils with this skillet except for plastic or silicone! Forget the dishwasher. Only AFTER the skillet is cool, gently wash it with a sponge and soap. Dry it gently and do not stack it with other hard items unless you put a dish towel between them. This sounds like a lot of trouble, but it's a lot more trouble to throw out your nonstick skillet every few months when it loses its nonstick qualities. One other piece of advice: order one of these exclusively for cooking omelettes or other eggs. Never cook anything else in it. A good French omelette requires a wonderfully nonstick surface.",

Hopefully that will not cause any issues down the road with the rest of the finish. We have only used it once so far to cook some eggs and pancakes. My husband had not read the instructions and wasn\u2019t careful to keep the flame on the gas stove directly under the pan and the base of the handle began to get toasted and smelled bad. So just be warned if you have a gas stove especially don\u2019t let the flame reach beyond the bottom surface of the pan. It\u2019s sad the handle is now slightly brown there after our first use. Other than that the pan looks great in the kitchen, and the pancakes and eggs cooked up perfectly and the pan was easy to wash.",

When my old frying pan's Teflon coating (something I want to get away from) started flaking, I decided to try this pan. After using it, I decided to replace my current set with a full line of GreenLife's pots and pans (I will buy bake wear in the future). The pan is lightweight and I love the soft grip handles, they are cool to the touch and very secure. There has been no sticking at all and clean up is an absolute breeze. I am careful to follow usage and washing instructions and I just loved it. Looking forward to my complete set arriving.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pan for my husband, so he did not ruin my new set of pans. I bought this because of two things: the price, and its not Teflon. I was looking at this set when I bough my new set and decided against it. But, boy am I really surprised. This one is one of the cheaper models that this company offers and I have to say....This pan is really nice. These sorts of pans need a little oil or butter in them to perform well, and this one does! I use low heat on all of my non Teflon pans and this is no exception. Lightweight without feeling cheap, nice handle and good heat distribution. The only downside is no metal conductor on the bottom of the pan. But after using for about a month on gas stove, it is holding up nicely with hardly any evidence of use. I use only silicone utensils on the pan and so far no problems. My husband is really hard on cookware and this is holding up to his high heat fast cooking style. I will be looking at this company's options if I am ever in need of new set. Would be nice if these companies would offer separate lids for an option. Really like the lids with the silicone rim. Just saying.",
