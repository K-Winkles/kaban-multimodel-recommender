                "reviewText": "We do lots of cooking and prefer nonstick pans where possible. It\u2019s been hard to find a good nonstick surface that lasts along with a quality pan base - until now. These pans have the benefits of cast iron along with nonstick properties. They are quite heavy but that is a good thing as they heat pretty quickly and hold temperature well. I bought the metal handle pans as I want to be able to put them in the oven for an omelet and such. The first item we cooked was French toast and it was terrific; the minimal butter remained in the pan and it was easy to wipe out. We are mainly treating these pans like you would cast iron; season the interior & wipe clean when done. If what we cook needs more cleaning we hand wash gently. My husband loves to cook; these are his go-to pans. I have placed silicone trivets between the pans to protect the interiors. I highly recommend this cookware.",

                "reviewText": "I jumped on buying this set when I saw they were on sale. I don't regret buying at all. From the moment I unpacked these pans, I could tell they were heavy-duty and built to last. The weight provides a sense of durability that is often missing in other nonstick pans. The construction feels robust and sturdy, making them perfect for everyday use.One of the standout features of this set is the quick heat-up time. The pans heat up rapidly and distribute heat evenly across the surface. This ensures that my food cooks consistently and efficiently, saving me valuable time in the kitchen. The nonstick coating works like a charm, allowing for easy food release and minimal oil usage, promoting healthier cooking.I am particularly impressed by the scratch resistance of these pans. Despite regular use, they show no signs of wear and tear. The nonstick surface remains intact but I have been cautious only using wooden and silicon utensils. This durability adds to the overall value of the set, making it a wise investment for anyone who loves to cook.Great buy, highly recommend to anyone who is shopping for high quality nonstick pan.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So I've been wanting to get a really nice set of pans for a long time. I've always had pretty crappy pans, but I've made do. I just also want to add that I've cooked on a semi-professional level so I know what to look for in a good set of pans. I'm always critical about pans that are non-stick... All pans are non-stick if you use the correct amount of heat or the correct amount of fats. However, to ease life in the kitchen on multiple people will be using this set. I decided to go for non-stick. I have had my eye on (and will probably end up getting) a set from hex clad. They really live up to the hype. However it's just a price point that is super unreasonable for me right now, so I wanted something comparable. These pans are so easy. They make cooking really fast with great heat distribution and conductivity. The handles apparently can get pretty hot but I have yet to experience that since I have just cooked on the stove top for quick simple cook so far. I will say the two things I would change if I could though I know you can't have everything. Is the cleanup and the weight of the pan. The small indentations do make it kind of hard to cook everything because you do get some sticking in the small little crevices though it still is really simple cleanup comparatively. They are a little heavy however, their material really helps with that fast cook so it depends on what matters more to you. It says that they are cast iron but they feel more like a porcelain so I'm sure washing them with care and by hand is probably the way I'm going to go to avoid any cracks or breakage though they seem really sturdy so far. All in all, I'm really glad that I finally just purchased them and I know it's early days but they are really putting in work already.",
