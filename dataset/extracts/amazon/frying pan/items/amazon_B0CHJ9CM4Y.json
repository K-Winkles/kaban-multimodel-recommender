                "reviewText": "When cooking with this pan it is an ABSOLUTE MUST that you oil or butter the pan in order for your foods (e.g.: eggs) not to stick. The marketing for this pan is a bit deceptive. This is not mentioned in the Amazon advertisement for this pan. However, on the box of the pan it is printed \u201cA little oil/butter required (sic) during cooking\u201d. Therefore, be aware that the non-stick feature is about easy clean-up of the pan and not about cooking without first oiling the pan. When oiled (use oil or butter; don\u2019t use PAM), the frying pan cooks wonderfully. Without oiling the pan scrambled eggs will stick to the bottom of the pan and turn brown.The 2-metal side-grip handles are large, comfortable, and easy to use for safely moving or lifting the pan. The shape and size of the metal grips are very good and very effective. It\u2019s not required that you loop your fingers through the holes to use the metal side grips. You are able to cradle the grips in the palm of your hand, if you desire to lift the pan in that manner. The metal knob on the lid is also large, making it easy and comfortable for removing the lid from the pan. The metal side grips and the metal knob on the lid do become hot, so when moving the frying pan you will need to use heat protection (i.e.: potholders; mitts; towel) for your hands.The frying pan has a solid, balanced feel to it when cooking. And the bottom of the pan \u201cgrips\u201d the burner so that the pan doesn\u2019t slide. I appreciate that! Liquids heat readily. When filled 2/3 with cool tap water, it takes about 5-minutes for the water to reach a full boil.Cleaning is a breeze. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that the pans are not washed in a dishwasher. I hand-wash my pots and pans, so that\u2019s no inconvenience for me. But the pan and lid cleans-up so easily that even the dishwasher-user-diehard wouldn\u2019t really be inconvenienced to hand-wash this pan and lid.One \u201cflaw\u201d I noticed is that during washing, water seeps into the knob handle of the lid and gets stuck there. Not good. The \u201cstuck water\u201d cannot seep into the pan or into the food that you are cooking; even so, I don\u2019t like the idea of \u201cstuck water\u201d hanging-out on the underside of the lid\u2019s knob.The frying pan arrives \u201cunassembled\u201d. Using the wrench that is provided, you will need to attach the two metal side grips to the frying pan.On the whole, this is a really nice frying pan, and I am enjoying using it. It\u2019s a good pan and I like it!",

                "reviewText": "This pan is absolutely beautiful, both inside and outside. Solid, durable, and highly polished stainless steel construction. It arrived well packaged with the handles detached. Handles with hardware and a small tool are included for easy assembly. No instructions, but a cinch to figure out. The instructions for care are printed on the box. Manufacturer suggestion is to use oil or water only and NOT cooking spray. This pan heats QUICKLY. Instructions on the box for stovetop application state \"medium to low heat\" so, if you have a power burner on your rangetop, too high of a heat source will burn the food surface, without cooking the food throughout. The cleanup is pretty easy. It is not completely non-stick. As indicated in the description by the seller, the design \"improves\" the non-stick property. It does not state that it is completely non-stick.I fried pork breakfast patties as a test. I did not add oil or water to the pan prior to cooking, thinking that the oil rendered from the patties would be substantial. The patties stuck and blackened a bit. But, to the seller's point, I did not follow the instructions printed on the outside of the box. I did not cook on a low-medium flame, nor did I use oil or water. Once I lowered the flame, I added a touch of water, covered the patties and let them simmer a bit, they came out just fine. The residue left behind was simple enough to clean. I added a bit of very hot water to the pan, let it simmer a bit and the residue slipped right off. I then tried my hand at scrambled eggs, since they always seem to stick on surfaces that claim to be non stick. This time I added a little oil and the eggs fried without sticking to the surface. Once the pan completely cooled, I washed it with a warm soapy water, rinsed and dried it - beautiful! This pan cango from range top, into the oven and to the table for a beautiful presentation, which is an excellent feature.As with most \"non-stick\" type pans, proper care is important to maintain even heating and the non-stick property, and this pan is no different. Since this pan does not come with enclosed detailed instructions, take heed and be sure to read all instructions on the box. As suggested, I used wooden cooking utensils and did not apply any rough scouring in cleaning. The cleaning is a breeze if you use caution and follow the manufacturer's recommendations. This pan is solid and I anticipate that it will last for many years. For its beauty, solid construction and versatility I would highly recommend this pan.",
