Needles to say I am very happy with my purchase.I love this pan and can't say enough about it!!! It heats fast and evenly so everything cooks at the same rate not just what's closest to the center. Clean up is a breeze. The pressure valve in the cover does come out easily but is not the issue some reviews are making it out to be. I just put it back in the cover...no big deal. The size is great. Wide enough to do 4 chicken breasts and deep enough to make soup. The spatula included is of substantial weight and feels good in your hand. The removable handle so it can go into the oven adds to the versatility of this pan. The heat sensor in the handle is nice too making it easy to know when the pan is hot enough to get a nice sear on the meat. I bought the pink. I love that I had a choice of colors. All this and a reasonable price too? Very happy with my purchase!!!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been waiting for an alternative to the Always Pan as I refused to pay $150 for a pan that can\u2019t go into the oven.Enter the Tiborang Pan.I love the versatility and it works in the oven! To try it out I decided to do this chicken and fettuccini baked dish. I had to pan fry the chicken thighs so I followed directions and had it on medium heat and yes, it heat up quickly and pan fried evenly. So in that regard, it\u2019s a nice replacement for a skillet.Next, I had to boil the water for the pasta. I will admit, it took longer to boil water but eventually I was able to put all the pasta in the pan and it fit nicely for me to stir. So it\u2019s fine as a pot.By the way, it comes with a steamer pan that allowed me to put asparagus in the basket above the pasta and use the low pressure lid to do its thing. It steamed well and here\u2019s where 4 stars come in: the directions state to use a fork to release the pressure valve and not your hand. Well I did try to use a fork and nothing and pressed the red button again and it popped inside. That was annoying but it is a rubber thing that I guess is more for decoration.Finally, I added the sauce, herbs and Parmesan and added the chicken back on top of the pasta and in the oven it went. This does come with a removable handle so you need to remove it before putting it in the oven. I baked it for 20 minutes and it came out great! So it\u2019s fine as an oven cast iron or casserole dish (even though it\u2019s not).Clean up is a breeze - you can imagine this In a casserole dish would\u2019ve been a mess - nope, not this. Keep in mind you have to let it cool off before cleaning it. I hand washed it and it cleans like a dream.So all in all, this is a great pan even with the minor flaw of the air pressure valve. I\u2019ll check in a few months later with an update.",
