It\u2019s a beautiful pan, I love the color and look. It cooks, and cleans up easily, no sticking so far. We\u2019ve ordered GreenLife ceramic pans before, and have been extremely disappointed.

                "reviewText": "I'll keep this short and sweet. I've tried several \"nonstick\" pans before but this is the only one that has lived up to the claim so far. Nothing has stuck.I also like the flat bottom it is easier to clean compared to pans that have ridges or any significant texture on the bottom.Helpful hint: Never use nonstick spray on nonstick pans. The lecithin will eat away at the coating. If you want to use something for additional nonstick fortification or other reason, get your oil of choice and pour it yourself into spray or mist bottles you can get made for oil. Or use butter or crisco hey whatever it is that's your go-to use that...just not PAM or other premade spray unless it says it's 100% oil.Bonus points because it's pretty.",

                "reviewText": "We have been avoiding teflon skillets for years, because they always end up flaking off, with us eating that toxic stuff! But we have been noticing that when we try to fry corned beef hash, all the tasty browned portion ends up bound to the bottom of our stainless skillet. Such a waste!So we finally ordered this in the 11\" width. It browns the corned beef hash perfectly, with none sticking to the pan. I fixed chicken marsala in his pan and though the recipe warned that teflon skillets would not give good browning of the meat, this one gave excellent browning. The 11\" width is perfect for all but the largest recipes, and I find it much lighter on the wrist, which is important for the elderly with arthitis. Lastly the bottom stays nice and flat when heated so it stays in good contact with my glass-top range, with no hot spots and very even heating. This fry pan is a real winner. I was not paid, nor given free or discounted product in return for this review.",

The coating is fine, the non-stick quality seem solid, and cleanup has been ridiculously easy.In recent years, I've become a convert to ceramic pans (vs traditional teflon and similar \"anodized\" pans.)I don't know if this'll hold up in the long run, but currently I think it's marvelous and the Redshef brand in particular seems good quality.",
