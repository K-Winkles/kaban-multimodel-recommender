Slow Melting Syndrome is when outer crust perfection is achieved before the sandwiched cheese has adequately melted.

To avoid any potential sogginess from steam trapped under the lid, I leave the top off the sandwich, cover the pan until the cheese is melted, then add the top and finish the sandwich as usual, uncovered.

                "reviewText": "It cost more but I have never used a better non-stick egg pan and I have tried many! I use an induction stove and this pan is very inductive and heats quicker that my other induction pans. Must be a good bit of steel in there and the heat is distributed evenly through the whole pan bottom. Perfect size for the one or two egg sandwich! The glass lids works great and made doing steamed ham and eggs a breeze.Don't waste your money, this is the ONE!",
