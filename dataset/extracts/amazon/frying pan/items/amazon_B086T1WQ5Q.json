The food does not stick at all, and the coating doesnt seem like something that is going to peel off. Heat distribution seems great. My husband and I are both chefs, so we do some hefty cooking at home, and the pans do just fine. They are not as heavy duty as some $$$$ sets like All Clad...but I knew that going in of course!!! And for the price, I did not expect the quality of professional cook ware. Anyway, I love these pans. 5 stars.",

Also the largest size pan's external base sofar has remained flat. On the inside is the center is slightly raised compared to the periphery, the same applies to the middle sized one. This doesnot seem to matter much in the daily usage. It is true that it would have been nice if they had come with lids,however a well known Swedish company sells universal lids made of a soft rubber like material which addresses the problem somewhat. The fact that the pans are not dishwasher compatible is a little disappointing, but as the pans are easy to clean, it is something I can live with.",

                "reviewText": "The handles on these pans got hot instantly! And they were as hot as the skillet that was on fire! My hubby used one first and when he complained I thought he was being whiney. Then a few minutes later, I cooked something. I simply moved the handle (didn't grab it - just pushed it away to keep from accidentally bumping into it while cooking.) I literally burnt my fingers! I've been cooking 50 years and I've never felt handles this HOT!! Protection needs to be added. Someone is going to get hurt!",
