                "reviewText": "I was eager to receive this pan ... the 9.5 inch size seems just right for my purposes and I didn't have that kind of pan on hand .. This pan looks beautiful and well made ... has a good heft to it ... I read other reviews from this brand and expected that I'd have to attach the handle myself - but that wasn't the case here ... the pan came fully ready right out of the box .... it was also reassuring to see that when I washed the pan the water just rolled off the surface on it's own ...that seems a good start for non-stick cookware ... there are several reasons though why I took one star off of the review ... although the packaging was nice and attractive ... it was kind of generic ... no mention of the brand aside from a small code sticker ... also I was surprised ...and disappointed ... that there was no literature enclosed ... no instructions for how to prepare the pan for it's first use ...that's easily found on google of course, but I expected something from the manufacturer explaining care of it's product ... also no warranty care or mention of one that I've usually seen with similar cookware ... also ... it seems customary that the center circle at the base of the pan might be engraved with the maker's name .. it seems that whatever might have been there has been excluded .... probably a company in China that produces generic cookware for other brands .... having said all of that ... the look is handsome ... the weight has heft and balance ...the price point is right on the mark ... I'll see over time how the non-stick endures..but right away I'm pleased with the order and with the caveats I've mentioned would recommend this pan to others ...",

The nonstick coating lives up to its promise, allowing for easy food release and quick cleanup, and I appreciate that it's PFOS and PFOA free. The handle stays cool during cooking, providing a comfortable and secure grip. Being dishwasher-safe is a time-saver, making post-cooking cleanup a breeze, though I will say the handle can hold water, so extra drying time may be needed. A combination of convenience, safety, and performance, making it a valuable asset in any kitchen. Highly recommended for those looking for a reliable nonstick skillet that delivers on its promises.",

The rest of the review still holds true, but I wouldn't order this pan knowing that the paint will come off.We have been using this pan for several weeks, and we are really happy with it. The nonstick coating seems durable and the pan washes well in the dishwasher. I am now using my induction burner almost exclusively, and I needed an induction-ready omelette pan. In the picture, I am preparing a frozen scallion pancake. To get them to puff, you need to swirl them in the pan over fairly high heat. They already contain a decent amount of oil so I do not like to add any to the pan. This pan did the job perfectly! The handle is heat-poof and comfortable to hold so swirling the pancake was a breeze. It heats up very quickly and evenly on the induction burner. It also cools quickly - great if something starts to scorch. The height and curve of the walls make it perfect for omelettes, but it is also great for any type of saute. I will probably keep using it daily. The price was great, and I would order another pan from this brand.",

                "reviewText": "This Hensenmen omelette pan replaces a Red Copper 10\" that lasted 3 years - although the last year was a little sketchy. That's the nature of \"non-stick\" cookware, they're wear items and they don't last forever. So commenting on the lack of friction provided by this 9-1/2\" pan is hardly fair, because they'll all perform the same out of the box - I cooked some eggs over easy this morning which was no trouble at all, and the result rivaled my trusty cast iron. What I can comment on is the quality of this pan - I would say excellent. The finish is without any flaw, and the pan feels very solid and has a nice heft and balance. The handle lug is substantial and the handle itself, while billed as \"Bakelite\", has a nice grippy feel. I'll have be careful about that handle on my gas cook-top. The only thing you can't do is put it in the oven, but there are better pans in the cupboard for that. I take care with my non-stick items by never using a heat higher than medium-low, never using metal or wooden utensils, and always using a quality oil or butter (never cooking sprays). I also would never put something like this in the dishwasher, I'll have to leave it to someone else to comment on the results of that. We'll see how this holds up over time but I'm sure it will last as long as its predecessor.",

                "reviewText": "This pan is truly great quality. Heats up and cooks food decently and evenly. Things dont stick on here as much as other pans do! I have realized that if you let things cool on here it does get stuck a little more but if you clean sooner, things just slide right off. Its one of my better pans right now! the price for the quality is appropriate and you truly cant go wrong. Its a great quality pan and the handle feels nice and comfortable in my hand as i cook. I like that its a little higher up from the flame so the handle doesnt get warm or melt. Really great skillet!",
