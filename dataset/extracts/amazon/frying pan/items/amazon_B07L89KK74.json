I love them I don\u2019t use metal utensils anymore. There are spatulas and utensils now that the edges are sturdy, yet thin enough to be able to get it under a piece of meat, fish or eggs. Read the instructions on any of these nonstick pans carefully. You do not have to use oil in these pens if you start using oil with metal utensils you will be the one to destroy the pan. There are a lot of options on Amazon to purchase the proper utensils to use. I have bought several. The newer spatulas are very \u201cthin edged\u201d they are not the spatulas of yesterday! I prefer the silicone or nylon spatulas. They are wonderful.",

What I do not like id, Ive gotten 2 skillets from different locations. The first skillet after 1st use, of cooking a steak, there was a slight discoloring inside the center of the pan. After a few months, I finally bought another bigger skillet. After I used new skillet a few times, this pan too, had a slight discoloring inside center of them pan. It must have something to do with only the bigger sized slillets, because I have 3-smaller sized skillets, used many times, & they still looks as good as when I bought new. And yes, I have 4 several other pot style pans, & none of them have not had any discoloring type in them as larger skillets did. I myself will never buy Granitestone skillets again. Wish pictures could be left so I could show you the discoloration I am speaking of.",
