I like the build quality as they are riveted and have no screws to loosen or strip. I chose Aqua to go with everything in my kitchen, and perhaps understandably, but unexpectedly, the beautiful Aqua finish turned dark olive green after using the pans. Great product, (and I use them extensively) and have had none of the negative experiences' others seem to have. I cook on gas stove only, as these would definitely scratch the surface of a glass top electric stove. I would only say that you should use only wood or silicone utensils (my preference) to preserve and protect the cooking surface. Although it states dishwasher safe, I am not a fan of the dishwasher, so can't make any observations there. Nonmetallic scrub pads work well.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the Farberware brand of pots and pans. I have the classic stainless steel set and love them. But saw these on sale and figured they'd be easier to clean...which they are. And lighter in weight, too. I've used four pieces of these nonstick ones so far and am happy with them. I can't say much about durability because I haven't had them long enough yet. But the weight (light but doesn't feel cheap) and the ease of cleaning are worth five stars. Oh! I saw these on sale on here, then saw that the warehouse had a set. So...got them for just a little over half price. Really great deal. The only thing I could find was a dent in the edge of the cookie sheet, which doesn't affect the performance at all. And yes, I love their bakeware, too!",

                "reviewText": "I like the large size for an even temperature cooking surface across the whole pan. Smaller pans have different cooking characteristics because the edge of the pan is curved up at the edge of the hot cooking surface resulting in uneven temperatures. This one has plenty of room for 4 eggs or2 country fried steaks etc. The cooking leftovers wipe out with a paper towel and he non stick surface does not hold a greasy film after cooking oily foods. I like it",
