                "reviewText": "After three weeks of light use, the hollow handle fills up with water when I wash it, dribbling dirty dishwater everywhere for hours afterwards, sometimes even pissing out a puddle of water days later when I'm trying to cook with it. Given the price point, I didn't expect this pan to last long, but I did expect to get at least six months of use out of it. What garbage.",

                "reviewText": "Pan is easy to clean and, food not sticking, but the bottom is not even. The middle portion of the pan is elevated and when you fry egg, the egg will slide to the side. When I fry steak, the center is already burnt before the sides is cooked. I tried to use it this way but it is so frustrating. I will try to contact the seller or Amazon if I can have it replaced. Or even return it.",
