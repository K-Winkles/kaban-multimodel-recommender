Nothing sticks to it, even the melted cheese. I have also used it to fry other things with no problem. I like that it heats evenly and I never burn food with it. I only wash it by hand with a sponge and mild dish soap- I have never put it in the dishwasher, and it is very easy to clean. I bought the Calphalon nylon utensils to use with it and I have had no scratches or damage to the non stick surface. With proper care this seems to work very well.",

My early experiences are that the heating on my electric stove-top is uniform across the pan and that eggs, for one, do NOT stick to the surface.

If you were to cook helping after helping it probably would get uncomfortably warm but for single dishes cooked for just a few minutes - it is an egg pan after all - it should be no problem.Obviously I have no way yet to judge durability.

El sarten es mucho m\u00e1s ligero que un sarten de la misma marca y tama\u00f1o que tengo y que por su antig\u00fcedad ya lo quer\u00eda cambiar, me quedar\u00e9 con mi sarten antiguo en tanto compre otro en una tienda f\u00edsica para asegurarme que la calidad corresponda a la marca. No lo regresar\u00e9 para no perder mi tiempo y seguramente lo desechar\u00e9 pronto por su mala calidad. NO COMPREN ESTE PRODUCTO ES UN FRAUDE.",
