                "reviewText": "I've been on the hunt for a cooking pan since I moved into my new college apartment. This pan is absolutely fantastic and highly efficient. It arrived in attractive packaging and was a breeze to attach the handle, thanks to the straightforward instructions. It's nonstick, allowing for effortless cooking without needing oil, and it retains its nonstick quality remarkably well. Cleaning is easy. It heats up quite rapidly, allowing speedy cooking. Overall, this pan is amazing A+++!",

It came securely packaged and has a great surface for evenly cooking. This is my go to cast iron for making eggs every morning. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pan on a whim. I\u2019m an experienced cook and have 2 of every type of frying pan. This pan is the best pan I\u2019ve ever used. I wasn\u2019t expecting much as I love my cast irons and carbon steels. With both, you can only fry and must be careful not to cook anything acidic as you will lift the seasoning layer that took so long to establish right off. All that nurturing down the tubes.With this pan you need not worry about that. It requires no seasoning and you can cook anything in it, which means you can use any acidic liquid to deglaze the pan and make a sauce from the pan drippings. Can\u2019t do that in a carbon steel or cast iron pan. They have their place in any well equipped kitchen, but have limitations. The beauty of cast iron and carbon steel is the superior heat induction and even cooking. Also, the ability to withstand quick temperature fluctuations without warping.This pan provides you with the best of both worlds!! It\u2019s cast iron, so heat induction is excellent and no cold spots, which is a huge drawback with almost all nonstick pans. And\u2026this pan is the best nonstick pan I ever used!! Straight out of the box you can fry an egg and it will slide right out of the pan!! I first bought the 10 inch and once I used it, I immediately ordered the 8 &12 inch pans! I now use them almost exclusively! But this pan!! You won\u2019t be disappointed!! Two thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
