Rinse and dry thoroughly, then season by lightly rubbing cooking oil onto the cooking surface and heating over medium heat for two to three minutes. When cool, hand-wash in warm, soapy water, then rinse and dry thoroughly.Do not use nonstick aerosol cooking sprays in your nonstick pan. They will leave a residue, which may be difficult to remove and will cause foods to stick to the pan.To preserve the look and performance of your pan, we recommend using silicone, nylon, bamboo or wood utensils when cooking. Regardless of how hard the cooking surface is, using metal utensils or sharp objects may damage the cooking surface over time.Cooking using low to medium heat only. Since aluminum yields excellent conductivity and delivers even heat distribution, the usage of high heat is not necessary. In fact, the use of high heat can permanently discolor and damage your pan.Keep the pan on the burner only during the necessary time for cooking. Do not overheat empty pan.Always use protective mitts to safely handle a hot pan.Avoid sudden temperature changes such as immersing hot pan in cold water. Always let the pan cool before washing.When using your pan on ceramic glass stovetops, always lift (do not slide) to move to avoid scratching the cooktop.",

When we had to toss out our last pan after only a couple of months, I did a fair amount of internet research. As is typical on the Net, no product is all good and few are all bad. I settled on the Tramontina and am happy with the choice. It is a good size for a wide variety of needs, it heats up fairly fast with an even heat distribution, and the non-stick surfaces has held up really well (after 2+ years). The only \"down side\" we have found is that the long handle makes it difficult to store in a drawer (we hang ours in the kitchen pantry - problem easily solved with a nail).",

This pan received good marks in a few online comparisons I read. Although we don't utilize a non-stick skillet a lot, it's invaluable for certain tasks. We are happy to report this has performed flawlessly since receiving it. Eggs, fish, anything we've thrown at it has been successful. The construction is sturdy, the weight is substantial and the removable silicon handle is a bonus! It's oven safe up to 400F with the handle and 500F without. Like most cookware, it has a few \"hot spots\" but cooking, in general, produces even heat - at least, as good as you can expect. No issues. We can confidently recommend. Great value too!",

                "reviewText": "There are a lot of things to love about this skillet. 1) It's large enough to handle a lot of food. 2) The handle is long enough that there's very little danger of getting burned if something splatters. 3) It's very sturdy. 4) It heats up quickly and very evenly. 5) The nonstick coating is perfectly even and probably thick enough to use metal utensils, although I never do.But there are problems, too. 1) Even though it's a 12-inch skillet, it's substantially larger than the 12-inch skillet I bought it to replace. 2) So large in fact that I can only use very small saucepans on the burner beside it and behind it on my standard size range. 3) The handle is so long that it will only fit in the dishwasher if I push the end of the handle up into the rack above it. 4) It's very heavy, even before you put anything in it. 5) The extra weight makes it necessary to remove food with a spatula or tongs or spoon instead of pouring it out over the edge the way you' might do browned hamburger meat, for example.All in all, it's a great skillet that I may have to replace anyway.",

The first time my Husband used one of the pans , I was out & he called to thank me for getting these pans ! In his words \u201c what a joy to cook with these !\u201d They are sturdy, the heat seems to be evenly distributed in the pan, & the silicone on the handle gives you a firm grip without the threat of being burned . I would highly recommend these pans .",

                "reviewText": "I waited a year to leave this review because so many of the negative reviews claimed the pan eventually falls apart. Well, after a year I can say the pan still looks like new. Now, I treat it well (no metal utensils, don't leave it on high heat, don't leave it to soak in the sink overnight), and don't use it every day, but it is our primary large skillet and it has held up perfectly. And it cooks well too, I have no complaints at all. Excellent value for the money in my opinion!",

The US listing was based on more than 10,000 positive comments, which influenced the Canadian rating, and I have to agree it is a great tool. Good buy, great service.",
