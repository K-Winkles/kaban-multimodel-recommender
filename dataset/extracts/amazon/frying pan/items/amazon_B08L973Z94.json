I actually want loves these so much that I just bought the Wok/Stir-Fry pan. I will be getting the other Deep Frying pan soon. The only down side to this brand is that they don't have a frying pan that is bigger than the 11\". These pans are AMAZING though when it comes to lasting and still after 3 years not losing the non-stick. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! You will thank me I promise!!",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I really like this pan. It is not too heavy, cleans easily, and is the perfect size for me. However, this morning when I picked the pan up, the handle fell off. I have been using this pan for less than a week. The screw for the handle was in the handle when the pan came, and I tightened it as much as I could. It seemed secure. Now it appears that the screw is too short to adequately hold the handle. This could be a real problem if someone had a large amount of hot grease in the pan, picked it up and the handle fell off. I have reattached the handle, but doubt it. will hold, since the screw is so short.This is an add on to my original review. The company sent me an entire new handle and screw. They replied to my text the same day. They have excellent customer service! The pan is wonderful and I am very pleased with it. LATEST REVIEWI have had this pan since March 2023. Loved it....until the coating has come off in a strip near the side. I use this pan only for. frying eggs and bacon. I have never put it in the dishwasher, nor used anything on it that would cause the coating to come off. It has never been heated high. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem?",

I've only had this pan one week but can already tell it's much heavier and easier to clean. I love the handle/lid material because it's a nice color and not slippery. More like a rubber feel to it. This seems like a good investment. Now my daughter and I can cook eggs much easier than on our All-Clad pans (which are expensive and so finicky to use because everything sticks if you don't get the exact right oil temperature). My husband asked us to stop using the All-Clad pans for eggs because they would stick so badly so I found this great solution.",
