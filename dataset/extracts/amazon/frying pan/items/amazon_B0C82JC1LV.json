I found this one online and when we finally used it, we were both SO HAPPY with how quickly it cleans up with warm soapy water and a gentle sponge. The excess just wipes right off!!! No scrubbing, just wipes clean so quick! and the best part is the finish is non toxic and we can turn the heat down when cooking, don't need to put the burner on the highest heat. LOVE IT and DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PAN!",

Right out of the box there was one pan with a chip at the top like others have complained about. I didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of sending it back, especially with how long it took to get to me. They clean so well. I don\u2019t use oil in many of the things I cook in them because it doesn\u2019t need it. I just season and go. It\u2019s been great for cutting out some calories and fat.",
