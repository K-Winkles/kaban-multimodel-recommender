Avoid nonstick pans with textured cooking surface Some nonstick frying pans come with textured surfaces, such as the Frieling Black Cube Fry Pan and the Circulon Symmetry Hard-Anodized Nonstick French Skillet. It sounds a little like a no-brainer, but we found that the pans with textured surfaces were consistently less nonstick than pans with smooth surfaces \u2014 and the experts agree. \u201cA raised pattern on a nonstick pan pretty much negates its nonstick ability,\u201d Braun confirms. \u201cFood tends to grip to the texture, so a smooth-bottomed pan is ideal in this category.\u201d Why would a nonstick frying pan have a textured surface? In the case of the Frieling Black Cube Fry Pan, it might be so that you can use metal utensils on the pan \u2014 a fact that Frieling advertises prominently. The Frieling pan was the only one to pass our fork scratch test with no marks whatsoever \u2014 so those surfaces are good for something!

                "reviewText": "Anyone and everyone knowing me, know that if I leave a review like this, that there must be a reason. I have looked for a set of pots and pans similar to this brand for years. I didn't know whether or not these needed to be cured prior to use but I cured them anyway. I have not had a single problem with any one of them, in fact I use the believe it is either a 7-inch or a 10-in every single day with no issues. They clean very well and the no stick performance after 2 months has been without a single issue. So most definitely, I would recommend these items. There is one slight caveat, the handles do get hot so you will need something to hold on to the actual pots if it's left on the stove at a higher flame for a prolonged period, so just be cautious when dealing with heat/fire",

                "reviewText": "I picked up the pan & lid with a bunch of other ordered items at an Amz Locker a couple of days ago because I\u2019m out of town. Usually I delay a review to use something like a pan & lid for several months of hard use first, but am putting this up because some of the one star \u2b50\ufe0f reviews said it was NOT compatible with an induction stovetop. That is not the case for me because I specifically wanted that and it works fine on my NuWave induction burner/hob (*has adjustable wattage) that I brought along to test the pan out immediately in order to return if failed. Here are some photos of my tests: first I boiled 1 cup of cold water at 1300w on High & zippy quick the water came to a boil (if the pans aren\u2019t compatible you get a beeping alarm & error code). Then I tested a new cup of cold water to a boil at 600w* on High, zip it was just as fast. Then I tried another cup of cold water on 600w on medium-high & the boil was almost as fast. Then I tried 600w on medium-low and got those little bubbles at the bottom rising to water surface as when simmering something in a pot on a stove. The next morning I used the pan to cook eggs and chicken sausage. This morning I made eggs with olive oil and stir fried some green beans with water/steam. There is no question this pan (I got the 8\u201d diameter) works with my induction stove hob. And so far the glass lid fits properly in order to create steam to cook fresh string green beans.Rating: Giving the pan & lid a rating of 4 stars \u2b50\ufe0f for now because 1.) most importantly, it works fine with my induction stove burner/hob. 2.) the lid fit properly & and the little vent properly lets steam escape to keep pressure from building up. 3.) Quality is fine. The pan\u2019s non-stick surface has made for easy cleaning after cooking 3 or 4 meals on my trip. 4.) I would purchase this pan & lid again if the pricing remains competitive.Future Updates: I plan on revisiting my review with an update of 6 months of using it a lot more both at home and traveling.*600w is an important lower wattage setting if you are going to be using the induction stove while camping with an inverter on a portable power station.",
