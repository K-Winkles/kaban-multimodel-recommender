I washed it before first use--there was no chemical smell. It has good heft. Heats evenly. I have a gas stove and use low-med heat. This is the best non-stick that I've purchased so far in many years. It's reasonably priced so I'm considering purchasing other pieces from this line.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted an inexpensive non-stick that didn't scratch or flake. This one is solid with a nice handle and no sprayed or baked Teflon type coating. It cooks evenly and cleans easily. I like it much better than my old pan that had a black surface that was scratched and starting to flake even though I only use silicone or wooden utensils. I didn't expect the quality I got since the price was so reasonable so I am quite happy with this purchase.The handle does need to be screwed on but it comes with it's own screwdriver and was very easy to do. Because I have an electric range the pan tends to lean ever so slightly into the handle when sitting on the burner but putting a lid on rectifies this and, if I had a solid range top, this wouldn't even be an issue. The manufacturer does suggest to heat the pan gradually and always have oil or water in when you do and does not recommend putting it in the dishwasher. This makes sense to me to extend the life of this item.I gave this pan 5 stars in any case because everything else was great about it and I'm very pleased with it.",

They are sturdy, scratch resistant, non-stick and evenly distribute cooking heat as well as any cooking pans I have ever owned. I also love their non-metallic handles because they are heat resistant never get hot to the touch. These have been my everyday cooking skillets and I always wash them by hand and they still look brand new. I highly recommend these well made skillets.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the white ceramic, 9.5 inch span. It\u2019s the perfect size for frying up to 3 large eggs at the same time. This is a very attractive pan and it has an expensive look to it.What I found to be so unusual was when I opened the package, it came with a screwdriver. Totally weird. The screwdriver is included so that you to attach the handle. What? So now I have a fry pan and a screwdriver. After re-reading the product description, it states that the pan is oven proof up to 550 degrees fahrenheit, but only if you remove the handle, hence the reason for the merchant providing a screwdriver?Take care to securely tighten the handle which goes on easily with no hassle. When I first installed the handle, it started to loosen up after a few uses. After giving it a good tightening up, the handle is nice and secure and has remained that way.I purchased this strictly for eggs. My other egg plan finally started sticking.With this pan, I use a half teaspoon of either olive oil or butter and the eggs, over easy, scrambled or as an omelette slide out perfectly. The pan washes up by hand, nicely with a little bit of dish soap and hot water. So far this pan is exactly what I was looking for no sticking and it looks great sitting on my stovetop. Worth a 5 + star rating.",

Another pan had too low walls/edges, and not the inside but the outside scratched easily which visually was not appealing.This sensarte pan was the one I kept going back to for daily use. I like the bottom plate which helps spread the heat evenly, as well as how amazingly non-stick it is. Cleaning is simple, just use a paper towel to quickly wipe. And bonus, visually the pan looks great too. It's been a couple weeks of solid daily use, and it still looks just as amazing as day one.I eventually learned an easy way for me to flip omelette. First I let it cook just long enough to be somewhat firm. Then I pick up the pan with one hand, the other had has a silicon spatula that i slide under the omelette. Then I lift both arms quickly about 6\" high, quickly followed by lowering the pan hand, while at the same time the other spatula hand stays at initial height (maybe lowers an inch or two) and flips the omelette. I can get super clean flips this way...",

                "reviewText": "f you\u2019re looking for a nonstick frying pan that is durable, easy to clean, and compatible with different stoves, you might want to consider the Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet. This pan has a Swiss granite coating that is PFOA-free and safe for your health. It also has a woodgrain bakelite handle that is comfortable to hold and stays cool while cooking. In this review, I will go over the pros and cons of this pan and help you decide if it\u2019s worth buying.The Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet has a round shape that fits snugly in your hand, thanks to the swappable earwings and eartips that come in different sizes. It is lightweight and water-resistant, making it suitable for long listening sessions and workouts. It also comes with a compact charging case that can provide up to 35 hours of total battery life, which is decent for this price range. The case has a USB-C port for fast charging and an LED indicator for battery status.The Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet has a Swiss granite coating that is PFOA-free and safe for your health. The coating is made by ILAG, a Swiss company that specializes in nonstick coatings1. The coating is SGS approved, which means that it meets the international standards for quality and safety2. The coating is also scratch-resistant and easy to clean. You can use a soft sponge or cloth to wipe off any food residue or oil stains. You can also put the pan in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended to extend the lifespan of the coating.The Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet has a woodgrain bakelite handle that is comfortable to hold and stays cool while cooking. The handle features a woodgrain design that adds a touch of elegance and naturalness to the pan. The handle is also oven-safe up to 302\u00b0F, which means that you can transfer the pan from the stove to the oven without changing cookware. The handle is attached to the pan with two screws, which makes it sturdy and stable.The Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet has a high magnetic conductive base that is compatible with different stoves, including gas, electric, and induction cooktops3. The base is made of stainless steel, which helps distribute heat evenly and quickly across the pan. The base is also flat and thick, which prevents warping and ensures stability on the stove. The base has a diameter of 9.5 inches, which is suitable for cooking eggs, pancakes, bacon, steak, chicken, vegetables, and more.The Sensarte Nonstick Frying Pan Skillet has some drawbacks that you should be aware of before buying it. One of them is that the pan does not come with a lid, which means that you have to buy one separately if you want to cover your food while cooking. Another drawback is that the pan does not have any markings or indicators on the surface or the handle to show the temperature or the time of cooking. You have to rely on your own judgment or use a thermometer or timer to monitor your food. A third drawback is that the pan may not be suitable for high-heat cooking, as it may damage the coating or cause food to stick or burn.",

Follow their instructions. They supply the screwdriver with the pan to attach the handle. Solid handle. I purchased the 12.5 size with no lid and I have just purchased a second one.",
