            "Long-term durability: MSMK water-based limestone technology effectively addresses issues such as the non-stick coating chipping off, peeling off, scratching easily, small bubbles forming at the bottom, breaking, and pieces of non-stick material mixing with the food after months of use.",
            "Even heating: MSMK non stick frying pans features a 4mm thick aluminum substrate with even heat distribution and steady simmering, preventing burning at the bottom or corners. This resolves the issue of poor heat control in thin aluminum cookware, which often leads to burnt food.",
            "Cleanup was exceptionally easy: in MSMK scorch test where we simmer sauce for 30 minutes and see how it rinses off, it required no soaking in water to get the job done, saving time and effort.",
            "Comfort handle: Long, thick or wide handles are comfortable to hold and designed to stay cool. Avoiding handles that are poorly designed can makes it painful to pick up or maneuver, and may even burn you handle. A well-designed handle can greatly enhance the pleasure of cooking.",
            "Induction and glass stovetop-friendly: The stainless-steel bottom of this frying pan set enables faster induction heating, with a speed 15% higher than the PRO frying pans. The smooth bottom is specifically designed to prevent any scratches on your glass stove top, ensuring the longevity of its shiny appearance for years to come.",
            "LIFETIME WARRANTY: Designed in the USA with imported components, our comprehensive quality control system has significantly reduced defects in our frying pans nonstick. We stand behind our MSMK cookware set and offer a 100% replacement policy at no charge if any issues arise due to manufacturing or material defects of the 10 12 inch frying pan.",
            "The MSMK 2-piece 10, 12 Inch frying pans nonstick set is the perfect choice for remodeling your kitchen from the ground up or replacing your old set. It's also ideal for special occasions like weddings, graduation ceremonies, setting up your first kitchen, housewarming parties, and even as a thoughtful holiday gift. You'll be proud to boast about this set to all your friends."

You can fit 4 good size hamburger Pattie\u2019s on it just to give you an idea on how big it is. It cleans very well . Everything washes off very easily for me . It doesn\u2019t. The grill marks work pretty well but are not very apparent. I definitely would recommend this pan .",

                "reviewText": "These MSMK skillets are most likely the best non-stick cookware I've ever purchased, especially at this price point. I had initially settled on a similar all-clad set, but discovered these at about $30 less and thought I'd give them a shot because I liked the shape, stainless handles and stainless base much better. So glad I did. The skillets are substantial in heft, yet well-balanced with a really durable non-stick coating. I also liked the fact that they are oven safe to 450 degrees, so you can sear and oven finish dishes like salmon or chops.However, when the set arrived, the 12\" pan had some \"scuffing\" on the bottom cooking surface coating. Probably still quite useable, but I didn't want to compromise on a new product. I checked the seller's info and discovered their email address, sending them a pic of the slight damage and explaining that I loved the set, but would like a replacement for the 12\" product. I really didn't want to return both skillets since the 10\" one was perfect.They got back to me in a day or so and I received the replacement in two days. I can't say enough good about that kind of responsiveness, not to mention that the skillets perform amazingly well.",
