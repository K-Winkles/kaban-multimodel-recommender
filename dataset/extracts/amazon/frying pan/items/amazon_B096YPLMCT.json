                "reviewText": "Even heating, easy to clean, glass top w/vent, handles on opposite sides for carrying or giving pan contents a \"distributive shake\" to spread them in the pan evenly. Its a deep pan. Depth is 3.34in. Can be used for casserole since its deep. Non-stick surface is , well, non-stick - that's all I can say. For nonstick to actually work, your food should make some of its own juices. Pan lets go of contents and the juices with no sticking. Even burned on sauces (in my case Teriyaki sauce) peel off. Mine was pushed off when I placed it under running water. Let me also say that I have not seen an nonstick plan that is completely stick free. A fish filet cooked in the pan - no fat used. began to stick. It was easily removed with a push of a spatula without any or little residue left behind. Impressive! Before use, I washed the pan, let it dry, and then at the first use, I wipe lightly with canola oil, or you can use whatever you want - nor not! I think this is a very good full size pan. Its shape/depth reminds me of a small \"wok/frying pan hybrid\". Plus, Its got handles that are useful for carrying, and a vented glass top. . I recommend this pan highly - especially if you are a single person like I am, and due to the pandemic, at home cooking, and need a versatile pan such as this. 5 STARS",

This time I ordered the Farberware Smart Control Nonstick Jumbo Cooker/Saute pan. I am very pleased with the size and weight of this pan. I was concerned it would be too light but it hasn't dented or dinged with regular use. The handles stay cool and I can lift it easily with the helper handle. It sautes evenly and the lid vents steam well. I have had this pan for several months now, use it several times a week, and I recommend it. I will update if and when the interior begins to disintegrate.",

Whether I'm preparing a hearty stew, boiling pasta for the whole family, or simmering a flavorful soup, this 6qt pot provides ample space to accommodate large portions without compromising on performance.The build quality is exceptional. The pot is sturdy, with a well-fitting lid that locks in heat and moisture, ensuring optimal cooking results. The heat distribution is even, preventing any hot spots and allowing my dishes to cook uniformly every time.I appreciate the non-stick interior of the pot, as it makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. Even sticky sauces and stubborn food residue easily slide off, requiring minimal effort for a thorough cleanup. This feature is a time-saver and greatly enhances the overall cooking experience.The pot's ergonomic handles provide a secure and comfortable grip, even when the pot is filled with hot liquids. This aspect, coupled with the durable construction, instills confidence and promotes safe handling in the kitchen.",

I was a bit leery when this pan arrived, it was super lightweight and seemed a bit chintzy. But I've used it a number of times and LOVE it. It cooks perfectly and washes easily. I've washed it in dishwasher several times. Lid is also nice. I haven't used it in oven and maybe never will because it's only rated to a fairly low oven temp.",

But yesterday when i used biggest pot( the first time with the ladle that came with it) it badly scratched its surface. Mind u, i always use a rybber spatula to cook n soft sponge to wash all non stick surfaces. It should have worked fine with a plastic ladle or spatuala but cant understand how it got bruised this bad. The heat distribution is unbalanced too and mostly the food in the middle of the pot tries to stick and rather burn if u dont stir often. Will surely return or throw since cant use a pot that is shedding off.",
