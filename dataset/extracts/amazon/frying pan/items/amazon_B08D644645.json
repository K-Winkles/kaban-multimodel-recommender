Anyway, I am hoping it will still do this for the life of the pan. The pan itself reminds me of cast iron but not as heavy and a lot prettier. I did have to buy a universal lid to fit the biggest pan, but I have another large pan that didn't have a lid so it had been needed. I have told others to try this pan. Musiek? is the only other I found like this and they have been out of stock for a while. I think this might be better than them as their pan lasted 6 months, but it is wait and see. Saw another review where it showed the nostick peeling, definitely not the way the Musiek pans ended. Anyway it is with everything wait and see how long the do hold up.",

                "reviewText": "These pans are sturdy and non stick and I love the way they look! I did the seasoning as the directions suggested. The non stick is wonderful! Easy to clean up even after mu husband cooks. He tends to cook on the highest setting . I can't tell you how many non stick pans I've had to smoke and rezoak after he cooks. With these pans it's a breeze to clean. Also without the cancer worries of using the traditional nonstick pans. I highly recommend",

They are non stick, make the best over easy eggs and super easy to clean up! They also have great ceramic handles that don\u2019t get hot in your hand! Probably the best pans I\u2019ve ever used !",

It\u2019s working fine for that purpose, it\u2019s light and compact. The non-stick surface works well. It\u2019s not perfectly flat though. If you put in a little oil, it immediately runs to the sides of the pan.Over all I\u2019m happy with it for the price. I recommend with that one proviso.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 8\" pan to replace an old non-stick 8\" pan that had become scratched. The pan arrives with the lid holder and the handle unattached to allow for a smaller package. Both were very easy to attach solidly within 1-2 minutes. The pan itself has almost vertical sides, which provides a full 8\" internal diameter and allows more of whatever you're cooking in the pan. Some pans have angled sides, making the internal diameter more like 7\". The pan also has 2 small pouring lips, one on each side -- a nice touch. The lid fits perfectly and has a small hole in the glass to allow pressure buildup to escape. I followed the directions and so far the pan has remained spotless and totally nonstick. The instructions don't mention dishwasher safety and I have not placed the pan in the dishwasher. The handle and lid holder look just like wood but are made of Bakelite according to the included directions. All in all a great pan and value.",

The heat distribution is on point but does take a little bit to heat up the pan. Make sure you season them. Excellent value for the money.",
