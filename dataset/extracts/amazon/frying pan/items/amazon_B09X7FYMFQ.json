                "reviewText": "Very Nice frying pan. This is a super nice skillet - stainless steel on the outside and ceramic on the inside. It is just the correct weight (not too heavy) to lift and move around. The coating is very smooth and wonderfully non-stock - food just slides out onto the plate. So easy to clean - just wipe with soap and warm water. The food seems to heat evenly over the entire pan and cool pretty quickly . They ask you to heat the pan for 90 seconds- then get started. The hardest thing for me will be to remember to NOT use a spray on this pan - to use only butter or oil. It also suggests you use a soft utensil and to not get the pan too hot on the stove top. I haven't had this long enough to use in the oven - but I'm looking forward to that versatility. I highly recommend this skillet.",

                "reviewText": "I love to cook! Oftentimes I spend half a day in my kitchen preparing and cooking meals for my family. Pots and pans are important to me, so choosing a good pan is key to creating a good meal, effortlessly. I was impressed with the Green Life line of products and decided to try the 10 inch frying pan. I was so excited when it arrived and immediately took it to its new home, my stove. I would first suggest you read the enclosed booklet before you use your pan. One of the points mentioned in the booklet was that this pan does NOT heat like other pans. It\u2019s recommended to use moderate heat. Of course, I decided to try this out and turned my heat to the normal setting I would typically use to grill my veggies. In just a few minutes, I had to lower the heat. This pan definitely heats quicker and cooks faster. I had no problems using this pan other than my food was taking me less time to cook and was sliding with no problem. When it came time to cleanup, I was prepared to spend a good amount of time cleaning off the residue. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. The use of paper napkin was all it took to clean it up. The pan was a hit to say the least. The pan exceeded my expectations and was not as heavy as I expected it to be, which was a plus. I even liked the depth of this pan being right around two inches. Its overall value is excellent for the quality and I highly recommend this frying pan to others who spend a lot of time in the kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "I have never owned a non-stick pan, instead using properly-seasoned cast-iron and carbon steel, and multi-layered stainless, etc. However, I really wanted to be able to easily make crepes, and for this I need a really good non-stick pan that was safe to use. I only looked at ceramic pans, since the safety of PTFE seems to be questionable, and it never lasts.Anyway, this pan is very good. It cooks perfectly and crepes slide around in it with no oil whatsoever. In fact, it's a little tricky to even get a spatula under the crepe without the crepe sliding away. When all the crepes are made, the pan requires no cleaning other than a quick wipe with a cloth.It's quite amazing, and well worth the money.Update: My wife ruined it by packing it carelessly for a trip. These have an extremely delicate nonstick surface. You should definitely hang it up too high for your wife to reach it.",
