                "reviewText": "I have used this skillet for the better part of a year now to cook scrambled eggs, usually at least twice a week. I think it probably has the best non-stick performance of the many pans I have had over the years. This one is non-stick without any help such as added oil, and seems to be maintaining its state better than most. I use this on an induction plate, and it works well. The deep form factor is nice too. However, I am not too excited about the handle design. It is not uncomfortable, but the hook to allow the pan to stack with others isn't a helpful feature when I don't have other pans to stack with it. I thought I would need to cut it off, but it hasn't proven enough of a nuisance to do so. Also this one arrived with a slight chip in the coating surface from handling, I doubt it was from the manufacturer, since most of my Amazon packages arrive pretty beat up in my rural location. I almost sent the pan back, but I'm glad I didn't. The chip thankfully hasn't affected function. I will probably buy this one again if/when it wears out.",

As someone who enjoys cooking and experimenting with different recipes, I was looking for a high-quality frying pan set that would be versatile and easy to use, and this set has definitely delivered on those fronts.One of the things I love most about the Anolon frying pan set is the nonstick surface. It's very effective at preventing food from sticking, which makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. The pans are also very durable \u2013 the hard anodized construction is resistant to scratches and wear, and the pans feel very solid and well-made.I also appreciate the stackable design of the pans. They're very convenient to store, and the lids fit securely, which makes it easy to stack them and save space in my kitchen cabinets.However, there are a couple of things that I'm not as happy with. The first is the handle \u2013 while it's comfortable to hold, it doesn't stay cool to the touch when the pan is on the stove, which can be inconvenient. The second is the price \u2013 while the pans are high-quality and well-made, I do feel like they're a bit pricey compared to similar products on the market.Overall, I'm mostly satisfied with the Anolon Smart Stack Hard Anodized Nonstick Frying Pan Set. It's a high-quality and versatile set that's easy to use and clean, but the handle and the price are a couple of drawbacks.",

                "reviewText": "I waited over a year to write this review because let's face it, everything is 4-5 stars out of the box. Plus, in my experience \"non-stick\" cookware usually starts to fail after around a year. So with that said, I am very impressed with this product so far. Even now it's the most \"non-stick\" non-stick cookware I've ever owned. Not a drop of oil is needed; even eggs release easily for a hand flip that always impresses the kids. Although there are now a few flaws and scratches in the cooking surfaces due to normal wear and tear and some accidental burning of food, it still functions perfectly. Cleanup is a breeze. We follow the care instructions pretty closely, so keep that in mind as well. All in all this is proving to be an excellent purchase. It looks great too!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered used items and they arrived strangely packed with a used roll of masking tape and debris inside. They were not packed to protect the non-stick surface, but loose, and freely scraping against one another in the large box. (No paper or other soft packing to protect the pans.) HOWEVER, I did buy them used, and maybe saved about 10 dollars and noticed only a few small scratches on one of the pans. I tire of returning items and thought one gets what one pays for. Final thoughts after using the scratched pan, it seems to work well. And it cooks everything nicely without sticking, and it is easy to clean.",
