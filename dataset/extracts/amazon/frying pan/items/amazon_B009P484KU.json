Now my husband and I each have one to cook our individual breakfasts in. I like the shiny surface inside the pan. I considered buying a non-stick frying pan, but I wanted to try this one. I'm glad I didn't go for the extra expense of non-toxic non-stick, because this pan does so well with cleaning up. I think the price is very good for the quality of the pan. I don't often write reviews but I am enjoying using these little Cuisinart frying pans so much that I thought I'd share my thoughts.",

                "reviewText": "I have a set of Calphalon and All-Clad pots and pans that were given to me as part of a wedding present set. We have owned that set for over 10 years now. However, the one thing that set didn't come with was a small frying pan. When I finally decided to add the small pan to the collection, I was stunned as to how expensive it was! Considering how much a complete set of pots and pans cost, I couldn't understand how a single add-on pan could be so expensive. I guess that is how they get you to spend all that $$.Anyway, I was looking for an alternative pan that cost less. I found the Cuisinart pan and saw that it had good reviews. It was also fairly inexpensive, compared to the All-Clad pan. I have now been cooking with it for about two weeks, and I love it! I find very little difference cooking with it compared to my other pans. It heats quickly and evenly and cleans up great. My daycare provider accidentally over-cooked oil in the pan and it turned all brown and hard. I sprayed some oven cleaner on it and sat it in the sun for about 20 minutes, and the pan looks like new.The only area I find a very, very slight difference is at high temperatures. It doesn't seem to handle them quite as well--maybe it is that it ends up getting too hot compared to the All-Clad set, but it is probably because I am just so used to the other set. I figure that is more an adjustment that I need to make, so the pan itself still gets 5 stars.I would gladly buy a complete set of Cuisinart pans and I will have no problem filling in other pieces with Cuisinart. I highly recommend this pan!",

                "reviewText": "I researched stainless steel cookware for quite awhile and decided to try the Cuisinart Multiclad. It was the highest quality that I could get for a reasonable price. I tried this skillet and loved it. As long as I use a little oil when frying things, like eggs, it worked beautifully. Did not stick and was easy to clean. The cookware itself is very nice looking too. I ended up buying an entire set.",

Heat up the pan first with your oil to at least a medium level before placing your food. Pan went from awful Not even able to clean the pan as the food was still still stuck. Food slid off the pan when Following the instructions. And I would much rather use a stainless steel pan with no extra toxic coatings.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 12 inch and the 8 inch pans about a year ago and no problem! I love the way they look. I am reading reviews and people complaining about warping and the food sticks, etc. etc. and yes food could stick if you do not cook at the right temperature.It also depends on the type of stove you have. I can fry an egg at the right temperature, and it will not stick if I am careful to ut enough oil and not to have the pan too hot. I have an induction stove and it generally gets really hot on P , so when I am frying an egg I have to be careful and I do not use the max temperature , but a bit less. You just gotta learn how to cook with it and what temperature to use. There were a couple of times that my food stick to the pan in the beginning, but I was by the stove so I removed right away from the heat and cleaned with SOS pads and no problem. I had not experienced any warping with any of mine. I am attaching a couple of pictures of my pans after one year of using them every other day, you just gotta be careful, these models are expensive pots and pans and you just need to learn what can you do and not do with them.I just bought my 10 inch pan to replace another Cuisinart teflon pan which I bought after these and is peeling bad. I really love them, but again you just gotta learn to cook with them and take care of them.Another thing to consider is Cuisinart has other stainless steel models that are not the same quality as this model (MCP22) that are cheaper and do warp and you get spots after a couple of uses. I have read lots of reviews and it seems that it is not just the brand but the quality you buy. You get what you pay for.",
