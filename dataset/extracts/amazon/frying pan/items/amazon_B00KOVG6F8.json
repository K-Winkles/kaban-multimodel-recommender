        "description": "The USA Pan 7-Inch Gourmet Chef Skillet is 5-ply clad stainless steel premium cookware that lets home chefs cook food the way it should be -- rich with flavor and packed with nutrients. Our 7-inch small skillet is a true 5-ply clad stainless steel, meaning 5 layers of metal for durability and optimal heat conductivity. USA Pan cookware can also be used on cooking surfaces such as gas, electric, ceramic glass, and halogen. USA Pan cookware is designed with healthy cooking in mind, our skillets feature a unique vapor cover design seal that enables waterless-greaseless cooking. Waterless-greaseless cooking is possible because a vapor seal is created around the cover (does not come with cover, but works with any universal cover for 7-inch skillet) and heat is distributed evenly across the bottom and up the sides of the cookware. This process cooks food in its own natural liquids for nutritious, flavor-filled meals. The craftsmanship of the USA Pan Chef skillet and saute exemplifies the premium quality and high performance that has made USA Pan the predominant leader in the commercial baking industry. Each individual pan is hand polished to a mirror shine, providing a stunningly vibrant appearance in the kitchen and on the table. Made in the USA from globally sourced materials, our cookware is dishwasher and oven safe. USA Pan is a Bundy family company which has proudly manufactured high quality bakeware and provided jobs in the USA for over 60 years.",

                "reviewText": "We got the 8inch USA Pan Stainless Steel Chef Skillet. Normally I wouldn't buy such as expensive piece of cookware but it turned out to be well worth the money! I am by no means a chef, but maybe with this skillet there\u2019s hope! The pan is wide enough and deep enough for a one-pan dish without worry of overflowing. The pan is super shiny, even after a couple of washes and a burnt sauce incident (again, not a chef). Although it is heavier than it looks, it is quite sturdy and well made. I\u2019ve only had it for a couple of days now, but made quite a few meals already. We have an electric stove top that\u2019s infamous for not heating our pans evenly, burning some parts and not heating others at all. That was not the case at all with this skillet! We made pancakes in it and they turned out wonderfully golden brown and not half-cooked like with our other pans. My fianc\u00e9 accidently cooked some vegetables in a sauce a little too long that wound up burning quite badly. I wasn\u2019t too happy that she almost ruined our brand-new and quite frankly, expensive pan. After a quick soak though, it was as good as new! Not a speck of burnt residue or discoloration at all! I was amazed. After scorching a chicken dish, my fianc\u00e9 and I learned that we do not need to use as high heat as with our other pans, which is nice. Like I said, the pan is heavier than it looks and quite deep for a pan of its size. We got adventurous and used it to try our hand at frying (this time shrimp tempura), which was catastrophic with other pans. Because the skillet is so deep, we were able to fit enough oil and shrimp without spattering and making a mess. The oil stayed at a constant temperature and they turned out wonderfully. After mastering the temperature difference (you\u2019d be surprised), we also used less oil and butter because nothing stuck and so much healthier for us. The pan is still as shiny as when we first got it, after all of our mishaps. We just soaked it in warm water with some soap for a while and most of it came off under the running water! We didn\u2019t even need to use a scrubby sponge (which I don\u2019t recommend on any pan, reason we are buying a new one). I do wish for the price we paid, that it did have a lid, but they are sold separately unless you buy the whole entire set. (Which may wind up on our wedding registry though). If the rest of the set is as well made as this skillet I would definitely highly recommend the entire set. Overall, I can\u2019t say enough awesome things about the USA Pan. It was the first USA Pan we\u2019ve ever bought and it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll definitely buy some more in the future!",

                "reviewText": "Hello all, I have purchased this pan less than a week ago and received it Friday (7/17/15). This is my first stainless steel pan. I decided to purchase this particular pan because:1) Price ($30?!?! What?!)2) 5 ply (Again, what?! For only $30??)3) Made in U.S.A4) I needed something small for eggs!In the past, I have tried cooking with non-stick pans and Lodge cast iron pans and with both I have failed miserably. I know what you're thinking, how did I fail to cook on cast iron?! Well, everything just burned on the pan for me despite proper care. When I purchased this pan I found it interesting that similar pans by competitors cost nearly 3 times as much and they might not even be made in the U.S.A!Since this is my first stainless steel pan, I looked up \"how to cook with stainless steel\" and most of the websites I read expressed to use the water droplet test to find out when the pan is ready. You'll know when you pan is at the right heat when you place some droplets of water in the pan, they come together and form a \"ball\" and just moves around the pan without evaporating. This is when you know when your pan is ready for butter/oil! (Thanks paleoleap.com!) Once I found the right temperature (about 3.2-3.4 on my electric stove) I made some delicious eggs. I even made scrambled eggs the way I like them for the first time in my life. I have never been able to make scrambled eggs on any other pan. When I was done, the pan came out fairly clean, I just had to wipe it down with soap, water and my sponge.One of the other reviewers wrote that it takes a minute or two to release the food. I didn't understand what that meant, but after cooking on it for a couple times, I know what it means for the pan to \"release the food.\" It does take a minute or two for the egg to become free to be turned. I made the mistake of using a metal spatula at first and it did scratch the pan slightly, but not so badly that the pan became ugly. I ended up purchasing Epicurean Gourmet Series Utensils, Medium Turner, Natural/Black Nylon to compliment the pan (it's also made in the USA!!) and it has done a wonderful job thus far.To summarize, this a low cost, high quality pan that cooks great food. I highly recommend this pan to anyone who wants the quality of All Clad, but at a reduced cost!",

Nice size for one or two people servings. It's perfectly heavy and very solid. Cleaning is a breeze. I only wish I had an option to buy a lid for it. This is a 9\" inch pan.",

                "reviewText": "Don't understand all the great reviews for this pan. It's a nice shape and size, but everything else is extremely disappointing. Bottom is not flat and the handle tips the pan over whether there is something in it or not, so it wobbles on the burner. The bottom is higher in the center, which is easy to see when you put a little water in a dry pan and watch it make a donut pool around the dry center.I have nothing but stainless cookware and know how to cook in these pans, but after one simple saute, the inside finish of this was ruined: no shine, rough areas on the sides, a lot of effort with gentle, non-scratch cloths, but could never get it clean. A complete waste of money.",
