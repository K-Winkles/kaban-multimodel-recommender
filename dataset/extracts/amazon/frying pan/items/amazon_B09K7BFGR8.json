                "reviewText": "I have been looking for frying pans that DO NOT have those two bolts on the inside of a frying pan as food gets around them and difficult to clean. GOOD NEWS I looked at the photos a lot and decided they do not have those bolts on the inside so took a gamble and bought the 8-10-11 inch. Delivered today washed them and already used them. NO BOLTS on inside and inside pan is smooth. We did not need to have expensive pans however these pans are very well made, sturdy and a wooden handle makes them even better as handle will not get hot. You can not bake in the oven with these pans and we use regular baking pans for that anyway. The cost is very reasonable and you will not be disappointed in buying these. A big THANKS to the company and a huge THANKS to Amazon for having them.",
