They are all sturdy, nonstick, and a little lighter than my old pans in a good way. The lighter weight has no effect on heat distribution or any other factors. The style with the long handle and helper handle is what I wanted to replace my 12 in pan that just had the 2 small handles. I decided to go with the larger as I have other 12 in pans. The only bad part that cost them a star is that after 1 use the bottom warped a bit and doesn't lay flat like when I it arrived. This is not a big issue and you won't even notice it with a gas range, but on a flat top electric the pan wants to spin easily on the low point in the center. In some ways this is advantageous to spin the pan without dragging on the glass but in most cases you have to hold on to the handle when stirring the contents. To be fair the same thing happened with my old 12 in pan so maybe this is just an issue with all larger pans. BTW if you need a good quality inexpensive lid, I purchased this one from Amazon and it's perfect and heavy dutyBrand: CRESTWARE4.5 out of 5 stars1,596ReviewsCrestware Frydc14 14\" Aluminum Fry Pan Dome Cover, Extra Large, Silver Metallic",

I have made fried potatoes, slid them to one side and then made scrambled eggs next to them. Great for stir fry or frittatas. The non stick surface has held up well. I always use non metal utensils and only clean it with a soft cloth (no nylon scrubbers) and it cleans up very easily. Here is a picture of some chicken and roasted vegetables I made. I seared the chicken on the stove top then added the veggies and roasted the whole thing in the oven. It came out great and was a one pan meal.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this pan. I'm not usually a fan of \"nonstick\" but the home menu delivery service I use always mentions a medium or large nonstick pan. I selected this one for the size, price, oven-proof handles and ratings from others. Did not disappoint. This one is a great value. It distributes heat well, no hot spots but obviously use a big burner or you'll have slightly (predictably) cooler areas that you can use to your advantage. It sears much better than I expected (I'm used to cast iron). It wipes clean with a damp paper towel - ease of cleaning is amazing. I baby it, though - only wood and silicone utensils and hand washing. Obviously it will scratch with metal utensils or abuse - it's a coated pan. Mine isn't scratched to speak of with near- daily use, perhaps a couple insignificant hairline scratches from nuts or vegetables on close examination. I'm actually writing this review because I am looking for a couple more of the same pan in smaller sizes.",

                "reviewText": "Barely a year of minimal use and the non-stick qualities were gone. We are a household of 2 and we cook an average of 3 times a week on a gas stove - read, minimal use. Never put the pan in the oven, only used silicone or wooden utensils, and always hand wash. The heat does not spread evenly, and the pan must be rotated while cooking. After seeing the quality shift of the food processors and now the skillets, I'm going to go ahead and stay away from the Cuisinart brand moving forward. This is not the same brand that we knew 20 years ago.FYI - In terms of the warranty - I emailed customer service and was told that you need to provide the following details with your warranty request.1. Subject Line of email must be as follows: COOKWARE / SN# _________2. In the body of the email, you are to include:\u2022 Name\u2022 Address\u2022 Daytime Phone Number\u2022 Service Notification Number: _________\u2022 Attach a Clear Picture of the bottom where the model number is located (for each defective piece)\u2022 Attach a Clear Picture of the defect with cookware(for each defective piece)Once this information is received, it will be evaluated. Please allow 10-15 business days. We also ask that you mail a check or money order for $7.00/$15.00 if you receive the replacement pan/pans.",
