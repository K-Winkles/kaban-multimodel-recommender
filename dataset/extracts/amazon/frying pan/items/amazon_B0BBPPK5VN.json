                "reviewText": "I'm one of Those People who doesn\u2019t want to spend a dime more than is necessary but still expects high-quality.In this particular case, I initially ordered a 10-inch T-Fal pan. However, it had a scratch on the top of the rim. I promptly returned it for a replacement, but it too came with a scratch on the top of the rim. It was packaged well, so I don\u2019t think it came from the manufacturer like that. So, I returned that too.Next, I tried the PranzoElite pan. I read good reviews, and thought I\u2019d give it a try. But, while it said it was 10-inch, it was actually 11-inches, which was annoying since I still had a 10-inch lid that I wanted to use. Also, the PranzoElite\u2019s bottom wasn\u2019t fully stainless steel, so it seemed to only work on one of my induction burners.I finally decided that it just wasn\u2019t worth my time driving back and forth to the UPS store to try and save a few bucks and got this pan. And I\u2019m glad I did.First of all, I\u2019m glad that those poisonous substances were not used for this pan; that\u2019s not optional.This pan\u2019s full stainless steel bottom easily cooks on any of my induction burners, having no problems activating them.It appears very nicely made and is aesthetically pleasing. The stainless steel and brass-colored design looks nice together.The handle and pan seem pretty thick, and didn\u2019t transfer any noticeable heat.I also like how, where the handle is riveted, it\u2019s coated with a non stick surface there too; a lot of pans don\u2019t do that and, thus, over time get a little grimy, in which case you\u2019d have to take a metal pad to clean them and thus possibly scratch your nonstick pan. But not this one.I\u2019ll adjust this review if it fails me in the near future. However, for now, I\u2019m pretty happy with it overall, and look forward to using it for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned and used pretty expensive non-stick pans in the past (e.g., All-Clad) and they perform very well and will last a long time as long as they are used and cared for properly. Unfortunately, I am the only one in my family who consistently does that, and so even the best non-stick pans will start to fail after repeated abuse. So when I had to replace a 10 inch non-stick All-Clad (I got tired of wasting my breath with the pan abusers in the house), I decided to look for something that seemed pretty well made but not as expensive. After reading other reviews of the Analon pans, I decided to give one a try. Since doing so I have actually made some headway with the other members of the household (the worst perpetrator has moved on) and thus far this pan has held up quite well. One it does eventually wear out (they all do sooner or later even with proper care), I think I will have gotten my money's worth.",
