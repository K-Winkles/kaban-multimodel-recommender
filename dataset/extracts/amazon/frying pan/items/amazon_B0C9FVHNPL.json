I\u2019ve included a pic of my cabinet - notice how much more compact the Zakarian pots are (right) vs out old pots (left). Also like the lids have fold-down handles for easy storage. Feel very heavy duty. Love the strainer lids. Extremely happy with them!",

                "reviewText": "I have a really nice set of Henkel pots and pans that my wife is terrified to use. I used to be a professional chef, and I am very particular about my kitchen tools, so my wife ordered these so she could use them when she cooks. Honestly they are a really nice quality set of pots and pans, and I really have no big qualms with them, other than the handles are not (In my opinion) over safe. I do however really like the lids because you can strain it out of the pot by giving it a turn. Overall nice set, but maybe a bit expensive.",

                "reviewText": "These pots and pans are perfect for someone that doesn\u2019t want to spend a small fortune, but also doesn\u2019t want a super cheap starter set that\u2019s going to need replaced in a year or two. This set is basically right in the middle of super expensive luxury and collage form or starter home cheap.The straining lids are a game changer, no need to get out a separate strainer. And the fact that these pots all stack together is fantastic, I can\u2019t tell you how frustrating it is to have a whole set of pots and pans that are not stackable, they take up so much room!The quality is nice, much better than a cheap set you can pickup from Walmart. Heck I\u2019m pretty sure the quality is just as good, if not better, as the Ninja pots and pans I had previously. Overall no complaints here!",

I have been telling my friends and family all about them because I love them so much. Depends are extra wide and deep which makes it perfect for any meal you are cooking. Overall I cannot recommend this these pots and pans more.",
