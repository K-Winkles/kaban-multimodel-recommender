                "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW:I originally was disappointed with this pan as food often stuck to it. Customer service kindly reached out and told me that I needed to use oil or butter when cooking and make sure the pan is properly heated before adding any food. I had always heard that oil can ruin the coating of nonstick pans, but in this case it has really helped. Because my pan was fairly new, they very kindly replaced it and since then I have not had any issues. I would recommend this pan and this company.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this pan a month ago and this is what it looks like now. The eraser it comes with for stains scratched the coating. Honestly if they would just offer a black pan would hide stains so much easier or even make the outside just a basic stainless steel instead of trying to make it look pretty for one day lol would avoid this issue. Otherwise the pan works great, month of twice a day use and still non stick and no scratches or stains on the inside of the pan. Outside of the pan looks horrendous though not happy about it.Edit update: non stick lasted 2 months. Don't recommend this pan",
