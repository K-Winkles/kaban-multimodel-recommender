So far everything I\u2019ve cooked wipes right off after which makes for such an easy clean. They heat up evenly and look amazing! I love this set and definitely highly recommend!!!!",

I personally just wash them by hand because there so easy to wash and nothing sticks to them the food just risnses off easily. Great purchase!",
