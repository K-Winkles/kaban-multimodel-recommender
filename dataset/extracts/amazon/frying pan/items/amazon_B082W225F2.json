The body is substantial, so it heat up evenly and it holds temperature.The non stick finish is really non stick. Cooking dry or with oil, food does not stick to bottom or sides and it cleans up easily after use. No scouring or hard scrubbing.The handle is full, so it is easy to grab onto and hold steady when pouring off liquids or handling cooking food. It does not heat up, so safe handling.This fry pan replaced an expensive Teflon coated pan that would not let go of anything cooking.",

                "reviewText": "I am 77 years old and this is the best pan I have ever had. I beats anything else I have ever used. Nothing sticks to it unless you leave it over the heat and the pan dries out, but even then it is very easy to clean. You need absolutely no cooking spray to keep food from sticking to it. Just don't heat it up before putting food into it. Turn on the heat immediately before or immediately after turning the heat on. For the small pan, don't turn the heat up to high because the bottom of the pan is not large enough to withstand the width of the heat and it will darken the part of the handle that is closest to the pan. I loved this so much that i bought another one with the same wonderful characteristics. Another thing I like about theses pans is that there is a place on both sides that makes it easier to pour the contents of the pan out without dribbling down the side of the pan. It isn't perfect but it does make it easier to pour. I have no complaints at all about it. It is sturdy and well-made. I highly recommend it.",
