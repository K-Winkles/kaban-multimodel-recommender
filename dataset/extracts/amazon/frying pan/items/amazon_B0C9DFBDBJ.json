I get things ready while pan heats, color changing tab let's you know when it is ready, toss my eggs in and just sip my coffee. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. A great for kids of appropriate age to fix \ud83d\udc4d there own. They would love it too. It doesn't take long at all. When I do my eggs I put English muffin on back to heat. PERFECT",
