The only thing you have to watch out for is keeping an eye on the heat levels, and when sauteing so something doesn't burn. They also wash perfectly in the dishwasher and you can finish cooking something in them in the oven with perfect results. I bought 4 of these in different sizes and gave all my other (very expensive) pans away! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\"m a full blown Carnivore, so I cook in this pan daily. What's so great about GraniteStone? 4 months in and I haven't had a single thing stick that required more than hot water and a swipe with a paper towel. I use Plastic, Wood and Metal utensils when I use this pan and not a scratch to be found on the surface. I now own 2 each in the 10\" and 12\" size. I've even given some as gifts to friends that quickly become fans, inquiring where to get them.Try them... You'll thank me for the suggestion!",

                "reviewText": "I love these pans! They are heavy duty and food does not stick to them as much as other pans I have owned. The label claims no oil is needed for cooking but I have not tried cooking without at least using oil spray. Also claims using metal utensils is permissible but I advise against it as I tried doing that and now my skillet has some slight scratches.Cleaning is very easy. My skillets are used daily and come clean with a little dish soap and a kitchen cloth. No scrubbing needed!So far I have bought 2 of these and plan to buy more. Fantastic product for the price point!",

                "reviewText": "This pan is non stick as described however it does not function very well on an induction cooktop. To get it to work at all you have to leave it on very high heat. The pan is not flat inside and is higher in the center, causing any liquid to run to the outer edges. Overall a very poor design.",
