                "reviewText": "I bought these as a Christmas Gift for my boyfriend (we live together) because he wanted to replace our very beaten up old skillet. I checked around a lot whether or not these were worth the price vs the cheaper T-Fal sets that come in fun colors and are about half the price and decided that the added features on this set worth it.I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. The hard, anodized coating is really what convinced me of the upgrade. After all....the durability of the pans is what makes us need to buy new ones every few years or alternatively keep them around much longer for a slightly higher price. These wipe clean as promised and require no butter or oil to be \"non-stick\". We haven't used metal utensils in them yet because there's really no reason to roll the dice on that....but it seems like this would also prove to be OK as advertised. The red heat indicator is helpful (not necessary), but great when you're cooking multiple things and need to glance down and know you're at an optimal temperature to throw your meal in. A convenience that's nice for sure.These are attractive with a deeper setting rather than the \"flat and wide\" versions that technically measure as larger, but don't actually hold more food because they are shallow or graduated out. The handles are easy to use, don't get hot, and feel durable/heavy. The bottom of the pans are excellent for your old, electric stove (like ours) that isn't exactly top notch for heat consistency anymore. No burning or hot spots with these. Our cooking experience is vastly improved with these pans over any others I've owned and we cook breakfast (eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, etc) more than anything. You can easily cook sauteed veggies for omelettes in the smaller pan and the eggs in just a few minutes and the egg and veggie residue rinse clean with dish soap and water even without wiping (though I wash them to ensure bacteria is gone regardless).While *I'd personally* love it if they could manage the same fun colors as T-Fal's cheaper models....it wasn't important to my significant other and the function and already-attractive finish alone more than make up for it. This may not be a \"Professional\" piece of cookware....but it sure behaves like one. And for a fraction of the price. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who does a lot of skillet and stovetop cooking and doesn't want to spend tons of time soaking pans, scrubbing, or deal with \"seasoning\" and other nonsense that more professional skillets and pans often require. Cooking should be fast, easy, and cause as little clean up as possible. These do the trick. And they look to be a set to last and last on top of it. Will definitely be purchasing more sizes of these!",

One, they were heavier than the ones we had prior. The bottom of the skillet was different. The surface was also different and the real difference came when cooking in it. Eggs, bacon, grilled cheese, and most everything else came out great. No sticking. You could use a fork and no scratches! I am only waiting to see how long they last. As I stated in the headline, these skillets were better than I expected!",
