                "reviewText": "Well, I have yet to find a really durable non-stick pan, these pans all have sprayed on coatings and on every one ive ever seen the coating eventually fails - its just a question of when. The infomercials make wild claims that dont even match the pans own instructions of use, how they get away with this is baffling. They often iimpress at first use and get glowing reviews, then at some point its in the trash - to be fair this is often as much to do with improper use of metal utensils on a non stick surface as anything, but ive had pans I treated with kid gloves and still the coating failed. OK call me negative but its the truth 99.5% of the time and its something only time will tell. So, that aside I will say this pan makes a great first impression - the nice looking if not unusual coating and pan construction seem to indicate better than average quality and durability based on ther pans feel and weight as well as thickness. I especially like the very well made handle that will never burn me and looks very much like real wood but is really a man made high heat synthetic, and thats fine as long as it holds up, but the handle is one of the best ive seen far as comfort and safety go -- the down side is you can not put this pan in the oven with this type handle, and im not faulting the pan for this because the manufacturer tells you this in the instructions and I knew this going in so if you want such a pan buy one made to go in the oven. - Ive only used the pan three times so far and can not deny I am impressed, I lightly cleaned and wiped the pan dry, then fried eggs sunny side up and there was no sticking they slid out with almost no coaxing. Then with no cleaning I fried some breakfast sausage and the pan proved easy to work with and cooked the sausage nice and evenly, no sticking and the sausage came out great. Finally, leaving all the sausage remnants in the pan untouched I fried two more eggs sunny side up, and again there was no sticking the eggs slid right out with no issues - again its still early in the game but I found this very encouraging, often frying an egg after sausage makes it hard to retrieve the egg - but not in this case, in fact though I am a nonstick skeptic I already love this pan -- but I know in my heart only time will show how good a companion this pan proves to be. I would say if this pan could deliver say, five to seven years of this kind of performance its a bargain for $30, almost nothing today is built to last like things used to so the five to seven year rule is just my opinion and in todays world not many things last five to seven years, so I figure that would be a very good lifespan for a $30 non stick pan, and hopefully being made in Germany will mean something as far as build quality making it a realistic projection - but so far I have nothing bad at all to say about the pans performance or overall build quality, given what I know so far of it the $30 price seems well in line and for now I have to say its a solid performer and definitely one to try if youre looking, its not a run of the mill TV ad clone and its one of the reasons I pulled the trigger. Ive only seen the one size so far, hopefully there will be and 8 and 12 inch available, because if it proves itself good I definitely want another one or two of these pans.",

                "reviewText": "I actually came to Amazon today searching for matching pans, and realized I was remiss in not reviewing my 11\" pan that I literally purchased a year ago today. I've had it a good while, and am comfortable letting the world know that it's still like brand new and easily my favorite pan of all time. Nothing sticks to it...NOTHING...it heats evenly, has a nice lid, and is SO EASY to clean. Everything just slides right out--hot water, a squirt of dish soap, a few passes with a soft sponge, and a good rinse and dry and it's ready to go back in the cabinet. I was concerned about the warnings to hand wash because, well...I'm lazy and I admit it. The rest of my pots and pans need some elbow grease to clean up, so I worried that if I couldn't put it in the dishwasher, I would just leave this pan sitting dirty on the stove in a fit of laziness. Or WORSE, that I'd say \"eff it\" and put it in the dishwasher and ruin it, as I've been known to do with other hand-wash items. But oh, was I wrong! 90% of the time, I put whatever I'm cooking onto a serving dish and clean off the pan before the family even sits down to our meal, it's that quick. Ask my husband and kids, every time I wash the pan I exclaim out loud how much I love it--they think it's pretty weird, but hey, I guess this is what it's like to be in your 40's.Aside from all this, as mentioned, my pan is a year old and I've seen no wear on it at all. I'm so sad to see all the reviews stating that their pans didn't even last a month! I wish that everyone could have a life-changing non-stick pan experience like mine. I stan for pan. Now I'm off to buy some other sizes.",
