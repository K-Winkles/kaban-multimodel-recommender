                "reviewText": "This frying pan definitely fulfills all the requirements I was looking for in a frying pan. The size is well suited to most of my frying needs, not too heavy or shallow. The \"non-stick\" feature was the number one reason I purchased this item. My previous main frying pan had lived a long life and was scratched up and everything was sticking.This pan is absolutely non-stick! While it is still \"new\", I've used it about 6 times at the time of this writing. It has surpassed my expectations at how easy it is to clean and how nothing sticks. I use a silicone spatula when cooking in this pan.The care instructions do state that the pan is dishwasher safe, but I personally do not put pots and pans in the dishwasher. Lids, yes, but not the pans themselves. Non-stick pans are so quick and easy to clean, I prefer to just use a non-scratch scrubber with dish soap and hot water in the sink.The lid fits perfectly and has a handle that is easy to grasp and does not get so hot that you need a mitt to pick it up with. The lid is glass so you can see what you are cooking without lifting it up and is fully dishwasher safe.The \"soft grip handle\" of the pan itself is a very comfortable size and easy to grip while maneuvering a full pan of food on a hot stove. The pan handle does not heat up, nor is it slippery.The pan was packed well and arrived in perfect condition on the exact date indicated when I ordered it.I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality non-stick frying pan at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical about buying from this brand, as I had never heard of it, but I saw that it had three layer construction, a reasonable price, and great reviews, so I figured I'd give it a try. I've used it a few times now and it is obviously higher quality than the previous T-Fal frying pan that I had. Looking at them side-by-side, this one is noticeably thicker. The non-stick function on this one is also better than I ever have experienced with any other pan. I expect to get a few years out of this pan at least and will be sure to update this review whenever it gives out. If you don't see an update, assume it is still going strong.",
