                "reviewText": "Let's start with the things I like about this pan. The ceramic coating on the pan is excellent. Food doesn't stick, and cleaning it is a breeze. I appreciate the fact that I can cook with very little oil or butter, which is especially important for those concerned about calories or cholesterol, like myself. The ceramic coating also appears to be quite durable, as I haven\u2019t noticed any scratches or signs of wear. The pan did arrive with a small chip on the rim, but I don't think that will affect the ceramic finish. The 14\" size is also a plus, particularly if you're cooking for a large family or guests.The one think I didn\u2019t care for is the lightweight nature of this pan. While that may appeal to those who prefer lighter cookware, I found that it lacked the heft I like in a large frying pan. The fact that it's lightweight also makes me wonder about longevity. Other than that, this is a nice, large non-stick pan that cleans up easily.",

                "reviewText": "I have similar type skillets and thought a 14-inch would be nice to have for cooking larger quantiies. Oh, my! I had no idea how large 14 inches would be! I can cook a lot of food without overcrowding.If you like to cook without much fat, then these ceramic pans are perfect. You can use butter and oil in these, but sparingly and at the appropriate temperature for the fat. For example, extra virgin olive oil would be at a low temperature and butter slightly higher. You definitely want to read the use and care instructions to avoid ruining the non-stick surface. They also recommend that you not use heat above medium except for a short period of time. This is true for all products like this one, as well as for stainless steel pans, which I also use. You always want to let the cool pan before washing it.I like to use butter and oil when cooking because it adds flavor and helps with browning, so it\u2019s a bit of an adjustment when I use ceramic pans. But I can say that nothing sticks in this skillet. I tested it out, making pancakes and eggs. Due to the skillet size, I was able to knock out pancakes super fast and scramble plenty of eggs with ease. Everything came out beautifully. And cleanup was a breeze. I also like that it can go from stovetop to oven. I use that cooking method often with steaks and pork chops.I love the color of this cream and navy pan. It looks as good as it performs. The material is much safer to use because it doesn\u2019t contain the harmful and toxic chemicals of non-stick materials used in pans years ago.This pan will get plenty of use! The only issue for me is where to store it because of its size. But it\u2019s a good problem to have. This pan makes cooking fun and cleanup hassle-free.",

                "reviewText": "I've moved away from teflon pans a couple years ago and have been using anodized aluminum, but certain foods like eggs are hard to do in aluminum pans since they're not really non-stick. I tried the Gotham Steel grill and it works really well, so I bought this pan also and so far it's amazing! It's true you don't need any oil, butter or non-stick spray. Haven't found anything that sticks to it. The non-stick nature also makes cleanup super easy! I would recommend treating the pan with care and not using metal utensils (plastic or wood only), and using a soft sponge when washing it. Also as with any pan, you need to have basic cooking skills to not put the heat too high unless you're frying. Even pan frying only requires 3/4 heat. Gotham Steel has definitely changed the game for dishes I can enjoy without the messy cleanup and maintaining the high quality of the dishes we like to achieve. I never thought I'd enjoy or even entertain the thought of making a juicy fish filet anywhere other than on our grill but this pan has proved me wrong! The meat treat cooked evenly throughout. I like mine closer to medium rare. Not only was the end result delicious, the cleanup was a Snap! What appeared to be caked on residue, which I allowed to cool down before attempting to clean, wiped off almost 100% with a paper towel with the rest falling off into the sink with a bit of running water and soap. It nearly took me less time to clean this pan in the sink than it would have to get it prepped and put in the dishwasher like other pans. We are now in the process of replacing all of our pans with Gotham Steel. Now I love to make pasta dishes, eggs and more without dreading the cleanup process!",

                "reviewText": "I was not expecting this pan to be big at all. I love the size. I can fit quite a bit of food in this pan to feed my big family. I've grilled chicken, made pasta, fried steak. It is absolutely the perfect pan. I need more pans such as this to match. As much as I have cooked in this pan it has yet to get a scratch. i love the thick coating they place on the pan. I would not use any metal utensils just to ensure the life of the pan. The heat is distributed throughout. There aren't any areas where the food doesn't cook. This came to my surprise because of the size. Some big pans you have to move the food around in order to cook thoroughly. If this has a set, get the set. Get all of the matching pieces. Cleaning is headache free. Does not feel like a cheap pa, it definitely has some weight to it.",
