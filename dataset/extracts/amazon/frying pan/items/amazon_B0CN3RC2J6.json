Great results straight away, in fact I\u2019d rather have to add heat than to turn it down.Did not hint at sticking with the cutlets I made.

                "reviewText": "This Gotham cookware set is absolutely beautiful but also does an excellent job with meals. This set is fairly large, equipped with most things needed stove top wise, making it a great gift, especially for a new homeowner or college kid. The hammered steel gives the pots and pans a luxurious appearance. They are fairly light weight but cook/heat evenly. I was concerned that acidic things like pasta sauce would stain, but the pans clean up easily with no discoloration. The pour spouts on the pots and saucepans are my favorite feature as it\u2019s extremely convenient\u2026.all cookware should equip spouts! You do have to take caution with storing as they will scratch. Overall, affordable and good looking quality.",

It's non-stick, easy to clean, and cooks evenly. The lid fits perfectly and has a steam vent. The hammered design is beautiful and the cream color matches my kitchen. It works well on my induction stove and it's dishwasher safe. I love this frying pan and I use it almost every day. It's worth every penny and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality non-stick frying pan.",
