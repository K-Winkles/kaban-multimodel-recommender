It's very attractive (I got the black with the black and white speckled interior, and I just LOVE it), and it cleans like a dream.I can see this set lasting for many years with the use of silicone or wooden utensils. As with any nonstick pot and pan set, the key is to use non-metal utensils and to ensure that when you store them, you place a paper towel between the stacks to ensure the coating is not harmed. It will eventually give out, of course, but this set is really good and should last years. I'll update if anything changes with daily use.",
