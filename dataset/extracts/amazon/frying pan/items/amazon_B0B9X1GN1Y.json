It is recommended that a very high heat is not recommended for this pan, which makes perfect sense. I rubbed a small amount of olive oil in the pan and set the heat dial to halfway down. Scrambling them with a silicone spatula, my eggs came out light, fluffy and perfect. Cleaning up was a breeze. A little soap and water and done. No sticking remnants. I think that with my good care, this pan will last a long time. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The enamel the coating on the outside of the pan leaves a lot to be desired. Its not fired correctly or glazed correctly, and eventually the enamel stained the pan itself performs perfectly for what I need it. It\u2019s a well-balanced, gradual heating. Cooks perfectly and washes up beautifully. It should be five star but I gave it four stars because the enameling on the outside is so itchy. I suggest you get it in a dark color rather than the turquoise green. I bought my frying pan, and it shows every little drip and will not come clean.",

I bought one from the grocery store a few months back for about $20, and it warped in no time, and the cook surface was OK, but still needed to use a lot of butter or oil. I honestly just bought this one because it was only $10, and I needed a new one. When I opened it up I was surprised with the quality. It is solid, and sturdy, with a reinforced bottom with heat distribution. The non stick surface is great, and you hardly need any butter to fry an egg. You really can't go wrong for the price. Next time I need some cookware, I will go with this brand again.",
