The weight of these is what we expect from A/C. But we haven\u2019t tested them yet and will update this as we do.As per the handles, what the heck is the big deal! We have 30 A/C pots and pans and they all have the same handle. It has never been an issue. My wife is a lifelong professional chef and chef educator and never an issue. Until I read these reviews I had never heard a complaint.After using them for a week (my wife is a retired professional chef and is ALWAYS cooking-and we have over 30 All-Clad pans), we found them perfectly functional and a huge bargain. We have no complaints of the evil handles. They work well as all AC handles do and the NS surfaces as well. Nothing to add to the above except that they are not showing any signs of wear at all after a few months. But we take care of our pans! No overheating, no metal utensils and no scrubbing with abrasives. We like them enough that we just bought a 12\u201d pan from this same line.",

                "reviewText": "I am giving this product five stars. First let me say the pot handles suck. They are weird awkward and it is a terrible design. However, the surface of these nonstick pans is absolutely incredible. It is a hard surface. It is not coated with any weird chemicals and nothing sticks to it. As long as you take your time and heat slowly, I have had absolutely no problems with this. It is perfect for saut\u00e9ing tofu and getting a nice crunch on the outside without using any oil I would highly recommend these pans even though the handles are awful, the most important part is the nonstick, right?",

But the small pan was burned and had some things stuck to it It was scraped with a metal spatula and now didn't look so good. I ordered a replacement. It came and weas the same size. Looks nice. But it is not as thick and slightly lighter weight. The metal is just a little bit thinner. I don't know if this is for all the newer ones or just what we ordered from Amazon. But being the smallest pan it's not that important",

                "reviewText": "This is a heavy-duty pan -- almost like cast iron including the weight. They sit very flat and the nonstick is really non-stick. I have fried eggs wi.th just a brushing of oil and they slide around as if floating in oil. They are super easy to clean. Wiping with a paper towel will almost clen the pans. I find the heating the pan just higher than the cooking range for few minutes improves the evenness of heat for uniform cooking.The main negative is the handle. It is strange. It is U-shaped on top and narrows at it gets closer to pan. It is awkward. It is similar to a Cuisinart frying pan handle which has a U-shaped handle, but it widens as it gets closer to the pan which works better with your hand while holding the pan. It is also long. All Clad needs to rethink this handle design.",

They hold the heat very well, are solid, and the non-stick remains awesome. I've upped it to five stars, since the value is great considering the sale it was on.",

This is the same set sold in William and Sonoma and the price it was listed at, at the time, it was a little bit cheaper on Amazon. Works as expected, easy to use, nothing has stuck so far. Easy to clean, I haven\u2019t used in dishwasher and I don\u2019t plan to even though they say it\u2019s dishwasher safe, no need, it cleans up so easy with a soft sponge and warm water with dish soap. The larger sized pan is perfect if you\u2019re looking to do some fried rice for one or two people, or it will cook 3-4 eggs perfectly. The smaller one is really just for cooking one or two eggs. Handle doesn\u2019t heat up when cooking. A solid purchase, would buy again.",

The cleanup is a breeze. We're very happy with the pans so far, and will try to make them last as long as possible by using only silicone utensils and soft dish-washing sponges on them. The only thing I don't like is that the pan lids don't have any steam vents. Luckily, I kept my glass Copper Chef pan lids, which do have steam vents, and they fit the All-Clad pans perfectly.",
