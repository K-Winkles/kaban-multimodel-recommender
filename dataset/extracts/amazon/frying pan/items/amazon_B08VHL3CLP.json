                "reviewText": "The pan handles are not totally seal against water. If you dishwasher these pans, water will build up in the handles. This will lead to corrosion later on and stovetop cooking will potentially heat the water trapped and burn your hands without warning (possibly). I drilled a 1/8\u201d hole on the bottom side near the end. This drilled hole will One, help to drain any water buildup. Two, this will aid in air drying to help lower chances of corrosion. The utensils that come with these pans are equal to the quality from a \u201cDollar General\u201d store ( basically just cheap junk ). BE CAREFUL when tightening the screw handles onto glass covers. If you tighten too hard, I was afraid of breaking these glass pan covers. Wrist tighten only and recheck these lids periodically to ensure handles are still on tight. Nonstick coating seems ok so far. Overall all these pans are ok but these pans are definitely NOT a five star rating.",

Handles for lids were difficult to put together without instructions; glad there were spare parts. Would have been nice if design had allowed for nesting with lids on without being concerned about scratching non-stick finish.",
