If you cook on an electric surface where the heated area covers the bottom of the perfectly (no more no less) the heat does not reach the sidewalls adequately in my opinion. If you are cooking ground meats, piece of chicken or eggs you only need low heat then the heat will not transfer to the walls of the pan. I dont like this. I think with a gas stove or an electric circle just a half inch past the bottom of the pan would fix this problem. But if you are using a circle of heat that fits the bottom exactly, heat does not transfer properly to the walls in my opinion. Not a deal breaker but something to adapt to with the pan.",

No le doy 5 estrellas porque me parece que es m\u00e1s delicada que otras sartenes de acero inoxidable que he tenido, veo que se maltrata un poco m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que otras.
