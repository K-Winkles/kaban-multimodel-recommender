One of the lids doesn't fit well (almost like it's a bit oval and I have to squeeze it in there to get it to fit. The pan are much lighter than comparable ones, which along with the poor fitting lid makes me wonder about long term quality and durability. I read the \"Lifetime Warranty\" and like other similar items, it seems pretty useless. Its warranty on manufacturer defects which means if the nonstick starts to peel in a few months it will likely not be covered.",

We haven\u2019t had that issue but we also haven\u2019t used it on super high heat. The no stick works well but they also instruct you not to get it too hot..but ...well you use a wok quite often....er...umm....hot. So that\u2019s bad.This pot is ok. Not great. But also not $400 either. So overall it works for us but no copper bottom French sauce pan. Might be cottage pot.One other thing - the crappy thin metal handle gets crazy hot!
