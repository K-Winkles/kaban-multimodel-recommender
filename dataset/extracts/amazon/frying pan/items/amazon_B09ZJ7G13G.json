I have cleaned them per the instructions that came with them, I seasoned them when they were new and then 6 months later ( I'm going to season them again soon, about every 6 months). They still cook like new, meaning they are still nonstick. I haven't experienced any chipping. Heat distribution seems to be fine on my electric stove. Overall I would say this is a really good budget medium weight cook set.",

I just washed it after it cooled and it is good as new. I hand wash them. Handles stay cool enough so as not to burn your hands.
