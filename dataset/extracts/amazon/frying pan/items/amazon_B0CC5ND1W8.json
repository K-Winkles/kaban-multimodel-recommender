When you don't have a lot of room it's nice to have a pan that will do double duty, and allow you to make a lot of one dish meals for two or three people on the stove top! The non-stick surface is perfect. Heat conduction excellent. It works well on my induction hot plate. Cleans up easily, and looks good. Arrived quickly and in good shape well packaged. First thing I made, was transcaucasus cheese bread, followed by omelettes. Neither the eggs nor the cheese stuck at all. I don't know how long the nonstick finish will last, but everything in life is uncertain.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a pan for making stir-fry noodles and came across this one. First off, I like that this pan matches all the other pans I have so it's looks like it's apart of the set I own. It comes with a lid so I can cover my food while cooking or when finished so the food can stay warm. The pan heats up well and evenly so cooking time was pretty fast. When it came to washing the pan, super easy to wash it with soap and sponge. I love this pan, I would buy my friends and family this pan so they could try it too.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the BEST pans I have ever used. I bought some 'non-stick' pans from Walmart not to long ago, and they were awful. After cooking in them a few times, anything I cooked in them started to stick and they were so hard to wash.This pan has been the opposite. It's so easy to cook in and to clean up afterwards. I don't even have to apply pressure with rag to get it clean. It also looks so pretty. It's speckled in white dots and I love the look. It's a good weight, not to light but not overwhelmingly heavy either.This has quickly replaced most of the pans I used to cook in! It's a serious must have for all kitchens!",
