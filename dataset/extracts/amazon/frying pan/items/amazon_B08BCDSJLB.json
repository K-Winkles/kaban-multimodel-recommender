                "reviewText": "I am an experienced home cook. I cook at least 3 times a day, 7 days a week. I've had several, several different pan brands over the last 12 years, and I've been really disappointed. This pan is pure magic. Pure magic! First, it's aesthically pleasing. It's seriously just beautiful. Second, it's super, super easy to clean. Food just slides off, you really don't need much oil if ANY. It's absolutely wonderful.Since I bought it, I've made eggs, pancakes, fried tacos, ground beef, all manner of veggies and proteins. I've not found it to have a single issue yet. In fact, I love it so much that I'm going to buy the pot.There is a downside, I purchased the 12 inch, which may be bigger than most need, but it doesn't come with or have the option of purchasing a lid. No matter, I'm certain that is easily remedied. The other is, you may cry for the resources lost before you found this magical piece of kitchen ware.",

This pan is so nicely made, from the wooden handle, to the non-stick, granite surface. It is attractive and easy to use.I will continue to use my stainless steel and cast-iron pans for high-heat cooking and searing meats, but this pan is perfect for everything else. It is so easy to clean that I don't even use soap. I just rinse and dry. I plan on taking good care of this. I will not turn the heat up beyond the lowest, medium-high setting, and only use plastic or wood utensils with it. It is enjoyable to cook on.",

It rinses out clean and comes out of the water completely dry (every drop of water rolls off- I don't even need a towel)This pan is about the same weight as than my teflon frypan- maybe even a bit lighterThe handle is really smooth and doesn't get hot.This is a really nice pan. I like the way it looks, feels and washes. I plan to buy other sizes if available.Update: 2 years later and daily use= still loving it. So easy to clean. Indicator light doesn\u2019t work anymore but I never paid it much attention anyway. I have used it multiple times every day.",

The interior and exterior show no staining whatsoever. I didn't think I would like the wooden handle but it never gets too hot and just works. The Circulon pans I bought at Costco about five years ago performed well but the fry pans now look disgusting and this pan was my first replacement. I also bought the 9.5 inch pan and should receive the 11 inch today. Sold on the pan.",

Of course I\u2019ve dealt with the situation by looking at them as a semi-long term disposable item.This is my newest and it\u2019s a little different. It seems a bit smaller but deeper pan, making it a nice implement for warming up leftovers. (God forbid microwaving!)The non-stick is pretty good thus far, but I never use it without a small bit of ghee.I like the spout on the side, that\u2019s somewhat unusual in this type of pan, but the little silicone temperature gage is a bit silly because I can\u2019t see the use for it myself. Of course that doesn\u2019t really matter one way or another, just mentioning it because they advertise it as a \u201cfeature\u201d, lolIt\u2019s a nice little pan, light and comfortable to use, but I haven\u2019t had it for very long so I don\u2019t know when the replacement day will come.",

                "reviewText": "Heat is really distributed well and quickly with this pan. It's also super easy to clean because the non stick surface works great. I've used it daily for about 2 months. I had another brand of pan like this before but I ruined that one because I didn't realize how much hotter these pans can get. I kept burning everything and the non stick surface no longer worked. I eventually realized it was user error and not the product so I bought this one to give it another try. I learned I have to turn the heat down at least a full setting, so if I want medium heat I turn it to low. If I want low heat I turn it to warm. That's how much faster and more efficiently the core of this pan heats up and distributes the heat. Now that I know the trick it works perfectly and I love it.",
