                "reviewText": "I like this nonstick pan overall because it is easy to use, not heavy, and seems sturdy. The only downside is that sometimes when I don't cook at a high-enough temperature or put butter/oil on the pan before cooking, it could get stuck on the surface and I have to put extra care in rubbing those off from each crevice. But it barely sticks, to begin with. So I am enjoying using this pan. It's also really nice that it does not have any rivets!! I hope it's sturdy, which so far I've observed as sturdy and well-made. I also love how it's actually genuinely dishwasher safe, without producing any dripping rust water or showing spots of rush, say, on the bottom like some other products.",

I took off 1 star because after first use, the rim of the pan turned brown. I had to use a Brillo pad to remove the stains, only around the rim though as not to damage the non stick surface.",

Not sure what else I\u2019d want a pan to do. I guess we haven\u2019t put it in the oven yet. It\u2019s a good pan and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t spend one kazillion dollars to get the one that yells a lot. :)",
