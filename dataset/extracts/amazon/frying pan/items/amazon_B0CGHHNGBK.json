                "reviewText": "It's one of the smaller pans I own, but probably the correct size for what I cook :) It does seem to take a little longer to heat up than my other pans, but my other pans are not induction compatible. I'm not sure if that is the reason why it takes longer, just the only explanation I can think of. It did a pretty good job of cooking food without it sticking to the pan and burning and any left over foods came right off the pan during clean up. My two 12\" pans are getting old and this one is meant to replace those, even though it's smaller in size. So far I like the results I'm getting with this pan. I plan to use this for a few more days, then throw away my 12\" pans if this one works well enough and sized big enough for what I cook. Since all my pans are larger than this one, I don't seem to have any lids that will fit, so that kind of sucks.I like the handle, it has a nice feel to it. It seems to have a good grip to it as well. Whatever that material is that it's made of feels nice to the touch. It's supposed to stay cool while cooking and so far I haven't noticed the handle heat up even a little bit, so I'm guessing that's true.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this skillet, it is so easy to clean, and it has been non-stick on everything I have cooked so far. The description does say it is induction cooktop useable, but so far I have not gotten it to work on my induction cooktop at all. The bottom is built up nicely, and does transfer heat well on my electric stove, and it does seem to distribute that heat evenly. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these skillets.",

                "reviewText": "Pan arrived in a simple cardboard box with the handle detached, and no product insert or use/care instructions. Everything looked nice and shiny, I had to use a long thin Phillips #2 screwdriver to securely attach the handle with the provided screw (handle hole angle necessitated long thin screwdriver). Finish of the pan is interesting appearance, looked to be without blemish. Pan feels firm and light. Handle looks like wood grained, but it's not wood (identified as bakelite in the product description), and it definitely stays cool when the rest of the pan heats up.I tried out the pan on an induction cook top -- it heated quickly and evenly. When it was sufficiently warm I cracked open one egg and poured into the pan, with a little water (for steam), and put a lid on it (glass lid I already had in the kitchen; no lid included with this pan).I think it was my first time ever, being able to observe the egg as it cooked. I was able to get a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg with no problem, up to this point.I turned off the heat and tipped the pan, expecting the egg to slide out of the pan and onto a slice of bread I had ready to receive it just like in the promo video... no movement. I tipped the pan almost vertical, the perfectly cooked egg stayed firmly stuck to the pan surface. I had to dislodge the egg from the pan with a spatula (egg tasted great, btw). Afterward, I scraped the pan with the spatula, the photo is what I scraped up.Maybe the pan needs to be treated or conditioned before cooking with it? I don't know, there were no instructions to tell me what to do. It worked great after I sprayed it with canola oil (second egg slid out slick as a whistle), but if I'm promised non-stick cooking right out of the box, that's what needs to happen. Grrrr...",
