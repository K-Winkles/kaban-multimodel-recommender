                "reviewText": "Now that we ate empty nester, I make smaller meals for just the two of us. This pan is perfect and with the higher sides, I can make many more dishes than I could in my conventional 10 inch pan! I even made a shepherd's pie in it! And with the pour spouts on each side, there is no boil-over!And clean up is a breeze!! Nothing sticks! An easy wipe with a little dish soap and some water, a quick rinse and you're good to go!Highly recommend!!!!",

                "reviewText": "This pan is wonderful, it has replaced all of the other plans we typically use in the kitchen. It works perfectly and is the best kind of nonstick. I personally also love the handle, it\u2019s big and study and has the best sort of soft touch. This pan is great, I would certainly consider adding more of these to our pan lineup!",

I bought it because it has a pour spout on each side, non-stick, comes with a lid, a handle, to some degree, on each side and is light weight. It absolutely checks all of those boxes. I highly recommend this pan!!!!!!",

However, in the second week, the pan starts losing the non-stickness and creating a mess no mater what i cook. I never overheated it (less than 4 out of 9 on my stove scale) and only wash it by hand with soft sponge. The durability and performance of this product is disappointing. Not recommended it.",
