My boyfriend puts everything in the dishwasher (I try to handwash things like this but doesn't always happen) so I didn't want a super expensive pan. Only slightly annoying thing is, make sure the handle is facing up in the dishwasher. The little hole where it attaches to the pan, will hold a lot of water and splash you, if it's not upright in there.The handle DOES get hot on the stovetop even just as short as cooking 2 eggs. I can only use the outer half of the handle at that point.Overall, I like it and I'm considering the larger pan too.",

And this pan is now officially on my favorites list! It is actually kind of lightweight, which I like - I hate slinging heavy cookware around - but it still distributes heat evenly and is the perfect size for an omelet, side dish, or grilled sandwich. The coating is divine and super easy to clean. I have a smooth, glass-topped stove and this heats up quickly on that. The handle is solid and comfortable shaped and looks pretty awesome too!
