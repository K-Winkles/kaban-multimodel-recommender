                "reviewText": "Absolutely love this cookware. Following instructions for use carefully and haven't had a scrub a pot since. Anything that does stick a bit, I just heat some water in it and add a bit of salt and then swish around a paper towel with my silicone spoon and it's clean - but hardly ever need to do this. Be sure not to overheat as well - pay attention to the max amt of heat you should use and that also protects the non-stick qualities - I had to get used to cooking at a lower temp than I had before but got used to it. I bought some felt to put between pots for storage to protect the finish from small scratches and also take care to put it in a place in the drainer where sharp items won't scratch. Seems like a lot to protect them but these easy habits forms quickly and makes cooking/cleanup so much easier. Pots were a little pricey but so glad I got them - with proper care, I believe they will last a good long time and the ceramic coating seems to be one of the healthiest options for non-stick cookware.One caveat - you might want a different dedicated pot for cooking pasta that you could put on higher heat - takes a long time to heat up a large pot of water with the lower temp requirement for this series.",

                "reviewText": "I have two Tramontina cookware pieces and both are fantastic--I would highly recommend Tramontine Enamel cookware pieces without any reservations.The enamel surface is high quality and is truly a non-stick surface. I have been able to greatly reduce the use of oil when using this piece of cookware.The enamel also cleans-up well and requires little scrubbing. According to the care instructions, it can be washed in the dishwasher. I have tried this a few times to see if this claim was correct and it cleaned-up well; however, for the sake of the longevity I will normally be washing it by hand. Even after washing it in the dishwasher, the enamel surface remained non-stick.The packaging and marketing material is honestly written, as the piece is both designed and made in Italy.High quality alloys appear to have been used, and the rivets connecting the two handles to the body of the piece are very securely fashioned and well made. (If I had to wager, I doubt the handles will be coming loose.)One word of caution about caring for this piece... On the lid, in between the gasket and the rim of the lid it is possible for water to get behind the gasket. If you let the lit soak underwater or if you wash the lid in the dishwasher, be prepared to allow the lid to sit out to air-dry as so give ample time for the small amount of trapped water to evaporate.",

                "reviewText": "These pans work really well, overall. It is important that you follow the care and cooking directions. I first bought an 8\" and 12\" pan several years ago. The 8\" pan is still in excellent condition. It does not get as much use. I generally just use it to fry an egg or grilled cheese sandwich. It is a perfect size for these tasks. I am on my 3rd 12\" pan. The first one lasted about 3 years with heavy use, then it started staining and sticking. My second one lasted about a year, and I am sure I could have gotten another 2 years out of it, but one of my family members used it and cooked on high. The pan got stained and started sticking. So now I recently purchased my 3rd one. Although these do not last a lifetime, they are a decent value to get a few years of use out of. I am not a professional chef, but from what I can tell, these heat pretty evenly and do a good job cooking. Just remember to take care of them! And, don't cook on high!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a larger stock pot for soup that has a safe coating to cook with for my birds to be around without spending a ton of money. It was kind of hard to find something that fit all my requirements but this is it and for a really good price. The ceramic coating seems like it will hold up well to chipping and it heats evenly. The rubberized handles are nice so you don't have to search for pot holders. I will probably add a couple more pieces from this collection.",
