I grew up with this brand in Germany, it is well known for good and long lasting kitchen products. Profi means professional and I hope this pan lives up to it. This is a small but mighty pan. It has a clad bottom base, a welded don't get hot, juts warm handle and high quality non-stick coating. It is dishwasher safe and it's light weight is great for arthritic hands. This pan will be used almost every day in our household. When I ordered this pan, the price was higher; it has come down to $25.61, a great value considering the 5 year warranty!",
