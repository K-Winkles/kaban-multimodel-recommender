                "reviewText": "Finally got around to replacing my frying pan/skillet-- the one i had previously was a basic stainless steel model... that got ruined in a kitchen accident-- turns out the stove itself had wiring problems and boiled a pot of water on low... but, unfortunately, that former skillet of mine was not worth keeping as the scrubbing efforts were just futile. (stove has been replaced by the way)I bought this skillet because I liked the non stick feature of it, which makes cooking a lot of things easier. It's a bit heavier than my old one, heavier than I'd anticipated but... it's definitely lighter than my cast iron skillet that I like to rotate out.I needed an everyday skillet-- and this is great for that. The value for the money I would say is pretty spot on, and it doesn't feel cheaply made. I tend to hand wash my skillets even though this is dishwasher safe, I would rather just hand wash and know that it keeps in tip top shape.",

Also great for fried or scrambled eggs. It retains heat so well I don't even need to use it above a medium low heat setting. I've also used it for sauteeing vegetables and for roasting in the oven. Works great, good investment for any home cook!",

Had a minimal hotspot and did moderately well with the none stickm on the hardness scale it didn't scratch until about a number 5 pick was used. Previously this was $20, at $30 \"discounted\" to $22. I'm not sure if still fits that value. The texture I wouldn't call smooth on the pan (if that matters to you( and NEVER believe any pan that says no need for oil, that's falsehood marketing crap. Cooked an over easy egg with a spatula, flipped and all. Good pan and good value with even heat distribution.",
