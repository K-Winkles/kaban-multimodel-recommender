I have used it quite a number of times and it's held up quite well. I washed and seasoned it for best results. Had some eggs stick but the trick to cast iron is continued use and seasoning which I've done. I am more than confident this piece will stay in constant rotation in my kitchen. I must say, it is NEVER far away when I cook. I would definitely purchase this brand again!",

                "reviewText": "I've avoided purchasing cast iron pans in the past, as I was concerned that my natural habit of grabbing the handle while stirring would result in a bad burn. But the silicon handle cover reduces that risk. Having seasoned the Legend skillet 5 times, I've used it twice since then, the first time with fish. I also like the glass lid with silicon knob, and generally everything about this pan, except for the rough texture of the interior surface. Though well coated with oil, a lot of food residue stuck to the pan during its first use. I tried it again today for a mushroom & onion sauce, and was happy with the way it held heat for a gentle simmer, and cooked evenly. No problem cleaning it up afterward. I assume that with each use, the patina will build, and the the surface will become smoother. Looking forward to many more uses of this nice-looking skillet.",

                "reviewText": "I love this cast iron pan and use it regularly. As with most cast iron when properly seasoned it's relatively nonstick and can be scrubbed clean (I recommend a piece of chainmail) with some hot water and some vigorous scrubbing without the use of soap. Do not use soap on cast iron, it messes with the seasoning. On my pan however I'm not sure if it's uniformly thick all around because the seasoning in the middle keeps cooking off under seasoning heat while the edges are relatively unheated. Sure the edges will heat up (the handle and outer grip take awhile to heat up) but for after cooking stovetop seasoning it's kind of uneven. For all around seasoning I have to wipe it all over with grease or something and stick it in the oven for a few hours otherwise a center splotch of the pan isn't as seasoned. It's not a huge deal, as it's still relatively cast irony. I still love the pan more than a lot of my other pans though. Be sure to clean the inner edges of the lid well as they can accumulate grease and other detritus by the seam that a few swipes with a cleaning pad will easily miss.",

                "reviewText": "We LOVE cast iron pans in our house. They're our goto pans, because they're so versatile. We cook almost everything in them. My husband makes the absolute best steaks in the cast iron. He reverse sears them by putting them in the oven at a low temperature, until they reach the desired temperature. Once they're the right temperature, he sears them for 2 minutes on each side. They're so tender you can literally slice through them with a butter knife. Dang, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I use it for all the rest of the cooking. I especially like using it instead of my Dutch oven, because the heat is more evenly distributed. Two months ago, I purchased a Legend pizza pan and it's the best pizza pan I've ever had. It's holding up great and seasoning up nicely. Not only is their cast iron made with high quality steel and iron, but it's half the price of the Lodge brand. I chose this pan because I needed one with a tempered glass lid. My other pans either didn't have a lid or the lid was cast iron. This lid is made with good quality glass and it's very easy to clean. The extra long handle with the silicone sleeve makes it much easier to get the pan in and out of the oven. It comes pre-seasoned with vegetable oil, which is extremely important and essential. When I was looking at pans some were pre-seasoned, but with synthetic products that are full of chemicals. Who wants to cook their food in a pan that's basically seasoned with poison. Yuk! I'm very impressed with the quality and durability of the Legend brand of cast iron and will definitely be purchasing more.",
