I cook anything in it and it all turns out great!!! Good price for the product. Get it. You won't regret it. I just ordered another one because 2 is always better than 1.",

                "reviewText": "Recently my wife expressed her desire to replace the old worn out pan we use most in the kitchen. It was tired and had lost most of the scratch resistant coating due to its age. Amazon and T-fal to the rescue. This was the only place I could find an exact replacement for a decent price. We love this pan, it really does what it says and cooks evenly while not allowing anything to stick. It is super easy to clean thanks to the coating, and we currently only hand-wash to hopefully prolong its life.",

Big enough for my needs.",
