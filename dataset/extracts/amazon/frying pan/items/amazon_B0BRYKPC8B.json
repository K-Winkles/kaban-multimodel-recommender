                "reviewText": "These pans are A+ in my book. They are well made, the perfect size for everyday cooking, and healthy so you are not ingesting leached poisons into your foods. They have a nice weight and balance... and a good look about them. The ceramic-coated stainless steel is a hard combination to find. Most pans are aluminum coated with ceramic; a cheap combination. Now, these pans do have an aluminum core sealed with two stainless steel sides, top and bottom, for even heat distribution. That way no aluminum {a poisonous metal to humans) comes in contact with your food. So, they are safe to use. You can't go wrong buying this pan set... what a bargain.",

                "reviewText": "When this product worked, it worked very well. Excellent non-stick characteristics, very good heating. We used it almost every day, including being put in the dishwasher just about nightly. After sixteen months, the pan still looks great -- no distortions, no real scratches, lid still fits perfectly, nothing coming loose, no corrosion. However, when cooking and cleaning, the \"non-stick\" performance is becoming noticeably worse, to the point where we'll soon buy another, even though it won't be \"bad\" for another few months. Of the many skillets we've bought, this is \"middle of the road\" performance for this price point. (The longest-lasting ones were about 2 years, the shortest about 1 year). This price / performance is only marginally better in value compared to what you could find on sale -- but still worth paying extra for, especially if you value avoiding the hassle of frequent buying or are especially annoyed by problems like loose handles.",

The instructions say to not use cooking spray, so I add a few drops of oil or small pat of butter to make sure nothing sticks. Super easy to clean, washing by hand is recommended.",
