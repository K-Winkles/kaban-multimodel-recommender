                "reviewText": "I ordered this about a month ago and finally gave it a try. I was afraid to cook eggs in it... I didn't want to have to scrub all those little wells because I just imagined they would stick terribly. However, after recently ordering some frozen ham and cheese croissant sandwiches that didn't have egg on them, I wanted a little egg, so I pulled this pan out to give it a try.This little pan is awesome!! It makes the perfect sandwich-sized egg patties. AND, they didn't stick... at all!! I will admit, though, that I brushed a tiny bit of olive oil in each well because I didn't trust it. I don't think that would've been necessary, though, because the egg that ended up on the top of the pan when flipping it came right off and there was no oil there.Speaking of flipping... I read some other reviewer comments that said they had a hard time flipping them. Just use a rubber spatula... you can run it around the edge of the eggs to loosen them, then slip it underneath and lift it, then carefully flip it over. It's a little tricky because the wells are a little small and deep, but once you do a couple, it gets a little easier. I think the trick is to let some of the runny part of the egg drip off - back into the well - before you flip it so you don't end up with egg splattered everywhere.I carefully mixed my eggs right in the pan with a fork (trying not to scrape the bottom so I didn't scratch it). It would probably be easier to mix them in a small dish and pour into the pan, but I was lazy and didn't want to dirty yet another item. Some chopsticks would work well to mix the egg right in the pan too so you wouldn't have to be as careful.Overall, I'm enjoying this pan and really like it. I see lots of ideas and ways for using it.I also like that it can be used on an induction cooktop. It warmed up quickly and seemed to cook my eggs evenly.",

It is easy to use and also very easy to clean. It doesn't seem to stick. Would I recommend this to someone, sure I would recommend it to someone that is wanting to save some time in the mornings.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised by how much I liked this pan. It's very lightweight and comes with the handle separately. You need a phillips head screwdriver to attach and I wasn't able to get it to be flush with the body of the pan but got it on sturdily so it doesn't shift or move around at all.The pan is a little smaller than I expected but can hold four eggs and make them round, about the size you'd find on a breakfast sandwich. I made little omelettes and an over easy egg to see how it worked and was pretty impressed with how nonstick it was. The hardest part was flipping them over. They didn't stick but because the wells are a bit deep and small, I didn't really have a tool that fit well. I ended up using a pair of chopsticks and a plastic fork (plastic so as to not mess up any nonstick coating the pan had). This worked okay, although I may see if I can find a tiny silicone cookie spatula that's small enough.This pan cooked eggs quickly with no sticking to the pan and they were just the right size to make breakfast sandwiches out of. You could even cook a round sausage patty in one while you make an egg in another and maybe toast an english muffin in the remaining too.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little pan! If you like breakfast sandwiches, this is the pan for you! My family loves breakfast sandwiches and I meal prepped a few days worth of eggs for my family with the help of this pan. The fact that you get 4 at a time and they are in the perfect shape and size to fit on an english muffin, makes this pan a must for a busy family! I'm going to meal prep some pancakes with this pan next! I think the possibilities are endless! Finding a tool to flip the eggs is a little tedious, but once you find something that works, the process is seamless. With that being said, it would be great if the company included a flipping tool with the pan.",
