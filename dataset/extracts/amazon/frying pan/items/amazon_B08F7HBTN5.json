Slow Melting Syndrome is when outer crust perfection is achieved before the sandwiched cheese has adequately melted. By covering the pan with a lid, you concentrate the heat and coerce the cheese into melting a little more quickly. The bread, in contact with the hot pan, toasts at the same rate. To avoid any potential sogginess from steam trapped under the lid, I leave the top off the sandwich, cover the pan until the cheese is melted, then add the top and finish the sandwich as usual, uncovered.

We have an induction range (altho this would work with any type stove), and had bought the 12 inch, which we love. I thought the 10 inch wouldn't be used much, but I'm putting the 12 inch away. These handles are not just super sturdy, they don't get hot sitting on the cook top for a while. It works well even for searing, for a stick free pan. The glass lid is durable, and this pan is reasonably priced for its quality. I highly recommend, and no one compensated me for this review.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not a good first impression. But was happy with the replacement.",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is an update to my original review.After receiving my replacement pan I very carefully looked it over for any damage or flaws and did not see any, initially. However, I can find flaws on anything I look closely at. I did eventually find one, but this little blemish did not bother me like the gouge on the first one I received. There was a minor \"nick\" on the edge of the non-stick at the outer rim of the pan. (see added photos)Let's get the thing that I didn't like out of the way. The lid. I was cooking on a low heat and burned myself when taking the lid off. A different handle would be nice. One that doesn't carry the heat like this one does. Also, there is a pocket between the glass and the rim that will hold liquid. It is a real pain to try and get it clean and dry.Okay, now for the good stuff that I did like. In my testing I tried both an induction cook top as well as a gas stove for my experimenting. I tested for heat distribution, discoloration, slipperiness, flatness and over-all cooking performance. First I just wanted to break in the pan to heat and check how well it boils water on the induction. The boil was rather quick. About 4 minutes from tap water to begin boil at a 320 deg cook top setting. The boil was pretty even and extending to the outer parts of the pan surface pretty well for a medium priced pan. No discoloration that I could see. Of course I wasn't applying a tremendous amount of heat.I rinsed the pan out and wiped it dry. Clean and dry within a few wipes and seconds. Nice. Then I made some taco meat. See the video I added showing a low flame and spread out heat dispersion. I Like it. The pan performed well without any meat sticking or burning. Sliding stuff out of the pan into a container is a challenge. Everything slides to the edge and wants to all come out at the same time. So I needed to get a very wide container and it still wanted to dump all over the counter. I think the sides might be a bit steep in my opinion. After that I rinsed and dried and again, zip-zip, clean and ready for some Chorizo y Juevos. The meat cooked great, just as the ground beef did. Nice and low, even heat. Then I transferred it to a standby skillet so I could wipe the inside and do 8 scrambled eggs. No surprise at this point that the eggs scrambled up nicely for such a large quantity at once.I mixed in the chorizo and then into a container. Yep, again, food dumped on the counter because I did not have much control pouring it out of the pan.I then dunked the mostly cooled pan in a sink of dishwater, wiped it out with a sponge, short rinse and quick dry. All in all a good cooking experience. The pan is a keeper for me as long as it doesn't fail later by losing its surface or having the bottom warp. The base of the pan did discolor slightly from the gas stove but I had expected that and I did get a little scratching from the stove grates, but that's expected too.If you are willing to expect a pan be delivered with some blemishes or even not just \"perfect\", then I would say this pan works well otherwise. Blemishes, lid and pouring lose a star. Other than that I am so far happy with it.Original review...What I expected was a really nice pan in a quality and new condition. I was excited in waiting for it but I was quickly disappointed by what I saw when I took it out of the box.Take a look at the photos I included. There was a very noticeable blemish on the base that I saw almost immediately. When looking closer I saw that it was a gouge of sorts. If you look closely at the zoomed photo you can also see a bunch of other scratches around the gouge as if it were mishandled prior to packaging. There was absolutely no damage to the box it was packaged in. So the only other way it could be this way is if it was produced this way.I cannot even try it and give an honest impression of what it is like to cook in it. I felt the gouge and it is quite apparent that it is going to scratch the cook top surface I would be placing it on. The base is also rather rough feeling aside from this gouge. I expected it to be smooth as satin to the touch from the description in the ad.If the pan is already damaged before I can even have a chance to try it, then what is the point of even moving forward to see what the performance of this skillet is?I'll spend the week to try and contact the manufacturer about this issue and see what they say before boxing it back up and returning it. Not sure if I want to exchange it. The quality issues could be an ongoing thing with this brand. Hopefully they are responsive to my contact attempt.I'm really sorry I had to review it this way. I was really hoping to love this frying pan. But it is what it is and now I need to do something about it, darn it.",

I use the 8\" pan mostly and almost every day (if not several times a day). I try to be easy on it but I'm not always as careful as I should be. I've had it for almost a year and a half and while I've put a couple mild scratches in it, the coating is staying on, it's super easy to clean (99% of the time, I wash by hand). Only very minor complaint is if I run it through the dishwasher, food tends to stick a little more. Hand wash and it is great. Just bought a 2nd small frying pan because having an extra never hurts. Very pleased with its performance.",
