                "reviewText": "We got the white set a few weeks ago and have been testing them since. They are truly the best pans I've ever had. They heat evenly and sear beautifully. The first thing I made in them was marinara sauce, which cleaned up like a dream. I was a little worried because of the red sauce on a white pan, but no issue. I've also made some fried eggs, and they slide around the pan with absolutely no sticking. What a wonderful purchase. I would highly recommend this set. Also, it's kind of weird - They are shipped with the handles detached, so they can ship in smaller boxes, saving resources. The screwdriver they send with it is an actual, good-quality screwdriver. So, you get a set of pans and a good screwdriver for the purchase price. :)",

Great product, really is nonstick, cleans very well and it looks great. They look like expensive pots and pans. Looking forward to changing all my pots to this brand and type.",

                "reviewText": "Our collection of cookware needed a serious upgrade. Neither the wife or I are what you would call kitchen or cookware experts... we cook a lot, but do not find it to be a source of great enjoyment/passion. Nor are we particularly great at it :) That said, I was not super keen to invest in high end cookware that was likely more than we need. I started looking around on Amazon and came across these Sensarte, granite finish pans. I ordered a single skillet in the interest of exploring, based on their slightly retro vibe, solid reviews and low price point. It shipped quickly and performed admirably in addition to being lovely to look at.We then came across the 8 piece set and decided to toss out all the old, burnt out cookware odds and ends we'd been using for a long while. The price point on the set was a major selling point. At this point, we have used them a bit and couldn't be happier... they fit our whole, funky vibe and the price was right. I'm now planning to order a couple of smaller pots/saucepans to round out our inventory.At this point, I can say that:- They feel great in your hand and on the stove. The slightly rubberized handles are quite nice feeling. They are indeed light as advertised.- We start at a low setting and gradually raise the temp as their directions indicate. The heat seems to distribute quite evenly (also as advertised.)- They also clean up quite easily and are also egg-cellent... for making the eggs (see what I did there?)In summation, would definitely recommend for the average household user. Totally possible that someone with more demanding requirements would want to go up a level or 2 higher, but I think we're going to be quite happy with them and you can't beat the price. If they hold up to my heavy handed cooking for the next few months, I'll probably add a star to this review.",
