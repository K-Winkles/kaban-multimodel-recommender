(the right amount of oil can provide a good release for your food.)Cook over medium heat at most. The tri-ply layer steel is heats up faster and low to medium temps are sufficient for everyday cooking. (High heat often causes food to burn and thus stick directly to the bottom of the pan.)Don't move the food too often (build a sear for better release).Start with ingredients at room temperature for more even cooking.Do not heat an empty pan for a long time (to avoid deforming the pan). DAILY CARE For little messes, wipe clean in warm water or use a small amount of vinegar or lemon to wipe.For bigger messes, boil in water and white vinegar for 3-5 minutes, then clean the pan with a rag while it is still hot.Warm water and stain removing powder can easily remove the yellowed areas.Be sure to dry the pan and the bottom of the pan after each use.Avoid detergent residue as it may corrode the surface of the pan.Avoid direct rinsing of hot pans with cold water and rapid temperature changes.Avoid placing strong acids and alkalis food in the pan for a long time.",

I've been looking for quality, stainless steel pans and I've found them with these LOLYKITCH pans.I was impressed by their sleek styling as soon as I opened them. Artistry and styling have never been important to me with cookware; I care about functionality. Getting cool looking pans is just a bonus.The surfaces are very smooth and the curves help with their function. The cooking surface is the right size and flat, but they hold the food inside like than vertical sided pans, but it stays in when I stir. They are user friendly.The bottoms are heavy and flow seamlessly to the sides, which gives them their sleek look. They have a unique construction of aluminum sandwiched between two layer of steel, so they feel heavy, but they heat up very quickly.The finish is polished and smooth. I washed them before using. The instructions are very informative about cleaning, care, use and seasoning. I recommend reading them. I know I learned a bit from them.The glass lid has a steam vent and the handle is bolted on. All the handles are excellent and they don't get too hot while using.I made my taco meat to learn about them and write this review. I used about four ounces more than I normally would for an 11 inch pan, but it cooked it just fine. The instructions recommend no more than medium heat. My stove is a glass top electric and is 1 year old.With my older cookware, I would have turned it to 7, which is medium-high. The scale on my stove is 1-9. With the LOLYKITCH pan, I achieved the same results on a five setting-- and I had a little more meat than usual. It heated up faster, used a lower temperature setting and it retains the heat. Importantly, the heating was even on the whole pan.These are excellent pans.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered the LOLYKITCH 8 and 10-inch tri-ply Stainless Steel fryer pan with a glass lid for the larger pan. I was looking for a replacement for my older Teflon-coated frying pans, and these seemed like a great option since I prefer enamel-coated cast iron for most of my cooking, which isn't well-suited for searing.These pans were the perfect diameter and depth that I was looking for, as I didn't want saute-type pans. Although the pans only come with a lid for the larger pan, I knew that from the description and picture, so it wasn't a problem for me.The pans are an excellent weight, and the handles stay cool as promised, making them extremely comfortable to handle. They also hang out easily. The depth is perfect, and the curve is perfect to maintain both heat and food inside but not make it too cumbersome to pour from when necessary.Due to the great conductivity of stainless steel, these heat up very quickly and evenly; thus, lower heat is needed and may take some getting used to for more novice cooks. I would suspect that those who complain about sticking are actually overheating their pans. I have gotten a great sear on meats, braised, and also made omelets and fried eggs without any issues using these pans.One thing I would take issue with is that while they may be dishwasher safe according to the manufacturer, I wouldn't do that to these pans. I haven't found a need to take any abrasive measures to them to keep them clean, in fact. Overall, they are what I expected.",

                "reviewText": "This is a better set of pan's but only one lid for the larger one. You can use them well for everything which needs a large heat distribution, but should not use them for food what tends to stick to pan's (eggs, veggies). I really wood like to have also a lid for the smaller pan and I don't know why the manufacturer did not offer the set as a complete (2 pan's 2 lid's) one. The pan's are heavier than other, so they will need more time to get hot, but also will hold the heat longer.The ribbon which holds the handle goes through to the other (in)side, not like shown on most of the product page. That is not what I wanted, since this construct is a source of additional effort to clean the pan. On the other hand this construct is more robust and will not brake easily. Also the handle has a slightly different shape, so the product on the page is not matching what you get.Nevertheless it works well with my glass top stove and distributes the heat evenly also to the edge of the pan.",
