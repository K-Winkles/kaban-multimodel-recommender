                "reviewText": "I've been using this pan for a couple of months now, having switched from non-stick pans. I finally got tired of having to replace my non-stick pans after a few months. This pan should last longer than I will, and I have no concerns about teflon getting into my food. Though this pan seems expensive at first, considering it will last decades it becomes a bargain in the long run.Like many reviewers have already said, you have to learn how to season the pan and preheat it before each use. It is certainly more work to own than a non-stick pan, and it has taken some time for me to get used to it. By seasoning and preheating the pan, I've been able to cook eggs without them sticking, which I think is a good test. However some other foods have been sticking a bit, though cleanup is easy. If you are prepared for that, I think this is as good as a stainless steel pan gets, though I admit I have never used All Clad. Preheating this pan takes 5 minutes at medium heat on my stove, and I would not want a heavier pan or it would probably take even longer. I'm not sure how 7 layers is better than 3, but the heat does travel well up the sides of the pan.I'm not sure if the 316Ti is a true benefit or good marketing, but being a bit of a science geek, I dug into it a little and it seems like this is the highest quality, most corrosion resistant stainless steel available, the kind they use for medical implants. The weight is good, and the handle is comfortable and stays cool except for the inch or so next to the pan rim, which is not where your hand goes. There has been no warping whatsoever. Given the price difference, for my money I would opt for these over All Clad. I wish they sold an 8 inch pan with the 316Ti as an individual item (you can get it in a set).",

So this company gives you as much or more for a significant discount. I\u2019ve been using it for the last week and the results are fantastic. 316 ti bonded steel cooking surface is likely hype rather than functional. It\u2019s supposed to maintain its integrity longer. I doubt it. But it\u2019s there. What I\u2019ve noticed is these take slightly longer to heat up and hold that heat evenly throughout. That\u2019s a biggie. It\u2019s likely due to the thickness of 5 ply construction. You\u2019re less likely to get burn spots and thus clean up is easier. The handles are a bit rounded which I\u2019m not a fan of but no problems thus far. This is a major major major go. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Two reasons for four stars rather than five. Actually, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. Compared to All Clad or even Cuisinart Multiclad Pro, this pan is much lighter in weight. While my wrists appreciate that, it tells me the 7-ply claim is somewhat of a gimmick and if there are actually that many true layers they are laughably thin. I also take away for the fact that I do not love the handle on this pan. It is short, fat, and rounded. This pan could be unwieldy and would likely turn in the hand were it not so lightweight.The good points are the lighter weight is easy to handle for my poor arthritic hands and wrists, even without a helper handle, so maybe that\u2019s not a true negative and I have just come to expect quality metal pans to be quite heavy. The pan heats very quickly, almost two quickly, so have your food prepped and ready to go. I\u2019ve gotten beautiful sears on steaks with nice release. The pan cleans up easily. An included cover would have been nice, but I am using one from my huge everyday or casserole pan. Overall, I would say the pan works well at a reasonable price point.**Update as of 8/18/20. I am still pleased with the performance of this pan. I see a number of negative reviews about warping, and I have to say I don't know what they are doing to their pans, but mine is still in pristine condition after more than two years use. BTW, if one feels the need to get a pan screaming red hot (no reason to do so, even for a good sear), use cast iron for that; that said, even cast iron could crack from such abuse.",

This pan is not non-stick, but the titanium cook surface cleans up nicely.I use this pan for searing, in conjunction with another pan for low and slow. So far I have had no issues, and will continue to use this pan. It is a simple pan, but it should last decades.",
