                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars BEST Non-Stick Pans this Home Chef has ever owned",
                "reviewText": "I have been a \"home chef\" for 30 years now. No I am not a professional but I have been called a \"food snob\" by more than one person including long-time close friends. So when I say something is the \"best\" I've experienced, it is after careful consideration.Over the years I've probably owned well more than a dozen different pans of various sizes. All of these pans were a different brand. None of them ever performed satisfactorily for me so I always replaced the previous pans with a different brand. The best of them lasted a couple of years and probably because I was too cheap in the moment to go buy another. None of those pans had a non-stick surface that lasted long.Non stick pans are different from cast iron or stainless steel in obvious ways to most. The thing is I find that many of us still treat them the same. Mostly that we expose them to High heat. You can't do that with non-stick pans if you want them to last. Even worse is exposing it to high heat then immediately rinsing or imersing the pan in cold water. The non-stick coating will break down and lose its non-stick properties and that surface eventually will start to peel/flake-off. A sure sign that your pan has lost it's non-stick properties will be that it won't come clean from a simple wipe of a paper towel or damp sponge. At that point you may as well throw that pan away.Another issue with the non-stick pans I have used over the years is that the the coating is teflon and it has been said to be toxic when exposed to high temperatures by more than one published study. To be fair table salt is toxic to humans in high quantities but I don't seen anyone willingly putting teflon on their food. Unfortunately, once teflon coated cookware has been exposed to high enough temperatures for it to break down, your food is likely being contaminated by it. This is in addition to the fumes it creates at those high temperatures.This Green Pan is not coated with Teflon but Ceramic. It is free of all of the toxic man-made chemicals that are typically found in mass manufactured items as well. This is a huge boon if you are someone like me who strives for healthy cooking in every way. Healthy cooking doesn't apply just to the food you eat but also the way it is prepared. That includes the tools and equipment used in that preparation.Many pans do not heat evenly in my exerience. I would even say that most in my experience did not. Unfortunately, many don't realize this until after using a pan that does. It is one of the reasons why I will choose a stainless steel or cast iron pan for a chosen dish though a non-stick pan might be a better choice. These GreenPan Chathams have the most even heat distribution I have ever seen in a non-stick pan. Foods simply cook better.As mentioned above, having issues cleaning a non-stick pan should be a red flag. If you don't expose these pans to prolonged high heat and allow them to cool down before cleaning and use an adequate amount of butter or cooking oil, it is very feasible it will simply wipe clean with a dry paper towel. Most times this is all I do. If I do need more than that, I only use a damp sponge (soft side only) and a little soap with warm water. You should never have to do more than that with this pan. If you do then you are probably cooking at a temperature that is too high and/or for too long and/or inadequate cooking oil. That would say a lot for this pan because it will take temperatures higher than non-stick pans I have used in the past.If you want a high quality non-stick pan, I really can't say enough about these pans. As long as you treat them right they should perform and last for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot speak more highly of this pan set. It\u2019s actually ridiculous how many pots and pans I\u2019ve tried over the years - gave up on ever having a full set that I liked and decided to minimize to just two Our Place brand pot/pans a couple of years ago. With a growing family, they just didn\u2019t cut it anymore and I was growing to hate cooking anything without a proper set. First trialed a tiny little egg pan from this company and quickly fell in love with it. I was hesitant that the full set would have the same quality but am pleasantly surprised to say they do! They\u2019re truly non-stick and I feel good about using cookware that is safe and healthy to cook meals for my family without worrying about metals or toxic ingredients. They wash so well and are lightweight enough to be stored conveniently on a wall hung rack, plus are nice looking to keep out! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I've had these pans over 2 years now. The smaller ones still look like new. I notice that the pans work like a charm when using butter, but I've used Olive and Avocado oil and things stick like a mofo. I heat the pan up first, add butter, then add my ingredients almost immediately. I'm looking at another pan for oil cooking. If you want one pan for both oil and butter cooking, this isn't your pan. If there's an oil that works in these pans, someone please share :).I bought the mini 1 year ago, and it worked so well that when I needed to replace larger teflon pans for healthier cooking, I bought this same brand in this 8\"/10\" set, and the 12\". I have now had the mini for 1 year and the rest for 8 mos. They look just as good as when I bought them. I have cooked some stuff and gotten gunk/burnt bits in them, but I let them cool, then soak in soapy water, then they cleaned like a charm. I even used the large one for bacon while camping and thought it was ruined...nope, cleaned nicely. I do try and clean them soon after cooking, but they have also sat all night. What I did notice that works best is to let the pan get appropriately hot first, then put in my fat (oil or butter) as needed, give it about 20 sec, and it works every time. I did not get these pans as part of a review, I bought them after quite a bit of research and use them on an electric glass-top stove.",
