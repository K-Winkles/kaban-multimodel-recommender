                "reviewText": "I got a greenpan pot over a year ago and I love it & use it all the time! I\u2019m so glad I bought these 2 new additions - it\u2019s perfect to have a couple smaller options instead of one semi-large pot to cook in. We have used them probably a dozen times so far and washed them in the dishwasher & they are holding up beautifully! Much better than the older model original version pan I have. These heat up really fast & evenly, easy to clean & look great. I highly recommend!!!",
