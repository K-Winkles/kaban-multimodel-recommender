Even before reading reviews, I ordered and glad I did. I understand all the rave reviews.I like it doesn't have a Teflon coating, so it won't have coating peeling issues like aluminum or ceramic cookware does after months or even years. That is why I had to get rid of several pans, so hoping this one last for years as it is a great pan and my new favorite.It is a very well-made stainless-steel pan. The nonstick provides a nice, easy way to cook without food sticking.Cleaning the pan is so easy, as I usually try and wash pans by hand. I used a sponge, some water read some use little cooking oil so going to try that for now on to keep the pan non-stick and rust-proof.",

                "reviewText": "The 9.5 inch frying pan comes packaged well in a nice box, but unfortunately there are no detailed use or cleaning instructions included. For this we need to come back to the Amazon site to learn that it is e.g. 500F oven safe and dishwasher safe. Build quality is great with a nice polish and a sturdy riveted handle. While the main hexagonal pattern seems to be a hexclad copy, there are other ornamental features that are actually prettier.It is listed as compatible with all modern cooktops (gas, electric, inductions, etc.) but I was only able to test it on gas, where it worked very well. I tested it for a week with several different foods (fried eggs, stir-fry, fried rice, etc.) and it worked great, heated evenly, and was always easy to clean. Even the bottom side directly exposed to the gas flames still looks like new. This pan will last a long time!Compared to my other frying pans, the bottom corners are very rounded, making it almost \"wok like\". This is an advantage under most use cases, but limits the number of eggs that can be fried at once. For that we are probably limited to the flat part. No big deal.Overall, this is my new favorite frying pan!",

                "reviewText": "This pan is sturdy, very solid, and has a nice think well-fastened handle. The non-stick surface is a series of hexagons and is kind of bumpy but does work. It is easy to clean. It works well on my induction stove. However, there is one major problem. Instead of a 9-inch flat surface for cooking, it is only about 6 inches across then rises up the sides like a bowl. Cooking in it is more like a wok and would d work well for stir frying. Things like a larger piece of meat, strips of bacon, or a large omelet are impossible to cook correctly. I cannot recommend this unless you really would like a bowl shaped fry pan.",
