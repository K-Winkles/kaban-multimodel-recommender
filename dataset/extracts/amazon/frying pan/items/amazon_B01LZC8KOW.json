While cooking, nothing sticks to the pan. I mean if there is, it's very very minimal and when cleaning this pan, anything left behind will wipe right off with no effort what so ever. This pan is light weight. That was one thing I notice when I purchase pans. The weight of the pan and this one is not heavy what so ever, even though looking at it, you might think it's heavy.The lid has a nice and good seal on it. That too is light weight. Not to mention the eco-friendly materials were used to produce this pan. Huge plus for us. You will enjoy a cool-touch silicone handle. I can't tell you how many times I have burned my hand when I needed to quickly grab a pan. With this pan, you will not have to worry about that.Seller gives a 1-Year Warranty, which means they stand behind their products. These pans are definitely premium and we can not wait until they come out with more sizes. I'm going to try to hold out on buying pans until Summer, when they should have new sizes.\u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f PROS:east to cleanlight weightsturdyhigh quality1-Year Warranty\ud83d\udc94 CONS:i don't see any cons with this pan what so ever",

I was super scared to use it the first time. I'm always burning myself, and I have a problem with dropping stuff sometimes. I wondered how that little piece of rubber was gonna save my fingers. It indeed did just need to pay attention to my knuckles when I let go of it, not the company's fault by any means! Sometimes I just use a pot holder and sit it upside down with it while I'm fixing the pot. It does get hot if you plan on holding it for a long time and you had the heat up. Thats anything really. There are more on her Christmas list this year. Last year the brand was a surprise this year she knows exactly what she's getting! Awesome pans!",

                "reviewText": "I received this piece December 30, and have already used it several times over the weekend. I am very much in love with this pan already! First, the pan is beautiful and the lid has a very contemporary look. Second, the pan is light weight, but seems to be very sturdy and appears to be well constructed. Most importantly, the food comes out of the pan so easy! Just in the last 3 days I have cooked sausage patties, fried eggs, seared meat, and sauteed veggies. The pan is light enough to comfortably flip food, and the non stick allowed the eggs to glide right out of the pan with out the use of oils. The pan heats up quick and cooks evenly. When I seared the meat, I noticed I was getting the crust on the meat and the brown bits in the pan. If I were to have deglazed, the good stuff would have been there (unlike a teflon). In this case it wiped out like a dream!!The lid that comes with the pan is also a nice part of this pan. The lip seats well and can also be used in the oven.Clean up was a breeze! I wiped out the pan and it is ready to go again! This was like my well seasoned cast iron pans, but so much more light weight!I am pretty sure I am going to love this pan!",

                "reviewText": "6 Month Update - Let down.After using this pan for 6 months, I've found it to lack almost all of the non stick qualities it had when I received it. I have hand washed with soft sponge only since having this pan. Eggs now stick every time, unless I use scads of olive oil in the pan, which for me defeats the purpose of non-stick, healthier eating. For the money, I'd say not worth it. Hoping this is a defect. Will attempt to make contact with the company about their 1 year warranty. Maybe this pan is the exception. Would love to try another.____Original Post:Solid product. Lives up to its claims....so far. I'd like to do a 6 month/12 month check in to see how the ceramic is holding up. This has always been the biggest point of failure for all \"non-stick\" pans that I use.Works exactly as advertised. Easy to cook with. Non-stick ceramic is a breeze to clean. This is used almost daily for meal prep. The lid works well. I was worried a \"U\" shaped handle wouldn't feel sturdy - I was wrong; it's very sturdy. Silicone outer edge was a nice touch. I would love to see this in a >= 12\" pan, but I was willing to make the sacrifice since it seemed like the best option out there. If I was really being picky, I would love to see a bit more metal in the bottom of the pan...to help even out temperatures and keep it from cooling down too much as I add items in to cook. I hope this company continues to make more products like this!",

                "reviewText": "I have the 11\" & 9 1/2\" versions of this pan. This pan is a truly non-stick pan. It is amazing. I have cooked cheese, super low fat ground beef, as well as other items that generally stick to pans and not only do they not stick to this one, but clean up is a breeze. Cooking is even. I used my larger pan for a difficult stir fry dish that usually burns in other pans and I had no trouble, because the heat is evenly distributed with this pan. The handles do not get too hot. These look good too. These are a bit pricier than other non-stick pans, but you won't be replacing them a year later. So worth it! If you like to cook and want a non-stick pan, this is the one to get. Also, they aren't too heavy.",
