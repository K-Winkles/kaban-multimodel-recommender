Right size, very little cleaning, fast, even cooking, no-oil or butter, whether it is scrambled egg or sunny-side up, or whatever. However, if you want to make anything bigger, even a one-egg omlette, then this is too small. Also needs a smaller spatula, which makes this toy-size pan an easy-to-pack item when traveling, if needed, for a quick breakfast.",

It is non-stick, but I found that you really need some non-stick oil to keep an egg from hanging on pretty tightly to the surface. Well built, extremely light and cooks pretty (but not perfectly) evenly.I am very glad I bought it - and it fits a Pyrex lid I already had.",
