HOWEVER, this aluminum grill plate has a non-stick surface that makes cleaning a breeze PLUS I don't need to worry about seasoning the surface or rust. No \"hot-spots\" since the plate conducts heat evenly, and it allows me to char the steak's surface quickly for \"black and blue\", char-rare, or blackened Cajun Style. I'll get several more for my RV and for Christmas gifts! Well worth the price!",
