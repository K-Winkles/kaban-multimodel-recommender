                "reviewText": "These pans are complete garbage and should be in the garbage can. I ordered these T-Fal frying pans because of their reputation for making good quality and I have one of their frying pans from over 10 years ago when they still had decent quality. These pans are flimsy and thin and have the weight and feel of cheap Chinese made junk from your local dollar store.Their new generation of these pans are a big disappointment. They were initially non stick the first 3 or 4 times then after that food started to stick and cleanup was not so easy. The handles on both of them started to come loose after only 2 weeks.This can be quite dangerous because when the handles get too loose the pan can flip upside down spilling hot food, cooking oil or grease all over someone causing severe burns or a fire. I have read some of these complaints on line and of a kitchen stove that was destroyed in a fire because of a loose handle.I tried to tighten up the handles with the screw under the handle and it is not a screw head that fits any kind of screwdriver that the average person would have. Its not a Phillips head or flat screw, just a weird kind of screw head I have never seen. I called T-Fal and they were no help at all except to say send it back ,, and I would have to pay shipping. The least they could do is email a shipping label .The pans are going back to Amazon for a refund. It is wishful thinking in many cases to expect good quality to come out of China. These pans were obviously made of substandard quality materials and I am not sure I even trust the claim by T-Fal that they are actually PTFE-PFOA Cadmium free.I guess you get what you pay for. Nothing good is cheap and nothing cheap is good. I will have to maybe spend double the money to get something of better quality.",

                "reviewText": "I intentionally waited a few months after buying these to see how they stood up- and they've done pretty well. I cook 3-4 times a day with each of these pans so they get very heavy usage, and I did properly \"season them\" every few weeks as recommended. With that said, here's my review-The Pros- Of all the pans I have in my kitchen, I enjoy cooking with these the most. They're mostly non-stick as advertised and it's easier to clean a bright white pan because you can clearly see everything. They also cook evenly so that's a big plus.The Cons- After about 6-8 weeks of heavy use (which would be the average person's six months), I'll have a dark residue left over in the pan that does not seem to wash out. It's almost like the olive oil penetrated the outer layers of the ceramic? Maybe, I don't know. But once that started a few days ago, these pans turn black immediately after adding heat to them and any oil/butter/base. Food easily sticks as well.Overall- At first I loved these pans and I really hoped that the negative reviewers just didn't take care of their cookware as instructed. I did everything right though and they now stick every time, so I'm pretty disappointed. I am going to order another set of ceramic pans but it will not be this brand...I'm crossing my fingers that I have better luck next time.However, I have cooked close to 150 meals in each of these pans and for the price- it's really hard to complain. As I said earlier, I cook 3-4 meals per day as a work from home dad and these pans were wonderful at the start. If I would have seasoned them weekly then they may still be perfect, so it's hard to complain about $17 for this mini-set. For the occasional cook, they'll last you years if you take care of them and that's a great bargain.One final thought- I always wash my pans 3-5 minutes after coming off the burner, and my sticking problem started when my wife left these sitting dirty overnight. So take my 3-star review with a grain of salt if you're a clean-a-phobe like me and take care of your stuff...I think these will do just fine for you as long as you season them regularly.",

                "reviewText": "I waited a month to do a review. I really like this cookware. I was skeptical because of pricing. I followed instructions before 1st use and oiled down the pans. I have never cooked on high with these and have never had an issue with food sticking. Most of the time to clean I wipe them out with a paper towel and put them away. If I have to wash with dish detergent or have cooked with acidic foods, I will wash then reapply a little oil before putting away. I have never put in the dishwasher as that is just too much for most skillets anyways. However, I do have 1 complaint. The paint on the bottom started chipping away after the 1st use on both pans. I have a new glass top stove, so I know I wasn't rough on it as I was not scooting the pan around. It does not affect the cooking, but it should have stayed on longer!",

Llegaron en excelente estado, y lo primero que hice fue curarlos con aceite de oliva. Desde el primer d\u00eda no se les pega absolutamente nada, OBVIAMENTE S\u00cd les tienes que poner algo de aceite, en mi caso use aceite de canola en aerosol. He preparado huevos, prote\u00edna como el pescado del video, carne \ud83e\udd69, pechugas de pollo y como ver\u00e1n no se les pega nada, NADA. Los lavo todos los d\u00edas con la ESPONJA amarilla de la marca Scotch Brite y detergente l\u00edquido. Repito: NO SE LE PEGA NADA siempre y cuando a\u00f1adas poco aceite en aerosol en todo el sart\u00e9n y permitas que se caliente lo suficiente. Buena compra y muy buen producto para cocinar DIARIO. El chiste es aprender a usarlo y lavarlo sin rayar nada.",
