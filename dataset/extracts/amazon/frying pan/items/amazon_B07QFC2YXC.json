                "reviewText": "This review is for the 10\" full body tri-ply pan and lid.First off, this is a stainless steel frying pan. It acts like other stainless steel frying pans. If you don't know what temperatures to use it at with your oil of choice and run it too hot, the oil will undergo polymerization and will become a brownish layer. As with most such things when dealing with stainless steel or cast iron, it may be fixed fairly painlessly. Oven cleaner and barkeepers friend will safely guide you back to like new appearance. As with cast iron, some chefs will purposely build up this polymerized layer of oil since it acts as seasoning much as with cast iron cookware. This is unlike nonstick coatings which will degrade and begin flaking over time. My 85 year old mother managed to wear out a stainless steel frying pan with 60 years of use but most likely you won't. This contrasts with non-stick cookware which needs to be periodically replaced.First impressions. The pan arrived apparently missing the use and care pamphlet. Or I missed it in the packaging. What emerged from the packaging was a gorgeous pan. It has a lovely mirror polish exterior and a somewhat matte interior. Heft in my hand was fantastic. Solid, and plainly durable though lighter than might be expected due to the aluminum. The lid fit nicely, tight enough to do its job.So, how does this work? My previous experience with stainless was with solid stainless steel. Heating times were longer than with lighter pans which is to be expected. Even while heated, the glass lid seemed to function well to keep the heat contained. The surface of the glass maintained a lower temperature than the pan. The handle remained cool even with half hour cook times.My first experiment was, of course, an omlette, exactly what shouldn't be done. I made sure to melt some cheese on to the pans surface along with sticking some eggs on. The pan cleaned well for a stainless, a few minutes soak in some water and a scrub with Scotch-Brite scrubbing sponge and it was good as new. I next made a cheesesteak in the pan with lots of molten American cheese. Once again, a little soaking plus a scrub sponge and it was good as new. I've been using it at every opportunity now for 2 weeks trying to vary the use from in oven fritattas to searing meats. The surface is getting somewhat cloudy now but nothing that wouldn't disappear immediately with some barkeepers friend.My purpose in ordering this pan was to evaluate it. I currently have anodized non-stick pans which are not compatible with the induction cook top that I plan on upgrading to. I wanted to see if this line was suitable to be the replacement for my current pans. What attracted me to this lineup was the solid reviews and the inclusion of lids for the 8 and 10 inch frying pans. Frying pans are the work horses for me and lids are important. After evaluating this pan, I am sold and will be making further purchases.",

                "reviewText": "Quality, price and use - fabulous!I purchased the Avacraft pot with side pour perforated spout and clear lid and loved it!I cook 2 to 3 times A DAY , very heavy use of cookware. I own pieces of T-fal ltd. (love but chachachiiiing!) , a Weaverware fry pan ( I do not recommend! ) and other various Brand Name stainless steel cookware I just can't recommend due to price or other issues.I needed replacements for the everyday \"recommended\" ceramic cookware I purchased a year ago that did not hold up. I did not want to spent $200+ dollars on one pan, or purchase something I'd have to replace next year. I googled tons of info and purchased one Avacraft pot first to test. I am super happy with this cookware!**If a cook is not familiar with cooking on stainless steel I would highly recommend googling info on stainless cookware use.**Most of the 1 and 2 star reviews I see are because the cook wasn't familiar with stainless steel use.The 3 items I purchased separately, a pot, pan and wok style multi purpose pot, are all NONSTICK when heated on med-low first then food is added. I have made omelets, soups and pasta sauce (acidic). Easy to clean. Stay cool handles. If heat/food \"discolor\" pan rub with vinager. I do not put pans or knives in dishwasher but these are dishwasher safe. I did make a frittata in the oven and it came out perfect, it did not stick. *Use cookware correctly. Heat first THEN add food.* Light weight. Easy clean up. See thru lids (love!!!) Stay cool handles ( I'll mention it again because lesson learned). A level base which sat flat on gas cook top even after multiple uses, no warping. Even heat distribution, no obvious hot spots . My gas range does not distribute gas evenly so a pans ability to distribute heat is important to me. I compared my Avacraft sauce pan(pot) to my Tfal sauce pan (pot) and it was very similar in heat distribution when comparing bubbles/temp distribution with a thermometer in clear water.Cooked well on low simmer for extended time without over heating as some cookware does. It kept an even temperature and did not continue to absorb heat and and over heat then scorch sauce on low temp, fabulous benefit! Yes, I've had pans that did that. I liked the 1st pot I ordered so much I purchased a fry pan with lid, and later the multi-use wok style pot. I recommend this brand for multi-use, ease of use, quality and price. Lightweight, cool handles, oven safe (350' was my experience), even heat distribution, dishwasher safe and for a quality vs. price, totally worth it!!!",

Love the quality, depth of the pan, great lid, no hot pad needed for either handle, and the ease of cleaning it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, quality pan for the most part. Looks good, is weighty, feels good in your hand and cooks well. I've used it twice now. Cooked four over easy eggs, and tonight made two pork chops. I let the pan warm up, added my EVOO and let it come to temperature before adding food to the pan. The food cooks nicely and does not stick. It's easy to control the pan temperature because it has the heavy 3 ply bottom. The lid fits well. I see only one flaw that I assume is a manufacturing flaw (not a design flaw) that could possibly be remedied. The bottom of the inside of the pan has a slightly raised center. I was a little disappointed when I noticed that upon putting my eggs in the pan but honestly it didn't effect the outcome as much as I thought it might and of course was not a factor when cooking the chops. I would definitely recommend you give this pan a try. I think it's a really nice, quality pan for the price. I wanted a second pan this size ,with a lid, that did not have a non-stick coating. They are not easy to find, especially one of any quality.",

Then I tried a squirt of Dawn dishwasher detergent and a cap of pickling vinegar 7% and cleaned with a soft dishcloth and rinsed in hot water. The pan came out sparkling clean just like first day it was new. I absolutely love this pan now because it works well on my glass cooktop. Now that I know how to clean it, that just adds to the love.",
