I always use silicone and non metal utensils when using any of my pots and pans. It has a bad scratch on it and honestly no idea where. I have re-seasoned it as the instructions said that came with it, it helps for one or two uses. I've cleaned it per the recommended way.Depending on where you read, it says to use spray if it starts cooking, yet other sites on the gotham preach not to use spray. So it can get confusing. Overall, still a good skillet. You do get a phenomenal deal within the box when you order to get pot pan or a smaller skillet for great price. That kind of evens it out and makes them worth it overall. Still a gorgeous skillet.I got the hammered skillet. It\u2019s a beautiful skillet. Use it almost every day since I\u2019ve received it and it\u2019s performed flawlessly. I was they type that used high heat all the time and cooking sprays. So far medium heat and no sprays is working out great. Time will tell. So far so good.",

                "reviewText": "I coat the pan with olive oil, put chicken, turkey, etc in the pan, surround it with root vegetables, and then bake them in the oven. When the meat is done, I set it aside in a warming dish. I boil down the meat juices on the stove burner and then brown the veggies. That's where the non-stick coating comes in handy. It's a very tasty and complete meal that will feed 3-4 people. It's very simple to make. The pan has the depth to accommodate a whole chicken or half a turkey.",

Medium heat only and get the food in before it heats up much. As someone had mentioned it humps up in the middle when it heats up. Probably because of the dissimilar metals built into it. My last non stick (started sticking after about a year) always cooked flat and didn't hump up. But then thinking about it all my bacon grease flows to the outer edge so maybe it's a good thing. The hammered copper looks cool but someone said it's paint after it started coming off in the wash. Whatever. It is what it is.",
