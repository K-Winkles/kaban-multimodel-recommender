                "reviewText": "I have other cookware in this series and I found that when cleaned carefully (hand wash only with gentle sponges) the non-stick qualities last a very long time, so far more than a year with daily use and still going strong.This pan has fairly good heat distribution despite being relatively lightweight. I use it for bacon and it cleans right up with just a few wipes of a paper towel. The bottom of the pan is slightly domed so liquid tends to run from the center.",
