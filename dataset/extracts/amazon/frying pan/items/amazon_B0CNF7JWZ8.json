The nonstick surface lives up to its promise, ensuring that eggs slide effortlessly onto the plate without any sticking, and making cleanup a breeze. The included lid is a fantastic addition, as it helps to trap heat and steam, allowing for even cooking and perfectly fluffy omelettes. I also found it incredibly useful for melting cheese on top of eggs or for creating perfectly round mini pancakes. The pan's construction is solid and durable, and it works seamlessly on gas and electric stovetops, providing consistent heat distribution for precise and efficient cooking. The compact size makes it easy to store, and the handle remains cool to the touch, ensuring safe and comfortable handling.",

                "reviewText": "Having a bunch of chickens we make a LOT of eggs and egg sandwiches. As such we have tried many \u201cegg pans\u201d and so far this one is very much meeting expectations. Feels good quality actually a lot lighter than I thought. It was very easy to assemble.-The handles are not metal so pretty much cool touch.-The pan itself is about half as thick as our normal pans. This may lead to warping later but hopefully not.-The bottom is raised on the outside in the egg spots so it sits directly on the burner.-Heat dissipation is really good, everything cooked evenly.So far it is extremely non-stick and releases the eggs perfectly. For the price this thing is amazing!",
