                "reviewText": "This is a fantasic, non-stick pan!I don't know WHY the review asks if this is lightweight because well-made chef's pans should be heavy to distribute heat and prevent burning. This pan is NOT lightweight. It's heavy enough to distribute heat well. I've cooked eggs, carbonara, and sauteed in it, with no burning! It wipes clean. So far, no scratches or dings; it's holding up well.The sides of the pan are straight, not rounded, so it will not work well for crepes or omelets.I wish I had this pan in several sizes!",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a good pan. It\u2019s not my favorite pan but it\u2019s good. It has a decent weight to it, not too heavy and not too light. The non stick is great. In my pic I have potatoes, onions, shrimp and cheese and didn\u2019t use any butter. Nothing stuck to the pan. My meal slid right into the dish. Also, the heat distribution is quite uniform which is nice. The only reason I took off 1 star is because of the handle. It\u2019s a solid handle which doesn\u2019t heat up. I just wish it felt a bit more rounded in my hand.Oh, last but not least, this washed up great on the bottom rack of the dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "This frying pan has quickly become my go-to pan for most things I cook. I haven\u2019t had it very long, but I have cooked a variety of foods in it already, and I am impressed with the pan. The food cooks uniformly\u2026.Even if I\u2019m using a small burner, it doesn\u2019t have hot spots like some pans. It really is non-stick and requires only a small amount of butter or oil for cooking. I have done stir fry, fried pork chops, gravy, omelette, pancakes, hash browns, and more. It seems to need a little higher heat on my stove, and a little more preheating time, which hasn\u2019t caused any smoking or burning from butter or oil, like with some pans. The handle is aluminum, but doesn\u2019t get too hot. The size is great for me, and the depth is good. I like that it can be used in the oven too. I didn\u2019t find any instructions with it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to need anything special. It\u2019s supposed to be dishwasher safe, but I wash my pans by hand, and this one is very very easy to clean. I\u2019m very satisfied with this pan and am sure it will be used a lot. It was a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "The pan comes nicely packed in an easy to wrap box, so I think gift idea when I come across such packaging. But that's not what we are here to talk about.The pan has a nice flat bottom with a bit of an angle bevel where it slopes up the sides. This flat bottom works great for sausages or steaks where you might want to put a meat weight on. Generally those are around 8 inches, so they will fit the pan perfectly to get sensational sears.The handle is attached with rivets and is secure in place. It rises slightly and has a wrap under which makes for a comfortable feel in my hand. I did not notice the handle becoming hot while cooking.For me, I like smaller frying pans like this for eggs, more specifically omelets. They are the perfect size.I use gas stove primarily and also have a standard electric cooktop which sits countertop and I can move it around. I do not have an induction cooktop so I can't attest to how it performs for that. For gas and conventional electric the pan performs as expected.The non stick surface didn't need any seasoning or pre treatment use. I do use oils and butters to cook and for their thermal transmission qualities, but I was able to use them sparingly with this pan and have excellent release results.",
