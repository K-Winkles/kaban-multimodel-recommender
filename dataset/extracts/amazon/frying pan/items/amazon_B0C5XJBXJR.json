                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the imarku Non Stick Frying Pans - 8 inch & 10 inch Frying Pan Nonstick Set, Honeycomb Lock Oil Cast Iron Skillets, and I am delighted to share my thoughts on these kitchen essentials. Placing my order on July 24, 2023, I received the pans on July 27, 2023, and my culinary experience has been elevated ever since.First and foremost, the packaging of the imarku frying pans exudes elegance and quality. Upon unboxing, I was immediately impressed with the beautiful design and attention to detail. The pans themselves are visually appealing and emit a sense of high-end craftsmanship.In terms of performance, these pans deliver remarkable results. The even and consistent cooking they offer is truly impressive. From searing to saut\u00e9ing, the imarku pans excel in providing flawless heat distribution, ensuring that my dishes turn out perfectly every time. Moreover, the two different sizes - 8 inches and 10 inches - cater perfectly to my various cooking needs, allowing me to prepare meals with ease.One feature that stood out to me is the ingenious honeycomb lock oil coating. It not only enhances the non-stick properties but also ensures that the pans require minimal oil for cooking, promoting healthier culinary practices. The non-stick surface is truly exceptional, allowing food to effortlessly glide across the pan without any residue left behind. My morning eggs, in particular, have become a delight to cook as they slide effortlessly onto the plate.The thoughtful design of the pans extends to the convenient handles, which are easy to add and remove as needed. I particularly appreciate the pans' oven-safe feature, providing versatility for preparing a variety of recipes. The pans strike the perfect balance between sturdiness and manageability, as they possess a satisfying weight without being as heavy as traditional cast iron pans.The smaller 8-inch pan has quickly become my go-to choice for everyday use, especially for individual servings or breakfast items. Its compact size and excellent performance have made it an essential tool in my kitchen arsenal.In conclusion, the imarku Non Stick Frying Pans have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Their exceptional quality, outstanding non-stick properties, and thoughtful design have elevated my cooking experience to new heights. These pans are not only functional and versatile but also aesthetically pleasing, adding a touch of sophistication to my kitchen. I highly recommend the imarku Non Stick Frying Pans to anyone in search of reliable, high-performance cookware that effortlessly brings out the best in their culinary creations.",

                "reviewText": "I picked up this set of pans to replace my worn out non-stick pans. I've owned an iMarku santoku knife for a few years and consider it my favorite knife. These pans advertise cast iron performance without the worries about maintenance, they're dishwasher safe and non-stick but heat evenly and sear well. I didn't quite know what to expect but have been very impressed using them over the past few weeks.The pans are very heavy, and the wooden handles come unattached and require a bolt (with an eye for hanging the pan) to be screwed in. I hang my pans and wasn't entirely clear on how the handles attach, so I had wondered what to expect, but the long bolt has no problem hanging with my other pans. It's relatively easy to screw and unscrew the bolt, which is important because you'll need to remove the real wood handle prior to putting the pan in the dishwasher (or not, but the wood will wear out).I've primarily been using the 10\" to replace the pan that was worn out, and I've found that the results are closer to what I expect from a cast iron pan than the usual aluminum or copper-bottom pans I've had for years. Potatoes crisp up well, eggs benefit from the even heat distribution and cooking down onions or peppers hasn't caused any issues with sticking. I found the 8\" to be slightly smaller than expected, but perfect for eggs. Given my experience with the knife and the quality and heft of these pans, I expect these to last for many years.",

                "reviewText": "been looking for a true non stick pan that cooks even and not bow in middle 1st time in use . make this clear I never use over medium heat , no need too. I read and done what they said before cooking . this is cast iron coated , just a tad heavy but good long removeable wood handles ( great for storing ) . 1st I toasted cheese bread with just a little clarified butter come out nice and brown and even cooked . I wiped pan out and then cooked cheese straight in pan no oil or anything and it slid right out with just a nice brown cook as you can see and then I cooked a egg with no oil or butter same way and same results slid right out of pan . I don't normally leave a lot of reviews but if it is worth it I will good or bad . These will last a long time for money and got a 8 inch and a 10 inch for 70 dollars . Very very very easy clean upI am just a old fart who loves to cook , I DO NOT GET PAID TO WRITE THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but as working people most of us can not afford 200 dollar pans that can be a market gimmick best of luck",

                "reviewText": "We've tried all kinds of pans. Husband is hard on them. Think these will last a long time and he loves them too. Did have an issue with one handle, it wasn't honed properly on the small pan and wouldn't attach no matter how hard we tried. Contacted the company for a new handle asking if I should return the whole set or if they would send a new handle. They replied with the same options I asked them about. So, I exchanged them. The new set handles worked fine. They are heavier than the normal frying pans. They heat up well and evenly. Nothing is sticking after using them for a couple weeks. I did prime them according to the directions. Hope this helps.",

Great for everyday use to make different stuff easily. The non stick makes it more easy for cleaning. The best part is it need a very few amount of oil for cooking.",
