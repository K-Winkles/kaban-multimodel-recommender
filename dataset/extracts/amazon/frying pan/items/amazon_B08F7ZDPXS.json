                "reviewText": "I pay attention to build quality on products I buy, and this pan is off the charts excellent! I like that I can use metal utensils, it's dishwasher safe, and oven safe up to a 600-degree broiler. Honestly though, I usually hand wash the skillet, which takes no more than 30\u201360 seconds. Heat distribution seems very even. My only knock, if you can even call it that, is that the non-stick surface is so slick that I have to chase my eggs around the pan with my spatula in order to flip them. I'll take that any day! I would definitely buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE THIS PAN! I was skeptical that it would work on my induction cooktop despite other reviewers saying it does. I have a 10-inch blue diamond pan that does not work with induction.I compared the symbols underneath both pans and this 8-inch pan has the \"coil\" symbol in addition to other cooking symbols that my old 10-inch pan has. I noticed it working so well with induction that I set the power level at 2.5 instead of 3.0 to cook an egg in a couple drops of olive oil to make an egg-muffin. The pan is heavy enough to sit level even when empty. When I remove the egg from the pan, the pan looks clean.I think other reviewers saying the pan burns, are just using too much heat or cooking for too long. This little pan cooks faster than the small cast-iron pan I was using. It looks good, cooks efficiently and saves energy.",

Also the finish is starting to come off in the bigger pan and food sticks in the smaller pan. I have always used them on low heat, never rinsed or washed them until they are completely cool. Always hand wash and have only used a soft sponge on them. These are just not built to last very long. Upset that I spent this much money on them to see them fail like this. I reached out to the company to ask them if they'd be willing to replace the pans and I'd change my review on here. Until then I'm warning people not to buy these.",

All my other \"unscratchable' pans had fine scratches within a few days, this one still looks like the day it was delivered! I've already bought another one (larger). I don't know if it is the diamond dust in the coating but it works. A bit expensive but quality always is. Get one of these, you won't regret it!",
