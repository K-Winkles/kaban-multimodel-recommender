                "reviewText": "This 3 pack of different sized frying pans are pretty good. The non-stick, surface has seem to work well for the few times I've used the small pan when I'm frying up eggs in the morning. The first day I use just a little bit of butter as that's what I normally do and on the second day I didn't use any and I waited for the egg to get crispy and then it was actually very easy to hand flip within the pan. So I'd say the non-stick surfaces pretty good.The one photo shows the bottom of the pans that look to be great for induction heat as well as any other type of stove top which the product description say it's good for gas or propane, electric, induction and one other which I can't remember off top of head.I wasn't sure about the wooden handle when we place the order and once I got it I wasn't too keen on it but the handle is very smooth easy to hold and actually feels very lightweight compared to other pans of the same size.The only issue I have, and why I gave it a four-star, is because the handles don't feel super secure to the actual pan and upon first touching it I almost thought it was going to fall off but it didn't. I attempted to turn the handle and see if anything happened which it did not, so it looks like these handles are secured to the pan nicely but I still feel it's just a slight little movement when I'm holding the pan in my hand.The three different sizes are great for everyday household use if you need to quickly fry an egg saute some onions or mushrooms and or saute or fry up something in the larger pan.",

They come in the perfect everyday use sizes. Only thing is once I bought them I realized that I wanted to get pits to match them and I cannot find JUST a pot set that matches exactly. Lol but I'm happy with my purchase and plan to buy another set as a gift for family.",

                "reviewText": "This set of frying pans is of excellent quality. They are actually a great bargain at the current price!They are very non-stick and heat distribution is very good. They seem to be pretty solid pans so I expect they will last a long time.They have very solid handles so always have a good grip on your pan.I normally wash things like these by hand, but the listing does say they are dishwasher-safe so if that is how you wash them these are very easy to clean as well.",
