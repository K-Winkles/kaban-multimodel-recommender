We fried pork chops and just wiped it out clean with a paper towel. I would buy again for sure.

Please note, a little butter or oil is recommended to make this seamless! (Even when I use oil and butter in my other pans, things would still stick, ESPECIALLY with potatoes, but not for this pan)Fair warning for eggs, they would sometimes drift to the edges of the pan after you\u2019d crack them in. Makes it easy to flip from the pan for me so I don\u2019t mind it. This product makes me a fan of the Gotham Steel Pans! Reliable, easy to wash and DISHWASHER SAFE!
