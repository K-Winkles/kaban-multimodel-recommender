                "reviewText": "I'm reviewing the GreenPan Valencia Pro Hard Anodized 10\" Frying PanProsRequires much less oil or butter for cookingBest egg pan I've ever used.Pepper and onions cook nice and less greasy.Cooks well with medium or low heat.Lightweight. Well constructed.Handle stays cool.ConsI would prefer a white cooking surface rather than the gray color.DetailsI own cast iron pans and other ceramic pans. But this one has the slickest surface and easiest cleaning. I've been using this pan since Christmas 2022. About 5 times per week. I use it on a conventional stove top (not induction). I love it. Based on failures with past frying pans I treat this pan with respect. I use only plastic spatulas. Heat setting no higher than 325 to 350 using a laser thermometer. For cleaning the pan I use nothing but a warm wash cloth and dawn dish liquid when the pan is warm but not hot. No nylon bristle brushes. Sometimes I just wipe out the pan because it cleans up so easily. I cook thin omlettes in butter on low heat and cover them flipping them one time. They turn out great. They slide out of the pan.I cook burgers at about 350 in a little bacon grease. Vegetables around 325 to 350 with just a little olive oil and only cook a few at a time so they come out slightly singed.I use cast iron only for cooking thick bacon because it comes out nice and crispy. But I have to season the surface after each use so I don't bother using cast iron for anything else. This GreenPan is my fave for everything but bacon.I am optimistic the cooking surface on this pan will last a long time without flaking or chipping like my old teflon pans that I threw out.",

                "reviewText": "This is unquestionably the best frying pan I have ever used in over 60 years! Sturdy and very well made. Great non-stick coating that really works as advertised. Very even heat distribution for perfect results. Clean-up could not be easier - simply wipe clean with damp dish cloth. Only been using for a few months, so can't attest to how long the coating will last. I also like the fact that coating is TFE free and better for health reasons. Like the pan so much I bought a 10 inch and 8 inch one to go with it.",

The pan appears to be completely flat but the oil doesn't stay in the center. A small thing. Overall, it's is a fabulous fry pan.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Most expensive sticky \u201cnon-stick\u201d pan I have ever purchased",
                "reviewText": "I bought this pan because I wanted a high-quality, non-toxic, non-stick pan. It had great reviews. It worked well for perhaps 1 week then, things started sticking. I used it primarily for making scrambled eggs or omelets in the morning, or sauteeing vegetables and stir-frying. It started to stick so badly, I had to add large amounts of oil or butter when making an omelet or scrambling eggs, and still the eggs would stick. Sometimes I would lose about 1/3 of the eggs on the pan. I assumed I must have got a lemon. The saucepans I bought seem to be working well (so far). I contacted the company and received the following email:\u201c We are very sorry to hear about the issues with your cookware. Don\u2019t worry, this issue can be easily resolved!It is possible that you have a layer of carbonized oil built up on your pan that will create a barrier between the pan and your food. When this happens, you are basically cooking on the layer of burned oil as opposed to the surface of the pan. This layer may not be visible at first but may turn yellow-to-orange-to brown as the layer builds up.This cleaning method has proven to be extremely successful and can be used when you notice staining and/or sticking.Once completed, you may resume normal washing with soap and a soft sponge. Avoid use of abrasive cleaning pads and sponges or washing up brushes as the bristles are also abrasive. We have included our exterior cleaning method as well.Interior:Fill the pan halfway with water and bring it to a simmer for about 2 minutes. Pour out the water and place the pan on a sturdy surface such as a wooden cutting board. Carefully use a Melamine sponge (Mr. Clean Magic Eraser or our Restoring Sponge) and a little plain water on the warm surface to wipe away the food or stuck on oil. This should do the trick.The restoring sponge recommended for deep cleaning is perfectly safe. Our Product Team has tested this product for safety and durability. The sponge contains pores, which when moved around your pan, enables it to grab food and oil particles. Our cookware is coated and sealed and therefore, nothing will leach into your pan. Once the deep cleaning is complete, you may wash your pan as you normally would.Exterior:Plain tap water and the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser or any Melamine sponge should do the trick for minor staining! If you have stubborn stains, you may Mix baking soda and a little water to form a smooth paste; then use kitchen paper to rub the paste over the stained area (exterior surfaces only).As a reminder from our Care & Use instructions:It is very important to know the smoke point of the oil you choose. We recommend oils with a high smoke point, to reduce the chances of oils getting too hot and sticking to your pan. We therefore recommend keeping Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the salad bowl and not using it as a cooking oil because it easily oxidizes on exposure to air and heat.***It is extremely important to avoid abrasive cleaners/brushes/sponges when cleaning nonstick ceramic coated cookware.*** ***Abrasive cleaners and brushes can scuff your pan ever so slightly, that it will affect the nonstick properties.***Regular Olive Oil is a better option as it has a higher smoke point. We also find that many consumers like clarified butter (Ghee), Refined Coconut Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Peanut Oil and some vegetable oils with high smoke points. We suggest avoiding Avocado oil as this oil can become sticky when heated. If you do choose to cook with Avocado oil, please keep the heat on low to medium.Users should avoid all oils in spray form, as the tiny oil droplets will heat up very quickly and burn, creating a layer of carbonization on your pan. \u201cSo, to me, the point of using a non-stick pan is the easy care and clean up. Now I have to get a Magic Erase sponge (which are bad for you and the environment) and pregeat the pan with water becore cleaning? What a pain! Nevertheless, I followed the instructions. I was also mad that I am not supposed to use our preferred cooking oils: avocado oil, or Extra Virgin olive oil. I might add, these peculiarities, including the need for a Magic Erase sponge were not included in the Amazon listing, nor were they mentioned in/on the packaging. I got fed up with having to hear the pan and then clean it with the Magic Erase sponge. Also, the pan didn\u2019t work much better after I did that. Also, the initial instructions did not say that you can only cook on medium and low. That doesn\u2019t work for stir fry or browning chicken, etc. what is the point of this pan? It is awful. I have a normal, stainless steel pan that works better than this, with less oil, and my Lodge Logic cast iron pan doesn\u2019t stick and is easier to clean. I am not at all happy with the performance of this pan.",
