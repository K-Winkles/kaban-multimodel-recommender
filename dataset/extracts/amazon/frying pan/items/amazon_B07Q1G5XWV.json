When it finally started sticking, I decided to replace it with this \"non-toxic\" alternative. The new pans weighs about half, so is easier to handle. It is amazing slippery and easy to clean. But it has a bump in the middle so oil and other liquids run to the sides, for which I deducted a star.",

                "reviewText": "I've just gotten these.. can't give them an honest rating right now because I've only used the smaller one once and not used the bigger one yet at all.. I love the lids. The pans are much lighter than I thought they would be. hope that doesn't mean food will burn easier or pans will not hold a steady heat..... this is why I say , stay tuned.. I'll come back after using them a week or so and add to this.Ok I've used them, washed them etc. I love the pans. Nothing sticks and super easy to clean. I dont like the handles. They get hot. The knobs on the lids were loose. I had to use a screwdriver to tighten then. And those knobs get really hot. Well I forgot to come back in a week or 2 it has now been one year since I purchased these and they are still exactly like new I use them everyday. These are the easiest pens to wash I've ever had and I am 83 years old almost 84. I simply love them. The only thing I've had a problem with is the handles handles on the lids well the knobs UPS are loose And though we tighten them regularly they still come loose but so far no accidents just have to use a plot holder to take the lid off with because of them being so hot",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure why there aren't more great reviews about this pan. I've only owned it for a month now and it hasn't let me down once. I think if you follow the instructions never cooking higher than medium heat which all non-stick pans call for this pan works great. At first I cooked an egg without any oil and just like the commercials it slid right off the pan. Clean up has been a breeze always allowing the pan to return to room temp before washing. With a very little amount of oil every egg and omelette I've cooked never came close to sticking. I am using an induction cooktop so I'm not sure how it would perform on electric and gas. I do think if the rules are followed this pan will always perform great. I'm writing this 9/5/23 so durability still may be a question.",

                "reviewText": "Nonstick surface has worked every time so far. I threw out all my Teflon a few years ago and have been using stainless steel. But there were a few things that kept sticking to my stainless. I've been using this pan for about a week now and I've tried some of the recipes that were the most difficult on stainless. So far, everything slides right out of this pan effortlessly. I expect my stainless pans will last 50 years. I am hoping this stone wear pan will serve for a few years. If it lasts longer than that, then I will be impressed. So, the trade off is convenience versus the need to replace a pan that will probably wear out.",

(I always use the lowest heat setting and I've NEVER put them in the Dishwasher.) I had to discard one 8\" already, and the other 2 are well on their way to a degraded surface.When they start to look bad, I get rid of them.I worry that bits of surface material will end up in my food.The larger pans are used less, so they last longer, but even they show signs of decline.I'm debating whether I want to buy more of these, or look elsewhere for a more durable pan.",
