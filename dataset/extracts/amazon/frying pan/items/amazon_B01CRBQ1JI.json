                "reviewText": "***UPDATE 10/18***I've now been using both the 10\" and 12\" version of this pan several times per week for six months or more. I saw many negative reviews where people didn't use any oil or butter in the pan first and were unhappy with the results. While I found the same thing, simply adding a little butter or Smart Balance to cover the bottom of the pan results in an excellent non-stick experience. Just this morning I cooked three sunny side up eggs and they slid out of the pan without a spatula. So, while it may me disappointing that the pan doesn't work well with no oil or butter, the fact that it does work extremely well with it still puts these pans light years ahead of the many other non-stick pans I've used and thrown out. DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS DISSUADE YOU -- IF YOU SEASON THE PAN PROPERLY (as per the instructions) AND USE A LITTLE BUTTER OR OIL THESE PANS ARE OUTSTANDING.****************As most people I started out with teflon pans years ago. They eventually lost their nonstick properties, so I searched for healthier options without toxic chemicals to replace them. First I tried pans from Ozeri, which I felt better about for health reasons, but as with most \"nonstick\" pans they quickly lost their nonstick properties. Next I tried pans from Denmark after a good experience with them at a summer rental a few years back, but that yielded basically the same result. At this point I'd pretty much lost hope that any of these healthier nonstick pans would continue to work after a few months. Finally I decided to use my Consumer Reports subscription to see if they had anything worth trying. Duh! I was surprised to see that Red Copper pans were highly rated so I gave them a shot. FINALLY, a nontoxic, nonstick pan that ACTUALLY WORKS!!!I've had the 10- and 12-inch sizes for several months under fairly heavy use so this seemed like a long enough time to write a worthwhile review -- but I WILL UPDATE if these pans end up disappointing down the road. First, I strictly followed the directions and seasoned both pans before using them (none of the other pans required or specified this step and I wonder if it would've helped at all). I don't know how important this step is, but given my positive results I'll just say MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS FIRST BEFORE USING THE PAN. Also, the directions state that if the pans do start to lose their nonstick properties, just repeat this seasoning procedure. This actually gives me some hope that these pans might actually continue to work down the line. At first I was disappointed because the second batch of scrambled eggs I made -- right after the first batch without adding any more oil or butter -- started to stick pretty badly. Out of habit, for the first batch I used a little Smart Balance (the regular stuff, not the light version that doesn't melt well -- by the way I NEVER use real butter anymore as this tastes just like butter but MUCH healthier -- TRY IT!) so the next batch I added a little Smart Balance before cooking the eggs and, YIPPEE!!!!!! Although I'm just slightly disappointed that I can't just cook without adding anything to the pan first, adding a little Smart Balance is a small price to pay to have a truly nonstick experience. Seriously, eggs just slide right out of the pan. Even sunny side up eggs, with maybe just a little bit of coaxing with a spatula, literally slide right onto the plate. AMAZING!!! I don't add anything when cooking stuff like hamburger meat for tacos and the pan works great without any significant sticking. BTW, I kept the plastic covers the pans came in so I can stack them without risking damaging the nonstick surface, and I do NOT use any metal utensils while cooking with these pans in the hope of prolonging their nonstick life.So, what I like about the pans (other than the excellent nontoxic and nonstick properties) are that they seem well built, and the bottoms of the pans are actually pretty flat. Ozeri pans were not flat and oil or butter would collect around the outside of the pan and away from the center. Argh! Despite the handle being metal it somehow remains relatively cool as long as you grab it more toward the end, and it's great that the pans can be used in the oven if necessary.All this goodness notwithstanding, there are some things I wish were a little better. Despite being well built the pans are still relatively light weight, and with not much in them the weight of the handle is enough to tip the pan toward it if you put it down quickly or carelessly. And the pans seem relatively shallow, which means they don't hold as much and also make flipping food a little more difficult than a deeper pan. The most annoying thing though is that my standard lids will not lock into place on these pans. This seems like a cheap trick to incentivize customers to buy Red Copper lids. I just continue to use my lids as they do sit on top of the pan, but they will slide off if they're pushed or the pan is tilted. Despite these not insignificant negatives, I'm GLADLY living with them because they are so far outweighed by having a healthy nonstick pan that actually works.So in the end, while they're not perfect (name me something that is), overall I'm thrilled with these pans and most likely will be buying more. Very highly recommended!",

I've used more expensive pans and eventually they all lose \"nonstick\"- get some scuffing in the bottom. These are priced so that you can just replace them. I use my pans daily- clean very easily- Quality pan and longlastingI can't comment on how long they last with dishwasher cleaning- I hand wash my pans",

                "reviewText": "let me start off by saying I love this pan so much! It is the best pan to make my omelets in since they slip right out once they are done cooking. The clean up is super easy as the only place I need to scrub is the metal circles inside the pan that hold the handle.I had this pan for many years and it finally became a little less nonstick so I ordered another one. It is definitely worth the price for having it last so many years. Also, make sure you don't use the spray cans on this pan as I found it left a sticky residue which was what ultimately led me to needed a new one. Now I only use butter, a splash of oil, or just some water when cooking and it always turns out perfect without any stick.I never use metal utensils on this pan, I have plenty of plastic or silicone spatulas so there is no point in taking the risk of ruining the pan. To wrap this all up, it really is a great pan and if you take care of it then it should last you a very long time. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace the last in a series of classic Teflon non-stick pan. After seasoning, it's incredibly slick, and food just wipes off. Very cool. There are two problems, though:- The handle, which is stamped metal, is pretty uncomfortable, especially when you're flipping something. I understand that not using plastic allows it to be oven-safe, but a tubular metal handle would be a big improvement.- Although it seems very slick, fried eggs just will NOT slide in the pan. You can easily lift them off with a spatula, but try and just flip them and no dice: they stay where they are. So, I now have to dirty a spatula every time I fry some eggs. (Again, the pan itself seems extremely slick; it's just something about the surface which resists sliding by eggs.)I miss flipping my eggs. I'll see how long the pan lasts, but unless it's for a good three or four years I'll probably switch back to Teflon.Edit: after a week of breakfasts, eggs now slide just fine, and I'm back to flipping. I guess the factory-recommended seasoning doesn't do enough; perhaps more time in the oven, or repeating, would be better, or perhaps you just need to fry a series of eggs. The handle hasn't improved over time, though; it's still uncomfortable.",

I'm a tab bit confused that out of all the plastic packaging that surrounds this pan, you put the paper SKU sticker on the pan itself. Now I have a half-removed paper sticker on fire in my oven.One month review:This is a savage pan! Never use a metal spatula and it will last a long time. It works incredibly well for eggs and nothing sticks to it. I originally bought this for protection from my GFs AK47 but after reading the reviews it seems it WILL NOT block bullets of the .762 variety. I knew that this price range it would likely only block 9mm but to my surprise it will block anything up to a .45. Of course, your experience may vary.Be safe, God bless.",
