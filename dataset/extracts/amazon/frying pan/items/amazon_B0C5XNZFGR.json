                "reviewText": "I've been searching for years for a good pan to make eggs, steaks and general purpose frying. I've tried copper pans, \"diamond\" infused pans, ceramic coated pans, and always got the same result - sticking and difficult cleaning. I've done research on the \"Hexclad\" line of pans, but they seem waaaaay too pricey. $160 for a frying pan? No thank you. So I came across this pan, and the reviews seemed favorable. The original price is supposedly $100, but got it on sale for $59. I was skeptical and had low expectations, but when I used it, it blew me away. Eggs did NOT stick. Steak cooked beautifully with great crust with minimal oil. Vegetables cooked perfectly. Then after the pan cools, all you have to do is wipe it with a paper towel and you're good to go for the next meal. I think the key is to follow the instructions to \"season\" the pan before using it for the first time. Put some high temperature oil (like any vegetable oil, but NOT olive oil) in the pan and put on low heat. Then evenly spread the oil over the whole pan while it's on low heat with a paper towel. In this way it is similar to a cast iron pan in the way you have to season the surface. However this pan is a fusion of cast iron and traditional non-stick pans, and thus has the best features of both. It is a bit heavier than traditional non-stick pans, but not as heavy as cast iron. After several meals prepared in this pan, it seems to be well built and sturdy and will be able to be used for a long time in the future. If you're looking for a great non-stick pan, your search is over. Get this pan especially if you see it on sale. You won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "I've used these pans daily for two months now and continue to be impressed by the nonstick cooking surface. While I would say it is average at best for browning meat, it may be that I haven't completely learned the best heat and time required for the different meats. Don't get me wrong, it can brown meat fabulously but you may need to adjust your past ways.Browning meat aside, these are well built pans. They are considerably heavier than the nonstick pans you may have been using but much lighter than cast iron. They appear two be a cast iron bottom heat surface with a nonstick cooking surface seamlessly mated together. The handles appear to be solid - maybe aluminum - and are securely fastened by two hefty rivets.The cooking surface is very slippery which probably necessitates the dimpled surface. In fact, the nonstick is so slippery, you could simply wipe the skillet interior clean immediately after cooking (the warmth helps) and you wouldn't know you had just cooked in it.I can't speak for the durability, but after two months of daily use they still look like new. I do recommend highly these pans if your budget allows it.",
