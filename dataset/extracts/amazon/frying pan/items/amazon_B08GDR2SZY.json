                "reviewText": "It's hard to find good frying pans that come with lids. This 4 piece set is just what I was hoping for. The large pan is quite deep, so it can be used for saut\u00e9ing as well as frying. They are very solid pans but remain lightweight and easy to handle and wash. Although they are dishwasher safe, it is recommended to hand wash them because the harsh detergent can cause them to discolor. That's no problem because they clean up easily with just a wipe and rinse. The pans cook evenly and react well to all temperatures, except I have not tried extremely high heat or blackening meats. These frying pans are a good value for the money, especially when compared to others on the market.",

For some reason we have these old pots that do not slip over the cooktop.",

At 12.25\" there's plenty of space for extra ingredients to spread out. Omelets? WOW! One 6 egg omelet, which served two, fluffed up beautifully, flipped over effortlessly and came out of the pan presto.Warning: Please read the insert instructions inside the box. The description on Amazon is in conflict concerning the handle of the lid and pan getting hot. The handle stays cool, but the lid handle does become hot. Use a potholder for both to stay on the safe side. Also, many people like to know the origin of where items are made. Once again referring to the insert you'll find the pan is made in Thailand and the lid in China. Cookware falls under Meyer Corporation Markets, a Kitchen Aid subsidiary.Happy Cooking!",
