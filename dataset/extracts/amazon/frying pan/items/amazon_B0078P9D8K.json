                "reviewText": "I've had other non-stick pans, but this one is so much better than those, they don't even belong in the same category. I still use a little olive oil when I cook -- habit -- but I think that's not really necessary. Even when the food starts to burn, it doesn't stick.RE: food starts to burn -- this pan cooks so much faster, and at lower heat, that it took some adjustments to my cooking. This pan cooks well with about 2/3rds the amount of heat as my other pans, in about 2/3rds the time. Now that I've figured all that out, I hardly ever burn the meat. <grin>My only quibble is no vent hole in the lid. However, I just stick a spoon along the side, and let the lid rest on the spoon handle, creating a vent gap that way.Cleanup is a breeze. I wipe the pan with a damp paper towel as soon as I put the food on the plate, just to get rid of the leftover oil, sauce, whatever. (Probably not necessary, but I'd rather throw that stuff in the trash than run it down the drain.) When the pan is cool, I set it in the sink, add a few drops of dish liquid, fill it with water, and let it set for a while. I go back later and use a dishcloth or paper towel to rub the surface of the pan with the soapy water, rinse, and it's done. There's been no scrubbing necessary. (Maybe if I burned something to a crisp, but I haven't done that.)I bought the 8-inch skillet for single-person meals (4 oz meat) and the 12-inch skillet for family-sized meals (1 lb. meat). I like them so much that I've just ordered the 11-inch flat griddle; I expect it'll make reheating leftover pizza much easier. These pans are absolutely wonderful, and I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "My previous old teflon pan saw its last days. Looked at the reviews and opted for this one and haven't been disappointed. Its heavy enough to evenly distribute the heat with no hot spots which is a real plus with omelets. I've yet to have anything stick and cleanup has been just a wipe clean and no scrubbing. So far the surface has resisted marring and scratching (use silicone utensils). I give this item two thumbs up and worth the price.",
