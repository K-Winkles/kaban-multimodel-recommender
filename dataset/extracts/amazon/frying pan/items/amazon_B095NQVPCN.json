I usually like to make omelets or eggs for my family in the morning and this pan is perfect, the heat is distributed very evenly on the bottom, non-stick and easy to clean up. I wiped it off with a soft sponge or rag after cooking and it didn't stick. When I first got my frying pans, I was worried that it wouldn't be easy to assemble. But it was easy to assemble following the instructions step in the manual. You can be assured. The handle is definitely long enough to keep your hands out of the danger zone, the texture is smooth for a comfortable grip, and it has a wood grain to prevent burns.Overall, I absolutely love this pan set. buy it. You won't be disappointed!",
