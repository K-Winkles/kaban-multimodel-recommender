                "reviewText": "I have owned these pans for about three months now and use them for sauteing vegetables, pan-frying eggs, and searing meats. This is a really good value for two pans of small/small-medium size. The pans themselves are nothing fancy, but they are reliable, durable, and get the job done without the risk of Teflon and other \"non-stick\" chemicals they spray. I have been searching for the right pan for many years. I tried out ones with Teflon, ones with Teflon alternatives, and even the \"green\" pans that claim not to use non-toxic coatings. They have all failed me for different reasons. Ultimately, this is just a practical set for those not looking for anything fancy and just looking for tried-and-true pans aside from another great alternative, an iron skillet. Who knew that something so simple would turn out to be the best?The only issue with stainless steel pans is that they tend to stick. You have to adjust your cooking skills and re-learn cooking, but only briefly. The amount of oil and heat has to be just right in order to prevent your eggs or chicken breast from sticking to the pan, and you can't flip too early or late, otherwise whatever you cook will stick. Once you get through that slight hurdle, though, you will be cooking to your stomach's content without worrying about dangerous flakes of whatever chemicals or hazardous metals that may wind up in your body. These pans distribute heat well and are easy to clean as well, along with being able to take a beating. I recommend using a wooden or silicon cooking utensil to prevent scratching the nice surface. Overall, it's a great set of skillets that also goes perfectly with my 12-inch stainless steel skillet, also made by Farberware.",

                "reviewText": "I had a small stainless steel skillet years ago that I gave away and thought I would just buy another one whenever I wanted, but they are hard to find. This skillet set is perfect! I'm using the larger one to cook asparagus tonight. Yesterday I used the 8\" skillet 3 x ... once for eggs for breakfast; once to heat up a can of soup for lunch; and once to fry some potatoes for supper. It slips into the sink easily and washes up in a flash and then back on the stove top. I don't even bother to put it away. The skillets are deep enough to serve for heating liquids like a saucepan. I have some lids that fit several types of pans that I'm using. We have 3 people in our family. Of course for a larger family it might be too small. I even like to use it rather than the microwave for reheating leftovers for lunch. I have also ordered a 12\" skillet to make my set complete. I'm switching to stainless steel from cast iron.... can no longer lift all that weight and seems I always have trouble cleaning the cast iron. Can you tell I'm a satisfied customer?UPDATE: I'm still very happy with these pans, except the handle where it attaches to the skillets, has become wobbly feeling. I have some older SS pans and the way the handles were connected to the pan itself is very, very study. These newer skillets have a plastic handle with a metal end where it connects to the skillet.... and then the skillet has a metal connector where it connects to meet the metal on the skillet handle. Right at that connection is where the weakness is occurring. I don't see a way to correct this other than having another handle attached by someone with that skill. This is very frustrating and something I've seen in other merchandise... to manufacture such an excellent product with an obvious weakness. It's a shame to put all that effort and money in producing a good quality product that will many times end up in the trash because of a plastic connector or a weak handle. :(",

                "reviewText": "I recently tossed my scratched ceramic, non-stick pans because of health concerns and decided to go stainless steel. I think these pans cook better and can be put in the dishwasher. The one huge negative is the handle screw loosens after several uses. In the 21st century we haven\u2019t figured out how to keep a handle connected to the pan. I do like the handle style and function of keeping my hands safe from burns. A great product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "A good quality, stainless steel set. These are heavy, not like the more expensive lightweight tin / aluminum pans you see in the box stores. Enter my nonstick ceramic cookware that was not suppose to scratch. Well, it DID SCRATCH so I purchased these to replace the smaller pan and got a bonus at an exceptional price.In response to the reviews that suggest the pot burned their food ... This is NOT non-stick cookware. I highly recommend using real butter, ghee, or coconut oil at a lower heat setting to cook eggs on these. I find that most butter substitutes on the market today, what I call 'plastic butter', burn onto the pan when heated. In viewing the photos, I suspect that is exactly what the problem is.",

I will wash them thoroughly and see what they look like afterwards.Also, the interior finishes of these pans are not nearly as smooth as I expected they would be, based on experience with other Farberware pans, but I will use them and after a few sessions of scouring I hope they will \u201csmoothen up\u201d.Edit to update: the glob of food or whatever washed out ok with Dawn detergent and a green Scotch Brite pad. I cooked some fried eggs in about a tablespoon of butter for breakfast yesterday and no problem with them sticking despite the somewhat rough appearing machined interior of the pan. Just heat the pan up slowly until the butter is liquefied and bubbling then insert the hen fruit into the receptacle.",
