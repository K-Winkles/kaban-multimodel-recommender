However, after washing it in the dishwasher, I noticed the outer silver layer became discolored in some areas. I\u2019m quite disappointed with this outcome. Unfortunately, I\u2019m currently unable to upload a picture, but I wanted to share my experience. I would advise others to double-check with the manufacturer about dishwasher use before purchasing.",
