                "reviewText": "T-Fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan came well packaged in large box. The pan is beautiful! It's solid and substantial but not too heavy. The coated surface is typical of a Teflon pan but it has ridges on the bottom for more even heating. I tried it and fried some meatballs and onions. The pan takes a few minutes to warm up but then it does an excellent job cooking everything evenly. Nothing sticks to the surface (yet). The handle is a comfortable rubber like grip that stays cool while the pan is in use.It's also easy to clean. You do have to cure the pan before use by heating the pan up on low and wiping it with vegetable oil. Repeat after 10 cycles in the dishwasher. I'm not going to be putting mine in the dishwasher. It's easy enough to clean with a sponge and detergent in the sink.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.~ Kort",

                "reviewText": "I bought one of these 12\" skillets a couple of months ago. I was delivered within 2 days (I'm a Prime member) and it arrived safely packed and undamaged. It comes with a very nice vented, clear glass lid. The construction is very solid - it feels well-made and a little heavy. The material it's built from (Titanium) appears to be excellent - no more worrying about flaking Teflon. I did a lot of research on no-stick skillets and this brand (company) often made it into the top 10, so I thought I'd try it out. The price is excellent considering what you get.I usually cook on high heat and so far, have had no issues (no warping, charring, distortions, etc.) with this skillet. I mainly cook omelets but have also cooked chicken breasts and steaks. I usually cook with Canola or Olive oil and sometimes Coconut oil. Some people have claimed that you don't need any oil or anything to prevent sticking when using these. I experimented with cooking eggs with no oil and it was nearly a disaster - the eggs stuck for the most part (not too badly though). I don't cooking without some sort of oil to prevent sticking.My biggest complaint is the bottom of the skillet. I have a gas range and unfortunately, the bottom of the skillet is extremely slippery. On a few occasions the skillet nearly slipped off the stove. I got used to it and was more careful and to date, have had no accidents (keep the little ones away from this when it's used for cooking). The other thing about the red dot in the center (inside the pan) glowing red when it's ready... meh. I haven't noticed it glowing. None of these issues really lowers my rating on this product. I recommend it. We'll see how it holds up over the years.Also, I just bought a second one recently because it's a solid product and I couldn't stand my awful Rachel Ray Teflon skillets anymore.I hope this is helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fry pan two weeks ago and it is one of the best items in my kitchen. The pan is well built and very sturdy. The glass top is great to see the food as it is cooking, and it also fits my other stainless 12\" pan. Cleaning up is a snap. After using the pan all I need to do is wipe the inside of the pan with a damp sponge towel and it is ready for the next use. Food doesn't stick at all. Clean up works best if the pan is slightly warm.I read some of the other reviews that were not satisfactory in the buyers opinion and the only thing I can see is that they didn't follow the manufacturers recommendations to \"season\" the pan before first use and to keep the heat lower when cooking. How can you expect a pan to work properly when you don't follow the recommendations ?I would recommend this pan to anyone who loves to cook with a non-stick pan.",
