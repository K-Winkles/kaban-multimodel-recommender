It\u2019s very disappointing when you\u2019re used to cooking meals using specific size, the things you were able to cook before might not fit into the pan anymore. Another problem comes when you buy a Tefal lid for 28cm, suddenly it\u2019s not fitting and you\u2019re disappointed even further. Not a very good experience sadly.",
