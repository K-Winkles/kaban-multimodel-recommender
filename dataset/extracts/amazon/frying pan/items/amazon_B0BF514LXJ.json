                "reviewText": "Update - After only 4 months of use, unfortunately, the non-stick coating on the skillet is coming off.I'm very disappointed. Honestly, since I have owned the skillet it had turned into becoming my favorite skillet -- and to now see how the non-stick coating is not lasting is disappointing.I have been using it carefully -- never putting any metal utensils in it -- and only hand washing it.It really seems that a skillet should last longer than 4 months.Since I've ended up loving it so much during the 4 months -- I came to check about ordering another one --- but the price is too high to justify spending for a product that only lasted 4 months.I hope the manufacturer reads this update and works at improving their non-stick coating...................Original review below--This is a very cute skillet. I got the 7.9-inch blue skillet and am pretty happy with it so far.I've been using the skillet to cook an egg omelet in the mornings and the eggs have not been sticking - (that said, I have been putting a tiny amount of butter into the skillet).The skillet has cleaned up well doing hand washing. I'm not sure I would feel comfortable putting it into the dishwasher.The wood handle is a bit odd. The handle is not attached to the skillet when it ships and the user needs to screw the wood handle onto the skillet to use it. There are screws that come with the shipment for the user to be able to attach the handle to the skillet. We seem to have been able to screw the handle on tight enough that it has been staying on the skillet - but honestly I have never had to screw a handle onto a new skillet before.I do like the skillet and so far it has worked well. And it is very cute in the kitchen and on the stove.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I have revised this review to give this 8\" pan five stars, up from four. It has become the household \"go to\" pan for anything that will fit into it. It heats rapidly, cooks evenly, and nothing ever sticks. As a general proposition I still favor thicker pans because thick metal spreads heat better. This pan, however, is so small that none of the bottom surface extends beyond the size of the smallest burner on our smooth glass-top range. (A glass-top range burner probably heats more evenly than an old-style coiled burner of the same diameter, to say nothing of a gas flame.) So, in function, on our range, this small pan is about perfect. I have just now also bought the big 10\" pan. (The bottom contact surface of the big pan will similarly be smaller than the size of our 9\" burners.)----------------This attractive pan is thin and light, and has a rather crude handle. It is one of the more expensive pans of this type (small, about 8\", aluminum with induction capability), and it seems rather high priced at $23.The handle is unimpressive, basically like a plain wooden dowel, and the two handle rivets are small and fairly closely spaced. The handle must be attached by the purchaser with a single long slender bolt through the entire handle.My two kitchen scales both say this pan weighs 14oz. The manufacturer / seller says the \"item weight\" is 1.3 pounds (20.8oz). If my scales are accurate, that stated weight is an extra 6.8 oz, which is nearly a 50% overstatement. Maybe the seller weighed the box and the little utensils along with the pan. (My scale says the utensils weigh about 2.5 oz together.)My long experience with ordinary conductive heat is that thin pans heat unevenly and burn things in the center. Perhaps that won't be an issue with this pan, as the 4.75\" contact surface on the bottom is smaller than most small burners. All other things being equal, I prefer thicker pans that more assuredly spread heat. Thickness might, however, be more important in bigger pans.I don't yet have an induction range. If I did, that might change how I regard this pan, as induction heat is very even (assuming the burner is big enough to extend beneath the entire bottom of the pan).In my limited use of it this small pan has worked perfectly. It has heated evenly and the non-stick coating is terrific. One has to give it credit for that.",

                "reviewText": "I am loving this frying pan so far. It has lived up to its nonstick name! It's so lightweight and easy to use/carry. I make scrambled eggs with my kids in the morning, and our eggs have not been sticking. They love using the little silicone utensils that were included with the pan, too. They're perfect sized to slide along the sides of the pan. The wooden handle is nice because it doesn't get hot, and I don't have to worry about getting burned. The pan cleans easily after using it. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked this little skillet. It's a handsome product, well-constructed and sturdy, and the wooden handle makes for easy handling. the skillet heats up quickly and evenly, and its non-stick surface cleans up very easily. it comes with two spatulas, both of which match the skillet in ease of cleaning. It's available in a few sizes and I can see me ordering the others to complete the set. The only downside for me was that it doesn't come with a lid (which, honestly, didn't occur to me when I was ordering it), but I had one that fit so it wasn't a terrible inconvenience. Overall, I like this product and will recommend it.",
