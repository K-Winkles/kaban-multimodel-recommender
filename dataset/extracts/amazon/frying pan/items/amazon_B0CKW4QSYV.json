I am so intrigued by how this pan works so much better. I also need to mention that this pan is better looking in person and does come with a nice lid that fits the pan well. Both the pan and lid are easy to clean. If you follow the instructions, this pan works great and will hopefully last a long while too.I'm honestly surprised that the seller didn't really go into detail about how well, fast, and accurately this pan heats up and holds temperature. All this has been approved by my gourmet chef-at-home wife and yes she has advanced culinary training.Having said that, this pan requires special care, such as hand washing. You need to wait until it cools to clean it, etc., as described in their care instructions.",
