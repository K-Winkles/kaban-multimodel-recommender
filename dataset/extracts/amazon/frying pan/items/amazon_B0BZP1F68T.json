                "reviewText": "I think this is by far the worst non stick pan I have ever purchased. I have used it twice and have been \"under-impressed\" by it's performance. This morning, I lightly burned a sausage patty and for the life of me, I can't get the marks out of the pan. Absolutely horrible product and I would not recommend it.",
