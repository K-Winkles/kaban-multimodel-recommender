                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. All I can summarize my review is WOW, this is a very nonstick pan and Eggs don't stick. It is advertised as no butter and no nonstick spray needed and I did use some butter as I prefer to cook eggs with a light coating of butter for flavor but those eggs slid right out of the pan without issue. I used a similar pan in a timeshare and if anyone has stayed in a timeshare, almost any pan they have are not nonstick but these were holding up eggscellently! I had a similar non stick pan that was green in color and lost its non-stick capabilities a few months in. Hoping that this pan lasts much longer. I am fairly impressed that it isn't super smooth yet still offers excellent non stick coating to the pan.Final thoughts:Offers true non stick performance (tested with eggs)Ability to use with Metal Utensils (I won't be testing this personally)Good Medium weight pan (not super heavy, not super lightweight either)Recommended to use low to medium heat only (no high searing capabilities)Recommendation:Yes, I would purchase again and recommend to my friends!",
