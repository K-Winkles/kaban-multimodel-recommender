It\u2019s a beautiful pan with a nigh shiny finish on outside and bottom. Easy to clean. I Love the performance of this pan so much, I\u2019m going to purchase other size frying pans to have set.

                "reviewText": "I will say that I really like Rachael Ray cookware overall. I bought this 8.5 inch skillet to replace a very old 8.5 skillet of a different brand. While they are both are the same size across the top, the bottom part that touches the stove burners were not. This skillet is smaller at 6 inches and the sides curve upwards. I bought it primarily to make 2 egg omelets. There is nothing wrong with the skillet, depending on what you'll use it for. It's very nice. I'm going to exchange it for 1 size larger.",

However, when I read the \"care\" section included inside, it said not to use the pan over high heat. I thought this was ridiculous. Why buy a pan if I could not use it on all heat levels - low, medium AND high? I'm using it on high regardless, and it seems to be holding up well. Just a \"heats up\" on that oddity.",
