                "reviewText": "I don't really care for brands most of the time. If I like the look of the product, or the reviews of the product sit right with me, I will most likely purchase it. So, I didn't really care that these skillets are \"Rachel Ray.\"I bought them for the color and the size. I was looking for small, non stick skillets to replace my worn out ones and in that regard they are awesome. I cook daily, at least 2-3 times a day on medium, low heat only. Nothing sticks on em. I cannot say if they are dishwasher safe as I don't remember if it said that on the product description, but cleaning them is really easy. I pre-rinse with hot water and remove whatever grime or oil was left after use with the spraying hose, I then just simply use the soft side of the sponge to clean the skillets cooking side, and use the rough side to clean the rest of the skillet. The no stick coating still remains solid. Do not rinse the skillets right after cooking. Let them cool down or it may warp your skillets.The color of the skillets... Its soo nice. I purchased the orange ones. At first, it was a really bright orange color that pop'd. Now, its a lighter shade of orange mixed with the brighter orange color and it just looks great. The only way I can describe the color is by relating it to the color of cream filled orange Popsicle. As you bite into the Popsicle, the cream mixes with the orange and it produces this delicious lighter shade of orange. Idk, it just works, haha.I really only use the smaller of the 2 skillets as I bought the bundle that has the 9 and 11 inch, or something along those lines. I felt there was no need to use the larger one as the smaller one is able to cook everything I need.The handles on the skillets are pretty solid too. Good grip and feel heavy (the skillet as a whole.) The rubber does not get hot when picking up the skillets.Would definitely purchase again. Don't care for the name, but these are great.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know much of anything about Rachael Ray, other than the fact she has a chicken stock which I've used before and programs with her are typically on at medical facilities, but her brand does make some top notch pans for the price range. I first bought a Rachael Ray 10\" pan (orange handle) in 2017 because the wifey wanted a small pan that wasn't plain black (she's Mexican, so it ain't a kitchen without some color). That pan performed so well (even heating, easy to clean, nothing sticks) it became her favorite (mine too, beating out the Tfal) but, it's a 10\" pan so it had its limitations.Our larger pan, no idea what brand it is or how long we've had it, is just a food magnet. Anything you cook on it, no matter how much spray you use, it would be left with a coating of food. I told the wife we should get a new pan, another Rachael Ray, and she scoffed, \"Pans are too expensive, we'll wait for a sale\". Yeah, we both work so a $24 pan (when I bought it) is SUPER expensive...well, I bought the pan (in a pretty blue) and even though she was slightly annoyed I bought the pan even though she said not to, her tune changed immediately after trying it out. It totally outperforms its $24 price tag and absolutely NOTHING sticks to it. We both love this pan and I'll def look into buying a Rachael Ray wok if mine ever gives up (I'm Asian and it's not a kitchen without a wok).",

                "reviewText": "We bought this skillet to supplement the entire set that we purchased a week earlier. (We like having one larger pan in our set.)When the pan arrived, the non-stick finish had a few little tiny imperfections; 4 or 5 tiny little bubble-like spots in the surface . . the type of thing you'd almost think you could pick off with your nail. Since this was brand new, we decided to have it replaced and amazon.com, of course, instantly sent us a return label and shipped another one off.The second one arrived and it had no marks at all. The pans have a bit of heft but they're not particularly heavy; they feel well made and the handle is really comfortable. I'd almost forgotten what it was like to cook in something that's really non-stick, after all these years of facing surfaces on our old cookware, and true to its word, nothing sticks on this pan.We've only cooked a few things so far but it's been a pleasure using this cookware.There are two thing that bother us, though. (Not including the fact we needed a replacement*)The first thing is that there's no lid for the pan and none of the lids from the cookware set fit on the pan. As far as I can tell, there's no lid even available . . that's too bad 'cause all the other pans have lids and it puts some limitations on usage. Second, since the surface can be scratched, it would be nice if they shrink wrapped the pan so that nothing could mark it up. This was just wrapped in paper in a box.I'll update this someday, when we've had some time to really cook with it.*So far this is a solid 4-star pan. Normally, I would take a way a star because the first one was scratched but I'm in a generous mood. REALLY generous, in fact, 'cause when we received the full cookware set, of the same style, the smallest pan also had a tiny imperfection in the surface. They couldn't just replace the small pan so we had to send back the entire set. The next set that came had the exact same thing; there was one tiny little spot in the smallest pan . . . we picked it off and, though you can just make out where it was, it doesn't seem to have penetrated the actual non-stick surface. We've decided to cook with it for a while and then reevaluate in a few months. If that spot shows any signs of problems, we'll return the one pan via the warranty. Still, when you purchase these pans, take a really close look at the surfaces. (That said, the small pan has been perfect so far . . . non-stick eggs every morning!)UPDATED: January 10, 2013Just thought I'd check in on this review. We've taken care of this pan (and the whole companion set that we bought at the same time) as best we could. We haven't put it in the dishwasher and only use softer utensils and sponges. We've also never used it on really high heat. The non-stickiness has remained as new. There are no scratches or pieces starting to wear off and show up in the food. It still distributes the heat nicely and we have no complaints about cooking in this pan. That said, there are a couple of things we've noticed. First, like a couple of other people mentioned, the outside of the pan (particularly on the bottom) can get nicked up a bit, especially if you're stacking pans. The finish still looks great but I can see you have to be careful about knocking these around too much. The only negative thing is that the pan warped a little bit after a few weeks of use. Again, we haven't ever used high heat but, though not dramatic, there is definitely a little bit of \"non-roundness\" to the top of the pan now. As I mentioned, though, we have a full set of these also and no other pots or pans have warped at all; it could just be this particular one.All in all, we still love the pan. I'll check in again after a year . . see how it holds up.",
