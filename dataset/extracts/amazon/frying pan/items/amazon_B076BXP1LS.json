                "reviewText": "Really wanted to like this pan. The nonstick surface is wonderful, does what advertizes, but the shape and design of the pan suck. The surface is not flat, but slightly domed, so any liquid will run to the edges. And the heat is focused on the center of the pan, not evenly. I wanted to make big pancakes, but the edges wouldn't cook enough to flip before the center burns. So lame. Making small pancakes in the center is ok. Big ones, no. Makinf 4 small pancakes - no way at all... they'll never cook evenly. Poor design.",
