This 8 quart Kitchenaid is the best pot I\u2019ve ever had. The handles are cool while cooking and cleanup is a breeze. Hard anodized is the way to go. Not too wide for my burners, more narrow on the bottom than the top and it fits just right. Plus if a pot can be considered beautiful, it most definitely is. Kitchenaid doesn\u2019t disappoint!",

                "reviewText": "This replaces a 45 + year old and well used Cephalon 10 quart stockpot. This new pot is large enough for empty nesters with occasional guests. It's also good for canning and making jam, as the largest jars I use any more are pint size. The cover is very sturdy but NOT vented. Hopefully that won't be an issue. I washed it in warm soapy water by hand and towel dried it. I don't recommend putting any non-stick pots/pans in the dishwasher. I just don't think it's a good idea. I also suggest plate/pot/pan separators between those items that \"nest.\" It protects the individual items. They're inexpensive and well worth the effort and money. Comparative to other stockpots given the same size this is a good deal. I have a few KitchenAid pans and have always been satisfied with their performance.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this frying pan to replace an old one that was scratched. This has high sides which is great for sauces and stir frying. I don't use metal utensils when cooking with the pan. However, it does scratch easily when storing it (stacking other pots on it, moving it around, etc.). Non-stick is pretty good so far. NOTE: wash several times before using [new] as there is a black dust covering (I took a paper towel and wiped over it after every cleaning to make sure it was gone).",

I bought a ceramic set but the ceramic set doesn\u2019t brown well at all or I should say it takes forever. I hardly use the ceramic set. This is my go to pot. Carmelizes onions in less than 10 minutes. A nice golden brown. Love it! I have a gas stove.",

                "reviewText": "As a person of short stature, I have always had difficulty seeing the inside of most cooking pots due to their height. However, the Stewing pot I recently acquired is the first one that allows me to see the entire inside of the pot without having to stand on my toes. This makes it great and easy for me to clean. I intend to be the only one using this pot. It's quite amusing, really. The thickness of this pot is great and it's also not too heavy or too light it's perfect for me to make my mom's homemade spaghetti sauce from scratch. No more running to the kitchen every five minutes to make sure it's not starting to stick to the pot. Now for the real test to make a pot of homemade spaghetti and let it simmer all day and see that it don't stick is going to be the biggest thing. If it sticks I will come back and tell you all that it stuck to the pot if not then you know I'm happy and cooking everything I haven't cooked in years on the stove in fear it sticking and then burning in the pot for once it's stuck and if you don't change to another pot it will burn eventually. But nothing like cooking things all day on your stove. I just know I am going to love this pot. Best anniversary gift I have been given by far. Lol,",
