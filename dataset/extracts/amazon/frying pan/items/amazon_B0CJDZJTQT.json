They are non stick and clean up easily. Very attractive hanging on our pan rack. Nice durable wooden handles. Bonus was recieving high quality screwdriver to assemble them. Will definitely buy these again in a few years. Highly reccomend!",

                "reviewText": "I have already owned two pans by this company, and was waiting for them to put out a whole set so I could replace my older, other brand, pans. I was psyched when I saw this set!These are such good nonstick, when properly cared for, that they last for years. They are sturdy and well made, but not super heavy. The handles are very comfortable to grip. Even though I just received this set, I have owned two of the deep saut\u00e9 pans for several years, so I will give my long term feedback on those also.First, comments on the new set and the packaging:It's all packed very compact, it's almost hard to believe there's a whole set in there. The pan handles and the knobs for the lids are separate. This saves on packaging, and they're very easy to assemble. They even include a screwdriver!Make sure to pay attention to which handles go on which pans. They look identical, but two of them are slightly larger than the others. I initially tried to put one of the smaller handles on the wrong pan, and it didn't fit properly. There's a very clear illustration that I could have referred to.Don't lose or forget to use the little washers that are on the screws! I did this with one of my older pans, and the handle was jiggling a little before I could replace the washer.The free utensils that were included are good quality and sturdy, and the dividers are very helpful.Here are my recommendations after owning the other pans for years:1. I don't put them in the dishwasher. They're so ridiculously easy to clean, it shouldn't be necessary anyway.2. I made the mistake of searing meat on high in the first one I owned, and it lessened the efficacy of the nonstick surface. It's still usable, but that's why I bought a second one. Incidentally, this was after over a year of use. The newer one, which I haven't seared anything in, I've owned for over a year now, and it's like brand new. I use it practically every day.3. The obvious, don't use metal cooking utensils or steel wool etc with these. Don't heat up without oil, butter, or food in the pan.If you take care of these, they should last for years. Nonstick pans are not known for their longevity, these are the exception that proves the rule. And the price can't be beat!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased 3 months ago and used almost daily since that time. Problem with the non-stick coating on the large pan was significant but, the company replaced without issue. Replacement works quite well. First, the good: cookware set is extremely solid and durable. Cooktop to oven was no problem with large stockpot. Set is definitely thick and made to last. Lids fit well and steam vents work as expected. Customer service noted above is a major plus. The NOT-SO-GOOD: Handles get rather hot, especially for a cookware set in this price range. This is a good value but certainly not dollar store or discount junk. The nonstick coating works fairly well but it isn't amazing. For the first few months, most non-stick cookware is usually super slick and often doesn't even require non-stick spray or oil. This set definitely sticks if no oil or spray is used. That being said, I am pleased with the purchase. The durable nature of the cookware and the performance to cost ratio certainly warrant a solid 4 star review.",
