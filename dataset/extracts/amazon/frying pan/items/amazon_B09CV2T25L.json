                "reviewText": "I have had an 11 inch Green pan for several years, but it's not non-stick any more. The other thing about the pan is, that it didn't have a lid, and none of the lids of my other pans fit it. So, I have been looking for a new non-stick frying pan with a lid. I really wanted to get one made from cast aluminum, not stamped aluminum, because it's thicker and holds the heat better, distributes heat better, less likely to warp, more likely to stay flat on the bottom, and doesn't have those two little shiny rivet heads that always get food stuck on them and are impossible to get clean. After sifting through hundreds of options I finally selected this Vinchef deep frying pan with a lid. I really was looking for a pan that would be shallower, but I couldn't find one with a lid, so I had to get one that was a bit deeper so I could get one with a lid. I noted the comments regarding the pour spouts so the lid doesn't seal completely, but in the time that I have been using it I have not found that to be a disadvantage. The only food that I have got to stick was when I was steaming some broccoli and put some slices of American cheese on it. One slice got up on the side of the pan and cooked there, and I had to scrub it off, but everything else has been very much non-stick. I really like the pan, the only downside was in assembly, the Phillips head screw that you have to use to put the handle on doesn't go in very well. Even though I think I have the screw in all the way, the handle still feels just a bit loose. I'm afraid to screw it in any further for fear of breaking it. So, it works. I like the fact that the pan fits very nicely inside my 12 inch Farberware stainless steel frying pan for storage. I put the glass lid on it upside down for storage, and everything goes in the drawer very neatly. I don't think that red temperature indicator does anything useful, except it fills the hole between the pan and the handle. Overall, I love the pan. It's just exactly the pan I was looking for, excellent quality, I hope that with good care it will last me many years.",

The lid is a nice feature to have for a pan as well and not super common. The nonstick and scratch resistance are superb. Can\u2019t recommend enough.
