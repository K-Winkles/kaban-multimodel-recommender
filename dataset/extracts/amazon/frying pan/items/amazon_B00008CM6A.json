I found this pan difficult to clean but I was using butter or margarine to coat the inner bottom & sides. I use this little pan to cook eggs. My daughter used it one day using a common spray for pans. I was happy that the pan was much easier to clean that day. It is a wonderful little pan, perfect for scrambled eggs for one or two people. I\u2019ve also put it in the dishwasher with no ill effects. I highly recommend this beautifully made pan.",

I\u2019m noticing you don\u2019t ever have to go on high, it has such good heat it distribution that low to medium does the job. There\u2019s a good finish on it and things just slide right out.

                "reviewText": "I used to use teflon-coated pans but after living in a furnished place for a time, and using stainless, I bought new pans. This one is perfect, the right size for small meals, nice good weight, the heat is dispersed well, cooks well, and cleans up well. Trick I learned is to sit some water in the pan after it cools down a bit, and let it sit for an hour or so, and easy breezy removing everything that stuck to the pans. Use a bit of butter or cooking or olive oil and it cleans up very nicely. And to get it cleaned extra well, every so often I use Barkeepers Friend cleaner and it takes it back very nicely. I have a larger Cuisinart pan too, love them both. I cook everythin in them, rice in the small pan, and it cooks faster, spinach is perfect in the larger pan, do grilled chicken, vegetables, steak, making a cheeseburger with onions right now as I write this. It's perfect.",

                "reviewText": "A wonderful little frying pan. All stainless steel with an aluminium sandwich in the base makes for good heat transfer. If you cook on gas, as I do, keep the flames small and within the \"double\" base area.I guess you can tell from my spelling of \"aluminium\" that I am in the UK and could not find a similar product over here which is why I was so pleased to see this on Amazon.com (US) Delivery was very quick about 5 days.People have said than plain stainless steel isn't non-stick! It is if you condition the pan by heating a small quantity of oil until smoking just starts, allow to cool slowly and then discard the oil. Finally get the oil to the right temperature before breaking eggs into the pan and they will not stick. Much safer and longer lasting than coated pans where the coating peels off or becomes toxic if overheated.",

Dedique un par de d\u00edas a investigar que ventajas tiene usar un sart\u00e9n de acero inoxidable y en el proceso descubr\u00ed que ning\u00fan fabricante te dice como cuidar el sart\u00e9n que te cost\u00f3 mucho dinero ni mucho menos te aclaran en que tipo de cocci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s eficiente el suyo, el gran gancho es (en el caso de los de tefl\u00f3n) la promesa de que la comida no se te va a pegar. As\u00ed que sugiero a quien haya llegado a esta parte de mi rese\u00f1a leer el blog de \"el comidista\" dedicado a la comparaci\u00f3n de sartenes (\" ALUMINIO, HIERRO O ACERO INOXIDABLE: \u00bfQU\u00c9 SART\u00c9N COMPRO?\" y tambi\u00e9n ver los videos de youtuber \"recetas flipantes\" dedicados a como curar un sart\u00e9n de acero inoxidable.Dicho lo anterior, y dejando a un lado la utop\u00eda de tener un sart\u00e9n al que no se le pegue nada, puedo decirles que como simple aficionado a la cocina tom\u00e9 una buena decisi\u00f3n al comprar este sart\u00e9n para profesionales porque est\u00e1 hecho de materiales de buena calidad, tiene alma de aluminio y teniendole los cuidados adecuados me va a durar muchos a\u00f1os. Lo mejor es que aceptando que el buen cocinar requiere planificaci\u00f3n, dedicaci\u00f3n y paciencia he logrado preparar una muy ricas omelettes sin quemarlas ni dejarlas pegadas en el sart\u00e9n. Por cierto, si la comida se llega a pegar, lo lavas con agua tibia y jab\u00f3n y queda como nuevo.",
