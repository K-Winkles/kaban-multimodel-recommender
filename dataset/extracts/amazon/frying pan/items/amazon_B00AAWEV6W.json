                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A great non-stick pan for about 6 months",
                "reviewText": "I love cooking, it's one of my passions. So obviously I go through a lot of non-stick pans. I also always buy non-stick pans with non-toxic coating, and I feel like I've tried most of what is out there, ceramic, water based, etc. So far, my experience is that around after a year of owning a non-stick pan, the non-stick feature is lost, and most food tends to stick to the pan, ESPECIALLY eggs! Actually eggs are a complete nightmare when the non-stick is not new anymore. So I kind of just accepted that with the amount of cooking that I do, I have to buy a new non-stick pan every year.A friend of mine, who is a chef, suggested to try the Tramontina one, as its one of the best out there, so I ordered one on Amazon.The Tramontina has a ceramic coating, so it's super safe. Another thing that impressed me is that they offer a lifetime guarantee on it, with obvious exceptions of abuse and improper use. So hopefully if they feel confident enough to offer this warranty, maybe the pans are built to last longer?Obviously only time will tell. As of right now I only had this pan for less than 3 months, so it's too early to tell if this pan is different than the others. After a year I will update this review to reflect the performance of the pan at the critical 1 year mark.What I can say so far is that this non-stick has probably the best non-stick surface of all the ones I've tried. It's so slippery that most things you could easily cook without any oil or fat and they would not stick! It also feels good in the hand, it's nicely built, the silicon handle feels great, and the weight is just right, not too heavy, not too light.So far I'm quite impressed with this pan so I feel like it deserves 5 stars. Will see how it goes after one year!01/24/2016 Update: the nonstick pan has unfortunately lost a good amount of the nonstick quality. Re-seasoning the pan with oil temporanely solves the problem but it doesn't last very long. I would still say it's probably one of the best nonstick pans I bought, but I decided to remove one star because it's not even a year and I have to keep reseasoning it otherwise the food will stick.01/29/2017 2nd Update: I now refer to this as the 'STICK pan' because everything sticks to it, so even though I handled it with kid gloves (using only the soft side of the sponge to wash it, not the scrubber side, avoiding thermal shock, using only silicone spatulas, etc...) it's pretty much useless as far as nonstick goes. It was a fantastic pan for about 6 months or so, and slowly got worse until about the year mark when it became crap. At this point, reseasoning does nothing to improve it. Guess it's time to search for a new nonstick.7/15/2017 3rd update: I really don't know what to make of this pan. After everything started sticking to it like crazy, I realized that I'd just have to buy another. Out of desperation, I started using butter (instead of olive oil) to fry things, until I had time to get myself another pan. Once I switched to butter, nothing sticks anymore, not even eggs! It's almost like it's a different fry pan now. I've never heard that butter worked better than olive oil, and I don't understand how butter could possibly have made such a huge difference, but it did! I haven't made the switch back to olive oil, because I'm afraid things will start sticking again. For now, I fry only in butter, and the pan works well. I raised it back to a 5 star rating with this new development (from a 3 star). If things start sticking again, I'll change the rating accordingly. Has anyone else had a similar experience when frying with butter vs. oil? I really don't get it.",

It feels great and is shaped perfectly for it's job, including the curves at the corners- smooth flipping and scraping, easy clean.We just retired our all clad nonstick pair because the coating was coming up. They lasted a while, but that you're type of coating on those will inevitably give way and they end up in the landfill. I want to try ceramic in the hopes that it lasts much longer.This pan-One week of use, mainly eggs or pancakes. Medium+ heat maximum. It's very smooth and very nonstick. It balanced well and stays on the burner. It's light and thin, aluminum I assume. it heats evenly and fairly quickly.For us, This is a skillet, an egg and crepe pan, omelette etc. It's got the lower sides of a skillet.I'll update the review of anything changes within a year.",

                "reviewText": "I am following the manufacturer's directions and never using these on a higher heat than medium. Food cooks well and the pans are easy to clean. Just be aware that while the medium size lid fits the small skillet, the large lid is too small for the larger skillet. If you want to cover the larger skillet, you cannot fill it. The other caveat is that yes, a portion of the lid handle is silicone wrapped, but I burn my fingers every time I forget the hot pad. Putting a decorative metal piece in the middle of the silicone wrap is sheer lunacy as is not wrapping the entire handle. That said, I am still very satisfied with my purchase.",

But if you're anything like me, you run to reviews before purchasing anything. I bought this because it did get great reviews. I've been using it for 3 months and I have to say it exceeds expectation. I do follow suggestions of others such as ALWAYS LOW HEAT, butter as protection and never put water in hot pan. The deciding factor today to finally write review is that my husband burnt the hell out of Japanese pancakes, which have sugar, and I was sure the pan was done. It was burned almost black. But I didn't panic. I let it cool then soaked in dawn for a little bit. Guess what? Wiped right out, clean as a whistle! Five stars for this pan.",
