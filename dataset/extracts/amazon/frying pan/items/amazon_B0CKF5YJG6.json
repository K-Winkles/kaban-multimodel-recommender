                "reviewText": "Little by little I am getting rid of my teflon coated pots & pans - even if they\u2019re still fine - and replacing them with pans like this one. This is a very good stainless steel pan and with the tri-ply construction, I\u2019m finding it distributes heat nicely on my glass-top stove.Assembly of the handle was straightforward even if the supplied \u201cspanner\u201d I got didn\u2019t actually fit the nuts that were provided. All you need is a small crescent wrench in any case and most of us have such a thing.The handle is good too in that it is hollow and seems to keep pretty cool and something you can take a hold of even without a mitt. I prefer this look and construction over ones that are plastic or rubber coated.Clean-up, in my experience, has been a bit more involved than my typical teflon coated non-stick pan, but I figured that might be the case. Still though, with a decent non-abrasive scrubber, there's not too much elbow grease involved. Sometimes I can get everything completely off and sometimes despite my scrubbing there is a bit of patina to the surface of the pan. But still, completely smooth and usable. In fact, it often all comes off after the next use & cleaning.Ultimately this is a nice addition and I expect to make use of it for years to come. In fact, given it doesn\u2019t have a coating that will wear out, probably longer than some of the non-stick teflon pans I\u2019ve had.",

It appears to have already lost some coating on the outside. I will use it as a place holder until I have fundage to buy a professional stainless steel skillet. If you find yourself in a similar situation, that product may suffice for you as well.",

                "reviewText": "When I was talking to my mom about this pan, I told her I'd never used a stainless steel pan before -- she said that was wrong that she'd had some when I was growing up. So...I haven't used a stainless steel pan in my adult life, so I wasn't sure what to get. I had been expecting something more non-stick. Mom corrected me and told me that stainless steel isn't non-stick, so I was expecting the wrong thing. My biggest complaint with this was that in the description it said it was dishwasher safe. However, when I read the directions, it talked about cleaning and drying immediately. That's not a dishwasher pan. If you are familiar with stainless steel, and you already know that, then this is a great pan for you.",
