I really like having the matching glass lid, it would be hard to buy one of that size separately. One problem, the lid does steam up when cooking so I'm not able to see inside the pan. I'm using it for eggs, I do add a bit of butter, but I think you could do without any oil/butter if you prefer. The eggs move around the pan smoothly, no sticking. Cleanup is very easy. Time will tell if the non-stick holds up over time, but I don't plan to use it frequently. The red pan and lid are very cheerful.",
