I normally do not feel so compelled to write a review sooo far from purchase but this was an exception. They STILL are so non-stick after two years! Nothing sticks to them! Food just slides off of them and I have never had to scrub very hard. Every day I worry, one day, their magic will fade but that day has yet to come!The only thing food sometimes sticks to is the three little bolt attachments however, food normally quickly comes off after some scrubbing. The only slight issue with these is that the lid handle comes loose quite often\u2014a little annoying but the handle never fully comes off.Overall, I would buy these over and over again if I needed to but, two years in, and they still work like new!",
