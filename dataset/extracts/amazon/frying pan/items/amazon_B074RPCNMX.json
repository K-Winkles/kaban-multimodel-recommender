Everything packed so securely that nothing was damaged. Within a day, I was eager to make some fresh, homemade stovetop popcorn on my gas stove, using one of the glass lid pans. It was easy to shake the pan with the sturdy cool grip handle, watch the popcorn cooking inside the pot and know exactly when it was ready. Perfect. Nothing burned. Easy to handwash clean. Consider this to be my best budget cookware purchase for value, design, and quality.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not really a cookware expert, nor do I play one on TV. I'm not even into cooking at all actually. To be honest, I hate cooking. Well, I don't really hate it. But I don't like it. What I do like is when a product I buy on Amazon exceeds my wildest expectations. Not that my expectations for this cookware set were all that wild. Rather tame actually, considering my general aversion to cooking in general. I like to boil water (and I'm an expert at that, although I don't like to brag), maybe for a cup of instant ramen noodles or a cup of coffee, and once in awhile, if I'm feeling particularly adventurous and/or frisky, some mac-and-cheese or some stove-top stuffing. But I'd usually much rather open a bag of something (beef jerky and cheez-its?) than go near the stove. So maybe it was just lowered expectaions when I ordered this basic package after throwing away all my old stuff following a recent move cross country. I was looking for something practical and of some halfway decent quality at least, but I certainly didn't want anything too fancy, nor did I want to spend too much on things I didn't think I'd be using all that much anyway. However, after having had and used this set for some time now, I must say I am most impressed. Not downright giddy mind you, but impressed. I can't talk of cookware going for a lot more than this, but I'm not sure buying such would be worth the extra money anyway because these are simply great. Very solid and well put together, heat absorption and duration are excellent and the heavy glass lids add a lot to the general overall feeling of quality here. The non-stick surfaces are great and fairly scratch-resistant as well and cleaning is a breeze. As someone who does not like cooking, I find myself using these all the time now, and cooking up a lot of variety of recipes (a lot of my own creation) I never thought I'd try. Don't let the price fool you, and don't let any negative reviews dissuade you. If you're looking for a nice little quality cookware set, at a more than reasonable price, don't hesitate to buy. The big two-handled pot is my favorite and especially great for my new specialty. A big pot of \"Tommy's world famous, bacon, beef, and onions, honey bourbon barbequed beans,\" of course... ;-P",
