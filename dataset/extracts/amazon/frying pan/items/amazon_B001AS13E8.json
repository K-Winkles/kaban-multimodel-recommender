They are amazing for the price they are better then my green life pans that are 30$ each! I bought 2 and plan to buy 2 more of each size!

Finally I soaked it with 80% Alcohol. Mostly came off but not entirely. It will probably not have an effect since it is on the bottom. I just didn't like this. I only gave the pan an average rating because of thsi even though I haven't used it yet. Nothing lasts forever.",
