                "reviewText": "After a long awaited kitchen remodel, I treated myself to these new pans in December 2021. It is now April 2023 and I am writing this review about a product that is now very well tried and wonderfully true. They are the best frying pans I have ever owned, and more than a year later, they look and perform like brand new. Perfect surface. Nothing ever sticks, including eggs. These are fantastic.I will also add, these pans are extremely well cared for. They never go in the dishwasher (no big deal since clean up is sooo easy with this surface!). They are never subject to cooking spray. I do use olive oil, sesame oil, avocado oil, and butter when needed, but never an aerosol spray. They are also never used above medium heat, and no metal utensils ever get used with them. Some family members have received mild, slightly veiled threats about consequences if they break the rules for my pans. :-) The positive result is that these pans continue to be fantastic, pristine tools of the trade in my kitchen.",

If you let food cool in the pans it will stick a bit but washes off very easily.Haven't had them very long so not sure about long term durability but I only use plastic utensils, hand wash and store with an old rag between them to avoid scratches.Hopefully they are as non-toxic as they claim to be.",

                "reviewText": "I received these and waited to review so that I had some time to use in different ways. First, it's a great price for 2 pans. The finish appears to be durable with a couple of caveats. 1) don't use much or oil or butter and NO cooking sprays. 2) use only medium/low heat ranges. 3) hand wash. I use one or the other pan almost daily. They are kind of light weight but also well made and sturdy. My one complaint (ok 2) are very minor. One is that because they are really nonstick, food can fly around the pan too much. The second part of this is that the sides \"could\" be a little higher. But it's my fault that I didn't look closely at measurements. All in all, these are really great pans and should last at least a couple of years. I cook a lot and the appear brand new. I would purchase these or other configurations of them again. They're also very nice looking. Love the color.",
