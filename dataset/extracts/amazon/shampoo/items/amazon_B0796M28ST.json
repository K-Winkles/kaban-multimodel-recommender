The refreshing feeling it gave me was amazing, thanks to the combination of tea tree oil and peppermint in the formula. The shampoo also proved effective in addressing my dandruff issue; after just one use, I noticed that my dandruff had disappeared. Also no more itchy scalp. While it's too soon to tell how long the effects will last, based on my first use, I highly recommend this product. The formula seems to be effective in targeting and solving specific hair and scalp issues. It also has a pleasant scent and lathers well. Overall, I'm impressed with Kick Active Shampoo and plan to continue using it in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this shampoo because of it's natural ingredients, and specifically the tea tree oil and peppermint combination. It has a wonderful smell, very minty almost like mint ice cream. Typically tea tree oil products have a very distinctive smell, medicinal almost like kerosene, but this combination is perfect. Everything is perfectly balanced. Once you rinse the shampoo from your hair, the scent does not linger like perfumed shampoos.From time to time, I do have a dry, itchy scalp and was hoping this shampoo would help treat that. It's been two weeks now and I can say that it's definitely is helping. It lathers up nicely and has a refreshing tingle and coolness to the way it feels on your scalp. It rinses nicely and my hair is squeaky clean and doesn't feel like it's been chemically stripped. I bought this for myself, as my wife and daughters all have their own specialty shampoos, but I've noticed that everyone has been using my new shampoo, so they must like it too!",

I was agrivated enough to try something new. This product works well! After about a week and half of use I don't have any issues! It's is a little strong at first but sort of refreshing after you get used to it. Smells like peppermint!!!",

Gross? Yes. A nuisance? Absolutely. This stuff has completely taken care of my issues, smells refreshing (not chemical-ish) and is a good price for the amount you get. I also have prescription shampoo that\u2019s $80 and I have needed to use it! Highly recommend.",

This is the first that I've tried that actually gives me that tingling on my scalp feeling it work. Bought this by mistake I might add, the best oooops I've ever done. I'm sold, it lathers up really good, I use about a quarter size and that's probably too much as the lather is really good. Feels squeaky clean after rinsing, just amazing I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I have a decent head of hair that I'm overly concerned with losing some day, which is the main reason I purchased this product --promising to negate that-- over other sulfate/paraben/chemical-free shampoos. I'm a couple bottles in now and cannot say that it has made my hair any thicker (though it certainly hasn't made it thinner) but it does leave my hair feeling clean, soft, revitalized and full. Before discovering Kick and while attempting to make the switch from the 2-in-1 brands I grew up with, I tried a few other options that left my hair feeling frizzy and dry in the absence of conditioner. This hasn't been the case with Kick. After each use my hair is smooth, full of volume and very trainable. I find the peppermint/tree oil scent to be refreshing and enjoy the tingling sensation I get when applying it to my head. Dandruff has never been a big issue for me, but I do notice less flakes in the cold/dry seasons. Unfortunately, Kick isn't the cure to baldness, but overall, it's a great shampoo that's worth trying if you're trying to level up your hair care game.",
