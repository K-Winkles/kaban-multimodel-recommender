This feels very moisturizing almost like it's a conditioner. I like the smell and even the pump. I rarely buy shampoo a second time, because not many products like my hair, but I'm pretty sure I will buy this again when it's out. I noticed I could probably use half the amount, but I'm so conditioned to use a certain amount of shampoo in my hand I forget whenever I wash my hair. It seems a little bit will go a long way so you will get more bang for your buck. Definitely recommend for any who feel their hair is dried out.",

                "reviewText": "I had this shampoo for 3 weeks and I really like the scent. I wanted an organic shampoo because I thought it would reduce the chances of color being stripped from my hair. This year I bleached my hair to a really high level platinum blonde and I had it color treated to a brown so my hair quality is fried and super tangled. The shampoo is honestly magical, the first time I used it I could feel it enriching my hair and I really didn't need any conditioner. It detangles my hair and I do see the results of my hair being strengthened over time. I've stopped combing my hair since it's so fragile and the 2 pics show the before and after. However, I am a little unhappy that it claims to be safe for color treated hair but after a couple of washes, I do notice the brown fading and my hair turning lighter.",

                "reviewText": "I waited until I used almost the entire bottle before leaving this review.Initially this shampoo has a slight odor, but that did not bother me since it wasn\u2019t very strong, nor did it linger. There is no lather which took some getting used to. The trick for getting a bit of a lather is to split your shampoo into sections of your hair and to add more water, not more shampoo. I have always only applied shampoo to the top and crown areas and conditioner to the bottom. After only 2 uses my hair felt clean, airy and I could have sworn it also felt thicker. I loved it! After a week into using it I noticed that as I parted or flipped my hair over there were sections that looked greasy and clumpy. Figuring it was the argan oil I am not used to, I spent a bit more time rinsing out sections of my hair. The clean airy feeling of my hair was no longer there. If I had plans after work my hair looked and felt greasy and flatter than usual. I have long hip length, thinner hair so volume is usually non-existent, but this was getting worse. When my husband described it as greasy and gritty, I was done.I really wanted this shampoo to work and I think that I gave it a fair chance with suggestions made by others using sulfate/argan oil shampoo. I gave up on using it with about an inch left in the bottle. I tried! Maybe I will try another sulfate free without the oil. I gave it 3 stars for quick delivery, nice pump and the few days I loved my hair. The search continues.",
