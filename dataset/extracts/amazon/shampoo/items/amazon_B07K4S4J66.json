                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect but I read several reviews that gave these products 4-5 stars consistently. I ordered all 5 of their products. First off the shampoo and conditioner are sulfate and paraben free, important for colored hair. They are amazing by themselves. What I think made me a hardcore believer was the hair oil. What a game changer, even my hairdresser over 20 years, said, my hair looked healhier than ever. Was I pregnant? lolol. I only wash my hair 2 times a week, I'm 56 and going thru the change. I was losing so much hair in the shower and everytime, I blew dried my hair, my sink looked like I lost 100s of stands. On Sunday's I wash my hair. let it air dry, put on the mask for 30 minutes. Get back in the shower and wash and condition my hair as normal. When I blow dry my hair, I put the biotin hair oil on my scalp, rubbing it all in and also apply the biotin hair protective spray on my ends. I typically let my hair sit and do my makeup about 15 minutes and then dry my hair with my dyson. I'm telling you, this has been a life saver for me and noticed a huge difference in my hair texture, color lasting longer and my scalp less itchy. For anyone going thru perimenopause or menopause, I highly recommend these products. They've truly made a difference for me.",

                "reviewText": "My wife has very fine long hair (past her butt) and I have very long thick hair (almost to my butt) and this shampoo and conditioner works amazingly for us. You don't need to use much, and as soon as you wet and lather it both just magically spread and cover your hair. It leaves our hair feeling luxurious and full of body.The scent is very pleasant, reminding me of something close to an American Crew product. It's a very neutral scent that is perfectly fine for any occasion. We do supplement the conditioner with another Biotin based product that has a more berry smell to occasionally have a different smell, but we always end up going back to this conditioner because it works so well.My wife particularly loves this set, and we make sure to keep it constant on the Subscribe and Save. Have been using it over a year now and have been very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "The packaging was nice, nothing came damaged, the bottles are a nice, pretty teal color (couldn't capture the exact color on camera), and it seems to smell good so far. I'm going to start using it tonight and see what I think then (about smell, feel, how my hair feels after, etc). Everything I have read about things to do to help your hair strands become thicker when they have thinned out (individual strands becoming thinner) thus leading to your hair looking thinner and seeing your scalp more, that you typically don't see noticeable results until about 90 days, so unless this stuff makes my hair seem worse, I'm going to try to give it a good try for the full 90 days, then determine if I should continue using it or not. I do like that it doesn't contain all of these harsh chemicals and it has a lot of great ingredients that is good for your hair and scalp! Its a shampoo and conditioner set that seems to feed your scalp all the needed goodies! My hair became a bigger issue after the birth of our 5th child. I found out I had some health issues (which explained a lot of other issues I was having), those got fixed for the most part, but apparently my progesterone was low for too long and it didn't balance back out as we hoped. So my issue is caused from a hormone issue (as far as we can tell). I am taking progesterone and even after the first month, it has changed my hair color (you can research how this works...I did not color my hair, but it seems to unlock your normal hair color and bring it back to life when you take a hormone med to rise the hormone you're low in). I do know this will also aid in reversing my hair, but it could take awhile for it to work on its own, so I found other things to help do this and feel proactive about my hair issue. I also ordered liquid biotin to take, which should arrive tomorrow.Now, what I didn't really realize with this product is that I might get a coupon to get another set for free. A part of that requirement is to leave a review. They didn't say a 5 star review like most products that do this do, so that made me a little hopeful that these people leaving the positive reviews are being honest. However, it does make me a little bit more skeptical of the glowing reviews as well. I do plan on being completely honest and keep updating my personal experience with this shampoo and conditioner set, so hopefully others with the same or similar issues as mine can read an honest review. I have taken photos of my hair for before beginning use of this shampoo/conditioner set and I will be adding those photos to show my personal results with it. I am also going ahead and doing this review to get the free set as well, because honestly, getting the free set would help me to keep using this for the full 90 days. I'm not sure how long one set will last me, but I will also update on that as well.Thank you for taking the time to read my whole review and I will be as transparent as possible on this product and any product I review. Hope my review helps you.Update: well the free product is NOT another set as expected, but their hair mask, which im not sure if it would help for my hair at all, since it says it is for weak/color treated hair anti-breakage hair repair. I am trying to thicken hair strands that got smaller due to low progesterone levels (and possibly stress as well). However, I have used the shampoo/conditioner twice now and so far I am liking it! No strong smell, so it doesn't smell bad at all. There is a faint pleasant type smell, but nothing all girlie either, which helps for it to honestly be for men or women. WASH YOUR HAIR TWICE. Lather, rinse, REPEAT, then use conditioner, letting it sit on there for 2+ minutes. I will be honest and say I wasn't ever that person that washed their hair twice because I was brought up being told it was a gimmick. We were fairly poor and for years, we didn't even really get conditioner until my later teen years. Turns out, washing your hair twice during your shower before conditioning is a thing we should all do, especially if we want to get the benefits from the shampoo/conditioner we are using. The first lather, you may notice it doesn't sud up much. This is getting the top layer of dirt and oil off your hair/scalp. The second time you later, you'll notice it suds up more, and doing this 2nd wash will all all the nutrients in your shampoo to actually seep through your hair and scalp, whereas the first time all of the dirt, oil, pollution stuck to your hair and scalp created a barrier, not allowing the shampoo to really deliver the nutrients like it should. When I first used this shampoo, with the first wash, my hair felt dryer and like more hair might easily pull out, and I was concerned that doing the 2nd wash would make it worse. However, I did the 2nd wash anyways to give it the good, correct try and the complete opposite happened instead! My hair started feeling softer during the washing process and even softer as I was rinsing it out! And that was BEFORE the conditioner! I then applied the conditioner and let it sit while I finished with my other shower needs (washing, shaving, and rinsing off). After the rest was completely done and loofah was rinsed out, I then rinsed out the conditioner. My hair felt really nice. I went to bed with damp hair (I hardly ever blow dry because I know heat is bad for hair) and I woke up with my hair looking SO MUCH BETTER than it normally does when I go to bed with damp hair. And it felt so much softer, too! But, as a friend pointed out, I should give it a good weeks try before falling in love with this set because typically when you switch what shampoo set you use, the first wash does tend to make your hair feel softer. So I was skeptical still, keeping my opinions non-existent until I used it again. With the 2nd time using it, the same exact way (wash, rinse, repeat, conditioner, let that sit until the very end then rinse it out), I noticed less hair fell out, like way less hair than normal. And my hair felt the same way as the first time throught the whole process and after, even once it dried. Today was the 2nd time using it and I just started my liquid biotin drops today as well, so that oral liquid biotin has had zero effect on my results thus far. If I get towards the end of this shampoo and conditioner and I am still seeing that it keeps working like this, I will definitely order a 2nd set. As of right now, it is too soon to tell of it has helped thicken my strands or help encourage growth of my hair, bit as promised, I will keep updating this review as I know extensive reviews can be rather helpful to another person with similar or even the same issues.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT, UPDATE: The Conditioner pump bottle began to work during my second shower. It's a mystery as to why the pump didn't work until then, but I sent the new bottle back to Amazon as soon as it arrived!Well, I almost gave this 4 stars and not 5 because the Conditioner pump doesn't work. I had to order an empty 16oz pump bottle so I could replace it. But 4 stars wouldn't be a fair representation of the shampoo & conditioner products themselves....as I am loving the products!! The shampoo lathers beautifully and the conditioner is a treat- just luxurious & easy to use. My hair has more body, plumpness & shine to it after using these! I haven't used it long enough to know if it will help grow hair in my thinning areas, but after washing & conditioning with these, there is very little hair circling the drain-so that's a step in the right direction!I do recommend the Biotin & Shampoo & Conditioner set! (Just maybe be prepared and have some empty 16oz pump bottles around in case theirs don't work.)",
