Sad because I kinda liked it but will have to try another, plus its way too expensive for the size, only used it like 5 to 6 times and the product is about half way probs bit less than half, my hair is wavy and medium length id say about 6 inches on top and 2 to 3 on sides. Didn't really feel like it did do much to my hair that I noticed \ud83d\ude15. Also bottles are small and almost 12 oz when others in the market are 17+ oz so you'll be spending alot in the long run specially for a 15$ price tag. Gonna have to just take a loss and throw them out. Bottles are cool though might use them for something else.",

Left my hair feeling soft and clean. I usually have to wash my hair every day, but with this one I am on day two of not washing! 10/10 recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I am 45 years old. I have curly hair. I grew up in Singapore and now live in Florida; 2 extremely humid climates. I have been battling frizzy hair ALL my life, until now. This shampoo is a game changer. I never thought a shampoo could make such a difference. I used to invest money in conditioners, masques and styling products to battle frizz. With this shampoo, my hair care routine has been simplified. Twice a week, I wash with this shampoo, condition with NatureLab Hair Masque and style with Wen styling creme. That's all I need now. I get consistent results every time. It's no longer a guessing game as to how my hair will look when it's dry. Now, my hair is frizz-free, soft, manageable with a defined curl pattern, and never weighed down or greasy-looking. I used to hate my hair because the curls always looked so untidy and unhealthy from being so frizzy. At 45, I finally love my curls. I can't say that this will work for everyone. Sometimes, a little trial and error is required to get it right. This is my experience, and it's been an emotional one. Thank you, NatureLab.",

                "reviewText": "So, I really liked the shampoo in the beginning I even bought more bottles like around 3-4 more. I ignored the fact that my hair started to be thinner and I lost a lot of hair during the period I was using it. I stopped using it, and I feel like I lose less hair comparing to the earlier times.But it could also be related to something else such as during the period I was using it I colored my hair ( not the roots, like only the ends) or I had a stressful period which can also be cause if it.What I really loved about this product is the smell and I felt like my hair is more softer than before. But seems like I have to say goodbye to it",
