                "reviewText": "I love Dove shampoo, so when makers of Dove came out with this new scented shampoo I had to give it a try. I will say, I Love the scent and it keeps my hair cleaner longer. It doesn\u2019t smell one bit like coconut, it\u2019s between floral and crisp scent. Not over powering and it last for awhile. Stocking up on these before the prices go up.",

I had tried the Dove Oxygen shampoo, however, it left my hair super rough and damaged (split ends and dryness) thankfully this shampoo reversed those effects and I got my old smooth hair back :)",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE Dove shampoo. I was raised on Dove bar soap (I\"m old enough that that's what soap was...a bar), and I'm still in love with Dove products, especially their shampoo/conditioner. I've tried other brands, more expensive brands, but I do so love Dove shampoo. I have thick, long-ish hair and Dove always leaves it smelling fresh, shiny, and manageable. And you can't beat the price on this GIANT bottle of shampoo, trust me, I looked and compared by oz. per price. We order several at a time so we never run out (and it's just two of us, my bathroom cabinet isn't too happy about it though). If you like Panetene, give Dove a try, I honestly can say of the two, Dove blows Pantene out of the water.",
