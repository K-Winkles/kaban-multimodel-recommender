Both my mother in law and sister in law asked me \u201cdid you dye your hair\u201d, \u201cdid you get highlights\u201d, \u201cwhat did you do to your hair\u201d. I simply told them \u201cnothing just a new shampoo\u201d. I am a natural blonde and if anyone knows natural blondes our hair gets dark in the winter. Right now over 12 hours of using it.. my hair is not greasy, its soft, its very voluminous, & its some how even brighter! So far.. it\u2019s awesome :) The only thing i would have to say \u201cnegatively\u201d & not that it\u2019s negative in anyway.. is that there is no scent to it. It does not make your hair smell good, but it also doesn\u2019t make your hair smell bad. Your hair literally just smells like hair.",

I have a natural wave in my hair that makes it almost impossible to control the frizz. This shampoo and conditioner did it. That's saying a lot considering how many products I've went through. Honestly, I used less of this than I did my go to shampoo and conditioner. The smell isn't overwhelming. I have a sensitive nose and this doesn't irritate me at all. My scalp feels clean and not dry. I definitely recommend these products.",

This was recommended in an article about shampoos for fine hair and was a reasonable price, so I figured I'd try it out. Overall I am unimpressed.-The Shampoo cleans my hair just fine and the Conditioner does feel like it works nicely through my hair, but there is zero difference in the body of my hair and it made the frizz worse.-If you like a very foamy shampoo this is not for you, but I tend to stay away from most of the ingredients that make things foamy, so not a big deal for me.-The Scent in the bottle was almost overwhelmingly perfumey and unpleasant, and I almost returned it just for that. But I gave it a try and it's fine when actually used in the shower and doesn't linger in my hair, so that's fine.I will finish out these bottles because they're fine and do the job of cleaning my hair, and I can combat the frizz with a couple of drops of hemi-squalane on the ends, but they do not do their explicit job of adding volume, so I will be unlikely to bother buying them again.",

                "reviewText": "I have very fine hair that is prone to oily roots and thought this might be a good budget solution for me. The packaging is super cute and I love the pump dispenser. The scent of these are AMAZING - I love it so much that I wish I could get it in a perfume or something. The shampoo lathers up really well, but never actually feels like it washes out or gets the hair clean and the conditioner didn't seem to do much. After a shower, I was left with matted and knotted up hair that took forever to brush out which is unusual for me. I used the shampoo and conditioner together for about a week and it ended up making my hair insanely greasy at the roots and sticky/hard to brush through at the ends. It also made my scalp dry and itchy, giving me dandruff which I have never had a problem with. While I absolutely love the smell of this, the performance of this duo was by far the worst that I have experienced in about as long as I can remember. I am not sure how this is so popular!?",
