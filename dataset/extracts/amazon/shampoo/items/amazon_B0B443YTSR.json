I recently had keratin treatment done for my hair so i lost a ton of my beloved volume :( i Was using R&Co biotin thickening shampoo (which is also great, but wasnt giving me that umphff i was looking for). I saw some videos online about amika and ive known about the product for years but never thought to give it a try (idk why, no reason) anyways, long story short\u2026 i bought the liter volumizing shampoo (great value for the amount btw) after 2 shampoos i found my hair having great bounce and thickness, but also soft and smooth (that might be the keratin lol) but i had volume after keratin treatment ! Well, i did also purchase their volumizing mouse and blowout spray\u2026 but these products are a game changer !!!! Im sold and have a new favorite regular shampoo and hair products. Also they smell amazing, and packaging decor is so visually attractive!",
