I\u2019ve almost bought all the scents to try so here are my ratings so far:Apple and Pear 9/10 (smells like apples more than pears, but leaves a nice scent in the hair)Ocean Breeze 1/10 (even out of the container it smelled like a watered down mixed drink)Island Tranquility 7/10 (aloe scent)Citrus 8/10 (smells exactly like oranges if you\u2019re into that - have yet to try it in my hair as I bought the body wash)Coco Mango 1/10 (smells like milk right before it expires, no mango scent at all)",
