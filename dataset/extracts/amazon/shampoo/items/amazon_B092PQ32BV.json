Initially purchased for my wife, who was experiencing a receding hairline and hair loss, we've seen noticeable improvements in the fullness of her hair since incorporating this product into her routine. It's important to clarify that while this shampoo doesn't promote hair growth, it significantly enhances the appearance of density and volume, making it an excellent alternative for those seeking a non-medicinal approach to hair thinning. Unlike treatments like Minoxidil, which can come with their own set of concerns and side effects, Monday Hair Care offers a gentler solution. For anyone looking to combat hair thinness without resorting to more aggressive treatments, this product presents a valuable option. Its ability to deliver a visible increase in volume and a richer hair texture without the need for pharmaceutical interventions is something we've greatly appreciated.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this shampoo for a month. It is a good shampoo, cleans my hair very well.I usually wash my hair every other day if I didn\u2019t go out, I don\u2019t feel my hair become oily if I don\u2019t wash my hair second day by using this shampoo. ( some shampoo does not clean well because if I washed hairs yesterday but didn\u2019t wash today it will looks oil)Recently I have been washing my hair every day because I started doing exercise every day. It make me sweating so have to wash hair and take shower after it. Normally if I wash hair every other days I wash twice with shampoo, but since I wash my hair every day now I only wash ones and my hairs feel clean too.Scent: it smells so good, floral scent, not specific rose scent, more like combination of different flowers. The scent is very strong when just pump out from the bottle, but after washing and rinsing all the bobbles after cleaning hair, not much scents left on the hair, only very light scented.Softness: my own hair is very soft and smooth, so they are soft with almost all shampoos. Lol only one thing need to mention is this shampoo make hairs feel not soft after rinsing, but when hairs all completely dry, they become very soft and smooth again. ( I notice most all pricy shampoo I have used does the same. They don\u2019t perform like drugstore shampoo) which is very interesting.Before I purchase this one I felt it is pricy as an unknown brand, but still purchased it because I really like the packaging. After I received it I was like wow, really a big bottle definitely good size for the price, good value for the money.Overall I am very happy with this purchase and thinking to buy their condition and different purpose shampoos as well.",

I\u2019ve used it 4 times and it is now going in the guest bathroom for guests who don\u2019t bring shampoo. It\u2019s probably great for normal to dry hair but it\u2019s terrible for fine or oily hair.",
