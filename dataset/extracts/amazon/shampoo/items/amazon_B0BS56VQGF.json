Pantene Pro-V blends formula with Rice Water helps strengthen hair against damage and breakage. Is the shampoo clear or creamy? It\u2019s a clear shampoo that\u2019s clearly your choice for stronger, fuller-looking hair. Infused with a blend of rice water and Vitamin B5, it\u2019s designed to reduce hair loss and thinning due to breakage. Do I need to use Pantene Pro-V Blends Rice Water Conditioner with this shampoo? For best results and more great hair days, it\u2019s recommended to pair this shampoo with Pantene Pro-V Blends Rice Water Conditioner. However, it\u2019s still effective when used alone without the matching conditioner. Is Pantene cruelty-free? Pantene has been committed to ending animal testing for over 30 years. We do not test our products on animals and have been actively working with governments around the world to put an end to animal testing for good. Why is sulfate-free important? While sulfates are a common cleaning ingredient, some Pantene fans prefer alternatives that are free from specific ingredients. With that in mind, we created formulas that are free sulfates, parabens, and silicones while still delivering great hair.",
