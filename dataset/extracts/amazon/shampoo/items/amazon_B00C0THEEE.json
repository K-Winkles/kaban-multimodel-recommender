                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I have really oily hair/scalp and I wake up every morning looking like I dumped a bottle of oil on my head overnight. Unless I put my hair up on a ponytail and a cap to go for a walk/hike I won't dare leave the house without washing my hair. I must wash my hair every single day \"(I found this shampoo and use it every other day because it's kind of expensive. On the days I use it I notice my hair looks less shiny the following morning, not enough to not wash it but better. I have an evening outing I make sure to use it that day. I feel it helps control the oil a bit. It lathers nicely, has a pleasant scent and overall is a great product. If you have oily hair, this works",

I noticed on other reviews about leakage due to the cap not being on tight. I was lucky as I had a similar issue but because it was delivered in less than 24 hours there was very little spillage. Regardless, I will definitely be ordering again, thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I love this shampoo! I have waist length fine hair (lots of it) and it helps keep it feeling bouncy and not weighed down, also TONS of shine! Lemon is my favorite scent, and it delivers with realistic lemon scent, not the chemical kind. The scent does not linger much afterwards. I tried neutrogena's new grapefruit clarifier, and did not like it nearly as much. I don't use products or blow dry my hair, and I only wash my hair 1-2 times per week so this works for me most of the time. When my scalp got dry in the winter I did switch to H&S dry scalp care for a bit, but couldn't wait to use this again, as nothing else feels as light or looks so shiny. Definitely recommend!",
