It feels amazing. The very best way to experience Moerie, though, in my opinion, is to go to their website, and purchase the whole regimen. It is way less expensive than purchasing the shampoo or conditioner alone, and you will need all 4 products in the regimen to experience the amazing results that I've experienced. I color my hair, also, and this shampoo is extremely kind to the color, and has restored my hair to what it looked like 30 + years ago. I LOVE Moerie and their amazing products. Also, the products are CLEAN of all the bad stuff most shampoo products have in them.",

My hair was full of volume and I received soo many compliments. Then they changed the formula accordingly to Moerie customer service. The 2nd time I bought it was from Amazon. I regret buying this shampoo and conditioner. My hair started falling out just using it in the shower. My hairdresser said to me \u201cyour hair has really thinned out from the top\u201d. I am just devastated. Both Moerie shampoo & conditioner has been thrown in my trash.",
