Pay attention to how your scalp and hair react to the shampoo\u2019s formula, and decrease the amount of uses accordingly. Is it safe to use this shampoo every time you shampoo? Yes! It is a gentle and powerful formula which can be used as your go-to shampoo. Be sure to monitor your hair\u2019s progress, and avoid overwashing your locks. I have wavy, frizzy hair. Does this shampoo smoothen hair? Our Degrease formula is designed to clarify, exfoliate and nourish your scalp and roots. Follow it up with a hydrating conditioner, and apply from mid-length to tips for smooth hair. Do I still need to use a conditioner when using this product? You don\u2019t necessarily need to condition every time you use Degrease. Notice how your hair responds, and condition accordingly. Many people shampoo 2-3 times a week and condition 1-2 a week. Is Degrease Shampoo cruelty-free? Vegan? Yes, it is! Animal testing of any kind will never be acceptable at Maple Holistics, so you can enjoy a guilt-free personal care experience without compromising on quality. Plus, it is 100% vegan!",

                "reviewText": "So I have been moving away from all products that arent natural for sometime and have loved the results. However, my head is so oily that even after using only natural stuff and no extra product, it was still gross the very next day. I am not a 2 day hair person, tho I would love to be, unless the 2nd day it is in a pony tail. And even then you can tell. So I researched and found this. I mean, its straight up, in your face called DEGREASE! That must be for me! And the reviews were great as well, so I gave it a try. I am currently well into my 2nd bottle, the larger one this time after initially trying the small bottle. This stuff is pretty great. The first time I used it I scrubbed my head, rinsed then repeated, omg it felt SO much better. I pair this with the Silk 18 conditioner just on the length of my hair, occassionally just skimming my hands over the surface of my hair on my head if it feels dry, just barely making contact. That stuff is also pretty amazing. Since I have been using it, I can go every other day without washing my hair without it being nasty. It still produces oil and isnt fabulous 2nd day hair like some lucky lasses out there but its better than its ever been. My scalp feels better also, its not oily or caked with sebum. I now only wash my hair once, rubbing vigourously in my scalp with my finger tips and letting it sit a bit while I wash my face. The only time I do the \"rinse and repeat\" (cause who has time in the AM before work??) Is when I have gone a couple days without washing my hair and it feels extra built up, I wash twice to cut through the grease (ugh, seriously cant stand that word when referring to my own physical self) and my hair is back to awesome. With the silk 18 my hair feels clean, light (not bogged down with oils) and silky soft. It also lies nicely, where it should without excess frizz and it air dries nicely. I live in central FL, humidity is in all captial letters here most of the year, I noticed when I use these 2 products and let my hair air dry it still looks amazing, not derranged and out of control or shell shocked. I definitely recommend using both the Degrease and Silk18 together because the degrease can be drying on the length of your hair, but the Silk makes it like it never happened. I think both products smell really nice. I love it. But I love the smell of clean versus fruity/flowery/omgIamchokingwheneverImovemyhead. It leaves my hair smelling really nice but subtle and best of all, feeling great. Do yourself a favor and just give it a try, use it how it states to begin with then do what you feel your hair needs after that. Best thing is with both the shampoo and conditioner, it doesn't take gobs of the product to work. My hair is to the middle of my back and though it is fine, it is thick. This stuff does the job.",

                "reviewText": "I have very fine hair that I touch a lot so it\u2019s gets greasy quickly. This absolutely works at combatting grease and my hair has not felt cleaner. I recommend following instructions with leaving on for 2-3 minutes for max benefit. I use 2-3 times per week and do not need a ton of dry shampoo in between washes like I usually go . I was very surprised how well it worked. I personally think it smells great, like fresh herbs. The only thing I would say is that you def need to apply conditioner to ends of hair, this is a bit drying if you have crispy ends like me.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for one of my teen children who was showering and then within a few hours, seemed to have oily hair again. I read the reviews and did some research. This product seemed to have ingredients recommended for oily hair. We had tried other products from drug stores and grocery stores. This isn't a miracle solution, but it has definitely lessened the oily hair. Her hair stays clean and regular looking until the next shower. The tea tree oil scent is strong, but she likes it , so that is no issue for her, and it fades quickly. Overall, this has worked well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it months ago and did not use it regularly for the whole time.First, it smells like herbs which I wouldn't say I like.Second, it did help me with the oil control - I used to wash my hair 4-5 times a week, and I need to wash once another day using this shampoo product.However, this product brought the dandruff issue back and I have to stop using it. My scalps started to itchy then turned to inflammation after I used this product for about a month. I have to stop using it so that I can take other treatments.So please be cautious to use this shampoo if you had dandruff issues before. Other than that, I would say it does the oil control job fine.",
