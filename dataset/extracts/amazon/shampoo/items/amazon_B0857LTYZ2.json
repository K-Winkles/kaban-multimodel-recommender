                "reviewText": "I'm not one to typically write reviews, let alone feeling the need to write a novel after only one use of the product.. but wow! I have very thin, frizz prone, naturally curly hair (ringlets & waves) that I stopped dyeing and harsh heat styling about 3 years ago - its helped my hair grow longer but moisture and dry brittle feel was something I could never escape, causing my hair to tangle and frizz instantly, constantly and needing to carry around a brush in my bag.Well holy crap. This stuff is great, I was afraid like some of the other products I've tried that it would be too much moisture and weighs my hair down or makes it feel kinda greasy (my thin hair is very prone to oiliness). It's day 2 after my wash and my hair still feels very soft, no visibly signs of grease/oil build up, and I haven't needed to brush my hair since I styled/dried it with my blowout brush (the only heat I use on my hair - it's a game changer to those trying to reduce damage from straighteners and curling irons). The frizz control I'm seeing overall with my hair is great. I used the 3 minute mask as well and the double up of the conditioner and 3 minute mask does not leave any sort of residue or oily/heavy feel.I've tried everything, my hairdresser friends even take me to the discount beautify supplies stores to try to find good quality products that work for my hair.. nothing has compared to these products so far, 10/10!",
