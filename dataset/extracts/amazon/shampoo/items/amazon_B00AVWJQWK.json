                "reviewText": "I rarely take the time to review a household product. But I feel very strongly about this shampoo. First of all, it is affordable. I have always thought suave was a cheep watery shampoo. But not this one; it is nice and thick. It lathers up very nicely, and it cleans great. I have a pump dispenser in my shower, so I always count the number of pumps. I have notices that I use less of this shampoo. So not only is it inexpensive, it lasts a long time.If you have not tried this shampoo, you should. I'm pretty sure you will feel as I do about it.Oh, I should probably mention that I purchase this product on Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program. This program sends you your subscribed products on a schedule. You choose how long it takes you to use the shampoo, and then a new one shows up at your door when you need it. You do not pay shipping, and there is a discounted price for the products. I probably have around 40 products on this program. To name a few: toilet paper, tissue, paper towels, trash bags, dishwasher soap tabs, dish soap, hand soap, washing machine tablets multiple varieties of cookies, soup, canned and bottled goods. This is just a sampling. But many of these products are bulky or heavy. It is a pleasure not to have to go to the store and get them.I hope this review is helpful. Try this shampoo, I think you will love it.",

                "reviewText": "Don't be fooled by the low price of this shampoo. It's rich, creamy lather leaves your hair feeling smooth and shiny, but not greasy.I normally shampoo my hair with Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage shampoo, and I also use Ookisa (sparingly, because of the high price). Because my hair is very fine, I usually avoid shampoos that contain a high oil content, since they weigh my hair down so it doesn't look clean. But when my hair is just washed, it needs some help to keep away the just-washed \"fly-away\" stage. I was using a few drops of argan oil to keep it under control, so I decided to try this shampoo (and the matching conditioner).This shampoo tames it just enough. And it works just as well for me as it does for my roommate, who has thick, curly hair that tends to be frizzy. She told me last week to forget about ordering the more expensive brand she had been using, because this works just as well.",
