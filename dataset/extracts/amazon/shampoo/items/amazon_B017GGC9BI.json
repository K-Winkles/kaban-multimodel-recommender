                "reviewText": "This shampoo and conditioner gave me such volume for my baby fine thinner hair! I really am impressed. My hair is shiny and soft and full and stayed that way all day. The scent is very nice too. If you are scent-sensitive, you may not like this really apparent spicy scent but I enjoyed the experience. I ordered the sample to try as I've been disappointed before by shampoo and conditioner claims, but this is one I will definitely re-order in the full size.Lather: Enough lather for me - I'm used to sulfate-free shampoos that don't lather a lot.Rinsing out: The shampoo and conditioner both rinse out easily, and my hair feels thicker in the shower--there is a bit of a 'squeaky clean' feel, and that helps with baby fine hair.Look of hair: Very full and my hair even has some body, which it rarely does. Lots of shine.Feel of hair: soft but not too slippery (baby fine hair can be too slippery sometimes and fall flat). It feels as if I've been to the salon.Very happy with my order.",

                "reviewText": "This thickening shampoo is amazing and smells wonderful. It makes your hair so clean, thick, and lustrous. Yes, it's expensive, but you only need a quarter size in your hand to get a full use. Lathers easily and fills the whole bathroom with a beautiful scent. It makes my hair shiny and bouncy. My hair stays clean and full-looking for up to three days. I was really surprised with how long it actually keeps my hair feeling super clean and super thick. I am excited to try the thickening conditioner, as well as, other products from R+Co. The way I found out about this shampoo line is from a sample pack of thickening shampoo and conditioner that I received 'free' with some perfume samples from a department store in Las Vegas. I was traveling and thought I would try out the sample pack and was blown away with the super high quality so when I got back from vacation, I made sure to search Amazon and found this wonderful full size 8.5 oz bottle. I ordered it through my Prime account with free shipping. I REALLY love this shampoo and encourage others to not think twice about the price. Get your hands on this stellar product; you will be a customer for life.",

This is the first product I have ever purchased for my hair that actually does exactly what it says. My hair is fine and thin and this is truly the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used and I am 72 years old. When a product really does what it says. I am willing to splurge, and I think I have found my forever products. If you struggle with your fine and thin hair, I highly recommend giving this a try. I do not think you will be sorry. And the 8 ounce bottles are a perfect size for traveling so I can always have this product to use.",
