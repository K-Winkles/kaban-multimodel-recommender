                "reviewText": "I used this shampoo and the Phytojoba hair mask in the old formula for a number of years and loved it. I could air dry my shoulder length slightly wavy hair with no frizz. I stopped using it several months ago and my hair is now in awful condition and I can no longer air dry it because I have so much frizz. So I have gone back to using both again. My only complaint with the old formula was it was very thin and watery and easy to pour too much into your hand. This new formula is thick and creamy and you only need to use a small amount. It lathers well and the scent is even better than before. It\u2019s a lovely soft coconut vanilla scent. It\u2019s expensive but lasts me a long time and it works for me so I think it\u2019s well worth it.",
