                "reviewText": "First let me say, this is great shampoo! I couldn't be happier with it. A small, quarter sized squirt in my hand easily shampoos my hair and leaves it looking great and feeling super clean. I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO! I bought my first bottle in April of 2021 and it's been 7 straight months of daily use. I'm still not quite finished with the first bottle. I bought a second in October. So with a relatively short male hairstyle, the first bottle has easily lasted over 7 months. So the value is solid when you consider one bottle lasts this long.Now to the elephant in the room. Many of you are here because you are losing your hair and you came across articles online recommending this shampoo to combat hair loss. This is exactly what brought me here the first time. I went from a thick full head of hair at 49 years old to suddenly having my hair fall out like crazy. I went from a full head of hair to super thin really quickly. I'd had Covid and apparently it's a known symptom often developed in the months following recovery. Whatever the cause, I lost tons of hair fast and I was panicked!I am NOT going to tell you if you buy this shampoo, you'll get your hair back. I'm not going to tell you this is the cure to baldness. I don't think that would be fair or accurate.But I will say this. This shampoo is far more natural and far better suited to giving you the best chance you'll get in either keeping the hair you have or allowing your scalp to produce hair again. The shampoo is filled with all the things you body needs to have healthy hair follicles, less of the hair killing chemicals found in traditional shampoo, and I think it sets the stage for your body to have a fighting chance again. I think if your scalp has the basic innate possibility to produce hair again, this shampoo will give you body a chance to do just that.My exact regimen was to start taking biotin daily and using this shampoo daily. My hair has greatly recovered since doing these two things. I'll say I was able to recover 80 to 90 % of where I was before my sudden hair loss started.Is this shampoo the reason? Did this shampoo regrow my hair? I'm not sure I'd say either of those things outright. But I will say, this is a great shampoo that gave my body the best chance at kick-starting hair production again. I'm not sure I'd have the results I've seen without it.Whatever the truth, this is great, natural, healthy shampoo you won't regret buying. I intend to use it from now on. Give it a try, I think you'll be glad you did.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a good shampoo for all of my family, especially me. I say especially me as I have the worst hair of us all, for example it's thin, fine, frizzy, and most shampoos make it worse or have no effect, and I have tried so many over the years including many Argan oil types. This shampoo actually does make a difference, my hair looks a lot thicker, and it isn't frizzy if I leave it to dry naturally it goes nice and wavy.For the first time I can get away with not using a conditioner everytime my tangle teezer goes right through with ease, no tangles or knots. I lather it up in the shower and then leave it for the two to three minutes then rinse. It smells nice and my hair doesn't get greasy at all, just looks healthy. My sons and husband have normal hair and they like it a lot, at first my husband was skeptical as he thought it might make his hair greasy, it didn't in fact he comments it stays clean longer.You don't need much at all it's very concentrated so don't waste it by using to much, I just use a five to ten pence blob, this makes it economical, a bottle is lasting us for ages. I recommend this shampoo and advise to leave it on as per instructions, I presume for the ingredients to penetrate.",
