            "Hair Thinning Shampoo for Men and Women: If you are experiencing or are concerned with hair loss, hair thinning, or excess shedding Revita is for you. Revita shampoo by DS Laboratories is a leader in hair loss and hair thinning products. Our shampoo starts acting on your scalp, from the first day revealing healthier, thicker, and more voluminous hair.",
            "Protect and Strengthen Hair: Revita is created with top dermatologists and formulated with key and effective ingredients that act against hair thinning while also protecting and strengthening hair. By combining ingredients like DHT Blocker caffeine, Biotin, antioxidants, hydrating molecules, and amino acids, Revita delivers an effective shampoo to promote hair growth.",
            "Improve Your Hair Appearance: Revita improves the look, feel, and texture of your hair. From the first use you will notice hair feels healthier, thicker, and has more volume. Revita works to not only support hair growth, but to strengthen hair from the root to prevent future breakage and give you your healthiest hair yet.",
            "How To Use: Massage Revita shampoo into wet hair. Leave on for 2 minutes and rinse. For best results use 5x per week in combination with Revita conditioner. *Most users can see results within 90 days of consistent use. Please note that shedding may occur at the beginning of use as new hair growth will push out old hair making room for healthy new hair. Results will vary depending on the severity and duration of hair loss and hair thinning.",

The one thing I've noticed more than anything else is that my hair looks thicker and fuller and, oddly enough, a little darker! I have even used both the shampoo and conditioner on my beard and noticed it looks much fuller and feels better as well. As far as any hair regrowth the jury's out on that one. But I will say I know it can take time to see those kind of results. My only criticism, and it's a mild one, is you can't be in a hurry to get ready in the morning if you follow the usage directions.",
