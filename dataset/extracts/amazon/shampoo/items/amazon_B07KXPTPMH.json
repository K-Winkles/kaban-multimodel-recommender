                "reviewText": "I could not wait to write this review. My hair has been thinning lately, when I took a shower there would be so much hair in the drain, and I have been watching thinning spots by either side or my bangs, where my hairline was actually receding. I was not liking it. So I went to amazon to search for a product/shampoo that would promote new hair growth and stop losing my hair. I wasn't really expecting much to be honest. I came across this Biotin shampoo and I read all the reviews. People actually saying that after a few uses they could see new hair sprouting. And there were even some pictures that looked pretty encouraging. But still, I just couldn't imagine that a cure for this horrific problem could be so easy. So I ordered it 2 weeks ago. I washed my hair immediately the day I got it in the mail. And the first thing that floored me there was NO hair in my hair catcher in my drain after I washed my hair. I laughed out loud. It has now been less than 2 weeks, I've used it like 3 or 4 times, and I have NEW HAIR SPROUTING like new grass in my thinning spots. I swear to you I do. On both sides of my hairline, AND filling in my hairline in my bangs. I don't even know what else to say but that this stuff is a miracle. Nothing less. And there is either none, or close to no hair loss when I wash my hair. It's almost ridiculous. I just ordered a biotin leave in serum to keep the ball rolling, but I will tell you, anyone who is on the fence as to whether they should try this shampoo, should! I'm almost laughing. I have baby little blonde hairs sprouting up this fast. And my hair, how it feels and smells, it's unbelievably fabulous. And this stuff costs way less than those fancy shampoos. If I didn\u2019t see this with my own eyes, I would not believe it. What people are saying here is true, I am so glad I didn't just say it sounded too good to be true and blow it off. Thinning hair is awful, whether you are a man or a woman. All I know is my brother spent tons for his hair plugs, and he needs them again. I don't know if every single person is getting these results, but I am , I think you should try it and see. I will NEVER stop using this shampoo.",

So I reluctantly bought this shampoo, worried it wasn\u2019t going to work as well as my last purchase, but instead I now see I am losing almost NO hair in the shower and only about 50 a day. Before I was at least losing 150+ a day and this shampoo made it nearly stop. So I would say it\u2019s definitely worth the money.",
