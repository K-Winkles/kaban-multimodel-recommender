                "reviewText": "I usually use Pantene for my 2 in 1 shampoo but I thought I would try something new. I really like this one! First of all it smells great without being overpowering. It has a thinner texture than my usual but that just made it easier to rise out. I always spray my wet hair with a detangling spray after using a 2 in 1 so combing through my thick hair isn\u2019t a problem. This shampoo did a great job making my hair feel clean, after it dried it felt very soft and manageable. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a shampoo and conditioner in one. I rotate with Nexxus shampoo and conditioner that I bought from Amazon when I\u2019m not in a hurry!! Also, I should mention that I\u2019m extremely sensitive to a lot of products, and this didn\u2019t irritate my skin or my scalp. A win win for the price!!",
