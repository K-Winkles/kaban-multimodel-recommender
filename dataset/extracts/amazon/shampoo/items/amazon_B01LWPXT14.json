This shampoo works best as a \u201cclarifying\u201d type shampoo for my hair (wavy/curly and a little oily) and does dry it out a little if I use it daily. I switch between this and the coconut or gardenia after the coconut started to leave my hair a little sticky after using it for more than two years. Possibly combination with hard water, I haven\u2019t figured it out yet. The gardenia is more smoothing and silky but the scent is too strong for me (although otherwise pleasant) so I will likely stick with this and the coconut to alternate.",

I will never order anything directly from them, instead I will pay more to have someone who cares about quality ship this to me. Each time i have bought this product from amazon, they have failed to secure the top and there is shampoo everywhere in the box and if they ship it with anything else everything else is unprotected and covered in shapoo. You spend half an hour cleaning everything up and youve lost half the bottle.The product itself is very nice smelling and feels great on your hair. I will purchase again--just NOT from Amazon.",
