I have seen such a difference, as has my hairdresser. The smell is absolutely amazing and my hair feels healthier and moisturized. The price seems high, but you use just a little each time, so this lasts quite a while. Highly recommend if you need to correct some damage, or are just looking for beautiful soft hair.",

It\u2019s the next morning and I\u2019m so eager type this review now that my hair is fully dried and I can FEEL the difference! I\u2019ve never had a hair product amaze me like this after the first use!! I\u2019m 4 months postpartum and losing handfuls of hair, someone in a fb moms group said this shampoo and conditioner saved her hair so I ran to purchase. HOLY COW! First off I only wash my combo 2b and 2c type curls once a week. I right away noticed way less hair fall out in the process of washing out the conditioner, I slept with my hair semi damp which is usually a no no unless I want to wake up with a wild frizzy mess, and misshaped curls. I looked in the mirror this morning expecting that mess, but nope! I\u2019ve never seen my curls so defined and bouncy, not to mention how clean and healthy my hair and scalp feel! My hair is so dull lately and I can see the life back in it, even after losing handfuls of hair daily for the past month it\u2019s looks so voluminous right now! This is a game changer and I\u2019m hoping these results last with every use over the course of time, if so I\u2019m sold on this brand and will try their other products without a doubt!",

                "reviewText": "amika the kure bond repair shampoo arrived on my doorstep quickly! I felt my hair was damaged due to processing and using the wrong products. I decided to try the amika products and I am glad I did. After only the first wash my hair felt more hydrated and less 'frizzy'! The shampoo suds up lovely leaving your hair feeling clean and hydrated. I complement the shampoo by following up with the kure conditioner. Con: I do wish it was a little more affordable and came in a larger size.",
