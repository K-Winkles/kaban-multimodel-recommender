I am often not big on overly smelly products, and this one did not disappoint. It is a really pleasant smell that makes me feel nice, clean, and adds a bit of confidence as well. Sticks with you throughout the day, but is not overpowering. Cleans and lathers very nicely and I plan to add the same body wash scent next. Great purchase!",

I caved and decided to try it and haven't looked back since! This has a deep, rich lather that smells absolutely amazing and lasts all day. Within 2-3 weeks, I could tell a huge difference in how much softer/silkier my hair was as well as how it kept the glossy sheen for 24+ hours! Although a bit more expensive than competing brands offering mens 2-in1, I definitely feel as though this is the best on the market at the moment and worth every penny!",
