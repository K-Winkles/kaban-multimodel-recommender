There's nothing particularly special about it, except that Avalon keeps some of the potentially harmful ingredients out of their shampoos. You have to read labels carefully these days because there are so many pretenders who try to make their packaging look natural or organic.If you shampoo your hair daily, you probably don't need to use very much each day (a little squeeze will do just fine). This bottle can last a long time. It's a bit expensive, but not nearly as expensive as some brands that deposit a bunch of junk in your hair and pretend to be high-quality because they are \"professional salon formulas\" or some such nonsense.",

                "reviewText": "I had to come write this review because I have been struggling with an itchy, flaky scalp for awhile now, which is embarrassing as a woman. I found this online and decided to try because of the reviews. It is truly WONDERFUL! It has helped me so much and I have zero dandruff now. I bought a little scalp massager gadget to go with it and the shampoo makes my scalp feel cool and tingly. I leave it on for about 5 minutes to let it really sit on my scalp. I will say that my hair feels like it would be really tangled after I use this because it\u2019s so clean but I just use a tad bit more conditioner and I\u2019m shocked how easy the brush goes through afterwards. I\u2019m not a huge fan of any kind of mint smell but this with the tea tree actually smells nice. It\u2019s not going to smell all fruity like I usually like but it\u2019s so worth it. I immediately bought 2 more bottles. I\u2019m in love with it.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought this product at Whole Foods on a whim.I have fine, very oily hair + scalp and have always had an issue with hair loss.This shampoo does not seem to foam up as easily as other shampoos but it makes up for it by making my scalp and hair less oily.I have also noticed a huge decrease in hair falling out, which makes me very happy because I would find a massive clump of hair in my hair catcher at the end of each shower.The smell is also mild and pleasant, nothing to harsh.This also makes my hair soft BUT I noticed that after several weeks of using, sections of my hair started to dry out.Since I have fine, oily hair I can't use conditioner but I have found that using rinse-out treatment on the ends of my hair fixes this problem.All in all, a great product that minimizes hair loss and hair oiliness.",

                "reviewText": "I started using this product a a little over a week ago. I bought the shampoo and the conditioner because I'm switching all my products to natural /organic /vegan ones so it doesn't harm the environment or my body. This was the first natural shampoo I've tried.The shampoo itself is very astringent. My hair is very fine and once I put it on, my hair fells like rubber. It would be ok if the conditioner fixed it later, but that's not what happens. The conditioner doesn't do much. When I try to comb my hair, it's extremely tangled and not soft.I usually wash my hair every other day, and sometimes I even skip 2 days without washing it. But with this product, if I wash my hair in the morning, at night it will feel like it's dirty again.To make things worse, my scalp, the back of my neck, and the area behind my ears started itching, as if I had spent many days without washing my hair. At first I thought it was just dirty and I should just wash it. But then I started washing it pretty much every day, and the reaction just got worse.I just used some allergy cream (at least on my neck and back of ears, since the scalp has hair and it's hard to use creams...) and I'm hoping it's gonna help the itchy feeling. It's driving me crazy. I've never had allergies to any personal care products before. I'm surprised a \"natural, organic, non gmo\" product gave me that reaction.Unfortunately, this product is not eligible for returning. So it will just need to go to trash. Very disappointed.",

Make sure you buy the corresponding conditioner too. I will definitely buy this again in the future.",
