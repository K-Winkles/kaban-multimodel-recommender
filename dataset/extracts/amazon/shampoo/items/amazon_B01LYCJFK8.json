Got my second bottle today and I love how it makes my hair feel soft and wavy. I kept hearing people say find what works best for you and I truly have found what works best for me. I only use two pumps because it lathers so well and that\u2019s how it\u2019s lasted this long for me. 100% satisfied",

Highly recommend this product! The fragrance is wonderful too!",
