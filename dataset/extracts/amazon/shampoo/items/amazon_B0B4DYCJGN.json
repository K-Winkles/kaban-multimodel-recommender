One thing might be undermining the strength of the other? No idea but I myself am done with this now. This regime did not help at all and hurt greatly. They need to get down to the basics of what they have faith in and not pile on products they dont' have faith in as something here really hurt my hair. I'm done. This science is clearly not perfected. They need to figure this brand out.",

                "reviewText": "Having recently incorporated the K18 Peptide Prep pH Maintenance Hair Shampoo into my hair care routine, I'm impressed by its performance and hair-nourishing qualities. This cleansing shampoo, packed in a 250ml bottle, stands out as a color-safe option that aligns with vegan and cruelty-free principles.The key feature of this shampoo is its pH maintenance, ensuring that it not only effectively cleanses but also helps to balance the pH levels of the hair. This is particularly beneficial for maintaining the health and vibrancy of color-treated hair. The formulation is gentle yet powerful, leaving my hair feeling clean without stripping away its natural moisture.Being vegan and cruelty-free is a significant plus for me. It aligns with my values, and I appreciate the commitment to ethical and sustainable practices in the beauty industry.The shampoo lathers well, and a little goes a long way, making it an economical choice. The absence of harsh chemicals and sulfates contributes to a pleasant and mild fragrance.While it comes at a slightly higher price point, the K18 Peptide Prep pH Maintenance Hair Shampoo's effectiveness in maintaining color, coupled with its ethical considerations, makes it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a quality, cruelty-free shampoo that promotes hair health.",
