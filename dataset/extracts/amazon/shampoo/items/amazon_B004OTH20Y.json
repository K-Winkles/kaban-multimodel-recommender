It doesn't smell like tea tree oil (which would be okay with me), but instead has a slightly odd perfume smell. I'm allergic to many scents, but not this. It's stronger than I like, but it wears off pretty quickly.If your scalp needs help, this is the shampoo you want. To the manufacturer, please please don't change the ingredients. It's too good for that.",
