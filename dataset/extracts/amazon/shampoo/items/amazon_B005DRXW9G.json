                "reviewText": "This shampoo is fantastic and I am willing to pay a ridiculous price for it, but I regret getting it from Amazon. Because of increased shipping costs, Amazon is cutting corners on packaging the products they sell. Even though the bottle had been shrink wrapped, the lid hadn't been taped beforehand. So it came loose during shipment and the shampoo leaked all over the inside of the plastic wrapping. It was a mess. We buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and this carelessness in packaging is becoming a common issue, so until they begin better packaging practices, I won't buy anything that can leak or break.",

I usually use the repair style but decided to try the extra volume this time and I love it too. It has helped give me more volume as my aging hair has lost a lot of its volume over time. I am 65 and love the way this product performs for me!",

With my previous shampoo, I would never skip the root booster after and the volume mousse but I've been skipping those after I switched to this shampoo. I still use them when I want the extra oomoh but my hair isn't flat if use just this shampoo and let it air dry. Its just a bit pricey but you actually don't need so much, I'm thinking it'll last me long time.",
