                "reviewText": "UPDATE: FEBRUARY 12, 2017- My Two Year PURA D'OR Anniversary. Don't think I have ever stayed with one product for so long. It still is working for me!!!QUICK REVIEW: This shampoo helped regrow my postmenopausal (plus recent hysterectomy) thinning hair. It has no silicones (silicones clog pores) but you might need a no silicone conditoner for detangling afterwards. Use it faithfully for at least 3 months. Take before and after pictures to see how your hair is progressing. Read my full story when you have time. It will tell you how the first year went. Also, I have just purchased and left a review for Pura D'OR Deep Moisturizing Conditioner, which pairs nicely with the shampoo especially of you have dry, curly, or hard to comb out hair. It also is my pick if you are used to regular shampoo and conditoner because it will gives hair more \"slip\" but does not weigh it down. If you have hair that goes flat in one day (fine and oily) then go with the regular \"blue label\" conditioner. I am very impressed with all of these products. Please email me if you have questions and please like my review if it helped you. I PAID FULL PRICE AND WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW. I have no interest or affiliation with the manufacturer or seller.MY STORY: I was skeptical when I purchased this shampoo 3 months ago. So skeptical that I took a before and after picture to see if it was working. I had pretty full hair until I became of a certain age. Slowly I could see my hair thinning, especially in the front. I went to a dermatologist who told me there was not much I could do. I wanted to tell myself that it wasn't true but I would not only find hair all over the shower but everywhere else, too. As far as me, I shampoo daily and have for many years. This shampoo has a pleasant smell (reminds me of incense) but not overpowering or lingering. You will probably need a conditioner afterwards as it appears to be very cleansing. I have colored hair and it did not strip the color. My hair now has body, much more shine and is noticeably thicker. I think you can see that by my before and after pictures. I hope you will give it a try before you give up on your hair.SIX MONTH UPDATE: After six months my hair has stayed thicker with no hair loss. I do continue to use Pura D'or Premium at least three days a weeks. I do switch off with low poo shampoo or apple cider vinegar a few times a week also. Like many women, my hair feels dryer or oiler as the seasons and weather changes. Also, even with great products sometimes switching it up is good! By the way, it pays to stick with this shampoo exclusively for at least three months. It takes time for hair to grow and to see a difference. Hope the update can help someone who is agonizing over thinning hair.Picture: I am adding two pictures (3&4) taken today 7/3/2015. I am 6 months out from first using this shampoo and about 5 months out of using the Pura D'or conditioner, which I left a review for today. Finally. As you may notice I need a touch up and also I am holding my hair back tightly like the before picture. The last one is how I normally wear my hair today. No more shortie bangs to TRY to cover the bald spot(never works!) Any questions please ask.ONE YEAR UPDATE: I placed my first order of Pura d'or Gold Label on 1/7/2015. So, I am pretty close to using it for one year. I took a few pictures today. I don't know if I really have any improvement over the last 6 months, maybe a little. Certainly, I have much improvement over my very first picture. My hair was broken off and very sparse at least an inch or two in. My scalp looked red and a bit angry. My fine front hair is definately a little longer at this point and you can't see my scalp anymore. My hair dresser said my hair was overall a bit thicker in December. This is the first time she has said that and I ask her EVERY time!! I have gotten used to using this shampoo which has no silicones and makes your hair a bit tangled before conditioning. I was so used to the slickness of silicones that I figured that this shampoo was drying out my hair. It was not. I have learned that the silicones can build up and also lead to hairloss. So it is a reason to keep using this shampoo and conditioner or at least one that is silicone free. I do recommend trying the Pura d'or Conditioner. It is very light, untangles my hair and a good match with this shampoo. I have left a review for it, if you are interested in looking at it. [...]",

Anyways, I figured now is the time to do the review.My hair was thinning horribly and it was frustrating as well as embarrassing. Oh How I wish I had done a before picture!My hair feels and looks thicker, the areas of thinning seem to have disappeared. I don't think its because of hair growth, but more that my hair is fuller.I will continue using this shampoo for the remainder of my days on this earth. I have no regrets buying this and will be referring people to try this product! It's amazing!",

                "reviewText": "Oh boy, where do I even begin with the PURA D'OR Original Gold Label Anti-Thinning Biotin Shampoo? This stuff is nothing short of miraculous. As someone who has battled with thinning hair for years, I was on the hunt for a hair thickening product that actually worked. And let me tell you, this shampoo delivered in spades!Firstly, the scent is out of this world. It has this natural earthy aroma that instantly transports you to a serene forest. It's like having a mini spa treatment every time you step into the shower. I genuinely looked forward to washing my hair just to experience that delightful scent.Now, let's talk about results. The PURA D'OR shampoo is clinically tested and boy, does it live up to its claims. Within just a few weeks of use, I noticed a significant reduction in hair fall. My brush wasn't covered in strands of hair anymore, and I could run my fingers through my hair without feeling like I was losing half of it.But wait, there's more! This magical potion also thickened my hair. My once lackluster locks gained a newfound volume and bounce. It was like I had stepped out of a hair commercial every time I styled my hair. I couldn't help but catch glimpses of myself in every mirror, giving myself a cheeky wink.Even though I have color-treated hair, the PURA D'OR shampoo didn't fade or strip away the vibrancy of my dye job. My hair stayed lustrous and shiny, and the color remained intact. Talk about a win-win!Now, let's get personal. This shampoo has become a part of my daily routine, and I don't plan on ever letting it go. It's like a trusted friend who never fails to make me look and feel amazing. And the best part? People noticed. Friends, family, and even strangers couldn't help but compliment my new hair. I went from having thin hair to being the envy of everyone around me.And let me tell you, the journey to discovering PURA D'OR's Gold Label Biotin Shampoo was not an easy one. I had tried countless other hair thickening products that promised the moon and the stars but failed to deliver. My bathroom cabinet was a graveyard of half-empty bottles that did nothing but drain my wallet.But then, I stumbled upon PURA D'OR. I was intrigued by its claims of being a herbal DHT blocker, which is known to contribute to hair loss. I had read positive reviews online, but I knew I needed to try it for myself. And boy, am I glad I did!One thing that stood out to me about this shampoo is its natural ingredient list. It's packed with biotin, argan oil, and other botanical extracts that nourish and strengthen the hair follicles. I felt confident knowing that I was using a product that was not only effective but also gentle on my scalp.I must say, the results were truly mind-blowing. Not only did my hair become thicker and fuller, but it also felt healthier overall. It had a natural shine and bounce that I hadn't seen in years. I couldn't resist flipping my hair around and watching it gracefully fall back into place. It was like I had my own personal fan blowing through my locks!The effects of PURA D'OR's shampoo were not just temporary. With continued use, my hair continued to improve. It felt stronger and more resilient, and I could confidently style it in different ways without worrying about excessive breakage. My hair became my best accessory, and I found myself experimenting with new hairstyles and getting compliments left and right.Now, let's talk about the value for money. The 16-ounce bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way. The shampoo lathers up beautifully and spreads evenly through the hair. I found that I only needed a small amount each time, so the bottle lasted me for months. That's a big win in my book!I also want to share a funny incident that happened while using PURA D'OR's Gold Label Biotin Shampoo. One morning, in a rush to get ready for work, I accidentally squeezed out way too much shampoo onto my hand. I stood there, staring at the overflowing palm full of shampoo, unsure of what to do. But hey, I figured, why not go all out?I applied the excess shampoo to my hair, creating a massive lather that could rival any bubble bath. My hair was transformed into a foamy cloud, and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. I must have looked like a walking shampoo commercial! But you know what? The results were amazing. My hair felt extra clean and refreshed, and the volume was out of this world. I couldn't help but strut around the house, pretending to be a shampoo model, much to the amusement of my family.But jokes aside, the PURA D'OR shampoo has truly been a game-changer for me. It has not only transformed my hair but also boosted my confidence. I no longer feel self-conscious about my thinning hair. Instead, I embrace my luscious locks with pride and carry myself with a newfound swagger.The compliments keep pouring in, and people can't help but ask me what my secret is. I happily recommend PURA D'OR to anyone who will listen. Trust me when I say, it's worth every penny.In conclusion, if you're looking for a hair thickening shampoo that actually works wonders, the PURA D'OR Original Gold Label Anti-Thinning Biotin Shampoo is your holy grail. With its incredible scent, clinically proven results, and ability to transform thin hair into a voluminous masterpiece, it's a game-changer. Don't waste any more time with other products. Get your hands on this shampoo, and get ready to turn heads wherever you go!",

I\u2019m not certain what they changed but I believe they may have increased the amount of Tea Tree oil in it. And that\u2019s a very potent scent I never want to smell too much of.For what it\u2019s worth I own a large collection of colognes and make my own candles so I have a very good sense of smell \u2014 this bottle definitely smells different from my last 2.It does lather and clean the hair well though, so hopefully it\u2019s still a good product overallI\u2019d give my last 2 bottles a 5 Star rating, but this one gets just a 3 for now.I will adjust this review if I change my mind on this one...",
