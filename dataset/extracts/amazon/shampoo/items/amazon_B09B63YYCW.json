Firstly, the biotin creates a coating around each strand to increase space between the hair. Additionally, the keratin reduces breakage to give a fuller appearance. Will this strip my hair of color? No. Our biotin shampoo is safe to use on all hair types. Thanks to the sulfate free formula, this volume boosting shampoo is gentle on color treated hair. Better still, it's also fine to use on hair that's been treated with peroxide and bleach. Will this help stop my hair breaking? Yes. Not only does our shampoo help you achieve voluminous looking hair, it has also been crafted to assist in reducing breakage. It's because of the enriched keratin that we've added to the formula. Keratin strengthens hair and stops broken strands. Will this make my hair feel softer? Yes. One of the things that our satisfied customers frequently report is how this biotin shampoo helps soften brittle hair. We've enriched our shampoo with silk extract which has been specifically chosen to give you luxurious and soft feeling locks. Can I use this shampoo every day? Yes, absolutely. Bellisso\u2019s biotin shampoo is ideal for everyday use when you\u2019re trying to repair damage and achieve thicker looking, stronger hair. Leave it in for a few minutes and rinse before the biotin conditioner.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this is not the cheapest shampoo available, but...It takes just a very little to create a nice lather. This is my second bottle. The first bottle lasted me a whole year. And I rarely use anything else. It makes your hair feel silky smooth. The scent is light and pleasant for males and females. As far as hair growth, that is hard to tell for me. I have a whole regime going on so I can't say what part of it works or doesn't. My head of hair is fuller than it was 10 years ago. Overall this is the best shampoo I've ever used. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I have been losing my hair and it has become thin. This shampoo and it's accompanying conditioner leave my hair very soft, shiny and manageable. I have noticed a decrease in the loss of my hair but I don't know what is responsible for that since I also use a product sprayed on my scalp.I recently ran out of the conditioner and had to replace it. It's definitely a must for me",

                "reviewText": "I don't dye or bleach my hair, 90% of the time let my hair air dry (no heat styling), and have been sulfate free in products for years.I've have autoimmune issues, and can be reactive to many styling products.My scalp used to hurt seemingly randomly, then I'd lose up to handfulls of hair in 2 to 3 days I don't know what caused this to happen, but it was frequent. I've tried a few different shampoos and conditioners, even the no-poo method (helped but left my hair in a constantly oily state), and nothing really CONSISTENTLY helped much until _this_. The shampoo (along with the conditioner) stops my scalp pain for up to 40 hours, and I now have barely any hair fall (between 5 and 20 strands per wash, and minimal shedding between washes). There is one spot where the hair doesn't seem to have grown back, BUT I'm not losing any more hair from that area. A wonderful reprieve. My hair is not as thick as it used to be in my teens, but it's better than it had been before this shampoo/conditioner combo.The pain and blanket level hair fall was irritating and embarrassing enough that even though I don't have much money to work with, paying over $20 for a bottle of shampoo (because it works) has been worth it.These results (from using the product) are consistent, as I've been using the product for over a year now.I switched it up a couple times and my scalp pain came back as soon as thefirst wash with other product, and my hair fall increased again until I got back on this shampoo/conditioner combo. So results last as long as I keep using this product _regularly_.Pros: less hair fall, pleasant enough product smell, less scalp pain - works the same even after a year of use; keeps working as long as I keep using itCons: didn't get hair to grow back in certain areas (though it stopped more hair loss from happening in those areas) so not really a hair regrowth product for me, as much as simply stopping further hair lossAll in all this has worked the best out of everything else I'd tried (and been able to afford) over about a decade.I gave it 4 stars, because hair _regrowth_ has been limited.Hope this helps.",
