                "reviewText": "I saw this was a dupe to the Redken All Soft shampoo and i decided to try it out! My hair is dyed and I noticed that whenever I would use it, the smell of hair dye would arise even though it was gone since the summer. The conditioner helps the smell disappear pretty fast and it leaves my hair soft. My hair used to get oily after a day but I can go two days without washing my hair (+no dry shampoo) and it still sits and feels clean. Hopefully the hair dye smell was just a unique experience but overall I like it and would recommend!",

We appreciate that Amazon keeps offering this shampoo at good prices. It is a bit hard to find these days, with so many other brands and varieties available. We like the tried and true!",

I\u2019d much rather shop on Amazon then go into a Walmart that\u2019s for sure. Thanks Amazon!!!",

                "reviewText": "For my thin frizzy hair this shampoo is quite moisturizing; couldn't say it will work on more coarse, dry hair. It doesn't `revive` the hair, but along with the conditioner it adds softness and shine, maybe some moisture.Although it states it does not contain heavy waxes and it makes a nice thick lather, I need to use this along with a deep cleansing anti-dandruff shampoo. After 2-3 consecutive washes with this shampoo only I start to feel my hair weighed down and not very clean. If I'm using it on it's own, I need to wash my hair twice if I have used dry shampoo. So in terms of that... it's gentle; but just too gentle.I don't have an oily scalp per say, but I do work out often and I tend to get dandruff easily. Again, if I use this more than 2-3 consecutive washes I get dandruff.It has a nice `oily` luxurious smell, but it comes mostly from the flagrance (of which it has more than oils).The tube doesn't close very all the way, it's easy to make a spill if you are not careful.Overall it's not a bad shampoo for the drugstore, but it's not for me. I will use it up, but definitely not re-buy.",
