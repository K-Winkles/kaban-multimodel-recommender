                "reviewText": "A little background about me and my hair. My ethnicity gives me extraordinarily thick, slightly coarse, dense dark brown hair. I'm a strong believer in everything natural and fewer harmful chemicals. Striking a balance between what I consider beauty and keeping the ingredients natural has been a challenge. This shampoo gets my stamp of approval ,for the most part. The first two bottles I got worked well and smelled good, I was looking for something without silicone so I could try the curly girl method. The current bottle I have still seems to \" clean\"fairly well, maybe not quite as well. What I don't like about it is a strong acetone like odor that's some other reviewers have pointed out. My husband says it smells like apple cider vinegar though and I don't completely trust my own nose at times. Post-covid I think we should all question our sense of smells. Since smell hallucinations was a feature of that disease. I like that this cleans my hair but doesn't strip all the natural oils. Isn't too heavy, and since I'm not going for the Uber-hippie unwashed look, still makes me feel presentable and professional. I have no issue with the pump that comes with it. The ingredients list is slightly deceptive because vinegar and fruit extract are listed separately while the front claims that it's raw apple cider vinegar. However that's not a deal-breaker since I also purchase separately good raw apple cider vinegar to use on my hair as a conditioner and to remove mineral deposits from hard water. After an apple cider vinegar rinse my hair is always lighter fluffier and softer. I'd recommend it if you like more natural products: but remember if your hair is fine or different than mine you will not get the same results that I did.",

I started using this product a few months ago, at first it really helped relieve the itch and scalp acne. As I continued to use this product, regularly, I noticed my hair began shedding excessively after use and the scalp itch and acne returned with a vengeance. I was only using Majestic ACV shampoo without any conditioners. My scalp became so sensitive and painful with breakouts that it hurt to touch my head. I stopped use of this ACV shampoo for a few weeks while I started using a shampoo bar that did not contain any SLS, silicone, or palm oil and all of the scalp problems resolved quickly. This was my experience. I will continue to use the shampoo bar and stop paying for questionable ingredients and plastic containers.",
