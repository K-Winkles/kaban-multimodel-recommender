Certainly no meat, no dairy, no poultry, no seafood, no processed food, no bleached white sugar, no salt, no oil -not even olive oil- only whole foods plant based diet that's how I fixed all of my health problems for good.)

I have been taking Biotin tablets as part of a daily regimen for nearly two years and I found that it helped somewhat. When I discovered this shampoo and combined it with the oral Biotin, the results were very noticeable. Please don't think you will see changes overnight. I have been using this shampoo for more than 6 months now and it wasn't until about after four months of continuous use (again, coupled with the oral Biotin) that I saw changes. My hair has grown a little thicker, but more importantly, it has stopped falling out. Praise God and Avalon Organics.",
