My recommendation would be to figure out just how often you need to use it to prevent dandruff (every few days, every week, every month, etc.) and then use something that smells better on other days to cover the scent.",

If u\u2019ve been in this situation you\u2019d understand how annoying it is. So, at first, I thought it was due to some biological issues (like hormone changing or stress, water etc) turned out it wasnt my problem BUT THE SHAMPOO AND COND themselves. And after researching for so many times, I chose this Head and Shoulders clinical shampoo, with doubt and prayed for a good result. And Surprisingly!!!! It WORKS SO WELL!!! No more itchy scalp, a super clean and relief scalp, less hair loss, stronger hair strains, however, without cond. my hair is still greasy so I use other brand\u2019s condition to help my hair smoother. It works as well.For this product, to be honest, I don\u2019t like the smell though, but regardless of it, I\u2019M HAPPY with the outcome and thank you to the people who created and made this product available for struggle users like me.",
