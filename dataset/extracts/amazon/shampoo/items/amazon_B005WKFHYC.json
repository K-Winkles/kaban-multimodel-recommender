The stuff that actually worked always smelled horrible and is usually really expensive or requires a prescription. The key for me has been to wash daily. If I skip more than a day, my head tends to break out. While this stuff isn't designed for acne relief, it's done a decent job for me keeping my scalp at a fair middle ground of not too oily and not too dry.I use about a nickel sized amount daily, starting with the sides of my head (where I get the most acne) and working up my scalp, then out the length of my hair. My hair is about shoulder length.It smells clean, but subtle. You don't have to use a whole lot, and it is good for daily showers. I personally do NOT like the matching conditioner for regular use, it tends to make my hair really poofy, so I suppose it could be good to someone looking for added volume maybe. I actually stopped using it a couple years ago completely and have had better control of my hair from doing so.",

                "reviewText": "Have been using this shampoo for about a year now... just like many other commenting fans, I too first tried this while staying at a Hilton in NYC -I have fine non chemically treated hair - tend to wash every other day (unless on the weekends) - and I have had more people tell me in the past year that my hair looks great - and comment on how fast it has grown....My hairdresser (who I had not seen in several months for a long overdue trim) even commented on how healthy my hair wasI do not do anything special except treat myself to this shampoo - it is a bit pricey compared to other products on the market but a little goes a very long way - not to mention the smell is amazing and clean -The only \"disappointment\" I have is with the package it's self- as earlier stated, I have been using this product for about a year - a few of the bottles would not close and one of the tips actually broke off in the tube itself - so I usually have to store the bottle upside down in my shower rack... not that this a huge deal, but a bit annoying.",

But the ingredients do differ.I like the fragrance, it is as I remembered it.A dime size amount was adequate for my shorter hair length. So the tube will last somewhat longer than a larger container of another product.I didn\u2019t notice any damage or any negative results to my hair, a couple of reviews noted.It\u2019s just way too expensive.(Update: I found it on Walmart.com for about 5 bucks cheaper.)",
