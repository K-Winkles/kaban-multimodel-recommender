I was finally going to go back to Free and Clear, which is a good product, it just leaves my hair limp and dull. I read the review on Pura D'Or and decided to try it. I love it! It has cured the itchy scalp (so far), it doesn't cause my body to itch or break out, and it leaves my hair really clean feeling. I like the argan conditioner, it has no scent, and my hair looks nice and conditioned, not dull and limp. The shampoo kind of smells a little strong..but it is not really noticeable after my hair dries, it just smells clean. Good product..good results..very pleased.",

She said she wasn't having any more irritation in just a few shampoos, and her dandruff was completely gone! I did not expect this shampoo to work this well, but I am pleasantly surprised that I was wrong! It made her hair super soft and healthy as well. The scent is strong due to the peppermint, but the ingredients did what they were supposed to, so I can't complain. You can't even distinguish the smell after using conditioner anyway. It was well worth the money overall!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, I never leave reviews, but I just have to for this. I hoped for results quickly but I didn\u2019t expect to be cured after one wash! About a month or two ago I started to notice this weird smell coming from my scalp along with itchiness and white flakes, which at first I thought it was dandruff, but my scalp felt really dry and even spots on my forehead were dry as well. I also noticed how oily my hair was getting after just washing it, and how often it was getting knots, which wasn\u2019t normal for me. I tried \u201chome remedies\u201d like lemon juice and Aloe Vera but they didn\u2019t seem it do anything (the Aloe Vera did get rid of the dry spots on forehead though). I even tried a new pillow case. So I suck it up and started searching for a new shampoo and conditioner, I was previously using Pantene, (I know it\u2019s not a surprise why I was having problems). Btw I have wavy, fine hair. Anyways that\u2019s when I found this one! And it worked wonderfully after one wash I have none of my previous \u201csymptoms\u201d. It also came like 4 days early lol thanks. The only thing to know is that it has a pretty strong smell, I personally like the smell it just smells like essential oils, but it does stay on your hair a little. Also it doesn\u2019t make your hair very soft, which is fine, but Id recommend using a mask a couple time a week or month for softness. I also felt like it really cleaned my hair too! Anyways great product and I love the ingredients.",

I\u2019ve been struggling with dandruff/dry scalp for months, it flares up occasionally. I never used to have this issue for 38 years or my life until recently. It\u2019s super weird, but I\u2019ve been trying different things to fix it. I\u2019ve used salon shampoo, I\u2019ve used medicated, over-the-counter shampoos. I saw this recommended from a YouTuber. I decided to try it because I am pretty desperate at this point. I used it one time and it immediately started working. I\u2019ve only used it twice, and the dandruff is totally gone, my scalp is no longer itchy, it is insane. My mind is blown, and I am so excited that something finally works, because nothing has worked for me at this point. So thankful , highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "I never leave reviews, but I feel I really need to with this set. Background, I have tried SO many different shampoo and conditioners... and nothing ever made my scalp feel at peace. My scalp would always feel itchy, burn, I'd itch so much that I'd get little sores. My scalp would flake, a lot. Constantly making it seem like I have endless dandruff. So embarrassing. Plus my hair would just feel so lifeless and dry, frizzy. I've tried anywhere from very expensive brands to cheaper, nothing helped. It always went back to flakes, dryness and sores. I finally found this set and I could just cry from joy from the results! Literally, after the first use I didn't see anymore flakes!! My hair has never felt softer, more luscious. I'm also experiencing less breakage and fallout. I have thin hair, so that is very important I don't lose more than I have to. I have a little scalp brush that I massage into my hair after I put on the shampoo and conditioner separately. That seems to have helped with the flake problem, too. So thankful for finding this brand! I will buy it for life, now! If you experience any of the problems I've listed above, please please please consider buying this and giving your hair some love!",

Of course I could wash my hair again but I find frequent washing dries my hair out very quickly (especially if it contains chemicals such as sulphates) so this isn't really an option.I spotted this product being recommended on an 'SLS free' cosmetics website and decided to give it a go. I have to say that it worked from the first application and I've noticed that I can easily go three or four days without seeing any flakes whatsoever, an added bonus is that my scalp doesn't itch like it used to either.Its not the cheapest shampoo on Amazon but it is a good sized bottle and the fact that it leaves my hair soft, manageable and flake free for days at a time more than justifies the cost. If run of the mill dandruff shampoos don't work for you, consider trying this product - well recommended.",

I've been going through other shampoos trying to find one that works as well as this for a cheaper price and I've had no luck so far... but I also can't afford to drop \u00a330 every time I need a new bottle of shampoo. Maybe if I become desperate enough I'll come back to this as I know for sure that it will work perfectly... but until then I'll sadly have to look elsewhere.This is an excellent shampoo and if you can afford it then I definitely recommend it.",
