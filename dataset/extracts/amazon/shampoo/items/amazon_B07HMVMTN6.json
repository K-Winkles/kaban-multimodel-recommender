                "reviewText": "I never thought I'd be moved to write a review of a shampoo, but this stuff is THAT good. I got the same soothing clean that I'd get with an apple-cider vinegar rinse without the smell and without over drying.My hair has always been \"my thing.\" I'm blessed with a lot of it and people have, in the past, stopped me in the street to comment on how pretty it is. So, you might imagine how I felt when, in the middle of the pandemic, something crazy started happening with my scalp--mostly that I could see WAY more of it. At first, I assumed it was the stress of nearly ending up homeless, but it was still thinning even after we got \"rescued.\" An oral vitamin B complex with biotin seemed to slow the migration a bit, but then I started to notice that my scalp was itchy and I had a fine powder on my hairbrush. [I've never had dandruff and never heard of dandruff causing hair loss anyway.] I have an appointment with a dermatologist, but obviously--these days--that's not a top priority. Still, my head was driving me nuts. Apple cider vinegar (as a rinse) helped, but then I smelled like vinegar until my next shampoo. A clarifying shampoo helped less, but also dried my hair out beyond what a conditioner could fix.And then I found this stuff!Right away, I liked that it had little to no scent. I noticed immediately that my scalp felt more clean while I was washing it. What really made me happy was that, AS I was rinsing it out, I could feel that my hair actually felt clean but not stripped dry. My scalp looks super clean, doesn't itch, and I haven't seen a single speck of \"powder\" on my hair brush since I started using it (about three weeks/nine shampoos ago). I'm still seeing more scalp than I was two years ago, but at least it's clean and the hair that's there is clean, soft, and shiny. Yay!",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased many hair shampoo's but this shampoo blows it out the door!I recently purchased and tried the Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo for Dull and Oily Hair for a little over a week now and I am beyond impressed with the results! As a student who loves staying active with sports and exploring new places through traveling, maintaining healthy hair has always been a challenge due to exposure to different environments. This shampoo has been a game-changer for me.Firstly, the scent of the apple cider vinegar is refreshing and invigorating, making my shower experience truly enjoyable. The formula effectively cleansed my hair, removing all the excess oil and product buildup that tends to accumulate after workouts and outdoor activities. My hair felt incredibly clean and rejuvenated after just one wash.One of the things I appreciate most about this shampoo is its clarifying properties. It effortlessly revived the dullness that had been lingering in my hair, leaving it looking shiny and vibrant. This is a lifesaver, especially when I'm busy with my studies and don't always have time for extensive hair care routines.What sets this product apart is its gentle nature. Despite its clarifying abilities, it didn't strip my hair of its natural oils or leave it feeling dry. Instead, my hair felt soft and manageable, which is crucial for someone who is always on the go and doesn't have time for complicated hair maintenance.",
