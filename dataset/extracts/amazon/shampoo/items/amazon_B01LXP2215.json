                "reviewText": "I love the scent. It is a lovely floral that I wish everything in my life smelled like. For now I will just have to settle for just my hair smelling this awesome. I have been trying different sulfate free shampoos and I think this one the best so far. I have been using it for over 2 months now. It takes a lot of product to work up a suds, even with a shampoo brush. Sometimes I actually need to \"rinse and repeat\" but since there aren't sulfates here to give a huge lather, that is to be expected. My hair comes out very clean. I would suggest this to a friend and buy again but BE SURE TO GET THE CONDITIONER. This shampoo is not moisturizing at all and you will need a conditioner with this shampoo. That being said, the Alba conditioners are great and a nice price and I will buy them again together.",
