                "reviewText": "We recently tried the shampoo/conditioner combo and the set was ok overall, but my better half likes the shampoo more than the conditioner, so we got additional bottles of the shampoo. To me, the shampoo has a pretty strong tea tree smell instead of a peppermint, which I would have preferred. I am not sure if this is because this product has sat too long on the shelf or the brand has inconsistent quality control standards. It does have a minty sensation on the scalp when put on and seems to lather well. The shampoo seems to clean well. The quality of the shampoo is ok. I think this is a bit expensive for shampoo though.4 stars",

I decided to reorder this set and am very happy with this product. It even helped my aging mother...who was losing alot of hair each time she showered and combed her hair.
