                "reviewText": "I love this product. I\u2019ve been using it since the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s just amazing. With American shampoo and conditioner, my hair always felt heavy, and greasy. Not to mention my dry scalp was awful, even using specific shampoos and conditioners for dry scalp. One use of this, and there was an immediate difference. My hair felt so much lighter, cleaner, and my dry scalp wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as it was. With previous shampoo and conditioners, I\u2019d HAVE to wash every other day. With this one? I only have to wash twice a week. I can go 3 days maybe more without my hair being greasy nor my dry scalp affecting me too much. My hair has never felt so good. It does have a pretty funky and strong smell. Can be compared to a cigarette, but not nearly as gross. But you get used to it after awhile. Eventually it\u2019ll start smelling great. As far as hair loss is concerned, my hair still falls out pretty consistently, but that may be due to other underlying issues, so I don\u2019t have much input on that. But it\u2019s a great product and I will never use any other product for my hair again.",

My white hair has a more dry and stiff feeling, sticks out and it\u2019s unmanageable. From the first time using this shampoo that all changed, now it\u2019s much softer and feels so very nice when I run my fingers through it. I\u2019m 75 years old and this shampoo is the first product that actually makes a difference. Thank you to the company that makes this fabulous shampoo!! It doesn\u2019t need a conditioner, it great just using it alone. I absolutely love the light, fresh fragrance, it\u2019s not typical and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.",

My hair feels super hydrated and soft after I wash it.",
