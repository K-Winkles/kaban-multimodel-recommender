As someone who values vegan and cruelty-free products, I appreciated the brand's commitment to these principles.However, after using this shampoo for a few weeks, I have mixed feelings. While it does effectively cleanse and remove buildup from my hair, I found that it left my hair feeling noticeably dry and stripped of moisture. Despite the lemongrass and argan ingredients, I didn't experience the desired boost in shine or replenishment of moisture as advertised.In comparison to other shampoos I've used, I've had better results with different products that left my hair feeling softer and more nourished. my favorite clarifying shampoo right now is 4U by Tia Clarifying Shampoo with Apple Cider Vinegar and Hemi15. While the ACURE shampoo is decent and lives up to its claims of clean ingredients, it ultimately falls short in terms of providing the moisture my hair needs.",
