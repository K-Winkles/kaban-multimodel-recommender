The impact it has had on my hair is nothing short of impressive. Notably, the visible reduction in hair loss during each wash has been a game-changer. What used to be a distressing sight in the drain has become a rarity, thanks to the shampoo's powerful blend of Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Shea Butter, and Peppermint.Consistent use of this shampoo has led to a remarkable transformation in my hair's resilience and overall health. The natural ingredients work providing me with a long-term solution rather than a temporary fix. My hair's texture has improved, and I've observed increased thickness, instilling confidence in the recovery of my hair.",

I found it when I had dreadlocks and was trying to find something better for my scalp and hair that would work with locs without the price of the \"dreadlock shampoo\" empires. It smells really good. It doesn't take much to use. Very long lasting and everyone in our family can use it. It has natural oils that leave hair soft, scalp moisturized and cooled from any itchiness or irritation and is overall better to avoid all the crap additives in shampoos and all. I personally would use a lil bit in a half gallon jug with water when i had locs in and use that to saturate and dilute it for washing. But when I had my locs out, I have fine type 2B hair and I don't find it is too oily or anything. Once you stop using garbage shampoos and begin using better products that actually care for your scalp and hair and use it for a bit you'll notice a huge difference. I highly recommend this product. The only reason I removed a star was because it came to us damaged, so that is more for Amazon than the actual product. The top of it was snapped off, and it wasn't even in the box, so they literally packaged it with it already broken and it leaked everywhere. I'd recommend getting the smaller container and not deal with the pump mechanic.",
