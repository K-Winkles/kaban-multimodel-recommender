For me it works fine, potentially better than the previous formulation, but your results may vary considering it is literally a different product. Similar, but different.While the practice of selling someone a health product that is not in fact exactly what they ordered is reprehensible, the updated product does function as I would hope. Less of a problem with Head and Shoulders who made a good product, more of an issue with the entire snafu that is re-using existing amazon product pages for literally different products.Imagine globally distributing a well designed product that requires actual research and validation, and then not telling people, potentially violating a few consumer protection laws in the process, because your marketing department/outsourced marketers forgot to update even a single picture or block of text.It would be funny if it wasn't a little sad.Additionally for anyone who cares, the fragrance is still nothing at all like eucalyptus. It is actually somewhat fruity and while noticeable, does not linger much. Which is nice, because I hate eucalyptus.",
