This shampoo is excellent. It lathers nicely, smells great, and leaves my hair clean without stripping it or leaving any residue. My hair looks healthy, shiny, and feels strong. I find myself reaching for this more than my living proof or pureology. The best part is it\u2019s priced very reasonably. For reference my hair is long, straight and very fine. My husband\u2019s hair is very thick and wavy and he loves it too. I hope they never stop making this.",
