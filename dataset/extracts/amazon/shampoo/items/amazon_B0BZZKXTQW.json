I didn\u2019t even know it existed in America till a few years ago. I ordered the Bain Satin Riche and used it for the first time today. Before that I had used the Bain Satin 1 a few times. It\u2019s just as good as I remember. Creamy lather, rinses easily and I don\u2019t need to use conditioner after this shampoo. That honestly almost never happens with my butt length hair. A little goes a very long way, you don\u2019t a lot. I used a quarter sized amount and shampooed twice because I hadn\u2019t washed in a few days and my hair tends to get greasy. Smells pleasant too. I know it\u2019s pricey but it\u2019s worth every penny. Those who doubt this is the real deal because it\u2019s on Amazon\u2026.. it is!",
