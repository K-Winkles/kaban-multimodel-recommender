There was a very noticeable difference for the good. She also loved the smell of it. I do like the fact that a piece of tape was placed over the lid to detour spillage. It worked great. I ordered conditioner(same brand not necessarily the same dealer) the lid wasn't taped and there was loss in transit due to it opening. Your on the right track! Great shampoo and thank you for the added tape to ensure I got the product. I will be ordering again and possibly placing this on subscribe. Thank you",

While it does not keep your hair feeling soft or smooth after, it's actually not supposed to! Clarifying shampoo helps to do what it says - clarify your hair of all the build up in it (aka hair spray, gel, and all other products we use). Even if you don't use products on your hair, build up forms and it's important to remove it every once in a while so that your scalp remains healthy and your hair continues to grow and be strong. I asked my hair dresser about this clarifying shampoo brand and they recommended it. It definitely helped my hair out and I will probably use this every few months!",

The shipment came very well packaged (perhaps even excessively so, but at least it was I damaged) and arrived earlier than estimated. This shampoo worked so much better than I had anticipated! After using it my hair felt so clean and light, and was noticeably shinier and softer than usual. I will definitely continue to use this product for a long time to come!",
