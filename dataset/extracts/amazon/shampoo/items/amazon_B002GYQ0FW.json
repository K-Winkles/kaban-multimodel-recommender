Quite a bit of money for sure, but truly a little goes a long way for the shampoo and conditioner. To me it\u2019s also worth the money to feel better about my hair.

                "reviewText": "Aufgrund eines Berichtes in einem meiner Lieblingsblogs habe ich diese brandneue Serie entdeckt. Ich bin fast 50 und leider derzeit unter hormonell bedingtem Haarausfall und altersbedingt d\u00fcnner werdenden Haaren. Nat\u00fcrlich ersetzt das Shampoo keine indizierte HET enth\u00e4lt auch kein Minoxidil wie z.B. Regaine (das benutze ich zus\u00e4tzlich und konnte damit den Haarausfall eind\u00e4mmen). Zun\u00e4chst wollte ich die Nourishing Serie kaufen da diese speziell f\u00fcr Leute mit d\u00fcnner werdendem Haar sein soll. Soll M\u00e4nnern genauso passen wie Frauen. Dann habe ich mich allerdings f\u00fcr die Volume Serie entschieden da ich auf den Sofort Effekt gespannt war. Nach der Anwendung f\u00fchlen sich die Haare sofort dicker an, nach dem Styling habe ich das Empfinden dreimal so viel Haare auf dem Kopf zu haben. Eine teure Angelegenheit - aber f\u00fcr mich jeden Cent wert - der entsprechende Conditioner erg\u00e4nzt das Programm, zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es noch Spezial Treatments. Wenn ich dieses Produkt aufgebraucht habe werde ich mir vermutlich auch die Nourishing Serie ansehen.",
