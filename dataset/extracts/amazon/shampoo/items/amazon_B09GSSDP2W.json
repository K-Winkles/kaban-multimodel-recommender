I had to wash rinse and reapply to get a good lather with the shampoo, but it has a nice soft smells (I am really sensitive to smells) and rinsed out well. The conditioner made my hair soft, I could easily comb through it in the shower and didn't lose a bunch of hair from washing like I usually do. It did have a little bit of an off smell (I was worried from the other reviews I read) in the bottle, but it didn't smell bad when I put it in my hair. My 3 year old told me my hair was \"so soft!\" As of now I am sold!",

I like Thriive shampoo and conditioner, although it stinks and is way too expensive for what it is, so I looked for something with comparative ingredients and found Puracy!! my hair maintains volume and curliness with this. On days where I need a little more moisturizer, I will use something like a detangler, it\u2019s a 10 styling product, or other lightweight spray-in products.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:After going through both the shampoo and conditioner I bought the shampoo refill pouch and have been using it for over a year now, and it\u2019s great! I\u2019ve replaced the conditioner with a different brand - the stink is gone and my hair\u2019s looking a lot bouncier. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the conditioner.Original review:I have fine, slightly dry, wavy, shoulder length hair. This stuff is GREAT for my hair type! I can\u2019t recall the last time my hair looked as shiny and healthy as it has this past week. I\u2019d been considering purchasing this pair for a while but was hesitant since the natural shampoos/conditioners I\u2019ve used previously have been atrocious - either way too stripping and drying or too heavy and oily. However, these products balance my hair nicely. The shampoo lathers up well and the conditioner is exceptionally moisturizing despite being oddly runny and thin. I appreciate having a pump on the bottles, and I like that the plastic\u2019s clear so I can keep track of when I\u2019m running low.Now onto the single downside: the smell. I saw the reviews likening the conditioner to the aroma of \u201cwet dog\u201d and \u201cmildew\u201d, and I thought \u201cpshh those must be exaggerations\u201d, I\u2019m not that picky about haircare scents anyway. Unfortunately they were spot on. The conditioner smells deceivingly fine in the bottle, but something happens when the fragrance is mixed with the humidity of the shower that causes it to exude an incredibly unpleasant scent. I get whiffs as it sits soaking on my hair, and it reeks. Once my hair\u2019s dry the odd stench dissipates and I\u2019m left with fresh smelling hair throughout the day (....or do I simply become acclimated to the odor?) Needless to say, I\u2019d prefer if this came in an \u201cunscented\u201d version since everything else about this product is perfect and I\u2019d rather not walk around wondering whether I stink or not.",

                "reviewText": "I am so disappointed in these products after being so excited to receive them\u2026. I have a bed and breakfast/yoga space at my house and was thrilled at the idea of being able to have ecologically conscious products that smelled good and could be refilled in our outdoor shower. I will say, both body wash and shampoo smell very good and the conditioner is more effective than most \u201cnatural\u201c conditioners I have tried. And I do like the appearance of the set and the art on the labels. That said, the conditioner does not smell good\u2014 it\u2019s not bad exactly but definitely one off\u2014 maybe going bad\u2026.My biggest issue is that the pumps DO NOT work. As you can see from the picture, the conditioner pump has popped out and the spring is exposed. Most of the time people are dumping it into their hands causing it to be used at a much higher rate. You can still use this one as a pump, but not infrequently the spring falls out rolls off. It is just a matter of time before the spring goes between the cracks in the deck and that pump is totally worthless. Similarly, the shampoo pump doesn\u2019t work and is used as a \u201cdipstick\u201d to get shampoo out. The body wash is the star of the show with both a good smell and functioning pump! As I said, I was really looking forward to being able to use products and refill them to minimize my use of plastic\u2014BUT you can\u2019t refill things if they come in really crappy, non-functional packages in the first place! I do wish this had worked out! Back to the drawing board, I guess\u2026.",
