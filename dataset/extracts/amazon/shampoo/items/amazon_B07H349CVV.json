I have wavy, dirty blond hair that I bleach and highlight up to the root and can now go every other day before I need to reapply. That may still seem too frequent, but trust, I was a multi-reapply-a-day head. This has been a God send *praying hand emoji*",

It in my opinion is on the pricier side but I love it so much that I will likely continue to buy it. The smell is also really good. It does go on white initially but as long as you run your fingers through your hair a bit it will disappear! I definitely recommend!",
