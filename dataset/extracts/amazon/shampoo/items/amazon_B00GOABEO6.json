                "reviewText": "I used Framesi Moisture Rich with Quinoa and Alo Vera for many years in the past. Swithed to cheaper name brand shampoo afer I stopped coloring my hair due to rash and headaches from hair dye. Lately, my scalp and hair had become dry and I was scratching alot and finally connected the dots. Looked at several natural shampoos that aren't made for color treated hair but decided I liked Framesi ingredients and have gone back to it even though it is too expensive. My gray hair is back to soft and shiny and no more scratching. I did not give it 5 stars because I do wish it was unscented, or at lease had much less scent. Hope they can improve this by the time I need another bottle or I will look around again. But I do like the product.",

                "reviewText": "I have used this shampoo & matching conditioner for over 6yrs now after my hairdresser recommended it. It makes my hair feel so soft & silky feeling. My hairs shines like I spritzed it with a shiner but haven\u2019t. I now keep a bottle of each in my guest bathroom so when I have guest come for a visit I recommend they try it. I get the same response each time, \u2018oh my gosh my hair feels so soft and silky.\u2019 That\u2019s usually before they have even let their hair dry. My 8yr old granddaughter loves using this shampoo because her hair when she gets out of the shower is easy to brush, no tangles. You can\u2019t go wrong buying this shampoo!!",
