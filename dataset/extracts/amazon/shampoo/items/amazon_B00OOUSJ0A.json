After using the entire product my hair is repaired, soft, full (I have fine hair, but I have a lot of hair), and shiny. I ordered it again, this time through Amazon and there is no notable difference. I have the scent a 4. It smells good, but if I could pick the scent it wouldn\u2019t be the scent that it is, but it\u2019s not strong so it doesn\u2019t compete with my perfume.If you have long hair that is in need of repair use the entire product (lasted me about 6 months). Then go back to something else if you prefer and later this in between washes.",

                "reviewText": "Yeah, it was hard to pay this much for such a small amount, but I'm learning that quality in small doses is better than trash in large doses. Sure you can get hair care for a fraction of the price, but that's because it's loaded with cheap ingredients- many of which are harmful. I will never go back from Davines.My hair is long and fine, and so it damages easily, and tangles easily. I don't have an overly oily scalp, but it does get oily after a couple days. Unlike many super \"natural\" shampoos I've tried (from Whole Foods and other natural stores) MELU actually gets the oil out. And unlike the cheap shampoos full of chemicals, it doesn't feel like it's stripping the all the living nutrients out of my hair as it removes the excess oil. MELU leaves it soft and workable, but not heavy.I love it!It's definitely worth the price, and if used sparingly (you don't even need to use much) it'll last you 2-3 months easy. So the price evens out.",

                "reviewText": "I read so many reviews on this shampoo (as well as the conditioner), and assumed that like everything else I had previously used on my hair (Goldwell, Kerastase, Oribe, etc.), that it was just another overpriced hair care line with a catchy look. I WAS WRONG! To be safe, I ordered the travel sizes of the shampoo and conditioner, along with a sample of the Nounou mask. I figured, it's Amazon Prime and the small sizes are safe to try it out. These are things that I wanted to specify, because they were not originally specified for me:- You get many uses out of the travel sizes, and a little really does go a long way. I have long hair past the middle of my back, and find that a quarter-size amount is plenty.-If you want a good lather with the shampoo, make sure your hair is very, very wet. I wash my hair everyday, sometimes twice a day, and have gotten about 15 uses out of each product, and there is still some left.This has literally TRANSFORMED my hair in the past two weeks, as I normally color my hair black once a month. I normally have oily hair with dry ends. My hair no longer feels oily, and my ends are extremely smooth and soft, and much less tangled than they were. My hair also feels like it has a lot more volume, and when I blowdry ... My hair is perfection (I air dry most days) . I am on my way to ordering the larger sizes of these products, and my next goal is to try the Davines OI All In One Milk. I can't stop touching my hair and neither can my boyfriend! I'm so glad I tried this!",

I have medium thick, semi long hair & a little goes a long way w/this shampoo, thank goodness, because the bottle is pretty small for the price you pay. I have noticed an improvement in the thickness of my hair & the length, which is what I was going for. Not as many split ends which means less trimming which means longer hair! When you are achieving the results you were shooting for, it's always worth the $$. I highly recommend & I am one picky consumer.",
