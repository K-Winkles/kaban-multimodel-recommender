It doesn\u2019t sud like the other shampoos, but you\u2019ll definitely see what it is doing when it lift all the toxins out of the hair, especially if you used oily products to moisturizer the hair. You\u2019ll see all those being lifted, and by giving it a second wash after your first rinse, then you\u2019ll start to see the shampoo starting to sud like normal shampoo. This indicates that it has less reactants such as oily products in the hair to combat with. This is a great shampoo indeed, and I\u2019ll be sticking to this product once the price doesn\u2019t go up.",
