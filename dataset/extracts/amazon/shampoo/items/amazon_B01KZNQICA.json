                "reviewText": "I used a darker color on my hair a few weeks ago by mistake. It came out looking very dark blonde and my natural is a medium blonde. Rather than risk ruining my hair by coloring it again so soon, I decided to try this shampoo instead. It had great reviews and is very reasonably priced. It lightened my hair quite a bit so that it looks more like my own color. My hair feels and looks soft and shiny, instead of dried out as I feared it would. This shampoo is amazing! My hair looks and feels great, and a few more shampoos should have me right back to what I wanted. I've never used this product before, but I intend to use it every third shampoo from now on. I don't want it to get too light and by alternating it with my other shampoo it should keep looking and feeling soft and natural. If I could give it 10 stars I would! I'm a definite fan of this product.Linneaann",

So I was hoping to go back to it to lighten my dark roots as I grew out the henna I used (no metallic salts in the one I used). Worked really well the first time. Then after the second I noticed some itching. That could've been from anything. So I continued to use it every week. It wasn't until I was down to 25% of the bottle that I realized that the the itching and slight burning I was feeling was directly after using this shampoo and conditioner, but that my hair was noticeably thinner. By my estimate I lost over 50% of my hair in 3 months after using this stuff weekly. Looking a little closer and my hair is coming out from the shaft and my scale is sensitive and dry. A big jump from always being oily after 3 days.So yes, this shampoo will lighten your hair, in both color and volume.",

It may be hard to find this product but well worth the search - I highly recommend it & the coordinating conditioner.",
