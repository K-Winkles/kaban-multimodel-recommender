However the irritants are in Allergies & Immunotoxicity. So this Combo of Shampoo & Conditioner may not be for you.The gentle Shampoo & Conditioner score a 4. There are really good ingredients in both of these products however, the irritants are what makes the score high.I used both of them today, and my hair is super soft and shiny. Just know your ingredients. This is not designed for fine hair, however I do get psoriasis on my scalp. Sometimes, it being winter and the fact that it calmed it down I will continue to use it.Also, you\u2019re not supposed to shampoo your hair every day. You can condition it every day, but not shampoo it. Just saying.So the bad reviews on this brand Im not sure why? As it is on the same level of $30 products with scores and ingredients such as Olapex scores a 6 for cancerous ingredients. I am not sure if I will purchase again. We\u2019ll see how it goes.But it seems fairly good for the price! I am happy to try it for the price!",
