I will continue to use this shampoo and it is very reasonable and a great price point. I also love how thick and consistency the shampoo is and a little goes a long way.

My hair which is very thin and not as much of it, looks lush after this shampoo! It feels soft but with substance. It takes just a dime size of the product to get a ton of lather, so this small bottle will last a long time! The conditioner is light, it glides effortlessly on my highlighted hair. I am a huge fan, instantly! it could smell nicer, but who cares when it works so well!!!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m about to take you for a little ride so if you\u2019re not up for it, TL/DR; just buy it. It\u2019s great.I have about waist length, very straight, unprocessed, fine, but very dense (think a scoop of angel hair vs the same scoop of regular spaghetti), brown hair. It\u2019s always been relatively healthy and routinely trimmed. I wash and condition about once a week unless I get sweaty/dirty. I only blow dry when it\u2019s washed/wet, but I do flat iron daily to smooth out any kinks from sleeping on it. BUT I started taking Accutane (rx for acne) about 6 months ago and it has completely destroyed my mane. It\u2019s insanely dry, breaking, and looks like I have paint in my hair because there are so many split ends. I\u2019m a bit of a product whore, but not out of control. I\u2019ve typically used redkin, biolage, aveda, and similar products. It was hard for me to swallow paying $30 for EIGHT OUNCES. But, it came highly recommended by both my derm and other Accutane users, so I took the plunge. I got the shampoo, conditioner, and oil. Amazon mistakenly forgot my conditioner so I can\u2019t comment on it quite yet, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and assume it\u2019s as great as the oil and shampoo. I can\u2019t tell you, honestly, the last time I fully washed my hair with shampoo before tonight. I was a little over zealous with my portions\u2026 a little goes a long way with this shampoo. I went for a quarter sized, but probably only needed a dime. This stuff lathers like the silkiest, thickest, richest butter you\u2019ve ever felt. It smells really good; light, clean, not floral or fruity, very neutral scent. The oil is exactly the same. I\u2019m not sure if it really made a difference after one use or not, but I definitely think it will with repeated use. It\u2019s a little pricey, but feels SO worth it. I\u2019d like to tell you that I\u2019ll update this review after a couple of weeks, but I will most definitely forget so you\u2019re going to have to accept my first impression. If you\u2019re on the fence, jump! I doubt you\u2019ll regret it.",

A pea sized amount is enough for my mid length hair, and one bottle lasts me about 5 months shampooing every other day. I do like a lot of scent in my shampoo and conditioner, which this does not have, however less perfumes are probably better for my hair so I'm ok with that. I bought the shampoo and conditioner on a sale and signed up for autoshipping every few months to lock in a great price!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently tried the Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo, and I must say it has completely transformed my hair care routine. As someone with color-treated and chemically processed hair, finding the right shampoo that not only cleanses but also nourishes and repairs is crucial. Olaplex No. 4 did not disappoint!Firstly, the scent is delightful and not overpowering. The shampoo lathers well, providing a luxurious and pampering experience in the shower. It leaves my hair feeling clean without that stripped or dry sensation that some shampoos can cause.The real magic, however, happens after the wash. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my hair since incorporating this product into my routine. My hair feels softer, stronger, and remarkably more manageable. The Olaplex formula truly lives up to its promise of repairing and maintaining hair bonds.Another standout feature is its color-preserving properties. Having invested time and money into my hair color, I'm thrilled to see that this shampoo helps extend the vibrancy of my color-treated hair, making salon visits less frequent.While the price may be a bit higher compared to other shampoos on the market, the results are worth every penny. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a decent amount of time, making it a cost-effective investment in the long run.In conclusion, if you're looking for a shampoo that not only cleanses your hair but also repairs and maintains its health, Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo is a game-changer. It's become a staple in my hair care routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their hair care experience.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Redkin for 6months and tho it did improve my frizzy hair, it didn't really fix it. No4 definitely made my hair look better after 2 weeks. I feel it'll only get better from here. I don't have to use as much conditioner and I could do without the oil, as well.I find it hilarious that they listed this product requiring batteries.Edit: 3rd week: my scalp is on fire. I don't wash my hair daily. It started with an itch, then skin peeling at the first wash of the week. Sometimes I get dandruff flare-ups so this isn't new. But then my second wash of the week, began the burning. Back to redkin. I really wanted this to work!",
