                "reviewText": "I generally go with a shampoo without scent, but I have used Dove Mens Care products in the past and thought I'd try this. This shampoo maintains the excellent Dove Mens Care quality that you've come to know, but how was the scent. It provides a light orange scent with a stronger focus on the sage. It's actually a manly scent. I will admit, I was original concerned it might not be a masculine scent, but I'm more than happy to use it on a daily basis.This shampoo lathers up very well and washes out clean. My wife likes the scent and so I'm glad I picked this up.I have chosen to rate this product 5 stars. Overall, I expected this to be just as nice as other Dove Mens Care products I have used in the past and it didn't fail me. This one has a nice scent to go along with the quality wash. If you like sage and orange, I'd recommend this product for you.Criteria for Stars:1 - Total rip off, doesn't perform basic advertised functions or not product advertised. I would likely RETURN and would NEVER recommend.2 - Not worth the money. Performs some of the basic advertised functions, but likely not all, and ultimately was deemed as not providing enough value for the money spent. I would not buy again, and would likely not recommend unless the buyer had a very specific use case.3 - It performs the basic functions as advertised, and has some usefulness at the price point, but doesn't work for all of the reasons I purchased. I would likely not buy again, and would only recommend if buyer understood usefulness limitations.4 - It performs most all of the features I purchased it for, but has limitations. I would likely buy again and would recommend.5 - Completely as advertised and likely exceeded expectations. Is if high quality and well shipped. I would totally buy again and recommend.",

It is nice to have a pump which is easier to use and can help to avoid wasting product. The scent is very pleasant and doesn't interfere with colognes etc.. Although it states \"men\" I think it would appear to everyone of all ages. It leaves the hair soft and clean. Anything that saves me time makes me happy. Having a shampoo and conditioner in one (that works-it does) makes it happen. I like that it is said to be paraben and sulfate free which may interfere with other chemical services or damage the hair. Also the ingredients are contained that may be kinder on the hair. I like Dove products and this is another winner!",

It has a nice orange-ish smell from the bottle, but then it feels chemical, but maybe it\u2019s just me (something is off with my sense of smell after COVID). It is a big bottle and a little goes a long way. Given that, the price is good. It works well enough that I am willing to ignore the smell thing.",

It does what it's supposed to do - cleans well and leaves my hair feeling fresh. The scent is nice, not too strong, but refreshing. It's a good choice if you're looking for a simple and effective shampoo and conditioner combo. I'm satisfied with it and plan to continue using it regularly.",
