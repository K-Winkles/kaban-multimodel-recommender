The tangles and damage we much better.It moisturize my hair enough that it was easy to comb thru.When my hair dried, it was so soft and felt clean for the first time in a long time!My hair feels light again, some of the curl in my hair is back!No itchiness.I'm hooked on this product and just can't say enough good things about it.",

What I did was check in on my scalp and I noticed every four days after washing the flakes would return. It went from severe flakes to smaller flakes but intense itching SMH. But now with this product, after four days its practically nothing on my shoulders. I do have to take a star off bc although my scalp isnt intensely itchy, it does itch. When it starts itching, I use Jamaican Mango and Like mentholated No More Itch spray for soothing. My scalp is definitely clean and smells fresh. I used another tea tree shampoo that claimed to soothe and stop dry scalp but for some reason it failed! Not sure if its me or if these products are on some BS bit Neutrogena is closer to the truth.

                "reviewText": "The Neutrogena Soothing & Calming Healthy Scalp Shampoo has become a staple in my hair care routine, and I am thoroughly impressed with its ability to provide a soothing and refreshing experience for both my hair and scalp.The standout feature of this shampoo is its calming effect on the scalp. From the moment it lathers, a gentle and cooling sensation envelops my scalp, creating a spa-like experience in the comfort of my own shower. This is especially beneficial for those moments when I need to unwind and de-stress.The formula is gentle yet effective, and I appreciate that it's suitable for daily use. It cleanses my hair without stripping it of essential oils, leaving it feeling fresh, revitalized, and not overly dry. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my scalp since incorporating this shampoo into my routine.The fragrance is subtle and pleasing, adding to the overall calming experience. It's not overpowering, making it suitable for those with sensitivity to strong scents. The fragrance also lingers on the hair, providing a subtle and pleasant aroma throughout the day.As with other Neutrogena products, the dermatologist-tested formula gives me confidence in the product's safety and effectiveness. It's free from harsh chemicals, making it a suitable choice for individuals with sensitive skin or scalp concerns.The packaging is practical, and the flip-top cap makes dispensing the product easy and mess-free. A little goes a long way, making this shampoo a cost-effective option without compromising on quality.In conclusion, the Neutrogena Soothing & Calming Healthy Scalp Shampoo is a standout product in the realm of hair care. It not only cleanses effectively but also provides a calming and refreshing experience for the scalp. If you're looking for a shampoo that goes beyond the basics to nurture your hair and scalp, this product is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a gentle and soothing addition to their hair care routine. My only issue is the price per bottle which may seem a little on the pricier end.",
