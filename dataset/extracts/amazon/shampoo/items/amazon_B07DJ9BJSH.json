                "reviewText": "My boyfriend had initially purchased this stuff at Walmart or Target. I had been having quite a bit of hair fall after washing my hair. I had talked to my dermatologist about it and she said it was just from stress. Anyway, I ran out of my shampoo so I started to use this instead and had a lot less hair fall! This is not just a men's shampoo. I have been buying it ever since. I actually have it on auto delivery with Amazon because I can't find it at any local stores anymore. It was cheaper at the store. I just ordered an additional 2 bottles for my mom. The only downside to this shampoo/conditioner is that my hair is not as shiny as before. It does detangle better than most 2 in 1's. I still use a separate conditioner though. My hair is very long.",
