I have fine hair (not thin) and it seemed like over the years I lost that natural wave and slight curl and I kept thinking I was losing hair or my hair was changing. In reality I was just using shampoo and conditioners that didn't work for me and were weighting down my hair immensely. I bought this shampoo and conditioner set for its lightweight moisture since I believed through trial and error I didn't need anything heavy on my hair anymore, and low and behold I got my curls and waviness back! This is the perfect shampoo and conditioner I was looking for. It smells great, still makes my hair soft but doesn't weigh it down, and has given body and volume back to my hair! I love this stuff",

                "reviewText": "I have long dry wavy/curly hair in between a 2B-2c. My roots and the hair to about my ear level is virtually straight, however, and actually gets greasy if I don't wash my hair least every two days or so. This shampoo not only smells like a juicy watermelon candy that gets me excited to wash my hair, but also really cleans the scalp so well without leaving buildup and residue. This shampoo also does not dry out the rest of my hair and the ends, and leaves my hair detangled and ready for conditioner. I can tell when \"moisturizing\" shampoos are actually drying because my hair gets so tangled when coming through it in the shower (coughPatterncough), and this one does not dry my ends out! It's really hard to find a good middle ground shampoo that doesn't break the bank and cleans my scalp without damaging the ends, so this is probably my holy grail! If I heatstyle my hair, I leave it for like 4-5 days without washing, so this $8 shampoo bottle will sometimes last me 5 months!Note: I do not use the corresponding conditioner so don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any good. As I have dry hair, I like to splurge on intensive hydrating conditioners. Also, the bottle cap is kind of cheap, so use caution when traveling with this.",

I've been trying all kind of shampoo and conditioners, but nothing was working. I have VERY thin and fine curly hair, so finding a curly hair product that doesn't weigh it down and make me look like smeagol was hard. Until I found this! My hair has been so soft and hydrated, my curls have never looked better.Pros:+ Great long lasting scent+ Very hydrating+ Perfect for thin & fine hairCons:None!",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR: this stuff works just as well as salon brand shampoo and conditioner. I have long, straight, fine hair down to my hips and have had no problems using the shampoo and conditioner from Maui.I have two sisters who work in a high end hair salon (DC area; lots of wives of senators and one sister of a very famous actress are among the clientele) and they give me salon brand products for free. One of the perks of having family in the business; I haven\u2019t had to buy expensive hair products in years. Well, due to Covid the salon was shut down for a while and I ran out of my fancy and expensive haircare items I had gotten used to getting for free. I bought this shampoo and conditioner due to the reviews that seemed good enough to go ahead and buy. I had been spoiled by getting free hair products for so long that I didn\u2019t want to splurge and spend my own money on the expensive stuff that I had grown used to and figured I\u2019d be fine using cheap stuff until the salon reopened. I was surprised at how well this brand worked for me. I know that a lot of the time you\u2019re paying for the brand so it\u2019s not like the salon and stuff was doing anything miraculous that I didn\u2019t think cheaper stuff would be able to do but I have had drugstore shampoo and conditioner cause sores on my head and leave my hair gross and greasy. The hibiscus shampoo and conditioner maintain my healthy hair and make it easy to comb through and doesn\u2019t leave it greasy, weighed down, brittle, or sores on my head. I have gone through more than one bottle of both shampoo and conditioner from this brand and I believe that it will be a good product for anyone who has similar hair to myself.",
