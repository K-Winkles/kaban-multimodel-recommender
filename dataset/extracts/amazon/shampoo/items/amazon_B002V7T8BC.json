                "reviewText": "While doing research on dandruff I ran across the Sachajuan Scalp shampoo and read all the reviews, some positive some negative; the negative ones mostly complaining about the cost of the product. I hesitated to buy the product until I realized what I was paying for my dandruff shampoo which was not working was $5.00 cheaper about a 15% difference; so i ordered the shampoo.When it arrived, the bottle was nice and I smelled it, not too much fragrance and it looked like baby shampoo or other commercial shampoos and I was not initially impressed; but of course I shampooed my hair with it. It has a mild clean smell which is great for me since I don't like strong fragrances. I got some in my eye and let me tell you, this is not a \"no more tears\" formula. Followed the instructions on the label and I have to say that I think the product is a miracle. Immediately my scalp felt better and i stopped itching and flaking. I know it is too good to be true but this was my experience. I was going to alternate between this and my other dandruff shampoo but i have not gone back to the other. I am using it every three days or so, about twice a week and it has not dried out my hair but at first I did use a conditioner, now I am not. My dandruff has not come back and I use it on my beard and my eyebrows (carefully).There is a doubt that this was a seasonal effect and that perhaps my dandruff would return in the winter, however my dandruff was never seasonal, but I will wait and see what happens then. For now I am very happy that decided to go for it and I have recommended it to friends. It is great to be able to wear dark clothes and not worry about the flakes. BTW I just realized that the bottle contains 250 ML which is 50ML more than my older shampoo so essentially they are the same price.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t remember how I stumbled upon this product, but about a year ago I had the worst dandruff I\u2019ve ever had. I normally don\u2019t have any so it was really a surprise that one day it looked like it was snowing from my head. It was so bad that I was nervous of getting haircut and having them think something was wrong with my scalp! After seeing that I did the first thing most people would do: go to the store and buy some head and shoulders. After using that for a couple of weeks, I didn\u2019t notice any improvement. I then tried tea tree oil, but didn\u2019t notice any improvement there either. I made an appointment with my dermatologist and she prescribed me shampoo, but I didn\u2019t notice any improvement there either. I scoured the internet and somehow ran into this. It was expensive, but I was pretty desperate so I bit the bullet and gave it try. Within a few days it started getting better. My sister recommended I use the Aussie 3 minute miracle stuff for conditioner as well. Between those two I have not had any dandruff in a year. Now, I did move to California and had run out of this stuff but I did still have my conditioner so I used Dove moisturizing shampoo for a week, but sure enough my scalp was dry and the dandruff was coming back. I freaked out and bought this all over again. I will probably never switch. This story really works or at least it really did for me.The scent isn\u2019t great as I like a fruity sort of smell to my shampoos and it does not lather as much as say the Dove did, but the results and lack of dandruff are too good to ignore for me.",
