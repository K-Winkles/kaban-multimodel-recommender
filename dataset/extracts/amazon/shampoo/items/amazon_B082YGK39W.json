I used this product for a month. I began to notice that my strands were thicker than they were before. I noticed that I have new growth. I noticed that the blonde hair color I used over a year ago is finally fading out and my natural (not grey!) hair color is coming back, which I\u2019m so happy with! My hair also shines! The only thing shining before was my scalp under my very fine hair.The product is clear, has no harsh chemicals or scents, it lathers well and rinses clean. It does add volume to my fine, limp locks.To be honest and fair, I should also say that I have started eating super healthy, drinking tons of water and have switched to all natural everything since I\u2019ve been diagnosed with some scary things since the virus.My hair and my skin are responding very well to Acure products and this shampoo is my favorite!",
