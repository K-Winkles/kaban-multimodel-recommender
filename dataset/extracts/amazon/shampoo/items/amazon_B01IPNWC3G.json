I don't use any conditioner and my hair feels soft. The scent is pleasant and doesn't linger, meaning it actually feels like the shampoo washes out which is what I prefer. My white hair hasn't turned more yellow after using this and seems to look better. I only use this shampoo once per week because of the price, and in between I use a facial finishing powder for absorbing hair oils (only needs to be applied once on about day 3 after washing and lasts until the next shampooing ... just a tip to extend your hair washing times). I'm hoping this shampoo will be available in Canada soon!",

Grey hair tends to be coarse but this a noticeable difference! Didn't order the conditioner before because someone had said it was too heavy for fine hair but after these remarkable results, I just ordered it. Will def order again!!!!",

I had some yellowing in my hair from the sun. This product looked promising and given the very high cost for such a small bottle I expected good results. After a few uses I did notice a change in the colour and was hopeful something was happening. BUT, as I continued to use it I noticed the yellowing in my hair was changing colour....it turned to drab beige! An expensive purchase to pour down the drain. If you have WHITE hair....consider carefully.",
