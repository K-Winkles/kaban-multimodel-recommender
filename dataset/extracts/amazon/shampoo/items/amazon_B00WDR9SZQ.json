                "reviewText": "I always come back to this shampoo. I\u2019m always tempted to try the next new thing to come along, but end up giving it to a family member to go back to this. I\u2019m late 40\u2019s (so lots of hormonal issues affecting my hair \ud83d\ude29),,, colored hair, almost shoulder length with tons of layers.. it\u2019s a little on the dry side and thinning thanks to genetics and Mother Nature \ud83e\udd74.I like the smell, and I\u2019m someone who prefers no scent at all... I\u2019m not a fan of the over-powering/sickening sweet fragrance that so many have nowadays. It just smells light and clean. I also love the fact that despite being sulfate free it lathers up... maybe I\u2019m old school but I just like the feel of suds when washing my hair and most sulfatefree shampoos do not lather. It\u2019s gentle on colored hair, and doesn\u2019t strip color or make it fade faster than it should. Also, this is an almost 18oz bottle, so it lasts a good while. Hair feels soft but not heavy or weighed down. *The matching condirioner is great as well. And seeing some reviews of build-up - get the Neutrogena build up remover shampoo (also available here on Amazon and pretty much every store, drug store and grocery store). Use it once a week (depending on how often you wash your hair) -It\u2019s gentle enough for even permed or color treated hair. I use it it every 4 or 5 times I wash my hair and have never had any issues with build up. *I actually found this shampoo by researching top shampoos for dry/thinning hair, and this was a top pick from Good Housekeeping.",

However, I have found that my hair is just as soft, not frizzy, (which is impressive in the Florida humidity) and feels clean, not weighted down. The scent is nice, not strong. My hair is graying, not dyed or permed and slightly wavy. It tends to get frizzy without the right shampoo. I also use the Hair Food Smoothing conditioner. Both are great and much cheaper than my former shampoo.",

                "reviewText": "My hair was was full of products and it would not hold a curl, which i have had never had a problem with before. I dont know what had happened, but I was so frustrated and confused. The texture of my hair was so off, like tons of products where just layering on hair and would not come off no matter what I did to try to make it better. I did some research and decided to give this a try due to being free of all the damaging products I was using and had been using for yrs that suddenly became a problem. Maybe its due my age and hormones. Either way my hair was not having anymore. So again, I bought this and literally a miracle happened. Let me say, I first used dawn dish soap to strip all the crap that was just sitting in my hair which worked amazing. I then waited 2 days before shampooing again. When I did, I used this! I have medium length hair and trust me when I say, you do not need more than 2 pumps to wash entire head. My hair is now feeling amazing. Shine is back and curls are now holding. I am so grateful I found this product. Fabulous!!",

I also use the conditioner with the shampoo it is also awesome. I washed my hair with the shampoo and the conditioner on Wednesday it's Friday and I got up and I just simply rinsed my hair not shampooing cuz I didn't have the time to mess with my hair and when it dried it was still soft shiny and not frizzy at all. I definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner. I'm planning on looking to see what other products they have in their line and I will also give them a try and I hope there is great this dual turned out to be.",
