The shampoo was in soft envelope style packaging and one of the shampoo bottles (soft plastic) had a small slice in it causing shampoo to be leaked out. Not only was the package open and wet with shampoo leaking out when it arrived, but because the bottle was damaged, it was hard to get the shampoo out because of the slice letting air into the bottle. The shipper should consider only shipping these types of bottles within a box to prevent damage. I\u2019d rate shipping a 1 and the shampoo itself a 5, for an overall rating 3.",
