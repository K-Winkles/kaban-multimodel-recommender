I immediately started looking for the conditioner to go with it. This shampoo has worked better than the last 2 I've tried so I'm definitely going to be a repeat buyer. So glad I chose to buy this one because not only is it cheaper than the ones I've been purchasing and tried but it also works better with my hair, it's so clean an soft.
