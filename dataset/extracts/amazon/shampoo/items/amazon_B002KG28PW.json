In terms of effectiveness, I have been using the product for quite a while, and it has shown significant improvement in my hair. My hair can get very dry and is also very thin, but using this shampoo consistently has made my hair more hydrated but not stripped, clean, and it seems to have even helped with the strength of my hair. The smell is also pretty long-lasting too. Overall, it is a quite good shampoo, but if it doesn't work, there are definitely other options out there.",
