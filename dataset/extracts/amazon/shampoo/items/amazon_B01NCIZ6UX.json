It\u2019s not the best for your hair because of the chemicals, but it will 100% get rid of any brassiness and if leave it in for while, it will make hair silver and leave it in even longer it will make your hair have a purple tint. NOTE: THIS WILL STAIN YOUR NAILS \u2014 but easy to wash off if you scrub. I recommend using a hair mask afterwards instead of conditioner since it can dry your hair out a little.",

                "reviewText": "If you have bleached hair, highlights, etc. and do not like the brassy look that happens after the toner fades/washes out this is the BEST purple shampoo I have ever used. I\u2019ll use it every other week to keep the yellow out I don\u2019t keep it on very long because my hair is on the dryer side. IF YOU KEEP IT ON TOO LONG YOUR HAIR WILL TURN PURPLE. It is a little drying so I would definitely recommend using a good conditioner or deep conditioning after using.",

The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is it will stain your hands purple although it comes off after you wash your hands a few times. The directions do say to use gloves. It also seems to leave my hair very dry and tangled. But overall I would recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely obsessed with this product because it flat out works. It\u2019s very pigmented and works better than any other salon product I\u2019ve ever bought. I have very white almost silver blonde highlights and am a natural blonde. In order to keep up with that look it\u2019s hard to avoid getting yellow and brassy. I use this product once a week and it\u2019s the best. Beware it smells like old lady shampoo and can dry your hair out if you over use. So don\u2019t use it more than once a week. Also don\u2019t leave it on for more than a minute or two. Your hair will be purple if you do. Great news is it washes out after a wash or two. It\u2019s a must buy! At this price and size you will be set for a year, maybe even two!!",
