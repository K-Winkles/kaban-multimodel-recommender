I tried a few other brands but found they left my normally dry, color treated hair very oily. They were also extremely watery. My hair just didn't feel clean and I had to wash it every day which is not good for dry hair. I decided to try Jason's Biotin and Hyaluronic Acid Shampoo but was a little skeptical at the inexpensive price. Pricier brands were disappointing so I didn't have a lot of hope but the brand has been around for a long time and the reviews were good so I went for it. I love it! It's a bigger bottle than pricier brands and the shampoo is thick and creamy instead of thin and watery. It has a pleasant but faint scent, which I like because I like my hair to smell clean but not like perfume. Too many scents in all the different beauty products is overwhelming. There's still a rich lather despite have no sulfates and it rinses out easily. My hair feels clean, soft, and healthy and not a bit oily and it feels cleaner longer. It's not drying either. I don't have to shampoo every day now. I'm very pleased with the product, shipping, and price. I look forward to seeing if it helps my hair get healthier and stop falling out so fast but it's an excellent product either way.",

                "reviewText": "For anyone who was wondering, this is actually the New and Improved formulation of Jason's Biotin shampoo. The bottle looks different from the one pictured here (and did not leak in transit, so points for that). I don't have experience with the previous formulation, but I can tell this one lathers up just fine on the first try and doesn't leave hair dry. It also doesn't seem to contribute to fallout. Time will tell whether or not it leads to new growth, but the biotin is low enough on the new ingredients list to make me concerned about that. I will follow up with the new ingredients list, as the one in the product description does not apply to this formulation. First a note on the scent: it is kind of like if original Herbal Essences and Johnson & Johnson Baby Shampoo were mixed together, it would result in this scent. It's a weirdly comforting fragrance but YMMV. Secondly, the shampoo leaves my hair in fine condition for house-puttering and errand-running, but for a night out I am still going to reach for a high performance shampoo like L'Oreal. Anyhoo, here are the ingredients, many of which are just science-ese for coconut based products, sugar based products and Vitamin E:Aqua (Water), Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract*, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract*, Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Amine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Sodium Phytate, Sodium Sulfate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol*, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Coumarin, Fragrance (Parfum)*Certified Organic Ingredients(Edit 6/24/13) I am adding an addendum to this review to state that I am noticing new hair growth since I changed the way I use this shampoo. I started off using it like I do other shampoos - lather, rinse, no repeat. I noticed that other biotin shampoos have instructions to leave the product in your hair for a while, so I started doing that with this one, just leaving it in for a few minutes like I would with a conditioner. I believe the prolonged contact with my scalp is allowing the active ingredients to do their work.",
