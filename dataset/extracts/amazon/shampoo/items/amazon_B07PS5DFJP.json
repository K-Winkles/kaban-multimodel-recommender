I ran out of the shampoo and conditioner bought at the salon when I had it done however I needed something that was relatively cheaper and had more product for my dollar. I found this on Amazon and I\u2019m pretty glad I did. I just blew my hair dry and it took a little bit longer than usual as I like my hair stick straight vs the usual poofy wavy mess it\u2019s used to being. Moroccan oil products are amazing, they smell good and they do an incredible job. This smoothing shampoo and conditioner so just that. There\u2019s no sign of frizz yet and my hair feels lightweight. It\u2019s not sticky or anything. I will continue to purchase this shampoo and conditioner as it has no sulfates which are harmful for a keratin treatment but this shampoo makes my hair feel better and smells so good.",

                "reviewText": "I have ALWAYS loved Morroccanoil products. I've used them for over 15 years. Recently, my salon stopped carrying Morrocan Oil products. (They're a small shop, and the minimum order just became too large for them to stock. The loved the products.) When I saw the shampoo and conditioner on SALE for Amazon Prime Days 2021, for $14 off the usual price, I ordered BOTH the Smoothing Shampoo and Smoothing Conditioner. Normally I do not order this BIG 33.8 oz size, but the price was too good to pass up. AND now that I have them, I like the fact that they come with a PUMP on the top of the bottle. Easier in the shower than the flip top on the smaller bottles. I originally started using Morrocan Oil products at the recommendation of my stylist, beginning with the Moroccan OIL. (The photo is of MANY of my previous products.) I LOVE the scent!!! I have thick, wavy, dyed hair, and have sometimes used the Repair line, and sometimes the Moisturizing line. As I've aged, and since I live in the high arid desert, my hair gets \"flyaway\". The Smoothing line works for reducing that \"static\" in my hair. You won't go wrong with any of these products, and the scent is divine!",

                "reviewText": "I have thick, wavy hair, somewhat frizzy. Everyone says how lucky I am to have all this hair but I think it's a pain in-the-you-know-what. It can be pretty voluminous and I like a more polished appearance. I don't like, however, spending an hour blow drying it out nor do I necessarily want sleek straight hair. And yes, it takes that long when you have a lot of thick, wavy hair. This shampoo and it's buddy - the smoothing conditioner, are great. It's worth the extra cost in my opinion. It calms the hair down and leaves it feeling very clean and healthy. I always get compliments on the way my hair smells. To be honest, I can't smell it on my hair but I believe them. I highly recommend the conditioner, too. I think the magic is in the pair. I also add some of the original Moroccan Oil while my hair is damp, and sometimes the brand's anti-frizz spray depending on the situation/weather. I air dry most of the time. I think using all these products together makes a huge difference. If you aren't happy with the shampoo, try the products together before you turn around. When I use the shampoo alone it's not as effective as when I also use the conditioner. Give it a try! Great seller - no issues and delivered quickly.",

(Lo compraba en establecimientos con permisos de la marca).Lo que puedo decir ahora es que lleva semanas en mi ba\u00f1o y no ha cambiado el color y sigue oliendo muy bien. Antes de comprar cualquiera de estos es recomendable revisar el estado de tu pelo para que compres la mejor opci\u00f3n, yo sol\u00eda comprar siempre el reparador solo porque mi pelo no me gustaba y lo que necesitaba era otro tipo de acondicionamiento. He comprado el shampoo, acondicionador, la crema, el control de puntas abiertas y el aceite y estoy fascinada, mi pelo me encanta y se siente muy bien!!",
