For some reason, men LOVE the smell of this - I get stopped everywhere when I use this and never when I use more expensive shampoo.This is a basic shampoo and probably not great for keeping color intact. I have bleached platinum hair, so it\u2019s fine for me as long as I don\u2019t use it in the first week after it\u2019s been toned at the salon.I also use this as a body wash in a pinch. The conditioner is surprisingly good, too. Not for fixing damaged hair (I have other products for that), but a great everyday conditioner that leaves my hair tangle free and smelling great.",

It gets my hair clean and I\u2019ve been using it regularly for a couple years now and haven\u2019t had to do that short term switch because after a while the shampoo leaves enough of a build up that it never looks clean. This shampoo isn\u2019t harsh. I haven\u2019t even trimmed my hair in about 5 years and don\u2019t have many split ends. Just found out this week that my husband has started using it and he has been a die hard for his brand of choice for years. Really surprised that he likes it too. The smell isn\u2019t strong so he doesn\u2019t walk around all day smelling girly.",
