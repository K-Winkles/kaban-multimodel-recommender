Three washes with this has pretty much eradicated my scabs to where I\u2019m not embarrassed to get a hair cut or have a hair dresser in my hair. My hair also feels SO soft and usually I have pretty coarse hair. I also use the ogx coconut shampoo and conditioner set, all three in my hair twice a week and omg. I\u2019ve noticed a difference in like 2 weeks. I do let the tea tree shampoo set in my hair for a few minutes and it has really changed my hair. This was a last resort before I bought some crazy expensive products and I definitely won\u2019t be doing that now. I also really love the fragrance and lather ability of this shampoo, it smells really minty but not overwhelmingly so, and it lathers up very well. My extension specialist gave it the ok for my extensions as well, so that\u2019s nice and it\u2019s waaaaaayyyyy more affordable than redkin or the from the salon stuff I was about to invest in \ud83d\ude29",

I have long hair, so absolutely have to follow with intense conditioner or my hair is like straw. The thing I don't understand is why it is so thick, it's almost stiff it is so gelatinous. You need your hair to be absolutely dripping or you can't lather. I dispense in my palm, then put my head back under the shower so I can apply immediately. Have tried to water it down in the bottle with mixed results. I do love the smell and the tingly feeling. Makes your scalp feel really clean.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of my staple favorites throughout the years(5 years to be exact). First, I LOVE the fragrance. To me, it smells like chocolate mint. (like peppermint chocolate ice cream). Second, the mint gives my scalp a real refreshing feeling and lastly, it does a beautiful job of cleaning my hair. Also, a little goes a long way...lasts a long time (depending on how ofter you shampoo your hair). Foot note: Use the conditioner on occasion, but it's rather diluted and doesn't last long. Shampoo: Competitive price...highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I ran into trouble with my scalp that absolutely nothing I tried over the course of many months did anything to heal. I learned that aloe vera can make rashes and wounds worse, not better, and most products made to soothe and heal are based on aloe vera and other oils that did me no good whatsoever, just exacerbated and prolonged the problem. My sister, living in a totally different climate, recommended this shampoo and conditioner and finally I tried it. It has done SO MUCH BETTER than anything else and I LOVE THE AROMA. The witch-hazel not only gives the it a more pure and fresh cleanse but also combines with the mint and tea tree to make it smell very similar sacred Palo Santo wood (slightly like sandalwood or very mild copal). With the companion conditioner, my hair is very soft, clean and fluffy and my scalp is the best it has been in over a year since this crazy problem started. I don't want anything else for my hair forever now!",
