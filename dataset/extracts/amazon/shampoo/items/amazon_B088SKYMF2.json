                "reviewText": "After years of trying to find a replacement for the shampoo I was buying at Costco, and having tried everything at great cost, I came upon this shampoo. Clearly not every shampoo works the same for everyone but this one works perfectly for me. Seriously, the most recent innovation in unsettling consumers homeostasis so that they try \"something new\" is a formula change...or have it made elsewhere so it's not the same. I'm am actually considering buying several bottles or more so that I always have this one shampoo. It has increased the volume, helped may hair have body and curl (I'm not young and don't have the long thick tresses I once had!) and left my hair clean for days after shampooing. A great find! Please Nexxus...don't change it!",

                "reviewText": "My hair is very porous, so it soaks up anything I put in it, leaving my hair flat and feeling weighed down. I was hoping this would be a good clarifying shampoo, but that's not the case. I still gave it 3 stars because it does leave my hair feeling soft, and I think this would be a good shampoo for people wanting a high-quality anti-frizz shampoo. However, don't buy this expecting it to be a megan cleaning shampoo. It still left my hair feeling weighted down and dull.",
