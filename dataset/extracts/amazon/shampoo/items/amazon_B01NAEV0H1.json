                "reviewText": "I've waited to write this review after using this shampoo as directed for about 2 1/2 months. At the beginning of Nov. I began losing large amounts of hair due to a massive hormone imbalance. We're talking like a ping pong ball sized wad of hair every time I showered. My hair was visibly getting thin at my temples & hairline & I proceeded to freak out-so I bought this shampoo. My husband had been using Bosley's shampo & cond., but the ingredient list is massive (full of chemicals). I wanted something more natural w/better ingredients, which is why I chose Purad'or. I bought the lavender vanilla scent, which honestly has next to no smell at all (but that's ok). It is very mild smelling w/no chemical smell at all. It's a pinkish gel consistency-not very thick, but not super watery either. 1 pump definitely gets your whole head. It DOES lather up some, but not like the typical soap shampoos. Here's the deal though: YOU MUST LEAVE IT ON FOR 2 MIN. before rinsing out. Now, I'm very impatient, so it's annoying to do, but I just count & do some squats in the shower (might as well get some exercise in, right)? If you don't leave it on 2 min., I notice my hair was more tangly. When I leave it on for the full 2 min., when I rinse, my hair is much more soft & detangled. It has not dried out my hair or my scalp at all. No irritation to the scalp at all (& I have very sensitive skin). I use my own preferred conditioner because I have color treated hair. NOTE: it will strip your color out some-so beware of that, esp. if you use semi-permanent hairdye like me). NOTE: YOU WILL NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE UNTIL YOU'VE USED IT AS DIRECTED FOR A MONTH. At week 2, I saw no difference at all & was getting really discouraged. Then after week 3 I started noticing less fall out & now at 6 weeks, I'm losing way less hair each washing. It went from a big wad of hair to maybe the size of a pea. I waited to review until it was this way consistently & I can honestly say, I have lost this small amount of hair for over a week now. I'm now losing about the same amount I was before all of my hormone issues. It does make your hair seem thicker as well, which also helps. I have never tried the gold label one, so I don't know about the smell of that one, but this blue bottle one that's lavender vanilla has no gross chemical or woodsy smell like some have mentioned on here. It just smells very mildly flowery, but the scent disappears quickly. I will continue to use it, maybe forever, because it's helping me lose less hair. I also take hair vitamins & use a growth scalp oil daily now too, so there's also that. I highly recommend this shampoo though if your hair is thinning & you want a more natural approach without a million chemicals in it.",

                "reviewText": "This is the 3rd of these products that I have tried. I am not paid to do this. I had a need and ordered this stuff after reading other reviews. They can be hard to sift through as some are paid or given free product to test it. I really wish amazon did not allow this or at least would pass them off as shill reviews.On that note, I have tried Regenepure and Monat products for the same reason. Thinning hair. I am mid 40s and my dad an older brother lost most of their hair much earlier. I still have quite a bit, but it is starting to thin and I feel much too young to let it go. I am considering surgery if needed in the future, but will try anything to put this off or eliminate the need if possible.I did not get much if any success from the other (Regenepure and Monat) products. A lot of hope and wishful thinking, but after a couple of years of using them, my hair was slowly getting worse. I have used this PURA D'OR for about a month. I am also taking PriaPlex (or PriaPlus, bought on Amazon too) pills. I have not been taking the Pria Product for a month yet. I am not sure which is helping, but i have noticed two things. One, my hair is not falling out when i wash it. I used to have 10-20 strands in my hands when I would shower or style with product. Now it is 0-4. The other things I have seen is small hairs coming in on the front hairline. One could argue that these have broken and are regrowth. I am just glad to see little hairs popping out and did not see this before. I am hopeful this is happening all over my scalp. If my hair would thicken by 10-20% this would likely solve my problem for now.I am hopeful that between these two products I can kick the surgery can down the street for 10 years or so. Would definitely recommend both of these products if you have about $90-100 per month to sink into a solution (the pills are about $75/month). If you only have $20 or so to invest a month, start with THIS SHAMPOO. I know it is what is contributing to my early success. I bet I get 3 months or more out of the bottle. I have used for a month and i am not even close to finishing it. I am certain it is more than 1/2 full. I use two pumps each time I shower and not much comes out. My hair is pretty short, and this does cause it to lather pretty well. If you had long-ass thick hair I bet this would go for at least a month. So it does a good job of cleaning hair too. It is not the best smelling shampoo, but i would put baby puke in my hair if it would make it grow. That said, no need to follow up with another shampoo to make it smell better. Just a different smell. Earthy maybe, but you could expect that from a natural product mix.This is the best i have tried to-date on my 2+ year search.",

It's not horrible but it's not great either. It smells like I'm washing my hair with a pine product but it's not so horrible that I cannot use it. I just wish the company could make it smell more appealing.",
