The shedding is no where near as much as I was losing. I could literally run my hand through my hair and feel chunks coming out. I have only had this shampoo maybe a week or 2. I am also taking vitamins so Im not sure if its a combination of the 2 or just one or the other but something is definitely happening. I also am obsessed with the smell of it. I just wish the bottle was bigger.",
