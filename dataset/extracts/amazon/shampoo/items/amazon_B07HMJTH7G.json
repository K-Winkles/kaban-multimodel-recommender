On a whim, I bought this Aveeno Daily Moisture for dry/damaged hair shampoo because I didn\u2019t want to spend a fortune for something that might not work. I have used it one time people, one time. It works! The frizz and fly away? GONE. The natural curl came back! It looks healthier! I\u2019m very pleased! It\u2019s not oily and left no residue. Not crazy about the fragrance, but I will get used to it for these results. Will continue to use this shampoo for sure!",
