                "reviewText": "I searched up this brand after I read the Korean comparison review for shampoos from more than 50 different brands according to its ingredients. She compares most of popular brand in korea even manufacturing from US like avalon organic , aveda, many orgarnic brand as well. I used to use avalon organic or nature gate with gentle cleansing soap since I have very sensitive skin, other brands makes my skin so itchy and so irritated and make me loose lots of hairs. So I always concern whether it\u2019s harmful ingredients in it.It was one of top shampoos with good ingredients and even good scent. So I decide to give it a try.I thought it\u2019s shampoo and conditioner set but it\u2019s two shampoo delivered which I didn\u2019t notice I ordered only shampoos. So I tried only shampoo first and I liked it. It\u2019s still soft enough to brush without Using conditioner since I have very straight hair. But I ordered conditioner set as well after I tried. And for my teenage daughter I ordered several other fragrances like english rose and baby powder. I satisfy it is still makes my hair smooth and healthy.White musk scent is also good for my husband use. Since it\u2019s like not all the way floral scent.I love it I want to try other scent as well but I still have bunch shampoo and conditioner with different scent my closet So later I will try them as well.Very satisfied.",
