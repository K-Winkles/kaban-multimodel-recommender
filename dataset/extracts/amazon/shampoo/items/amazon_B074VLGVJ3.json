I've found shampoos that do a pretty good job with my hair but so far this stuff is at the top of my list. For those that care it lathers really good and smells nice. But for me that main positive is that my hair hasn't been this full for years. It looks like I have more hair than I actually do. Don't know how that's possible but that's what I'm seeing. I recommend this product. Oh, by the way, the price is really good too.",

                "reviewText": "So. I needed shampoo. And I wasn\u2019t willing to go out in the hot summer heat. Good old amazon to the rescue. Ordered shampoo online.There\u2019s just so much to pick from on amazon. I was looking forPUMP STYLE (I mean everything else around my tub is pump style including the bubble bath stuff so that just made sense),QUANTITY- I hate ordering soaps and stuff often so I prefer to buy family sized to save money and save effort to remember to reorder again. Nothing like running out of essentials every month, or worse, realizing it mid showerQUALITY- now this was the iffy one. I was using another brand I think it was like called OG or something it\u2019s that short bottle with round cap. Anyways I had used that one for about a year now. Few bottles. I had consistently had irritable scalp and I was always itchy at the base of my scalp and it wasn\u2019t dandruff. After I switched to this new garnier shampoo. I noticed, my scalp issues went away. Within a week. Completely went away \ud83d\ude31I went from itchy scratching oozing bleeding. To no issues. Might have been sensitive to something or just too drying. It was a charcoal deep cleanse formula for oily scalp.Anyways. This new green bottle has been amazing it smells wonderful too so showers definitely more enjoyable, and the size of it should last me to Christmas at least! For $10 \ud83d\ude1d (I was buying the other bottle of wherever for $8.99 and it was about 1/3 the size of this giant bottle)Will buy again. Seriously considering getting the conditioner but so far the shampoo has left me fully hydrated on BLEACHED BLONDE AND COLORED HAIR! And it didn\u2019t strip the color either. (I used this on freshly colored hair, no color came off on the suds on even day one)Kind to scalp, kind to colored and bleached hair, kind to wallet \ud83e\udd11",
