I was skeptical but practical in my purchase. First, the shampoo has a light really pleasant smell and lathers so much better than expensive products I have bought in the past. My hair had started to transition from perm to natural (Black Person-Kinky). I put just a small amount of the Conditioner on my edges and at my roots. It combed through with no trouble and very little loss of hair. This will be the shampoo/conditioner set I keep on hand now for emergencies and in between. I don't know what it did for others but its AWESOME for me.",

It was delivered this morning and luckily on hair wash day. I also ordered a scalp massager as its suppose to stimulate hair growth. Any ways firstly this shampoo & conditioner smells amazing and is not over powering. After shampooing my hair did not feel dry and crappy which is amazing. Conditioner was left in for 3 minutes and left my hair feeling sooo soft. Now I usually while washing see lots of hair loss. I had way way less hairloss with this shampoo and conditioner combo and I mean wayyyy less. And wayyyy less hair loss after gently towel drying and brushing my hair. My hair is soft and easier to brush through. Will update after a bit more use but so far 5 stars.",

It's a good combination and this brand of shampoo and conditioner came highly recommended by a hair transplant clinic and stated that it will and does help to keep your hair. It may not be a complete solution...but in combination with other treatments, it will help for sure. I do recommend it. I added a bit of castor oil and rosemary oil drops into it and shook it all up. Feels great in the hair.",
