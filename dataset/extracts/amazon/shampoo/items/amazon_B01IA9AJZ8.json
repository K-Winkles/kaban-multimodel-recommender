With most shampoos, if I wash it at night I usually feel like I need to wash it again in the morning. This has been a problem lately because I had foot surgery, so showering is inconvenient.I tell you all of that up front so I can say this: this Suave is is the first clarifying shampoo I have found where I can wash my hair at night when I shower and have it feel clean all day the next day. The scent is neutral in that it's neither strongly floral or 'masculine'. It just smells clean, and you won't really notice it the next day. Highly recommended, and I hope it isn't discontinued anytime soon.",

My hair is strawberry blonde and turns brighter red in the sun- I wanted to highlight to look like that all the time. The highlights made it INTENSE. Way more red than I was hoping for. I honestly hated it. I got this shampoo and after 5 rounds of washing, the color stripped to exactly what I wanted! Totally toned down the highlights. Now my hair looks natural and beautiful.

                "reviewText": "I bought this shampoo to help rinse colour from my hair before using a colour remover. It works very well. Even with the low price, Suave is considered to be a great clarifying shampoo ( I did some reading ). If you are using it this way, use the hottest water you can take and much more shampoo than you normally use. This helped me get the most out of my colour remover. Makes your hair feel wonderfully light",
