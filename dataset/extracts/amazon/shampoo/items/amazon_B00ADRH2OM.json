I tried my daughters OGX hair product when I visited her after Hurricane Ian. That's when I started losing hair. Biotin has always been a part of my aging. I tried this shampoo every other day for three weeks and I already noticed the difference in the texture. It feels creamy and thick at application and rinses well. No real smell to the shampoo. No itching or adverse reactions. I have white hair and my hair looked shiny and brilliant white...no additional blue rinse for me! The price is right and I really love the shape and feel of the bottle, easy to distinguish in the shower even with my eyes closed! Nice packaging and delivery rapid. Joan Maroto",
