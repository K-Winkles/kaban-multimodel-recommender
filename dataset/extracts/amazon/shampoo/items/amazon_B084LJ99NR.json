I have horrible buildup and can't afford $40 shampoo so I use this instead. It's the only shampoo that completely cleans my scalp and leaves it non itchy. It's a staple in my bathroom and I whole heartedly recommend it for anybody who wants their hair weighed down and cleaned to the roots. If you have fine hair and want volume this isn't for you. If you have dyed hair and want color that sticks this isn't for you. If you have curly or coily hair and want a daily shampoo this isn't for you. But if you want a complete scalp clean every few weeks this is perfect.It also smells really nice.",
