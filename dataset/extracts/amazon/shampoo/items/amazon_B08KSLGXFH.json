                "reviewText": "I was shocked to look for my standby Neutrogena anti-residue clarifying shampoo and see it selling for $75 a bottle. After figuring out it has been discontinued, I needed to find something new. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week, but use product daily. This is great at getting the thorough clean I need when I wash without stripping the hair. In fact, it almost feels like it has a very light conditioning effect after washing out, so I use twice. Gentler than the discontinued clarifying shampoo. And my hair is not oily, if anything dry. I love the scent - am a fan of grapefruit (goes well with my Kiehl\u2019s body wash). Very happy, will continue to purchase.",
