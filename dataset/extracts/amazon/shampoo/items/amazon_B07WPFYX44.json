I\u2019ve been battling with dandruff with the season changes and the prescription cream I\u2019ve been using seemed to just add more build up. Let me tell you, this stuff works!!! I\u2019ve used Head & Shoulders before and ended up with dry, tangled curls, but with this one, even after shampooing twice my hair still felt manageable. I only use the conditioner on my roots/scalp area and a deep conditioner on the rest of my hair, but it did not leave a weird buildup or cause dryness. Definitely recommend, and it smells good too!!",

                "reviewText": "This wonderful sulfate free dandruff Head and Shoulders variety of shampoo is impossible to find it stores. I am so thankful that I can find it here! The economy size, multi pack option is just right for my family. This size bottle lasts 2 users about 3-4 months and it does wonders for clearing dandruff almost immediately after a few uses. It's such a great price savings and we are so glad that we aren't having to deal with sulfates while we try to clean our hair.",
