My second time ordering this, had horrible reactions to my scalp and created an infection after a day of use. I thought maybe this was a fluke, so I tried it again 3 weeks lately after fully healing, although the same thing happened to the applied area! The two orders were identical, nothing changed, which tells me that it could be careless ingredient mixture from the manufacturer. Had to throw the product in the trash, so be cautious!",
