I could go to sleep with my hair down and wake up with soft, untangled and healthy hair. When styling it has an after shine. My hair was very dry, unhealthy and tangled all the time. Best product to have. Smells good too.",

                "reviewText": "I love this shampoo! The first time I used it I couldn't believe the difference it made in hair. My hair was so much softer, easier to comb through and bouncier after washing with it. It smells so so good too, just like coconut. It makes me feel like I'm in a tropical rainforest when I used it.I recently tried a different brand thinking, oh it can't be that different. Was I ever wrong. It's settled this is my absolute fav shampoo I've ever used! I couldn't even finish out the other brand's bottle because this one is so much better!.",
