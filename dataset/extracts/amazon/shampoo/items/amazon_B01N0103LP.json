It detangled my hair in the shower which was great and left it feeling so fresh, soft, and renewed. Also, the smell lasts a long time and isn\u2019t too strong. The only issue with this is that my lid came in slightly broken which led to some leakage but not much at all. Overall, I would give this product a try and any other products in their line.",
