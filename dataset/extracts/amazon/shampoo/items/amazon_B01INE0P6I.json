This shampoo for men is designed specifically for those that want fresh, clean hair and have a concern about hair loss. It deeply cleans and invigorates hair with a refreshing effect, and is infused with caffeine + menthol. It helps strengthen hair, leaving it visibly healthy, thicker and resilient, with a dual 2-in-1 formula that functions as a shampoo and conditioner so that it cleanses and conditions hair simultaneously. This 2-in-1 consolidates your shower routine to keep up with men\u2019s active lifestyles and everyday activities that can weaken hair, making it more prone to hair fall from breakage and cause concern about hair loss. Great hair doesn\u2019t stop in the shower! Complete your hair care regimen after using 2 in 1 shampoo and get great more resilient hair with the Dove Men+Care Sculpting Paste for a natural look, Defining Pomade for a sleek and polished finish, or Control Gel for all-day hold. Use it with the entire line of Dove Men + Care products for the perfect grooming regimen, such as Dove Men+Care Extra Fresh Body Wash and Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant.",

                "reviewText": "I just tried the DOVE MEN + CARE Fortifying 2 in 1 Shampoo, and while it has a few advantages, it falls short of my expectations in a few areas.On the positive side, the shampoo works a good job of washing my hair and scalp. It has a lovely, not overwhelming aroma and leaves my hair feeling quite silky. The ease of a 2-in-1 solution saves time by removing the need for a separate conditioner.However, I think the strengthening assertion is overdone. While my hair feels clean, it does not appear to be stronger or more reinforced with consistent application. I was looking for a little more in terms of power and nourishing characteristics.",
