She said that she had used this brand and loved it. She had bought for fine hair which I have and I have loved it. When I tried to reorder l ended up with the for frizzy and curly formula which didn't work at all for me.I went back to the website and found this formula for dry and damaged hair. Wow! It really made my hair feel like brand new. Because I have fine hair, I periodically have a perm and it can damage the ends of the hair shaft.This Monday shampoo and conditioner for dry and damaged hair was amazing.I now go back and forth between fine hair and this one for dry and damaged.I have used some very expensive brand shampoos before, but this Monday brand has beat them hands down.",

                "reviewText": "I received this product Dec 15 and it is nearly the end of January. For years I have had to wash my hair at least three times per week. When I received this shampoo I kept my usual routine and then I realized I could wait another day, then another, then another, and so on. I have very long hair and it is a chore to wash and would take hours to dry. Also, I have an area on my crown that tends to get oily. I brush and comb my hair frequently throughout the day. It's been nearly a week since I washed my hair and the photos are cropped but otherwise unretouched.The shampoo and conditioner smell nice, but not perfumey. It really just smells \"fresh\".One other note, I don't have to use much of this product, and I only apply conditioner around my face, on the neck area and down the length.I don't have flyaways and haven't had as much breakage as with other products. I have used Pantene and so other salon type products, but this is by far the best I have used in the past ten years.",

It smells almost like lemongrass which I love, but for some reason it also smells like something burning. Like burnt hair a little. At first I thought it was just my hair from styling it, but I have used it when I have not styled my hair and smelled inside the bottle as well, and it is definitely the shampoo. The conditioner isn't as bad, but it's just strange. It doesn't leave much of that burnt hair smell on my hair like the next day, but in the shower it just smells wrong and when my hair is wet as well. I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot, but idk. Also the pump sucks lol, you get barely any shampoo, you gotta pump like 5-6 times to get what you need.",

I was looking for a comparable good smelling shampoo to the old Revlon Outrageous (remember how good that smelled, and you would know when women were wearing it when they walked by!?) and read that this shampoo was similar. I did not think it was, but it does have a stronger clean scent so far compared to others, so i already ordered another set. Left my hair feeling soft and not tangled, so that's a winner to me!",
