They've all wound-up in the trash because they could not stop my scalp from itching. It's particularly annoying because I don't have dandruff (or bugs). Anyway, I found this on the Amazon, read some reviews and because it wasn't another expensive bottle (that was probably going to wind up in the trash), I tried it. Glad I did. It's not only a great price, but smells good and has cut itching my head by, I bet, 75-80%",
