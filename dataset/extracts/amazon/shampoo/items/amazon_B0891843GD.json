I use the shampoo & conditioner in combination with the hair mask and my hair is soft, shinny and smells amazing! I noticed I can go 3 days without washing and a little goes a long way with this product also! My hair doesn\u2019t look oily and feel strains after like most products. The price is worth it! I still have more than half the bottle left and I bought this a few months ago! The 21 benefits spray is amazing also! I love that I made the switch.",
