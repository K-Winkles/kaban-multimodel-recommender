This shampoo does have oils inside to nourish your hair, but after you wash your hair with it, it will feel dry. After 2-3 days, your hair will start to feel soft and nourished from the oils. So i recommend you use it once every 2-3 days.This shampoo is strong and it is not designed for every day use, but it does work. If you try to use it everyday your hair will feel horrible and dry. I would have given it 5 stars but washing your hair every 2-3 days might be inconvenient for some people.",
