                "reviewText": "2nd UPDATE: AFTER USING FOR 2 YEARS. I've completely changed my review and opinion on this product. I think this product has single handily saved my hair. I'm a white woman and I'm 68 years old & on several medications. Several years ago my hair started thinning & falling out. I stopped using any type of hair coloring year ago, because of sever allergies. my hair was pretty much entirely white. MY hair is nearly waist long now, (have to keep it in a pony tail). My hair will never be as thick as when I was young, but all the balder spots on my head and thinner areas have filled in and my hair has gone back to blond and is shiny (as shiny as it can be). People that haven't seen me for a while keep telling me I look a lot younger, since I started coloring my hair again. But, I haven't. What, I have done is replace all my other products with this. I still use my medicated prescription shampoo once a week, but that dries my hair really bad. (I have seborreic dermatitis, so I have to use that shampoo) Then, I put this on. Leave it on for 5 minutes and wash it out. I follow with cool water for about a minute. I know that's not how it;s supposed to be done, but that's how I do it & it's worked for me. It's both cleaned & conditioned my hair & scalp & I get a very small amount of hair in the drain, if any. I might also add that I have straight hair, not curly or wavy. In my opinion, this could be used for different hair types. What you see below, are my previous reviews of this product. Whenever I find that a product is worse or better than I originally thought, I try to note that. Sometimes you don't know how well something actually works, until you've used it awhile.* OK, originally I had given this a one star rating, but I've changed that. My sister had purchased some too, so I tried it again. This actually has worked somewhat for me, but I've had to make some modifications to it. Like What??? I've found that this can actually make my hair soft, if I wet my hair with warm water, massage this in, leave it a few minutes, rinse it out and then follow with a good sulfate free shampoo. Wait, this is a shampoo!! Yes, but there are ingredients in this that just weigh my hair down too much and I believe the weighing it down and buildup is what's causing the dryness and breakage. I \"do not\" follow with a conditioner. This actually has enough conditioner in it. I think that was my mistake before. I was following this, with the conditioner. MISTAKE!! At least for me, it was. But, working this into my hair and scalp well, leaving it for a few minutes, rinsing and then following with a good sulfate free shampoo. left my hair, clean, soft & shiny for 4 days. I'm happy with that. I can't give it higher stars, because I couldn't get those results as instructed.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've probably used a couple hundred shampoos in my 66 years and I can say without a doubt, even including the drying medicated shampoos, that this was the most drying shampoo I've ever used. My hair came out by me just touching it and that was BEFORE I was able to put any kind of conditioner on it. Even after the best conditioner I have, I still had hair loss, until I was able to get some good products on it and the hair breakage and loss stopped. My sister tried it on just a little bit of her hair and it did the exact same thing. I seriously don't know how anyone could honestly rate this higher than 1 or 2. It's cheap & smells good. That's not worth losing your hair over, when I've spent so much to keep it. It went straight to the trash.Thank you for reading my review.",

Instead of getting stuck with something I may never use again, I bought this. I love the smell and my hair always feels clean after using this! Would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "Shampoo is thick, has a nice lather and a nice smell when first applying. After rinsing out, the smell is gone, leaving hair smelling clean. I cannot attest to extra product removal since I don't use them often.Conditioner is light. I like to use conditioner to detangle my wet curls and this conditioner becomes foamy and lathers well when I comb through my hair. The foamy lather helps spread the conditioner after you apply a small amount towards ends of hair.The bottles look small but the amount inside decreases slower than I expected. I feel like my hair is healthier but I am not sure because I recently trimmed my split ends.If you are used to using many other products after washing, this may be a good option because of the clarifying shampoo and the light conditioner.",
