                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Tresemme Shampoo 3 Pack, and there's a lot to love about this product. The scent is delightful and lingers, leaving my hair smelling fantastic for hours. The shampoo is rich and luxurious, providing a thorough cleanse that leaves my hair soft and shiny.Shine and Softness:Tresemme has nailed it in creating a shampoo that delivers on the promise of soft, shiny hair. After use, my locks feel smooth and have a brilliant, healthy sheen. For someone who values their hair's natural luster, this shampoo delivers on that front.Not Ideal for Fine Hair:However, as someone with fine hair that lacks volume, this particular shampoo didn't quite meet my needs. While it smells great and initially leaves my hair looking fantastic, it tends to weigh down my already thin strands. I prefer shampoos that add volume and body, which this one didn't provide. Even when used sparingly, it still flattened my hair, making it look limp and lacking in bounce.Best for Thicker or Curlier Hair:This shampoo would be perfect for individuals with thick or curly hair or those needing extra moisture and sleekness. This might be the right choice if you're looking to combat frizz or add water to your hair. Additionally, if you use conditioner regularly and aren't concerned about additional weight, this shampoo could work wonderfully.Conclusion:In conclusion, while the Tresemme Shampoo 3 Pack offers a delightful smell, incredible shine, and softness, there might be better fits for individuals with fine, thin hair struggling to maintain volume. It's a matter of personal preference, and I've learned that my hair type needs a different treatment. I'll opt for a volume-thickening shampoo for my next purchase to address my specific needs. If you have thick, curly hair or require extra moisture and sleekness, this shampoo could perfectly match you. As for me, I'll be on the lookout for a product that gives my fine hair the lift and body it craves.",
