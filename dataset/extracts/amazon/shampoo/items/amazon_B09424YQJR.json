                "reviewText": "I have medium thickness, slightly wavy hair that is down to my waist and tangles very easily. I get greasy roots, and my ends are very dry and prone to breakage. That being said, I bought this bar shampoo back in September 2021 and have been using it exclusively for at least the last 3 months ( I tried to use up my bottles first so I didn\u2019t start using this exclusively until around November 2021). I start at the roots and suds up my scalp and then squeeze the suds down to the ends of my hair. I rinse and then repeat doing the scalp again due to my oily scalp. This gets my hair super clean and I don\u2019t have to use conditioner except a small amount of leave in on the ends.Sometimes, I don\u2019t even need the leave in conditioner if I am not too vigorous with the lathering. The bar is still going strong as of January 22, 2022. I shampoo my hair about 2-3 times a week this way due to the length of my hair and the dry ends. The bar lasts a long time. It smells wonderful like honey. It lathers well and my hair doesn\u2019t feel too tangled unlike with regular shampoo and even conditioners. I saw Drew Barrymore\u2019s Instagram post showing her hair, which appears to be similar to mine in length and texture. I thought I would try it. I was very surprised. If it helps cut down on plastic, cleans my hair and smells good, it\u2019s a win-win. One thing, when ordering from Amazon they ship it in a big oversized bubble wrap plastic envelope mailer. That kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging that the bar comes in. Next time I will see if I can find it in the store.",

                "reviewText": "First, let me start with some information about me. I have thick, curly/wavy, long hair that I wash about four times a week. My shampoo before was leaving my curls limp and oily, and I had to wash my hair almost every day because of it, so I decided to try this. It my first shampoo bar, so it did take a transition period for my hair to adjust, but after that, it worked fantastically. It smells amazing and it left my hair clean and soft after washing. The reason I am giving it four stars is because by the time I was whittling the soap down to about the end of its life, it started to crackle and fall apart, as you can see in the attached picture. I got about three months of use with it before this started happening. Other than this, it worked fantastically. Also, I give it four stars because it does not work well in hard water, so if you have hard water you will need to do a rinse with vinegar or be left with waxy feeling hair. For the money, this is a good shampoo bar. Definitely worth a shot if you are new to them and just want to try it out without breaking the bank!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a lower cost alternative to Hibar. Hibar is the best shampoo bar I\u2019ve tried out of a half dozen or so shampoo bars. The Garnier honey shampoo bar is lighter weight and not as dense as Hibar, so fail there. The Garnier bar had a sickly fragrance so I set it in the garage for a week hoping it would fade a bit. Once unpackaged, used and set in the shower, I could smell the fragrance as soon as I came in the house after being gone all day. It has a semi-natural honey fragrance but a strong synthetic undertone that\u2019s kinda nauseating. If you\u2019re someone who uses fragranced body care, cosmetics, laundry products, cleaning products, etc. you probably will like it. I don\u2019t enjoy smelling like a chemist\u2019s idea of mountain breezes and generally avoid fragranced body care. I guess I thought it would be naturally sourced, my bad.Unfortunately it left a residue and also dried out my hair. I may research Garnier\u2019s other bars to see if they\u2019re fragranced differently or if reviews say it leaves their hair soft, etc. It would be nice to be able to grab a bar shampoo off a shelf at a large retailer. Im stubbornly avoiding plastic packaging as much as possible.But Hibar is where I\u2019ll be spending my shampoo dollars. Please don\u2019t acquire them and ruin the product Loreal!",
