I also bought the matching leave in conditioner it works really well too but I don't use it every time The shampoo and conditioner works great all on there own. It made a difference I could feel from the first time I used them and been using it for about a month now. My hair is fairly long and before I bought this brand I trimmed my hair a little so I could get rid of some of my split ends but my hair was still dry and breaking. It really has helped my hair to become so soft helped with the breakage. My scalp was so dry and had some dandruff before which is so much better now I don't think it says that on the bottles but it has really made a difference for me. It also smells great too!!!",

It cleans your hair very well and it leaves it full and shiny. It\u2019s hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that makes gray hair shiny. I will be buying this again and again!!",

                "reviewText": "I liked this shampoo, but at the same time I wasn\u2019t impressed with it. It seemed like I had the same amount of split ends that I had when I started using it. I even made sure to cut my split ends off before starting to use this shampoo so my hair would hopefully remain healthy, but this didn\u2019t seem to help. Overall it keeps your hair clean, but for me personally I didn\u2019t see much hair growth and minimized split ends.",
