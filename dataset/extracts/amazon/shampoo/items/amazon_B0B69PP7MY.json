Every winter, I get a dry, itchy scalp, and I am constantly scratching my head to the point of dandruff or some kind of dermatitis that causes flakes in my hair. And every winter I try to find products to alleviate this issue. This year, I did a coconut oil treatment and while I waited, I went on Amazon and found this and the conditioner. After reading the reviews and doing some quick research, I decided to try it. It arrived the next evening. That was a couple of weeks ago. I have washed and conditioned my hair about three times with this product and it has made such a difference. I do not itch anymore. I am seeing less and less dandruff. The smell is a little different than I am used to, but it isn't unpleasant. Had I known about this, I would have tried it a long time ago. If you battle the same problems I do, just buy it. It's not too expensive and the relief I feel is sooo worth it!((I wrote the same review for the conditioner.))",

                "reviewText": "Where to start.... So I have always had Seb Derm but as soon as I moved to Florida in 2017 it was the absolute worst it had ever been! I had insane red itchy hot spots and disgusting huge flakes of skin just stuck to my scalp that were so noticeable, I have super thick hair but it was constantly falling out! I had to shower at least once a day just to keep it some what under control pain wise. Then a miracle happened! My friend introduced me to Monat Shampoo in mid-2017 and it really seemed to be helping, the redness and pain had subsided but the giant flakes were still an issue. About a year ago when they changed their packaging I think they changed their formula because I started having the same issues or maybe my hair just got used to it and it was no longer effective! So I was on a mission to find something that actually worked! I spent weeks researching shampoos (mind you I\u2019ve even tried prescription ones to no avail) and then I kept seeing this one on lists over and over again, The Body Shop Ginger Shampoo. People raved about how it helped their seb derm, the only real down side I kept reading about was the smell but I\u2019m like heck, if it\u2019ll help me poor head I\u2019ll try anything! So I bit the bullet and purchased The Body Shop Ginger Shampoo and The Body Shop Ginger Conditioner. It arrives, honestly, I don\u2019t know what everyone is complaining about it really is not that bad... it just kind of smells like ones of those ginger candies, slightly medicinal but not overwhelming. For the first couple of weeks I alternated using the Monat shampoo and the Ginger shampoo and conditioner (every other ginger shampoo) and then just the ginger shampoo, completely phasing out the Monat. And OMG let me tell you! My flakes are gone not even a little one, no redness and now I can go more than 2-3 days between washing my hair!! I even use it on my eyebrows when they start to flake up as well! I have been using this shampoo since the end of May and I\u2019m so happy it\u2019s worked for my Seb Derm! But now... the not so great... again, I have really thick hair so I feel like I use quite a bit of the product but there is still a little left in the 13.5oz after 2+ months so that\u2019s not too bad. It\u2019s not moisturizing at all, my hair isn\u2019t brittle but it isn\u2019t particularly soft either, and the conditioner is completely useless. I\u2019m still using the Monat leave in conditioner until I find something better just to be able to get the knots out of my hair. And because it\u2019s not moisturizing it\u2019s doesn\u2019t add the weight which brings your hair down so in turn it actually makes it thicker and more fluffy especially in this Florida humidity! But with all that being said! I still would rather not have a horrible itchy, painful scalp with disgustingly huge pieces of skin falling off my scalp! I\u2019m so glad I found this product! Anyone recommend a conditioner that won\u2019t wreck my progress?",

I have tried so many dandruff and anti-itch shampoos (head and shoulders, t-gel, etc.) and either they smell horrible or they don't work. THIS is NOT those shampoos. Within the first week of using this product I noticed I had not been itching my scalp as often, and now after a couple months of using it I do not itch at all!! And the smell is totally tolerable, if not slightly pleasant. Give it a try :)",

After a week it had completely disappeared. 3 months later and I am still completely dandruff free. It\u2019s remarkable.Rather than strip everything off your hair and scalp, like other anti-dandruff treatments do, it seems to be very gentle. It never leaves my hair or scalp feeling dry. I wash once a day and use the conditioner once or twice a week.",

I honestly 100% recommend it, it's worth a try even just to deal with an itchy scalp or etc.I never write reviews but read them all the time before buying products so I felt like sharing how pleased I am with this one!",
