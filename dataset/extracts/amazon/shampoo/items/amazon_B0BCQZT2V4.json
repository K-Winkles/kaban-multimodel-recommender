Have been using for a few days and have noticed a difference in my hair. My hair isn't as dry as with other brands like Garnier Fructis. My hair doesn't fall out as much when I brush it once it has dried. So I figured out some of it was falling off when brushing due to dryness. I'd recommend for those who have hair on the dry side and not the greasy or oily side. I also like the scent, subtle but clean smelling.",

                "reviewText": "I have used so many expensive salon and big name shampoos looking for one that deeply cleans and also gives my hair some volume without stripping it. And to think, the one I like best is under $4.00 a bottle! This shampoo lathers fine and gets my hair very clean. It gets rid of all my styling products and root spray and leaves it feeling soft. The conditioner of the same name adds amazing hydration and, together, they give me clean, shiny, and volumized hair that isn't weighed down or looking fried. I am really happy with this shampoo (and the conditioner) and I plan on using it for the foreseeable future. I haven't found anything better and I have been looking for decades. I have color treated, fine hair that gets weighed down very easily and can look pretty shabby if not babied. Although this shampoo is inexpensive, it sure doesn't perform cheaply.",

I have tried several L'Oreal shampoos, conditioners, and make-up products over the last 30 years and have yet to be disappointed.",

I like the smell, but not much moisturizing, and my hair wasn't very soft afterwards. I didn't get any \"plumping\". The other L'oreal styles have worked better, for the same money.",
