                "reviewText": "This shampoo works well. The key is being able to wait to wash your hair every 3-4 days. When I started doing that, my hair was much softer. It is not a great shampoo to use if you want to wash your hair every day. When I was using it every day, it dried my hair out.The price on this product keeps going up and up (just like everything else). When I started using it, it was about $26.00 a bottle. At $38 (what it is listed for today), I feel the price is a little excessive now and not worth it. This is especially true when purchasing the shampoo and conditioner together.Unless the price goes back down to a reasonable cost, I will be looking for another alternative when I run out of my current supply.",
