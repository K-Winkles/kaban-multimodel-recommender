                "reviewText": "The first day I opened the bottle there was some off-gassing smell, but after that, it was fine, no smell. As far as its shampooing qualities, it is not one of those harsh ones that strip all the oil out. So yes, it lives up to the label of being gentle. Leaves hair manageable.",

                "reviewText": "I have switched to several Attitude products due to the good rating they get with EWG. I am working on analyzing everything I use as a consumer, trying to get to the least harmful products I can afford. So far, I like Attitude shampoo and shower gels. The scent is mild, and not overpowering like other 'regular' shampoos. It leaves my hair soft, and I stopped needing to use a conditioner. I have short hair.",

                "reviewText": "I researched shampoos to find one that maybe would allow my henna hair dye to last longer in my hair before requiring me to re-dye my hair. I had been using Suave Daily Clarifying Cleansing shampoo (very cheap: only $2 for a large bottle). I wash my hair daily, and the henna dye had to be re-applied every 2-3 weeks, as the dye gradually faded over time.This Attitude extra gentle shampoo did not change the fading of the henna dye (to my disappointment.) And, it does not produce a lot of suds. Also, my hair felt a bit \"greasy\" after using the Attitude shampoo. It always seemed like there was some sort of coating on my hair.So, for me, this product simply did not provide good results. I went back to regular shampoos.",

It doesn't make my hair feel all dried out; nor leave any unpleasant residue. I live in a hard water area & this shampoo does great. I think I could go at least month w/o having to use a clarifer on it because of the hard water's chemistry. Other shampoos need clarification every 3-4 shampoos. Will be checking out this brand's other products.",
