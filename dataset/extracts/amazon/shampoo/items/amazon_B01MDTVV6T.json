                "reviewText": "Hello, fellow curly-haired girls! If you are like me, you\u2019ve spent the better part of your life searching for just the right products to make your mop manageable. It is a stressful and expensive undertaking, certainly. The problem is that there are so many types of curly hair, and these differences are compounded by the varying environments we live in (tight spirals in North Dakota vs looser waves in Florida).For years I was told to use expensive salon-grade mousse and stick to sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner\u2014but the brands recommended to me were either horrifically costly or left my scalp feeling oily even after multiple scrubs. In the store one day, I saw these and decided to give them a try as a last-ditch effort\u2026and I\u2019m so glad I did!I have fine curly hair that I color, and I live in the MidAtlantic region. I don\u2019t smoke and I don\u2019t spend a lot of hours in sunlight. I\u2019ve mostly given up on heat styling as well, so your experience may be different than mine. But Garnier\u2019s wallet-friendly sulfate-free offerings have been a godsend for me!Unlike many of the other sulfate-free curly hair shampoos I\u2019ve tried, this one actually lathers up. My scalp and hair feel clean after use, but not oily or dry. I can actually feel my hair absorb the conditioner (I apply and then leave on while I soap up, shave and wash my face) but it rinses clean and my hair feels smooth when I run my detangling comb through before shutting off the water. About a week after making the switch to this shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a huge difference in my hair. It\u2019s less frizzy and it curls so nicely now. I do towel-turban only before air drying, and I also follow up with other Fructis products (their leave-in for curly hair, for example).Recently I\u2019ve had trouble finding these at the store, and switched to Suave\u2019s new entry to the drugstore sulfate-free category. It doesn\u2019t lather as nicely and while my hair still curls ok, it\u2019s not the same. I\u2019ve stocked back up on Garnier thanks to Amazon and I\u2019m not looking back!If you have similar hair and environmental humidity, I urge you to try these. Even if they don\u2019t work as well for your hair, at least you\u2019re not out a whole lot of money.",
