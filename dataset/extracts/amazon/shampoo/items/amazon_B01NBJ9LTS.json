                "reviewText": "Over the past few years, my scalp has become dry, itchy, and sensitive. I literally have over a dozen products in my shower right now that I've tried. There is one shampoo and conditioner I love, but at $35+ each for a small bottle, I've been trying to find a cheaper replacement.Enter this lovely shampoo by Aromatica.Pros: Salicylic acid! My scalp loves salicylic acid; it does some mild exfoliation without drying my scalp or hair more, and it helps prevent build up. The ingredients also include menthol, which gives a nice cooling sensation. The lather is good, it cleanses very well without drying or sensitizing. If you like herbal scents, you can't get more of an herbal fragrance than this.Cons: The scent is quite strong, so if you don't like herbal fragrances, this will probably not work for you. If you are sensitive to essential oils and extracts, there are a lot in this so proceed with caution.Overall, I would recommend this as long as you're okay with herbal-medicinal fragrances. It's not quite as soothing as my number one pick, but the lower price and bigger bottle mean I'll almost certainly be repurchasing.",

This makes my hair soft and shiny and my scalp never feels like it has tiny grains of salt on it. Love this product. Smells good too.",

                "reviewText": "This shampoo has been trending lately for the hair growth properties. I have only been using it for a few weeks and I do notice hair growth. I don\u2019t know if that is a placebo effect or the shampoo. So I am still on the fence about this shampoo on the topic of hair growth. I do have to say that it feels just like every other clarifying shampoo leaving my scalp feeling cleansed and light. So this would be a great clarifying shampoo in a hair routine.",

Might be good for dry hair but I find it leaves an oily residue which means I have to wash twice as often as I'm used to. At the current price, I'm not motivated to do that. I also found my scalp being itchy after using a couple weeks.I'm one of two in my family using this product and I noticed their hair looked oily and dirty despite (or because?) they use it daily. He also complained about the lack of any effect on dandruff which the ad seems to imply.",

We haven't been able to use it alone to cure issues with dandruff or a super, itchy, dry scalp but love to rotate it and use it along with other items. Will be repurchasing this shampoo.",
