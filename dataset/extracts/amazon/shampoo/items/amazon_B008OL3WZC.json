                "reviewText": "I recently decided to make a change in my hair care due to scalp soreness and itchiness. I was wearing my waist-length hair in a dutch or french braid almost every day 8hrs a day at work and my scalp started feeling super itchy at the back and very tender. I decided to cut it to shoulder-length and just wear my hair down every day at work and change my shampoo for the itch. I mean I would just scratch absent-mindedly to the point where it felt raw. I was also worried about tension alopecia. I've been using this shampoo for about 4 months I think and it's really helped. I leave the shampoo in for several minutes while I attend to the rest of my bathing and then wash it out. The itch is nowhere near as bad as before and my scalp doesn't feel raw. That could partly be due to the change of hairstyle but I do think it's helped a good bit. I've noticed if I just avoid scratching AT ALL the itch stays away, but if I scratch a little, it tends to start an itching frenzy. My scalp is still a bit tender if I pull the hair near the back of my scalp, but I had worn the braid style at work for several years and I think the tenderness is just going to take a while to go away. You will still need conditioner because this shampoo is on little on the drying side. My hair also seems to tangle more easily. I alternate with Renpure Biotin/Collagen shampoo (which makes my hair super easy to brush) once or twice a week. I've noticed that my hair has more \"poof\" after I use this. Like, it's fluffy almost to the point of being a frizzball. I have very, very fine hair and it can be hard to maintain volume, but this shampoo definitely gives me some. It leaves me with that squeaky-clean feel. I think if your scalp issues are not too severe, this shampoo can be beneficial for you.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this shampoo for about 2-3 years now but I've only purchased it from our local Sprouts (grocery store). I usually buy it only when it's on sale ($15.99). Seeing how it was so much cheaper on amazon, I decided to try it!It is definitely NOT the same shampoo I'm used to using. It is watered down and some sort of gel additive is added to it to make it appear 'thicker'. See my image comparison. The bottle on the left is from Sprouts, while the one on the right is from Amazon. I definitely have to use a lot more of it in order to lather up.Moreover, I have also noticed that it makes my hair much more dry after use, and I've experienced hair loss since I started using it.. a lot more hair collected in the drain than I'm used to seeing. Plus I had a haircut recently so there should be less hair collecting in general.Since I bought this large size bottle, I don't want to return it (like I did when I bought a similar looking bottle from TJ Maxx on sale one time, but returned it then when I saw the gel-like consistency). If my hair loss continues, I may just stop using it.Particularly in this time of the pandemic, I don't want to give up on already scarce supplies :), so I will keep this bottle. But I will certainly not be buying this shampoo from this seller again. I hope my honest review was helpful.",
