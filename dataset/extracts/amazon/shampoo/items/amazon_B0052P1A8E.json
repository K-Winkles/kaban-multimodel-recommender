                "reviewText": "It is a strong lavender scent when you first lather it up on your hair, but it quickly dissipates. The first time I used it was the first wash a week after a perm. The first wash didn't lather so I rinsed it and did a second wash, and I got a good lather. I'll see what happens the next time I use it. I just had to find something that does not have all the bad chemicals in it like Suave and almost every other brand I looked at on the shelves in the store. I've used Suave for years and never knew about all the bad chemicals in it until recently when I saw someone post on Facebook about it. Now I'm really aware of these bad guys and had to get new shampoo, cream rinse, shower gel, hand cream, and even today found it in the antibacterial soft soap at my kitchen sink!I'm glad the shipping box didn't get damaged because there was NO packing around the 4 Andalou products I ordered, and I did not see a link for rating packaging on this order to let them know. The shampoo and cream rinse were in a clear shrink wrap, but had the box been damaged, I don't think that would have prevented damage or leakage. Amazon needs to be more careful packaging orders.Update: I love it so much that I reordered another bottle of the shampoo when it ran out.",

                "reviewText": "I just learned yesterday that my thyroid was way too low. I have been prescribed the wrong dosage of Synthroid for 3 months, a mistake of the doctor's office. First things affected, hair and nails. Therefore, I can't really hope for volume. But since I read on the GMO website that Andalou was offering good products of quality, really natural and soft, I will purchase again since I need a non-sulfate shampoo with biotin to help recover from that medical mistake. I recommend it.----------------I love the formula in that brand of shampoo. It really shows that it's almost \"bad chemicals\" free. The foam is different from the commercial brands. However, I wash my hair every other day and I can't tell that I feel that my hair is manageable with that shampoo. I have a fine and dry hair. I wake up in the morning and it seems that the volume I had the day before is gone. I'm going to use it because I experience hair loss and Ireally see that it's very gentle but I'm not thrilled by the results. If you already have thick hair, it's okay but if you have fine hair, maybe you won't be satisfied to pay that price for shampoo. I was expecting more body in my hair. It didn't happen.",

                "reviewText": "My hair has been thinning for the last few years. I didn't think it was too bad until my oldest daughter said something. I ignored it for a little while, until I looked in the mirror and realized I could clearly see more of my scalp than I ever have. I was so sad and embarrassed. I just turned 44, I knew my body was changing, I was stressed with everyday life, and having covid, I noticed even more changes physically. I tried this shampoo, I have always been skeptical of products that say anything about helping with anything. I now have a spark of hope, my hair seems thicker just after 3 uses. I wash my hair every other day, I always have, I noticed I didn't lose as much hair after the 2nd use, and my hair did not have a dry feel as has with other shampoos (moisture level has improved)I am hesitant to get too excited, but so far so good. I will now be purchasing the conditioner, hopefully it will prove to be a truthful product. Everyone's body is different an needs different things, hopefully this helps people who are having similar or same problems.",
