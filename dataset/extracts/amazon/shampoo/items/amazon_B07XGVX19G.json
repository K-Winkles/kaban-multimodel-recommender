From when I bought it over a month ago until now, I use it 2-3x a week and I still have a lot. This stuff is amazing. My dandruff is gone, my hair FEELS clean, and it\u2019s like I\u2019ve gone to a salon several times. I can\u2019t go back to Trader Joe\u2019s shampoo; I can\u2019t go back to anything I get at the store. This stuff is the best I\u2019ve had and I am so excited that I now know about this hidden secret.",
