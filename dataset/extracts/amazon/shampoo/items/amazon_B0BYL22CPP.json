Every brand puts the indication of what sort of stink they've used in a different place on their label. So you have to read the whole darn bottle only to find that some fine print somewhere proclaims something like: \"Long lasting scent\". or \"Ocean Breeze\". or \"Forest Rain\" or some such annoying drivel.I don't want my hair to reek of some artificial stench. I just want to get the grease out every day and be done with it.I bought this to get an unscented shampoo, and it's pretty much stink-free. It seems to clean rather well, too.It's also a large amount so I won't have to go through the annoyance of searching for an unscented shampoo again for a very long time!Once I tried some of this and found it to be acceptable, I ordered another gallon. I'll probably be dead before I run out of two gallons of this stuff. And that's a GOOD thing!",

It doesn't lather up great, so we do have to use a bit more than we do with our previous brand. Overall, the price is right, though, even though we have to use a bit more.",

Thankfully, this doesn't have perfume and no scent whatsoever. I've been using it off and on for a week now without any issues. My hair feels clean and soft. Definitely going to look into buying their lotion by the gallon.",
