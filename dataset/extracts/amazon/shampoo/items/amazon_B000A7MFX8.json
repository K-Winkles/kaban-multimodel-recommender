                "reviewText": "I have used this shampoo for the first time, and it seems to have a nice effect on the scalp...inflammation is reduced...hair feels full and clean. So what if it smells like I was at a campfire, if I suffer less.I have had Psoriasis Arthritis for 45 years! I have used tar shampoos my entire adult life. Since my chemotherapy and surgery in 2019, my psoriasis, arthritis, bone damage, and neuropathy have accelerated. My psoriasis is very bad, with MRSA inflaming it. I can no longer find adequate coal tar shampoos and ointments. The young man who commented that this pine tar shampoo smells bad, does not have a bad skin disease on his scalp, otherwise, anything that works can smell like manure, as long as it works. And if he had a bad enough scalp problem, his wife would be in support of his treatment for his diseased scalp. I read his comment before buying to see only his whinings about smell, lather and consistency. He made no comments about how effective the shampoo was, or if he even had a scalp skin disease or not. Toss his comments in the trash, because he has no bad skin problems stated. I have had tar smells on my scalp for 45 years. I have dated 100's of women and could have cared less about them not liking the smell. I would tell them, that if I didn't use the shampoo, they would be getting dandruff all over them when it got so bad. Furthermore, this shampoo has plenty of lather, once you wash out your hair oils, then reapply it again after rinsing.Big Pharma has removed adequate tar shampoos from the market, or limited them in coal-tar content, so that the public would still be desperate for their pharmaceuticals, such as SKYRIZI, which may lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. I have neuropathy in my feet, so this SKYRIZI would cause me to lose my feet, which are a high-risk status at my Podiatrist.",

My skin is 70+ years old and probably has a lot of damage from over the years. Never had a problem with itchy scalp or dandruft, but here I am with age setting in and I do. I tried Grandpa's Pine Tar Shampoo with an attitude that it couldn't hurt. Yes, I read the negative reviews and people complaining about smelling like smoke. I tried coal tar soap, and thought this couldn't smell any worse. To my delight, I love the scent of a smokey campfire (which no one else seems to smell after my hair dries). Even more exciting was to notice that my beard and hair don't tend to shed a whole lot of dandruft anymore. It is worth it to me to spend the extra dime to get a product that does make me feel much more positive about my hair (what's left of it). This works for me, and I am happy to give this product a very positive recommendation!",

We are a household of itchy, allergic, impossible to buy for skin sensitive individuals. I spent lots of effort (and money) trying to find at least something which did not make me and others flaky, itchy, you know it... Finally we got tar based soap (very good!), based on some one mentioning this as a fantastic staff for sensitive people. And it really is. After i found the company did shampoos and conditioners, and though i tried all of shampoos and conditioners one by one (buttermilk, clay, witch hazel, oatmeal.... all of them), this tar one is the best of the best for our sensitive skin, scalp, hair - everything.After using it for several years (!!!), i can sincerely recommend giving this product a try (i tried other companies tar based shampoos & conditioners - not even close to this one).My deepest respect to the manufacturer.",

The look and color of the shampoo may remind you of a gel however it works through my texture hair very nicely and isn't too slick, doesn't over-sud or leave a residue. There is a slight tingle kind of like you get with tea tree oil, some people may be sensitive to that. Combined with the Pine Tar conditioner I found my hair retained moisture much longer and was easier to style (mainly tapered fro). I do not mind the smell, it's not something that anyone has every commented on after washing and drying (no heat). I have used this for over a year now. I first purchased outside of Amazon and was a little bit down that I couldn't find it in the store I initially purchased but glad to find it on Amazon. If you are Natural with thick 4b/4c texture hair that has dry scalp/moisture retention issues give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "I have no skin or scalp conditions but use this shampoo because it's great for washing your hair under the shower, the lather then becoming useful for cleaning your body when it cascades down after being rinsed out of the hair. I used to do the same using a bar of the pine tar soap but, although it does a good job on your hair too, this shampoo seems a tad better. I think the aroma is nice, smelling somewhat like the tree sap absorbed into the ground beneath a pine forest's canopy. I adore that smell but then, since birth, I have had a mysteriously inexplicable affinity with pine forests anyway. I always feel exhilarated and alive after using this stuff. I thoroughly love it.Eamonn",
