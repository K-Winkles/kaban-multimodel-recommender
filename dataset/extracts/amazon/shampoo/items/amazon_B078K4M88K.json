Too difficult to apply in the shower due to shape, size and slickness of the bottles. Conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle as it is thick and the bottle doesn\u2019t squeeze well. Please redesign the bottles, a pump bottle would be much better. I would not buy again if in the same containers. I had to pour out the product into different bottles to be able to use. Bottles are the wrong shape for smaller hands.",
