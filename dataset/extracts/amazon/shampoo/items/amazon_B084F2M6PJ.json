It\u2019s like a magic potion and resets my hair whenever I use it (usually every three weeks or so) when the oil buildup in my hair gets too much. It leaves my hair completely oil free but also shiny and moisturized and works well with my wavy thick hair. It also smells amazing and I\u2019ve never had a shampoo smell so good that I can smell it in my hair the next two days. I\u2019m going to be trying other shampoo from this brand because I was so impressed.",

                "reviewText": "So I did a lot of research on protein buildup and came to the conclusion that was what was going on with my hair. There were lots of suggestions and most of them were kind of pricey. This one came highly recommended and was in a decent price range for a trial product.First and foremost the other posts are correct, it does in fact smell amazing. Even a few hours after washing I can still smell it. I used a quarter size amount of shampoo as suggested on bottle and I didn\u2019t find it to lather that well? Maybe it\u2019s not meant too, I\u2019m not sure. I added a little bit more. I was a little bit more generous with the conditioner as I felt my hair might need the moisturizing. I left the conditioner in for 3 mins or so before washing out. As soon as I started brushing it I could tell it worked, it was so easy to brush through and felt super healthy. I can definitely say it feels like a deep clean for sure for the scalp and hair. I use a lot of oils, styling products and hair coloring so I feel my hair really needed this cleanse. Great product to add to your hair care regimen! Not as a daily/main shampoo! Only use once/twice a month to keep hair healthy!Worth the buy! No hair loss here (I was nervous reading the other reviews to be honest)!Scent is floral like and smells really good!Made my hair feel amazing, glad I bought it.",

                "reviewText": "I love that after washing my hair with this shampoo my hair feels so shiny and smooth. So clean idk if you can see it in the picture but this is a day after washing it with the shampoo which is once a week for me. As of now I had hair loss and I just went to get a haircut and my hairstylist said he felt my hair fuller the only different thing I have changed is this shampoo once a week and then the rest of the week I wash it with my Garnier fructis shampoo. Since it has been so hot here in Texas I have been washing my hair daily I can't stand sweaty hair and plus my hair is so oily from my scalp so this shampoo gets a thumbs up for me. It is a little drying but I do use a thick conditioner in my ends only when I use the clarifying shampoo just like any clarifying shampoo \ud83d\ude05. I love the smell it smells fresh and clean. The price is good I don't use it often but when I feel like my scalp needs a little more than just shampoo I go ahead and use it. I would say every hair is different but trying it is worth it.",
