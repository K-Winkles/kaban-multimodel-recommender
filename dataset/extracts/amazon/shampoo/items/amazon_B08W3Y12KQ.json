Every frame in our history reflects our commitment to the professional stylist and barber as we share in their quest to empower men through quality grooming practices and products. In 1994, a stylist named David Raccuglia foresaw a future when men would pay as much attention to their looks as anyone else. And he knew they wouldn\u2019t want to lose their masculinity in the process. Today American Crew is the professional men\u2019s grooming brand in the world. Men and their stylists count on us for the latest in hair, body, shave and styling products. And for more than 20 years, we\u2019ve delivered.",

I live in hot & humid Florida, where 3/4 of the year are bad hair days. This shampoo fully cleanses my scalp with no residue, controls my waves without flattening my hair, & makes it more manageable to brush & comb. For me, about the best of many shampoos I have tried that cost much more. Give it a try.",
