This shampoo has transformed my fine and frizzy hair into something truly remarkable. Not only does it add thickness, but it also tames frizz like magic. I've experienced noticeable growth, and my hair has never been this long. Needless to say, I've upgraded to the full-size bottle, and it has become my go-to daily shampoo. Biolage has definitely gained a loyal customer in me!",

                "reviewText": "This review is for Biolage Strength & Recovery Shampoo and Conditioning CreamI love this shampoo and conditioner duo. I have coarse, dry, wavy hair that waswas mega damaged by years of using heated appliances. I was in need of serious hair repairand TLC.This shampoo and conditioning cream delivered.They have a thick consistency. The conditioner is much thicker than the shampoo, butnot too thick that you cannot get it out of the bottles. Simply luxuriously thick!It has a wonderful scent and makes my hair smell good.After using the pair my hair felt smooth and sleek. After drying, my damaged hair wasno longer the frizz ball it was. It felt smoother and healthy.The only con against this set is the size. They only stand 4 inches. Still, they are a good size for trying them out, or to use for traveling.I will be purchasing the larger sizes!",
