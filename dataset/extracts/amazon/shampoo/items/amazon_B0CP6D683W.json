                "reviewText": "DOVE MEN+CARE's Charcoal+Clay Purifying shampoo lathered really well on my oily hair and rinsed very cleanly. It's supposed to have \"earthy notes of nutmeg and clay\". I can detect a bit of the nutmeg, but not sure about what charcoal and clay are supposed to smell like. Either way, it's a nice scent, not overwhelming but I can still smell it on my long hair on the second day. For surfactants, this shampoo uses sodium laureth sulfate (sulfate from palm kernel oil or coconut oil) and cocamidopropyl betaine (not a sulfate from coconut), so I think that the claim that it is 90% naturally derived is true. I also like that the bottle is made from 100% recycled materials. At $9.99 for 31 oz, it's actually quite a decent price too.",

I was kind of surprised how well it made my hair look just after that one wash! Less chemicals, more natural. That's exactly what you want in a shampoo. This stuff works great and I can highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This shampoo dispenses nicely out of smooth operating pump lid. The shampoo is almost perfectly clear but with a accent of gray to the medium weight gel. With a bit of water it makes a generous lather that makes washing any length of hair a breeze. It washes out of hair well leaving no residue feeling and when dry I noticed my hair feeling significantly lighter and fluffier. The scent while using is a moderate strength kind of refreshing men's cologne scent and after drying it is very minimal.",
