Pantene Pro-V Blends Rose Water is designed to provide lightweight nourishment without weighing down hair stands. It transforms thirsty, brittle hair into petal-soft, healthy locks. Is the shampoo clear or creamy? It\u2019s a clear shampoo that\u2019s clearly your choice for touchable softness. Infused with rose water, it\u2019s designed to moisturize and soothe damaged hair. Do I need to use Pantene Pro-V Blends Rose Water Conditioner with this shampoo? For best results and more great hair days, it\u2019s recommended to pair this shampoo with Pantene Pro-V Blends Rose Water Conditioner. However, it\u2019s still effective when used alone without the matching conditioner. Is Pantene cruelty-free? Pantene has been committed to ending animal testing for over 30 years. We do not test our products on animals and have been actively working with governments around the world to put an end to animal testing for good. Why is sulfate-free important? While sulfates are a common cleaning ingredient, some Pantene fans prefer alternatives that are free from specific ingredients. With that in mind, we created formulas that are free sulfates, parabens, and silicones while still delivering great hair.",

                "reviewText": "I have fine hair and an oily scalp that I wash everyday because I live in Miami and with how hot and humid it is here, you have to wash your hair everyday if you go outside. Plus, I workout. I bought this because I felt my hair becoming too dry from using mainly volumizing hair products and only giving super light hydration.The shampoo and conditioner are very light. The shampoo has a feeling that's similar to those strong shampoos that remove buildup. But its light enough to not strip your hair and strong enough to remove oil and sweat from my hair although, my hair feels a bit tacky after rinsing it off. The conditioner fells light too, but its definitely moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling soft and nice. Both the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling softer than it was before using it.And my hair looks great after dried up too. Soft to the touch and smelling strongly of that delicious rose scent. The fragrance is very strong so if you're not into fragrance, I suggest looking for another product. But who doesn't wanna smell like a bouquet of roses everyday?Overall, this was a good buy. My hair feels healthier and while I had to get used to that tacky feeling the shampoo gives my hair, it doesn't affect my hair that feeling. In fact, my hair looks great! If you need a shampoo and conditioner that moisturizes great without the heaviness, I suggest buying this. I don't think you'll regret it :)",

At the same time, I need a product that throughly cleans and conditions. Pantene makes this line that works perfectly for my hair type. Best of all, it has a lovely, light scent that isn't too perfumey.",
