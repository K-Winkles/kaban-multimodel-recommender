I use the shampoo & conditioner in combination with the hair mask and my hair is soft, shinny and smells amazing! I noticed I can go 3 days without washing and a little goes a long way with this product also! My hair doesn\u2019t look oily and feel strains after like most products. The price is worth it! I still have more than half the bottle left and I bought this a few months ago! The 21 benefits spray is amazing also! I love that I made the switch.",

A little goes a long way, and this lovely-smelling shampoo lathers richly and gets the hair very clean and easy to manage with no combing. It was wonderful on my colored hair. Rich and hydrating. My stylist says she has loved using it for years. I did not buy the conditioner but she recommended I do so, even though my scalp is healthy, simply because we are having such a dry and cold winter here in Alaska. So moe Pureology products for me! I am a convert! I was pretty easy to convince considering how pleased I was with the shampoo.",
