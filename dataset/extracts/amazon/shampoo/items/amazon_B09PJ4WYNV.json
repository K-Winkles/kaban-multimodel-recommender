                "reviewText": "I personally like the scent. My kids don't seem to care one way or the other. But I saw this at the store and decided to give it a try because my oldest was having a serious scalp issue (almost like dandruff but it seemed extreme - like large flakes that reminded me of cradle cap...but on a 12 yr old) and I wanted to rule out malassezia. I had read that apple cider was good at fighting fungus. I did a tea tree treatment on her scalp and then I washed it out with the Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar and it worked wonders. No more flakes. I was so happy with the results that I found the shampoo on amazon and now it's on our subscribe and save subscription. This all happened over a year ago and we're still routinely using this product.I can't say for sure if it was this shampoo or hormones or what that got rid of the flakes but it certainly cleanses well, and the conditioner moisturizes well, on all my kids. The price for the set is very reasonable. I'll likely be continuing to purchase this until it's no longer on the market.",

I got just what I wanted - silverish gray so I could see what my new growth would look like as it grows out. I am so happy with this lighter gray! I wish I had taken before and after pics.",

                "reviewText": "The ingredients in this ACV shampoo have left my hair feeling extremely dry and hard (dead-like) every wash within seconds of application and after rinsing. The only way to somewhat undo this bad effect has been to use excessive amounts of the conditioner each wash session, and even then, the quality of the conditioner is very watery/cheap\u2014nothing like the Shea Moisture brand. It\u2019s like I took my hair right from flowy, healthy and luscious straight to weak, dry and brittle within weeks. It\u2019s worked for others, just not my hair type. Also, 1/4 of the shampoo content was lost to waste due to a wide crack across the bottom of the bottle\u2014shipping management precaution. Not worth the change in brand or the investment for me personally.",
