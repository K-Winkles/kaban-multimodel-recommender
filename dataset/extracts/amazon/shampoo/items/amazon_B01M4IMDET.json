                "reviewText": "This shampoo is superb for several reasons. #1, it is EWG Verfied, which means that the ingredients are about as benign as you can get. This is why I decided to try it in the first place. I am extremely sensitive and often allergic to fragrances, so I am pleased to report I did not have a problem with the fragrances used in this product. In fact, I love the scent\u2014lightly citrusy with undertones of vanilla, reminiscent of Jean Nat\u00e9, but with more vanilla notes. Not overwhelming! Yet so nice, it smells edible.It rinses out easily, which is another thing I usually have trouble with. After shampooing my hair, which tangles easily and is very hard to comb out, I usually condition it and then, while the conditioner is still in my hair, I comb out the tangles using a wide tooth comb/pick. What I noticed was that after using this stuff, I did not lose much hair combing it out. That\u2019s a plus I wasn\u2019t expecting.I did not see much in the way of volumizing\u2014sorry, but what I do see is that it makes my hair very shiny and unusually nice looking. I\u2019ll take it! This shampoo is extremely light, which is important in volumizing hair, or at least not going in the opposite direction. Because it is so light, it does not weigh down my hair or cause it to clump together.My hair type is extremely fine, a notch above baby fine hair, rather thin, and longish. It tends to look oily the day after I wash it, so I appreciate how easy this shampoo is to rinse out\u2014otherwise hair care would take too much time. This shampoo is slightly gold in hue, but transparent. The transparency makes it hard to see how much of it I\u2019m pouring into my palm, but I would estimate it\u2019s the diameter of a Kennedy dollar, if you remember how big that is! Perhaps that\u2019s a 1.5 inch diameter. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having to use oodles of this stuff to get my hair fully clean. On day two after washing it fully, I have been able to use a very tiny amount on my fingertips to clean the roots of my bangs and hairline. My hair still looks clean afterward and the shampoo does not seem to dry it out.In summary, this is a high-quality, non-toxic shampoo with the nicest fragrance I\u2019ve ever smelled in a hair product.",

                "reviewText": "A+ for actual product. No dyes. No sulfates, etc. Cleans hair well.Take it out of the boxed wine design. Using it with the spigot at the bottom as designed relies on gravity and air pressure to make the shampoo flow and that's super slow. You have to open up the box and use a third hand to apply more pressure to refill in-shower containers within a realistic time frame. Additionally the spigot drips because again the shampoo is viscose and doesn't move through fast so I have to store it upside down. Additionally while the box might provide some protection in storage, as you use up the product you end up wasting storage space. Save some cardboard, some heavy plastics with the spigot and move to a bag and small nozzle in the upper corner design like the other bulk shampoo guys. This design is not worth it.",

I then came across this brand of shampoo and recognized it as the same brand as my hand soap which I love. The smell is exactly like The Body Shop's 'satsuma' line. My hair tends to get greasy after a couple days, but this shampoo has been keeping it clean for a little longer. It does add volume, shine, and leaves my hair soft not dry feeling. I like it so much I ordered another bottle right away. They do also put a stick on the pump so it doesn't leak while being shipped.",
