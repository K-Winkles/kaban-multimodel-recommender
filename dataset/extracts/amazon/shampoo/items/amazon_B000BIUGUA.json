                "reviewText": "I have thick, coarse 2b-c hair. I have been using this for my wash day for years, and one bottle lasts me well over 6 months (I wash approx 1/ week). After a couple bottles, I replaced this with a milder clarifying shampoo from a brand that I love, but had more challenges with product build up while I was using the other shampoo. So, I have returned to B&B Sunday Shampoo. My hair is below my shoulders, and I lather a small amount of this in my hands before applying. If I dont get great lather, I repeat with a slightly smaller amount of shampoo for a second wash and then get great lather and feel confident any product build up has been removed.Fun story about Bumble & Bumble, about 30 years ago I visited nyc and saw a photo in a magazine of hair I \"wanted.\" It was a short sleek bob. While the haircut was not at all aligned with my frizzy hair, I saw that Bumble and Bumble was the in the photo credits and thought if anyone could make my hair look that way, they could. Well, it was fate. I called them and due to a cancellation, they had an opening! I confidently presented the photo and the hairdresser kindly informed me that he could give me a short cut, but that it would not look like the photo. That was my first curly cut. While I walked out looking much different that I anticipated, it was the first time I realized my hair wasn't just frizzy- that I actually had curls.",

I would wash my thick hair thoroughly and it would look as if I had never washed it.I have used this once and instantly my hair had no grease. I wash my hair once a week and it holds up!",

                "reviewText": "L'ho comprato perch\u00e9 ne avevo sentito parlare bene in caso di acqua molto calcarea, e devo dire che non sono rimasta delusa. Lava molto bene i capelli e li lascia leggeri e morbidi. Lo uso almeno una volta a settimana per eliminare tutto l'accumulo di calcare. Consigliato anche se avete i capelli lunghi e ricci, purifica e fa quello che promette.Fa molta schiuma.",

Definitely a good product if you want to fully cleanse your hair.",
