It\u2019s god awful and if I hadn\u2019t run out of shampoo and felt guilty about throwing away an expensive bottle of this shampoo I\u2019d have stopped using it day 1. Three weeks after using it and my hair still looked great even though I was due for a root touch and glaze. I\u2019ve gotten used to the bubblegum puke smell enough that I\u2019ll probably keep buying. 5 stars for being a great product. Minus 1 star for stinking.",

I have long thick wavy hair and this stuff made it feel like silk. And talk about detangling. It does the trick. I comb my hair out in the shower while my conditioner is on my hair and this stuff let me get through with absolute ease!! The smell is perfect. Not overwhelming but a very nice scent. I\u2019m hooked!",

You only have to use a very small amount to get a luxurious lather. It really makes my hair very clean. I love the baby powder smell. It makes me think it is one of the better perfumes for hair that is mild, and better for hair. This shampoo is wonderful.",
