I was hesitant at first because of the price and size which I'm used to larger contents but I was desperate to bring my dry, unmanageable hair back to a healthier state. I purchased this item here in Amazon together with the conditioner. As soon as I got it, I was skeptical because the bottle was smaller than what I usually get and thought to myself that I'd finish this bottle in two weeks even with washing my hair every other day, I have long, thick hair and I'm generous when using shampoo and conditioner.So I went to try it and the first time I used it, I didn't see any difference. My hair was unmanageable and hard to comb. I thought I was doing it wrong but I kept using it so the next time I used it, it got better. I didn't see a big difference in the first week and the second week but I was surprise the bottle lasted longer than expected. By the third week, I've seen the big difference. There was less hair falling, my hair feels lighter, cleaner, and easier to comb and it smells great. My highlights look a lot better and not dull anymore and I could even skip washing my hair for 2 days because my hair is less greasy. So I'm pretty happy with the end results and I do plan to continue using this product because I've seen positive results. I also love the smell of the conditioner and even a small amount goes a long way.",

                "reviewText": "I turned to this shampoo after my keratin treatment/shampoo/conditioner company (Kera Luxe) suddenly went out of business. Another supposedly keratin-safe shampoo my hairdresser gave me to try had sulfates in it and completely stripped all the just-done keratin out of my hair in one shampoo and left it feeling and looking like totally dried out straw I couldn't even comb through. My hairdresser was away on vacation for a few weeks so I was pretty desperate. I also have severe scent sensitivity and many scents, especially anything floral, will trigger a migraine. (Food smells are usually OK.) Finding unscented keratin-safe shampoos is nearly impossible, so I was just hopeful the scent in this wouldn't bother me too much and, luckily, it didn't. This shampoo, combined with Maple Holistics' Silk18 conditioner brought my hair back to soft and smooth--without another keratin treatment and at a lower cost than the KeraLuxe shampoo/conditioner I had to buy at the salon. It really felt like a miracle. Hopefully they'll consider making an unscented version too, for the 10% of the population with scent sensitivity. About every 3rd wash, I use Queen Helene Cholesterol Hot Oil Treatment in conjunction with the Silk18 conditioner and leave both on together under a bathcap for a few minutes with hot water running over the cap. I also use Redken All Soft Argan-6 Oil after washing to keep flyaway hairs under control. This combination has worked really well to make my colored, keratin-treated fairly frizzy hair look and feel great without triggering a debilitating headache. I've just ordered a second batch of this, plus some Maple Holistics avocado massage oil and look forward to trying it out. Thanks, Maple Holistics!UPDATE 11/7/16:I had my keratin redone and after a couple of days of letting it sit, I washed with this shampoo. Unfortunately, it seems that the keratin got stripped again as all the silky soft of the keratin is gone and frizz is back. I don't know if this would be true with every keratin treatment, but it definitely was with mine. I'm so sad. I do expect that this would help restore my hair, but now I'm just not sure what to do as I don't have a keratin-safe shampoo that doesn't bother my scent sensitivity.UPDATE 7/10/18:Well, it looks as if it's the HARD WATER that's really the problem in our home. I still use this shampoo and instead have given up on keratin treatments until we get a house or shower water filter. In conjunction with the Silk18 conditioner and argan oil, my hair is in once again in great shape, very silky.",

                "reviewText": "To give a little background on my purchase, I am allergic to most standard shampoos. I have been unable to nail down which ingredient in particular irritates me, but every shampoo must contain it because I will break out in full body hives when I use them. I have since been experimenting with organic shampoos with partial success. I tried Burt's Bees, which made my itching disappear entirely...but left my hair feeling oilier than before I washed it. I tried a couple products that were semi-organic (as in, they used mostly organic ingredients but were not entirely organic). For about a year that seemed to do the trick. My hair felt clean and I didn't get itchy. Unfortunately, about a month ago, my itchy hives returned with a vengeance. In a rush I began looking into organic shampoos again, and this is my first purchase. I thought the price was relatively reasonable compared to a lot of other organic shampoos and it had great reviews. I'm not particularly into the whole organic movement, but it did concern me a bit that I still don't know what some of the listed ingredients actually are...but as I am certainly no expert on holistics or organics, they may very well be something truly organic. I don't know.Pros:1. NO ITCH so far! I have been itch-free since I began using this shampoo.2. My hair actually feels clean...it does what shampoo is supposed to actually do!3. It lathers pretty good. I realize without sulfates, there won't be much lather (I have experienced this with Burt's Bees), but I have had no trouble getting this shampoo to lather.4. Still within the affordable range. Some organic stuff can be outrageously expensive. This is still more than I would like to spend on a shampoo, but trust me, it's worth it to stop that itch.Cons:1. Smells somewhat like cardboard to me. Not a bad smell...just...boring and kind of ugh.2. Dries my hair a bit. But I used the silk conditioner by the same company and that seems to solve this problem. The conditioner also smells something like warm vanilla sugar, so once I use that I forget all about the cardboard shampoo smell.If any of this changes, I will update the review to reflect it, but for now, all is well and I really am overall quite happy with it.",
