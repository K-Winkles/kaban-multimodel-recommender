Actual conditioner will just make matters worse.I use this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00RYRJEL8?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_titleThe smell is annoying but it works very well.

                "reviewText": "I have always been sensitive to fragrances. I used to be able to tolerate products with a light scent but not I\u2019m getting to the point where any hint of fragrance makes my eyes swell and I get a terrible headache. I am now having to look for 100% fragrance free products which is how I discovered Vanicream. I had purchased their face cleanser which is awesome so I decided to try out the shampoo. The pros are, it is truly fragrance free. It provides a good lather and gets your hair clean. The con for me is that it doesn\u2019t provide enough moisture. My scalp is oily so I do appreciate that this product helps to keep my scalp oil free but my hair is long, course and curly. That\u2019s where I need the moisture. After using this shampoo, I had to use double the amount of conditioner to get my hair detangled. The extra conditioner I had to use, left my hair limp and it was difficult to style. I think this a really good product but not for my course, long, curly hair.",

I bought this shampoo hoping for a miracle that my skin and scalp would not break out. It worked! However, it didn't clean my hair or scalp. I left the shower the few times I used it still feeling dirty and having build up on my scalp. I even washed my hair 2-3 times hoping it was just me not scrubbing it enough. The smell was light and clean but I can't use a shampoo that doesn't leave my hair and scalp clean. Disappointed.",

No eye irritation or any irritations whatsoever. I also find it perfect for my hair; others complained it\u2019s drying? But my hair is typically on the greasier side so this was perfect for me!
