                "reviewText": "I saw this product in media somewhere and I was so intrigued, I bought it (which was great, since it was discounted when I purchased it). I have thinning, aging, fine hair (hair condition) and really stubborn seb derm (never-ending scalp woes). I am a sworn fan of Biosilk products that do an excellent job of softening texture, increasing manageability, and adding glossy shine. I sometimes have to use caustic scalp shampoos or pre-treatments for seb derm, which often sadly don't work well (none of them) and I have cost myself tons of hair just trying to fix my scalp aggressively. I only bought the Biolage Volumizing Shampoo (nothing else), and upon first use, wow! -- this stuff is great! I washed my hair as usual, noting the shampoo looks much like conditioner, but don't be fooled, it lathers up very well without too much. The scent is herbal with a predominant minty note; the fragrance did not stick around on my hair and was more like an aromatherapy bonus in-shower. I air-dried my hair as usual post-shower, flipping it around in the process to fluff hairs up around the roots in different directions, and the results were great! I had defined layers without any crunchiness at all, I did not lose an eyebrow-raising amount of hair in the shower, and the end look was soft, bouncy, and healthy with no styling products other than my usual Biolsilk serum. I will repurchase this shampoo again, probably in a long time because the generous size will last me a long time as a shampoo-rotater.",
