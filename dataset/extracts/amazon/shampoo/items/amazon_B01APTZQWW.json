It doesn't weigh down my hair or make it feel oily, which is a huge plus. Plus, the scent is lovely!I've made it a habit to carry this product with me, and I often re-apply it to the ends of my hair when they're dry. It's become an essential in my hair care arsenal.",

Might work if you add a better holding product on top of this, but does not work alone for wavy/curly hair.",
