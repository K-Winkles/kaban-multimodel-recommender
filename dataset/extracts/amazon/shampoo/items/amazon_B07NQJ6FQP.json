                "reviewText": "We absolutely love this shampoo! I have two boys with very different hair. The oldest is 6 and has thick, wavy hair that doesn\u2019t usually dry out. My younger son is almost two, and has curly, dry hair that needs moisture and a very sensitive scalp.I was looking for something \u201cmore\u201d than Johnson & Johnson and all of the other baby shampoos out there because my younger son\u2019s hair was feeling fried constantly. I bought this two months ago and it works GREAT for both boys! My younger son\u2019s hair is moisturized and healthy\u2014and bonus\u2014he hasn\u2019t had any scalp irritation whatsoever since we started using this! My older son likes the smell and it leaves his hair soft and healthy looking.The smell of this shampoo is also divine! I was surprised to read that someone found it \u201cperfume-y\u201d because it actually has a light, natural scent. It says on the ingredients label that it was scented with essential oils, and it smells like orange blossom and a little vanilla? Whatever it is, it smells great!Highly recommend!!",
