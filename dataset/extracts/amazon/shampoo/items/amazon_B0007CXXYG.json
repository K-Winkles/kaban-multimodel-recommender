Especially with color and needing shine and clean the deposits out of my hair and still be a daily shampoo. We have really bad well water and I don\u2019t think I have to use the other deep cleaner that I use twice a month with this shampoo. Haven\u2019t used the original shampoo but i really recommend this shampoo for deep cleaning your hair daily or when you shower it definitely cleans without taking everything out of the hair then remember to follow up with the leave in conditioner. Worth the money! Professional grade! Hair has never felt so clean light and looked so shiny til I used these products. FYI for removing metals get L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris metal detox it doesn\u2019t get rid of metals but cleans great and I use the leave in conditioner and it feels amazing.",
