                "reviewText": "I ordered these to put in bags with other items for distribution to those in need. I tried the shampoo in the shower, and found the smell nice and not too perfumed. However, I had trouble finding where and how to open them, especially under running water (maybe opening them beforehand and with scissors would have been smarter). I managed to tear the packet open a wee bit but it didn't want to go further. I don't see people with disabilities or the elderly being able to use these without scissors. The second issue for me is that my hair is almost down to my shoulders and one packet didn't cover my hair. Anyone with longish hair and/or very thick hair would need at least 2 packets per shampoo.",
