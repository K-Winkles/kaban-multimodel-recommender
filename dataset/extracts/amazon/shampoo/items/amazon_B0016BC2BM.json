                "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Avalon Organics B-Complex Thickening Shampoo, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations in every way. This product is a true game-changer for anyone looking to add volume and thickness to their hair. The shampoo's unique blend of organic botanicals, vitamins, and essential oils work together to nourish and strengthen the hair, resulting in noticeably thicker and healthier locks.One of the standout features of this shampoo is its impressive ingredient list. It contains B vitamins, including biotin and panthenol, which are known to promote hair growth and improve overall hair health. The inclusion of essential oils like rosemary and lavender not only enhances the sensory experience but also provides additional benefits such as stimulating the scalp and reducing hair breakage. Moreover, the shampoo is free from harsh chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances, making it a safe and gentle option for all hair types.In terms of value for money, the Avalon Organics B-Complex Thickening Shampoo truly delivers. Despite its premium organic ingredients, it is reasonably priced and offers excellent value for the quality it provides. A little goes a long way with this shampoo, as it lathers up beautifully and effectively cleanses the hair without stripping it of its natural oils. The thickening effect is noticeable even after just a few uses, and with continued use, I have seen a significant improvement in the fullness and body of my hair. Additionally, the bottle is generously sized, ensuring it lasts for an extended period, making it a cost-effective choice.Overall, I highly recommend the Avalon Organics B-Complex Thickening Shampoo to anyone looking to enhance the thickness and volume of their hair. With its impressive blend of organic ingredients, including B vitamins and essential oils, this shampoo provides noticeable results while also being gentle on the hair. Considering its reasonable price point and long-lasting formula, it offers exceptional value for money. Say goodbye to flat, lifeless hair and hello to luscious, voluminous locks with the Avalon Organics B-Complex Thickening Shampoo.",

                "reviewText": "6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point. It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather. It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS. My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point. It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The shampoo&conditioner bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and fluffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather. It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty!

(As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style! It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be? New hair? Will keep you posted. I see three short hairs poking through! I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently! I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES! Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots. My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks! I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy it looks! I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.UPDATE 11/16/13 - I use the shamp/cond. once or twice, about every 3 wks to a month. It was making my scalp itch. It's great for that monthly \"stripping of gunk\". I cannot live without the MAXI HAIR. Two weeks ago, I got lazy and missed a few doses. Within two days, more hair began to fall out in the shower and with styling. I went right back on it. Since I've started I have new hair growth that is now over an inch long.6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!

It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair. I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner. It's stripping the oils from my hair. I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week. WIll keep updating. I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy. That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up! That is the good part! SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.11/16/13 - continue to use shamp/cond once a month. Two weeks ago I got lazy with the Maxi Hair doses and noticed a difference two days in! More hair was coming out in the shower! Cannot live without this little plan I've got going on.",

Since using the shampoo I have farrr lesss hair loss when washing and brushing, my hair is stronger, its thicker and i dont have to wash it as much. I love the shampoo. I have noticed my waves are not as wavey since using and my hair feels dry when coming out the show but what i do to combat that is put Jojoba oil on my damp hair which helps alot.",
