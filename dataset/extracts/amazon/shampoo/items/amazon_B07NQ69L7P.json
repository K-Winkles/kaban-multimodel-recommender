Every visitor I\u2019ve had who\u2019s tried my shampoo/conditioner has ended up asking me for the link so they could purchase it. The scent is also powerful at first but will last longer than any other product I\u2019ve tried! 10/10 recommend for the quality and scent especially at this lower end price point.The one thing I don\u2019t like about this product is the pump! When it\u2019s almost empty, it gets very difficult to get the shampoo/ conditioner out but I guess that\u2019s the case with all pump-type products. I ended up purchasing a separate bottle emptying kit that i replace the pump with.",

I put on the conditioner, less than what I've used on expensive brands, and my fingers slid right through my hair! That's a first for me!! That alone will keep me using this! And I used LESS!!
