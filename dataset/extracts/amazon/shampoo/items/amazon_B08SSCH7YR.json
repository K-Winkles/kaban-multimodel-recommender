It only takes about a teaspoonful because it lathers beautifully. I use a cheap shampoo first to remove the hair spray and finish it off with this. It costs more than a lot of other shampoo but the bottle lasts such a long time.",

It definitely leaves your hair full and sleek and looks fabulous. But I feel like my hair gets oily faster when using this. My scalp also feels dry. Not sure if all the negatives are worth one day of fabulous hair. This one may be getting returned.",
