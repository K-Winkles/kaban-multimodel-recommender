Every day exposures to common elements like water and chlorine have higher, more alkaline pH levels that cause damage to hair. Acidic products have a lower pH to help re-balance your pH levels. How is Acidic Bonding Concentrate different than other bonding products? Acidic Bonding Concentrate products are made with Citric Acid, which helps strengthen damaged hair. Most bonding products are treatments or in salon services which are more time consuming and an additional step in your regimen. How much of this product should I use? The Acidic Bonding Concentrate System is concentrated, which means you do not need as much as your normal haircare routine. We recommend starting with a dime size amount and increasing from there based on your hair thickness, length and preference. Is the Acidic Bonding Concentrate system suitable for color-treated hair? Yes, the Acidic Bonding Concentrate Intensive Treatment is suitable for color-treated hair. Do you have to use the intensive treatment with Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo and Conditioner? Yes, it's recommended to use the Intensive Treatment with Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo and conditioner as a system. However, the treatment delivers benefits of its own and can be used with another Redken haircare range.",

I recently been struggling with it being so dry and ridiculously frizzy.. being bad about using a heat protectant and blow drying, hair would feel flat and oily the next day after washing, frizzy ends etc.This shampoo was INCREDIBLE after the first wash. My scalp has never felt so clean. Followed using an Amika hair mask then the acidic bonding conditioner. In the shower, my hair wasn\u2019t as soft as I thought it was after using, but I braided my hair and let it air dry- smelt wonderful and just felt so refreshed!The next day my hair never felt so great, I\u2019m on day 2 and it\u2019s hydrated and soft! not oily, not frizzy and my natural waves never looked better. The volume even after just using it once so far is incredible.Seen a lot of reviews about bad packaging, but it arrived perfectly and even a day earlier.BUY IT!",

I thought it was Ruined till it would grow out. At the salon, a $50 treatment with Keratase products was used to rehydrate, but no help. Totally static, dry, brittle, long strands breaking with a wide tooth detangler comb. I bought this shampoo & conditioner combo, and one time, my hair is SO much better! Soft, no static, lays like stronger and fully hair now. Not greasy or heavy as I imagined an intense treatment might be. Wonderful improvement. Grateful.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the shampoo and conditioner. On day one, I used them and no other products. It left my hair feeling greasy and looking greasy. My hair was still very soft and less frizzy than usual, but I didn't like how my hair was clumping together due to whatever oils or whatnot are in these. The conditioner did not make my hair feel soft or detangled like other conditioners do.Day two I used both and ended with my own Pantene Pro-V conditioner to try to get that smoothness back and my hair detangled. It worked but my hair still was greasy looking and clumping together.Day 3 I used only the shampoo and my regular conditioner -- AMAZING. All the benefits of healing my hair, minimizing frizziness, and making my hair super smooth and sleek from the shampoo without the greasy look from the pairing conditioner. My hair used to be a mixture of soft and brittle (past bleaching, but it's been over 2yrs since I've touched my hair), but now is only feeling super soft!I suggest trying the shampoo with your own conditioner first. If the results are to your liking, then don't buy the conditioner. Wasted ~$35 on a bottle of conditioner that I will only use every now and then to fortify the work the shampoo is doing, and that will only be on days I'm not going out in public. Lol",

                "reviewText": "About over a year ago I boxed Demi-dyed my hair and regretted it. I purchased a clarifying shampoo to remove what I could and continued using the clarifying shampoo up until 3 weeks ago- when my stylist told me you're not supposed to use it long term because it dries it out. My hair was dry and falling out a lot but I never thought it was the shampoo because I'm 7 months postpartum and figured it was the postpartum symptoms. However after using this product twice, my hair feels softer and isn't falling out as much! I'm eager to see what long-term effects it has.",

                "reviewText": "Have been using Redken faithfully for almost 20 years, despite their frustrating tendency to constantly update and change their product range. So I purchased the Acidic Bonding shampoo and conditioner pair based on the positive reviews. My hair can often feel dry and brittle from regular blow drying and straightening irons, and while I have heat protect products that help, I figured I'd give this a try to and reduce (or eliminate) those phases damaged hair.I really wanted to like this shampoo and conditioner combo, and to be fair, I can feel it working and doing its job, however my hair is not the thickest to begin with and this left it feeling pin thin. The other issue I (personally) had was that my hair felt heavy and oily, almost greasy. Redken make some great products, but this one personally doesn't suit my hair and it seems like others have enjoyed success with this line. I'm going to go back to using Redken Volume Injection as that worked better, and hopefully find an alternative product to deal with those days when my hair feels dry and damaged.Lastly, for those who care, it smells like passionfruit, which I quite like but may not be to the tastes of others, particularly people who don't like passionfruit.",
