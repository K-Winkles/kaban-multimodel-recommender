        "description": "Instantly get the look and feel of more hair. Infused with biotin and hyaluronic acid, this thickening shampoo visibly plumps, leaving you with thicker, fuller and stronger hair in only one use! Our hair thickening shampoo plumps the overall thickness of your hair by 200%* and strengthens your hair, reducing hair loss due to breakage (*vs. a basic shampoo). Our John Frieda ULTRAfiller+ technology strengthens, adding manageability to fine, fragile hair while increasing overall hair thickness and plumpness. It accomplishes this by aligning and creating spaces between hair fibers, resulting in hair that looks and feels thicker. Give fine, flat hair an instant thickening boost with this silicone-free, vegan, SLS/SLES sulfate-free volumizing shampoo.To use, work our volumizing shampoo gently through wet hair, lather and rinse well. Try the full ULTRAfiller+ thickening line, which is a 3-step process for thicker, fuller hair. Together, all three products complement each other for the best results. Step 1 is to cleanse with our thickening shampoo that visually plumps in only one use. Step 2 is to strengthen as you condition, helping to align the hair, creating thickness with our ULTRAfiller+ conditioner. Step 3 is to thicken with our thickening spray, which plumps your overall thickness and provides heat protection for fragile hair. You are one thickening shampoo away from thicker, bouncier, more resilient hair!",

I started to use the spray as well a few weeks later and not conditioner cause I have very oily hair and with the spray it gave me even more volume. I\u2019m not sure how to style my hair cause it\u2019s so voluminous and full. My baby hair in front are plump and cover the receding hair. This was not a sponsored review- it\u2019s my honest review and I found a shampoo I can use and make me feel good about my hair.",
