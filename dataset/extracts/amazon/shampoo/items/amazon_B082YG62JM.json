I have very long thick hair and their biggest bottle of shampoo is like 8oz to 12oz which wouldn't last very long. It also did not feel hydrating at all. The conditioner is very nice but you have to make sure you rinse your hair EXTREMELY thoroughly otherwise it weighs down the hair a bit. I would say the shampoo is probably better for people with fine-normal hair. People with oily scalps or thick hair- find another product.",

                "reviewText": "This has become my go to shampoo. I started my non-toxic journey and finding a good but affordable shampoo has been a hassle. So glad I came accross this one. I'm on my 3rd bottle. A little goes a long way with this stuff. I have super long thick hair down to my bottom and this stuff lathers and lasts. I get a feel good clean on my scalp, no itchiness or dryness. It has a soft pleasant smell that is not over powering but does last several days on your hair. It does moisturize my hair and keeps it soft. I match it with their smoothing conditioner and I love it.",

                "reviewText": "Oh my hair is just a tragic frazzled mess but with this product it not only smells like marzipan but it helps my hair naturally curl easier.I don't even know at this point with how many products I've tried but this works. Naturally drying my hair leaves nice and happy wavy curls and I just feel like this suits my hair perfectly.Pretty much this review will go onto the other product.The only thing I'm concerned about is I thought this was purely natural but there's about 50 ingredients with super long names and no description of what they do in particular like on some products.I'm trying to steer as clear as possible from chemicals and sulfates and the nasties most typical brands use that wreck your hair and leave you needing to buy 17 other products to fix the issues they caused.Otherwise though? If you don't care about those parts go wild! It's a great product :)",
