                "reviewText": "This shampoo has both healthy and unhealthy things in it. I don't usually use anything that has very many ingredients that I can't pronounce, but I tried this last year when my hair was thinning at a frightening rate. It smells good and lathers nicely. Very slowly my hair started regrowing, and several odd irritations on my scalp started healing. My hair never has and never will be thick. I did not expect miracles, so I was just glad when some hair started filling in. My only explanation is that the vitamins and protein it contains improved my scalp enough for viable hair roots to function again. Over the years I have noticed that B vitamins and eating more protein did help somewhat. This is why I thought maybe applying them directly to my scalp might be helpful. It seems that it is for me, so I just grit my teeth and try to forget what else is in there. Just bought 2 more bottles while it was on sale.",

                "reviewText": "so i know this product has much controversy surrounding it but for me, personally, i have used this product for years and have great results. i\u2019m 36 years old with naturally curly hair. after the birth of my child around 30 my hair became very frail and thin and was losing its curl. this product brought it back over time. it grew wonderfully and gave me back my confidence! but, in fact, at one point i regretfully stopped using it because of women saying it made them lose their hair so i was scared that would happen to me and it wasn\u2019t before long that i started losing my gorgeous locks again when i switched products. so i started using it again and already my hair is fuller and stronger after about a month.the lesson here is no head of hair is created equal. what doesn\u2019t work for one person can work for someone else. in addition to this i take collagen vitamins daily.",

It makes my hair feel thicker and fuller and does not weigh it down. I have noticed some improvement in my hair loss, but not a dramatic change. I think it is a good shampoo for adding volume and strength to thinning hair, but it may not be enough to stop hair loss completely. The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of the product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to boost their hair's volume and health.",
