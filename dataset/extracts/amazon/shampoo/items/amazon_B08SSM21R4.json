                "reviewText": "I have thick coarse wavy and usually dry hair with oily roots. It seemed like the only time my hair felt soft and manageable is when I left the salon, but my salon uses a shampoo which is close to 100$. I couldn't justify that so I looked for something cheaper, and I found this. This shampoo is excellent and I will never switch so long as they make it. It's the only shampoo with a fair price point that leaves my hair feeling soft and tangle free. I used to have a huge issue with there being a \"rats nest\" at the nape of my neck by the end of the day, this shampoo (and conditioner) have eliminated this problem. I no longer have to rip through my hair multiple times a day with a hairbrush, and it's actually smooth and tangle free. The smell is inoffensive although I prefer something more fragrant. Don't apply to your roots if you are oily, by the next day your roots will be shiny and needing to wash again. I only apply from my neck down.",

I will be using this forever more.",

But I gotta say this works better. The anti-Frizz was not noticeably more effective with smoothing the frizz and had the weird effect of making my hair look dull, for whatever reason. With this, hair is less dull looking, though neither of them worked the hair miracles their prices might suggest.",
