I have very curly hair and now I have straight hair after having a Brazilian blowout. In my experience this shampoo and conditioner have made the blowout last way beyond my wildest dream. Same shampoo was always good with curly hair too. It smells wonderful and you don't have to use much to wash your hair. I have very thick hair which is about elbow length. It may seem expensive, but it lasts and lasts.",

I have baby fine hair, and it\u2019s been a battle my entire life. I moved to a different city and acquired a new hair dresser that used it. I liked it so I bought it. I haven\u2019t used anything else since! It does great on my hair, and I have to wash my hair daily. The Nourishing and the Moisturizing ones are what I use. I also use the hairspray, leave in conditioner, the volumizer gel, and the oil. Even the oil isn\u2019t too heavy for my hair. It\u2019s like this line was made for people with hair like mine! They better not ever discontinue it!!",

This combo makes for unruly hair. Loma really helps with this because it gives it moisture without making your hair oily. Oiliness has been an issue for me when trying to get moisture into my hair. Loma has a very light smell that I can only smell when I am using it but I have been told by others they can smell it. Another good thing is how thick it is. Because of this, you don't need to use too much, making it a great value.",
