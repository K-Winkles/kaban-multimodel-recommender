I wrote a review on these 2 products once before, but since I REALLY LOVE using both of these 2 \" REVITA \" products SO MUCH, I wanted to write another review to let EVERYONE know, that both of these 2 \" REVITA \" products are \" BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET \", for hair loss. I have been using both of these 2 products for a few months now & I couldn't be more thrilled, pleased, happy or amazed with how these 2 products has really helped my hair, because I have always had some kind of hair loss or hair breakage most of my life, as we all do, then after I got really sick last year, I started to see that my hair was REALLY coming out a great deal, to where my hair would come out in hand fulls, every time I would wash or brush my hair, but since I started using both of these 2 \" REVITA \" products together over several months, I started to see less & less hair loss & less hair breakage after each time of washing my hair & NOW \" I HAVE ABSOLUTE NO KIND OF HAIR LOSS OR HAIR BREAKAGE AT ALL \" & I indeed have these 2 \" REVITA \" products to thank for saving my hair, because of these 2 \" REVITA \" products that I have pictured with this update review, my hair loss & hair breakage has completely STOPPED altogether & All hair loss or hair breakage that I did have in the pass is NO MORE & you can be rest assured that this will be the only \" REVITA \" Shampoo & Conditioner that I will ever use from now on, so if you suffer from ANY KIND of hair loss or hair breakage at all, like I did & you have tried everything on the market, then you really need to give both of these 2 \" REVITA \" products a try, because you won't be at all sorry that you did. How I use the \" REVITA \" shampoo, is washing my hair at least twice, with each time, really scrubbing & working it through my hair for at least a minute or so, then rinsing after each shampoo, then & use the \" REVITA \" Conditioner \" after the second shampoo, I put some of the \" REVITA \" Conditioner in my hand, then applying it all over my hair, scrubbing & working it all over & through out my hair for about a minute or so, then I leave the \"REVITA \" Conditioner on my hair for about 5 more minutes, because I REALLY LOVE the really cool feeling that it makes my hair, head & scape feel, then after leaving the REVITA \" Conditioner on my hair for 5 minutes, I wash the Conditioner out, towel dry my hair, then brush my hair, then after that & just let my hair air dry. Now you will might not see immediate results after the first time from using both the \" REVITA Shampoo & REVITA Conditioner \" but \" DON'T GET DISCOURAGED or FRUSTRATED \" because you will, especially if you keep using both of these 2 products for a few months, you will indeed see the very same results as I have & experienced, because like I said before after using the \" REVITA Shampoo & REVITA Conditioner \" together I have \" ABSOLUTE NO KIND OF HAIR LOSS ANY MORE OR NO KIND OF HAIR BREAKAGE AT ALL NOW \" & I couldn't be more thrilled, happy or amazed, because both of these 2 \" REVITA \" products do EXACTLY what they say they would do & to me, knowing that I spent my money on something or a product(s) that REALLY, REALLY WORKS, is just some of the best money that I have EVER spent.",

Can\u2019t just toss this product in your toiletry bag or suitcase because the design of the pump that delivers the shampoo requires complicated twisting to lock into place and even then the bottle typically leaks shampoo all over everything.
