Our Liquid Micellar technology acts like a magnet to attract and lift away buildup for a thorough scalp and hair cleanse without leaving hair feeling stripped. The targeted liquid formula provides easy scalp access as it instantly flows through hair and transforms into a gentle foam lather without harsh friction. It effortlessly works throughout, minimizing tangles and quickly rinses clean so there's no added weight from residue left behind. After one wash, scalp and hair feel clean, and hair feels soft and moisturized. One wash changes everything. We consider an ingredient to be naturally derived if it is unchanged from its natural state or has undergone processing yet still retains greater than 50 percent of its molecular structure from its original natural source.",

I chose the product specifically for my microlocs after seeing it highly recommended and demonstrated by several influencers on YouTube. A LITTLE goes a long way!! One bottle lasted 2.5 months doing 2 shampoos weekly!!! The \"water\" consistency distributes fast and easy throughout my locs. It lathers really well but rinses out surprisingly well too. Wash Day Delight (Aloe) is now my weekly shampoo I've used exclusively for 4 months. I also LOVE the super fresh scent that leaves a light fresh \"whiff\" 1-2 days after shampoo.",

                "reviewText": "I love this stuff, it can be initially applied with no added water because it is a micellar water shampoo it lathers all on it\u2019s own. Of course adding water is ideal, but not entirely necessary. Can be used standing up or even sitting in a chair! It\u2019s not messy or runny at all and doesn\u2019t drip. My daughter uses it as she\u2019s learning to wash her own hair in the shower so it\u2019s great for kids learning independence to use on their own. It\u2019s way different and less messy than traditional shampoo. It does seem to have clarifying properties, so it\u2019s not as moisturizing, but after using the Wash Day Delight conditioner which is a gel, my hair was moisturized with good slip. A very good leave in conditioner was needed afterward to maintain maximum moisture and I seal with oil. I love this set and I love the smell! Makes a great addition to your child\u2019s personal care items because they aren\u2019t creamy and drippy so the chances of shampoo and conditioner getting in their eyes is no worry at all. I will purchase again!",

Cela dit, ce shampooing fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien pour moi et mes enfants, nos cheveux sont doux et propres, il est important d'utiliser un shampooing et un apr\u00e8s-shampooing hydratants apr\u00e8s avoir utilis\u00e9 ce shampooing afin de ne pas avoir les cheveux secs. Il \u00e9limine tr\u00e8s bien les accumulations de produits et les salissures. Il sort de la bouteille sous la forme d'un liquide clair semblable \u00e0 de l'eau, mais il mousse bien et se rince facilement.
