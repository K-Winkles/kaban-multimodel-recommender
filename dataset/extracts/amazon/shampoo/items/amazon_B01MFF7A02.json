My really dry, over-processed hair is very soft, shining, and manageable. The tone after shampooing with this is beautiful. I had used this other product from another brand recently and it literally took all the color out of my hair! However, Garnier leaves this really gorgeous tone in my very light hair that looks like I just put color in it yesterday. The smell is nice, sort of a fruit scent. The lather is crazy. I am just waiting to find out how many shampoos my color will last but so far so great.",
