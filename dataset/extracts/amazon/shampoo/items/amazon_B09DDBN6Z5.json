I have used other natural shampoos that still seems to leave my hair dry and limp or with a \"film\" on my hair. I used this and I had no itchy scalp and my hair was left soft and shiny as well has a nice \"soft\" fragrance that isn't overpowering. Granted I have only used this once as I just received it, yet that's all I need to know this stuff works great for me because it only takes once for me to have a flare up on my scalp. The only issue I have is the pump does not work, yet since the shampoo works great in my hair I can live with unscrewing the cap to get the shampoo out everytime I wash my hair. I will definitely be buying this shampoo again.",
