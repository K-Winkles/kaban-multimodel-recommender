                "reviewText": "I adore the It's a 10 Miracle Leave In Product Plus Keratin, so I changed from my usual keratin shampoo and conditioner to try this It's a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin, and it's good...but not the best. I'll be switching back to my original favorite, Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, but I'm never getting rid of the It's a 10 Miracle Leave In, cause that stuff seriously changes your life.This shampoo was good, it does make hair smoother and a bit shinier, more manageable. I should explain that I've got a white-girl 'fro happening whenever I wash my hair with \"normal\" products, and I've learned over time to manage it. This shampoo is definitely a vast improvement to washing my hair with normal shampoo, but it's not quite as great as it could be. The hair is less weighed down, which can be good, but the ends tend to be a bit fly-away, though not truly static frizzy, with this shampoo. Overall, it's very good, but not good enough to de-throne the Suave Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.By the way, if you haven't heard already, if you have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair, it's best to \"co-wash,\" as they call it. Put conditioner in your hair FIRST, on dry hair even, if you can manage it, and leave it in for at least a few minutes. I put conditioner on, finish the rest of my shower routine, and as the very last step, I use shampoo on my hair (just the roots/crown area, not the ponytail/ends area), and it makes a huge difference. I think that's one reason this set doesn't work as well for me, because it really wants the conditioner second like normal, and the results are good, but it just doesn't sink in and seal the cuticle with \"good\" moisture the way \"co-washing\" can.But I would still say give this a try.",

I had a situation where my hair was getting very dry and weak so I bought this line to help my hair. It has become stronger and softer! Now I am more confident my hair will be successful with growing longer. I was at a very well known store and saw their prices but could not buy from them. Buying online is a money saver! Shampoo smells great and I am literally happy every time I am washing my hair. Product arrived on time and bottle is working as expected.",
