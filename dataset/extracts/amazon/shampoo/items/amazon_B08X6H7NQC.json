                "reviewText": "Let me tell you, the Dr. Squatch Pine Tar Hair Care Kit totally surprised me! I mean, I usually just grab whatever's on sale at the store, but this stuff is next level. First off, the smell? Amazing. It's like a walk in the woods every time I shower.But more importantly, it actually works wonders on my hair. The shampoo isn't harsh like some others I've tried, and my scalp feels so clean without that dry, stripped feeling. And the conditioner? It's like a secret weapon against tangles. My hair's never been easier to manage.What I really appreciate is that it's made with natural ingredients. I mean, that's cool, right? And the packaging, it looks really nice and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart after a week.I'm not usually big on writing reviews, but this kit? It's worth it. It's like upgrading your hair care routine to a whole new level without breaking the bank. I'll definitely be sticking with Dr. Squatch from now on.",

                "reviewText": "To fully get the fresh falls smoothness that the brand promotes, I recommend letting the conditioner last on your hair for at least 2 minutes or more when you\u2019re in the shower. This way, after rinsing it off and coming out to dry, you\u2019ll slowly feel the hair softening. It smells great and feels great. At first, after applying the conditioner and letting it last, you feel a cooling or burning feeling but it\u2019s the ingredients doing their stuff. Just a heads up.",

                "reviewText": "First off- if you\u2019re hell bent on buying this do it through their website, it\u2019s significantly cheaper. I\u2019ve used many of Dr. Squatch\u2019s products in the past, and have used their shampoo/conditioner dozens of times. They push the whole \u201cnatural\u201d thing a lot as a way to drive gullible customers, but there\u2019s a reason most soaps and shampoo from brands like P&G use unnatural ingredients made in a lab- because it\u2019s a helluva lot more effective and efficient than natural products. It has absolutely nothing to do with cutting costs like this brand claims. That being said- if you\u2019re looking for natural products due to allergy or some other reason, these are some of the best money can buy. Fresh Falls is the best scent from them imo and your hair will smell great, until you leave the shower that is, lol. Despite what they claim, smells don\u2019t stick around, especially when it comes to their body washes.Unless you\u2019re going into cold to freezing temperatures that\u2019ll make it more potent, don\u2019t expect to be catching a whiff of your hair throughout the day.Only way I could recommend this to someone is if they\u2019re trying to lead a \u201cnatural lifestyle\u201d and cutting out products made by big pharmaceutical companies. Which is an incredibly stupid idea in itself, but people will be people. Chemicals are our friends.",
