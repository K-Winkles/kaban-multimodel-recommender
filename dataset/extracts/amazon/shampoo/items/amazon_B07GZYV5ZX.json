                "reviewText": "October 5, 2023 UPDATE: Previously I had given this shampoo four stars because in spite of all its great qualities it dried out my hair a teeny tiny bit. But then I discovered when I used it with Baja Basics Hair Growth Elixir Rice Water detangling hydrating spray leave in hair conditioner, my hair became lustrous and just within two weeks of using the rice water conditioning spray hair, about 1/4 inches long hair sprouted all over my head! The baby hairs were noticeable in the big ALMOST bald spot I had in the crown area from wearing a sunhat everyday for 15 years. Yes, the hat stopped hair growth in my experience. Within four weeks the combination of this shampoo and the Baja Basics rice water hair growth conditioner caused the baby hairs to grow to half an inch length. I wanted people to know what happened as a result of the hair growth conditioner and this shampoo so I left a review about this shampoo on the hair growth conditioner/elixir on that site. Then I thought there might be people here on this shampoo site that are struggling with thinning hair so I am leaving information about that hair growth elixir here. I feel truly fortunate to come across two super stars products that work exceptionally well together. And to top it off both products are really reasonably priced. The Baja Basics hair growth elixir rice water hydration spray that is a leave in conditioner is only $14.95 for 4 fluid ounces, The ingredients are spectacular! Rice water, rose water, glycerin, D panthenol (wonderful, gentle for hair growth), Vitamin B5, Vitamin C, aloe vera, sorbic acid, MSM. Vitamins superb for hair growth and health. They worked for me beyond my wishes, I know you will benefit from them, also. Good health and beauty to you!First review is below ***************Because there is no sticky residue to weigh the hair downI, this shampoo gives superb body. Why I am not giving it 5 stars is because it dries out the hair a little bit. I will include this shampoo in my routine hair care, but I am still on the search for a shampoo that will clean well without drying out my hair.One side note: There is another plus to using this shampoo. It will cut out itchy scalp. The ingredients are so clean that the scalp is cleaned well, too, not just the hair.",

The shampoo pump broke after me, trying to open it to use. I'll just have to buy it at Sally beauty. I have high porosity hair and the twisting souffle helps to hydrate my hair. The rosemary mint scalp and hair I use this every other day. Thanks Mielle for being concerned about a customer who uses you products.",

On Black Friday and a couple days after if you went on Mielle\u2018s website, you got all of their products for seven dollars. I just so happen to already have these products at home already that I\u2019ve ordered from Amazon, the products are fantastic. I ordered the products that they have for 4C hair. They have other products for other types of hair but the one for 4C hair works for me just fine.",
