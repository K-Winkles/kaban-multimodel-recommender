                "reviewText": "It lathers up and washes your hair clean; nothing sets it apart from any other shampoo. The peppermint fragrance was a mild imitation smell. It missed the mark of my expectations by 90%. A small whiff of something meant to smell like mint. It's an acceptable clean that does an average job. For the price of purchase it's not worth the value. If I can buy cheaper for 'any old shampoo' that does the same exact job as this product there's no value in its purchase.",
