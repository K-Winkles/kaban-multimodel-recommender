Some shampoos leave a thick residue behind, leaving my hair with a horrible waxy feeling and heavy coating of gunk all over. I have very fine hair, very soft, and it grows thick on my head. Shampoos and conditioners that leave behind \"moisturizers\" (or whatever) often leave my hair feeling heavy, flat, or not rinsed off well (and hard water is awful for my hair)._THIS_ shampoo doesn't quite do that, but it does not rinse out very well. There is a slight residue, and it gets better with a second lather and rise, but it doesn't rise out thoroughly well, leaving my hair feeling a little heavy and not as clean as it should be. It's passable, I can dry my hair and leave the house, but I'm not pleased with it.This might work for some, but it doesn't for me. I would recommend a small bottle before buying a large one.",
