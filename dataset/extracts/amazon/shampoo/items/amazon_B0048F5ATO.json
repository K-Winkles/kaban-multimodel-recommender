                "reviewText": "Its great I still love this formula but I do honestly prefer the other formula which is the extra strength version. I find my hair and skin take to it better and doesn't at all trigger any acne in fact since I have so many skin allergies to face wash products and soap products from other companies I have resorted to washing my face with the extra strength version and my face has been taking well to the extra strength version, with no acne, no rashes and no enlarging of pores from it. Whether its correct or not I finally found something that I can also wash my face with that won't cause me any emergence of skin rashes nor does it seem to cause any acne and I have been using it for months. This version that is not extra strength I also use at times on my face too and I do find that occassionally it might cause a pimple or two and very occasionally some slight redness that usually clears up quickly. Now for the part that most people are interested in I have brunette and fine not thin/ thinning hair and both regular and extra strength versions even without the conditioner leave your hair extra silky smooth more manageable for my hair texture and fine hair type and bring out my natural colors and tones that are sometimes opaqued by cheap or heavily moisturizing shampoos. Both shampoos do give your hair aome good balanced volume but for all that I stated the shine the extra tones and more clearer lights/ highlights on my hair volume, and maintaining the health and luster I still recommend the extra strength version. Both are good but the extra strengrh version in my case just goes the extra mile and takes the cake in my opinion and experience. I still give this product 5/ 5 stars. I still reccomend to add the extra strength argan oil conditioner it'll do even more wonders for you and leave an even more beautiful luster that brings out/ highlights your natural highlights. \ud83d\ude09",
