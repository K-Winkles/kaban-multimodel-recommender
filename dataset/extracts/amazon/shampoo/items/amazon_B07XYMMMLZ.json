Leaves your hair manageable, soft and free of flyaways and the best of all - there is no purple residue left on your hair, your hands or under your finger nails. It really brings out the hair's brightness. I've tried other brands and they all leave purple behind. Absolutely love it!",

I have grey hairs that streak my natural brown and so far loving this shampoo, my hair feels soft and smooth. Will not order again unless I can get in Canada, definitely not worth the price or shipping fees; otherwise great product of Pantene Pro-V.",
