                "reviewText": "I recently stumbled upon the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo with ProteinFusion for Damaged Hair, and let me tell you, it has been nothing short of amazing! I've been using it for a while now, and I couldn't be happier with the results.First and foremost, the price is an absolute steal for the quality you're getting. This 33.8 oz bottle is a generous size that will last you a long time, making it even more budget-friendly. Trust me, you won't find a better deal!Now, let's talk about the magical transformation it has brought to my hair. My locks were damaged, lifeless, and desperately in need of some love. But since I started using this shampoo, my hair has been thriving! The Keratin Protein and Black Rice in the formula work wonders to repair and strengthen even the most damaged strands. I can feel the difference with each wash!But that's not all. The scent of this shampoo is simply divine! It leaves my hair smelling fresh and delightful all day long. It's a small touch, but it adds to the overall experience and makes me feel confident and rejuvenated.Oh, and did I mention that it's silicone-free? That's right! No more worrying about product build-up or weighing down your hair. This shampoo keeps your hair feeling light, bouncy, and full of life.In conclusion, I can't recommend the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo with ProteinFusion enough. It's a true game-changer for damaged hair, offering fantastic results at an unbeatable price. Your hair will thank you for this luxurious treat, and you'll be left with a fabulous mane that smells absolutely incredible. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Highly recommend this if you have damaged hair from either bleaching or just over processing your hair. This helps keep my blonde hair from breaking, made it more manageable, and smooths it out so it doesn't look so damaged. I also bought the conditioner, in which I highly recommend buying as well. This has protein in it which is perfect for damaged hair. Just keep in mind products like these are like a band-aid. Once hair is severely damaged and/or dead, you can't actually revive it. They are meant to help your hair until you're able to cut it off.I saw some people complain about the scent, it does have a perfume smell but it didn't bother me. Makes me hair smell really good!! And it lasts!",

                "reviewText": "I love, love, LOVE this shampoo!! I'd been looking for a Keratin shampoo and came across this brand on Amazon. It was a great price and received a lot of good reviews. So I took a chance and bought it. WOW! I'm not easily impressed, but after one shampoo my hair was noticeably softer and bouncier. After the 2nd time I used it, it was even better. My hair is very fine (but I have a lot of it) and not damaged. It has a mind of its own, especially in this Florida summer humidity, but this shampoo has helped make it more manageable. I really am truly impressed on how wonderful my hair feels. So much so, I bought 2 more and they just happened to be even more less expensive than the first time I purchased the shampoo! Yay! I just ordered the conditioner and am waiting to see how it does.",
