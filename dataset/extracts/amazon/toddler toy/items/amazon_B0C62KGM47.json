                "reviewText": "We previously have purchased ice cream set from this brand and loved it. Wanted to try another toy from this company and have decided to get this train set when it was on sale. It came real well packaged, no issues there. I like that it is a sturdy design, I have a toddler that chews everything, and so far, it stays in like new condition. The animal designs are adorable, and my 2,5-year-old was naming the animals and numbers. It's a neutral toy, so would make a great gift for both girls and boys (I have both, and my two girls and my son were taking turns in playing with the train). The only complaint I have - I wish the magnets stayed stronger like the one in ice cream set. It does its job but not the greatest. But overall, I highly recommend this toy, my kids play with it a lot! :)",
