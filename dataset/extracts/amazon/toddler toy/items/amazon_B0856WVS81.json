They are made of inexpensive plastic and hollow in the middle so not amazing quality but they still hold up very well overall, and my kids enjoy this set very much in the bathtub and pool. Very much worth it for the price. The backpack is a nice little bonus as it helps keep everything together nearly when they aren't playing with them.",

My only complaint is the fishing poles break very easily. One came apart on my daughter the first day she got it. She is 5 and is not rough with her things so that was disappointing. Other than that it\u2019s a good purchase. I found that sometimes I can repair the pole and other times it\u2019s a lost cause. We ended up buying some extra poles.",

                "reviewText": "This product should be recalled and removed from Amazon altogether. This is a potential choking hazard for young children. The magnet on the fishing rod is attracted to a small screw that is inserted into the fishes mouth and tops of their heads. I didn't even notice because they are so tiny until we caught a fish and the magnet pulled the screw right out. So incredibly dangerous for any kid of any age, including potential of lost screws that pets could eat. DO NOT BUY!!!",
