                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this set of monster trucks with lights for my grandson, and I have to say, they've been a big hit! He absolutely loves the flashing lights and the moving mouths on these trucks.However, there was a bit of a snag with one of the trucks in the set. Unfortunately, it didn't work properly right out of the box. The push-and-go mechanism, which is supposed to make the truck automatically go forward, didn't work at all. Despite this hiccup, my grandson still enjoys playing with the trucks. While he still can't pushing down the truck to make it go (he's 12 months old), he's still has fun pushing them around manually. The adult in the room have fun pushing them down and making them run.Although it was disappointing to have one truck not work as expected, returning it was a bit challenging since it was already given as a gift. So, we're making do with two working trucks and one that doesn't work. I'm hopeful that as my grandson grows older, he'll be able to manage the push-and-go action more easily.Overall, it's a fun buy and I'm sure he'll continue to enjoy playing with them as he grows.",
