                "reviewText": "My son is just now starting to be able to enjoy this toy. He\u2019s 11 almost 12 months but I bought it at Christmas and he was a little young to fully hold the ball, and understand the concept.I like that it\u2019s interactive, and cheers them on when they score! My son loves praise so it makes him excited haha.You do need about 4 Double AA batteries if I\u2019m correct, that aren\u2019t included but that\u2019s not an issue. As long as you\u2019re aware of that, and prepared when it arrives to put it together.Super simple set up & easy to follow directions.It\u2019s mostly just snapping things into place. It does require a small screwdriver to insert batteries.It\u2019s sturdy, but light weight so it\u2019s very easy for a young child to knock over. That\u2019s the only downside, but I\u2019d assume they don\u2019t want it to be heavy enough to cause harm or injury either.Overall, I think it\u2019s a great toy. Interactive fun and gets your little ones brain thinking",
