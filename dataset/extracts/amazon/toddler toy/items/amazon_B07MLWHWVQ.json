                "reviewText": "The idea of this piano mat is great and both of my girls love it. This is our second one. On the first one the power switch stopped working. It was loose and when reattached just didn\u2019t sit right likely due to damage from being dropped. On the second one, the inside wiring can bunch when my toddler crumples it and it has gotten stuck that way. I suggest sewing down the inside so it can\u2019t shift. I would also add a non slip bottom for those of us with hard floors. It slides around very easily and can cause a child to fall as they step on it. The idea is great and it works well, but the quality of materials is poor and it does not hold up to long term use well.",
