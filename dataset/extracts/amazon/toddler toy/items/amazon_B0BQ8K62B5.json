                "reviewText": "I have three boys ages 11, 5, and 1. We own a lot of sensory toys and fidgets. The baby often wants to use them as well. The other day he got ahold of one of the more traditional water toys and smacked it hard enough it broke open everywhere. You\u2019d think the stuff in them is benign, apparently it\u2019s not. I bathed him right away but he has a blistering rash, his whole leg has swelled, and he is miserable. I knew we needed something that was going to be safe for him to play with that was similar to the \u201cbig kid\u201d toys. These are perfect! We\u2019ve only had them a few hours but my very rough five year old has already put them through their paces. I feel confident allowing the baby to play with these.These are a good size. Not too tall/long so no risk of him accidentally smacking himself as he shakes them. They have a chubby rounded shape that\u2019s easy to grip. Two make interesting noises. The plastic seems tough and durable. I\u2019d happily recommend these to any home with toddlers or less than gentle children. Might be a good option in occupational settings too since so many kids and adults could enjoy these. In terms of occupational settings we would warn that the sand does make a noise that all of us can hear but it\u2019s not bothering anyone. I could see the rain stick one being problematic to some sensitive individuals though. It\u2019s not quiet by our standards (myself and the 5yo are sound sensitive). It\u2019s not bothering my 11yo though.",

                "reviewText": "Toys arrived safely in a plastic blister pack, so no doubt at all that they were new.The rain stick looks cute and sounds pretty nice, and also has this feature where you can turn the caps at both ends and it clicks? Kind of random, but I guess it\u2019s added value.The sand one is very calming, although something may be slightly wrong in one direction- turned one way the sand falls slowly, but turned the other way it all just dumps into one layer and then trickles out of that layer. Not sure if it\u2019s supposed to be like that.The glitter one has cute smiley face shaped glitters in it. I do wish something was added to the water to make the glitter fall slower. This seems like it\u2019s in plain water, so the glitter basically just Sinks instead of floating around much when disturbed.However, these are really small complaints- overall these are good! And I think it was a good deal for the three of them when I bought them, although I know Amazon prices change a lot.",

The sand moving through the tube sounds very relaxing, which he loves. He isn't a fan of the one with the marbles inside because its a bit loud, but he might enjoy it later on as he gets more familiar with these toys. Fidget toys can be hit or miss, but these are decent quality and great for kids who like visual and auditory input that is calming.",
