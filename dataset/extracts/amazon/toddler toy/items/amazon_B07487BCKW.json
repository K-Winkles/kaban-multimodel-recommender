                "reviewText": "These are really sturdy, and will keep rolling for over 20 feet once the inertial flywheel is sped up. They can roll up and over obstacles well too, with the impressive four-wheel drive operation and straight-ahead alignment.I did a lot of research, and found these to be perfect \"birthday favors\" for eight \"Twos Room\" children. Pro tip: use masking tape or similar to label the bottom with kids' names, so it is clear whose is whose. More toys built to last like these, please!",
