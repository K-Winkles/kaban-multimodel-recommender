The only thing that I was a smidge disappointed with was the Velcro is not attached to the pieces. It is something that an adult has to follow up with. My daughter is getting a laminator for Christmas and plans on laminating all the pieces and then applying the velcro. This is the first baby and she is also a child behaviorist on a baby leave for a couple of years and wants to use this book when she returns to her practice. It is just a great book!!!",

Putting the dots on takes a long time and careful fingers so that\u2019s a challenge with initial set up and although it has a sturdy lamination and the book binding seems durable, my two year old already bent many of the longer pieces permanently. Book has lots of pages with different vocabulary and topics and is a favorite item for him and I love that it is more academic focused and not requiring batteries. We do it together and sometimes he does it alone.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this busy book in February 2023, my 3 year old still enjoys it. An activity straight from unboxing, I myself enjoyed assembling it together with my child. Very bright, colourful and basic subjects for her to learn from. Only down fall about the product is that over time, the cards do fold if left unsupervised (general wear and tear by child) overall it is a great product for kids.",

                "reviewText": "For the high price point of this book, the quality is shocking. You have to apply velcro yourself, which means that the images aren't centred when they're applied unless you have perfect attention to detail.More importantly, as it's a book to help children read and write, there are spelling mistakes (\"Stegosaur\") and grammar mistakes, (Inconsistent capitalisation and missing articles, \"Match Planet\", \"Blueberry/Ice cream/kite\" as titles.) The product description and insert are both in very poorly written English, \"toy's for kids,\" and one of the activities is just a list of numbers, 1-100, with no pictures or anything. That's it. Just a list.There are some beautiful busy books online, this is just cheap, mass-produced, poor image quality junk. Very disappointed and lodged a return.",
