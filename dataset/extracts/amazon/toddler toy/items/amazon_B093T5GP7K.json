They\u2019re quite fast, but she giggles her head off when they\u2019re all going. The net just makes it more fun and easier to grab them when they get away.",

She isn't old enough to catch the ducks yet, but she will put all sorts of things inside the net and it's held up well. I won't lie .. the net alone is worth it as it's an excellent device if you had to scoop a little \ud83d\udca9 out of the tub.",
