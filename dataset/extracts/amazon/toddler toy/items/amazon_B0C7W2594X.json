                "reviewText": "My son loves this digital drawing pad. It has been a great interactive toy for while we are at restaurants or doctor\u2019s offices. He loves drawing on it himself and then asking us to draw! He\u2019s 2.5 years old.I specifically chose this one because it had a way of tying the stylus to the tablet, and it has stood the test of a toddler\u2019s whims. It\u2019s actually a coiled strand of plastic (?) that is stretchy, and he has dragged the tablet via the attached stylus, all over the house. I thought he destroyed it a few times, but it has gone back to its original length and same stretchiness. I\u2019m honestly impressed.The screen itself works great, and it\u2019s nice that there is some color variation when you draw. You can also lock the screen by a small sliding button on the back so that it doesn\u2019t accidentally erase your content\u2014or so that you can confuse your toddler like my husband did.This particular one also has magnets on the back, so I kind of want to get another one to stick on the fridge. I could use it for grocery lists throughout the week, or I can put it down low for him to draw on. I could also get two more\u2014one for each\u2014because they are so inexpensive! About $10 a piece.The battery is also nice because I can change it out. We haven\u2019t had to yet, but it is lest waste because I don\u2019t have to get a whole new tablet when it dies.Overall, we love this and will probably be buying again!",

                "reviewText": "I guess you get what you pay for. Money is tight at Christmas and I thought this was a great bargain. This was purchased for my grandson thinking it'd be great for him to write on without worrying about making a mess when he couldn't get out his paints. When I received it, it did not come with a cord to keep the stylus in place and it was very cheaply made. I contacted the seller and they indicated it did not come with the cord as it was pictured so I sent it back and bought another one that was bigger and a better quality. I had to pay more but I think paying more money was the better way to go.",
