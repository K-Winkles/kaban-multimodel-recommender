It is easy to put batteries in and the rest is up for them to play with and figure out. Its simple, sturdy, safe, and very engaging!

Now that he has it he takes it wi th him everywhere. Perfect for car rides. The board is noise less which is great as parents are not listening to the constant music throughout the day lol. Also is all wood and the lights are bright enough. It doesn\u2019t come with batteries and need to unscrew the front part to add the batteries. Other than that is a great toy for sensory and hand dexterity.",

                "reviewText": "Overall Rating: 4/5Installation/setup easiness: 5/5Ease of Use: 5/5Build quality: 5/5Utility: 5/5Child Safety: 2/5 (5/5 with constant parental supervision and oversight)Kids\u2019 play is the WORK that kids do in order to learn skillsets which will be useful for a lifetime.This is an EXCELLENT device which will most probably bring lots of pleasure to any kid aged 12-24 months while the child (i) gets instant cause-effect feedback, (ii) masters eye-hand coordination, and (iii) easily learns new, age-appropriate, critical-thinking skills joyfully without having to work hard.This device has been extensively tested by a child from our neighborhood (aged 12-16 months) who immediately started actuating all the well-located and easy-to-use switches (buttons & plug-ins & keys).-- Even though one of the switches fails intermittently (but NOT frequently, so it\u2019s not a deal breaker), the child has already mastered all the switches except the key-actuated one.WARNING: Some of the small parts (e.g., the keys and cabled plug-in connector) can be very dangerous for young children, especially since they put EVERYTHING into their mouths.-- Consequently, this toy should be used by any child ONLY with constant parental supervision and oversight.In addition, I personally would have preferred that the Busy Board be constructed of soft, lightweight elastomeric (and/or soft plastic) materials such that the only rigid parts would be the light switches & bulbs.-- Why? Because young children have no awareness of the damage they can cause by hitting themselves or other children with the hard wooden board.Other desirable niceties:(i) A camouflaged, sliding, ON-OFF master switch would be a welcome addition (instead of having to turn off all the switches individually).(ii) The battery compartment could be secured via the more commonplace, childproof, sliding closure (instead of using UNNECESSARY screws).Overall, I recommend this product with HIGH enthusiasm (especially if the seller makes the modifications I\u2019ve detailed)!",

(or as long as one-year olds attention span can be) She loves the lights and all the different functions. Great alternative to throwing a screen in front of them and gets their brain working. (Only thing, is you have to make sure you turn all the things off one by one after they're done playing with it because it doesn't have a main power switch that turns everything off at once. But that's just to help conserve battery life.)",
