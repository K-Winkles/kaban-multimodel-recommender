                "reviewText": "Very cute toy! My granddaughter needs a little help getting the coin in the narrow slot, but she will get the hang of it. She loves to open the door and take out the coins. When you put in a coin, it counts aloud\u2026one\u2026two\u2026three.. etc I both English and Spanish. Press the nose to hear music. Side buttons work easily to change the language and/or level.",

The standout feature of this toy is the activity of picking up coins and inserting them into the piggy bank. While this initially presented a challenge for my little one, it quickly became apparent that the difficulty level was intentional and beneficial for fine motor skill development. The process of aligning the coin with the slot and successfully depositing it into the piggy bank required concentration and precision.",
