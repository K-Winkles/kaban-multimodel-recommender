The only time one has broken was when the dog got one and chewed it up, otherwise there have been no other casualties!

It\u2019s a great learning tool, she can match up shapes, name the shapes, learn her colors, and count the eggs. She spends hours playing with them! They\u2019re also big enough where they\u2019re not a choking hazard, or get lost easily.",
