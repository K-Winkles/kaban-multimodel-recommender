                "reviewText": "We bought all three of the farm sets.For the tractor with the sounds: My two year old loves it, and the sounds it makes aren't super annoying, so that's a parent bonus. The trailer starts connected to the tractor really well, and it's all very sturdy. My two year old plays with it very easily. His Fisher Price Little People fit in the driver seat, too. My one minor complaint is that the other Battat farm animals aren't terribly compatible with the spots in the trailer. The animals from this set are shaped differently so they fit exactly in the spots that make them go up and down when you pull it. The animals in the other farm sets from this company do not. It doesn't bother my two year old, though, so it's really not a big deal.For the barn: this barn is AWESOME and my two year old hasn't stopped playing with it in two months. It's perfect for him. It doesn't make noise- it's simple, durable, sturdy, and so easy for him to play with. I love that your can fit all the animals inside and close it up easily. The handle is convenient, but we couldn't really take it anywhere without covering up all the windows, because the animals fall out if you bump it while moving it. This is probably the best toy purchase we've ever made. My son loves farm animals, so I looked into A LOT of toy barns, and I'm so glad we went with this one.",

Each time you put the farmer into the tractor seat or press down on the farmer(or the seat) it makes all the noises of the animals that come with it, makes a diesel tractor sounds, the lights flash, and it plays Old McDonald. It comes with cute and recognizable animals, a horse, sheep, chicken and a cow. A plus is that these sounds are loud enough to be fun but not so loud to be annoying. The animals move up and down when the trailer is rolling. I don't know what material they are made of but our teething grandson loves to chew on them and they still look brand new. The tractor lights up as well. The only difficulty he has is attaching the tractor to the trailer. As he gets older this will not be an issue. I would rather it be snug like that than coming apart at every bump or uneven surface. This toy is very sturdy and will stand up to a lot of play time.Pros:*does so many things*durable*sounds that aren't too loud*no sharp edges*rolls easily*a lot of toy for the priceCons:*attaching trailer to the tractor might be difficult for younger children.I know it will last for a very long time. I would recommend this toy to anyone.",

We haven\u2019t played with it yet, hence it is a Christmas gift. But I am very glad I chose this barn. It\u2019s a must have for any young child interested in farm animals. The colors are nice and bright, easily portable with a carry handle and well-built! Thanks Amazon",
