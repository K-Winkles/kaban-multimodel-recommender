                "reviewText": "This busy book activities are fine, but the technical aspects of the way it's made leave a little to be desired. Some of the velcro needs to be attached before this can be used and you're just pressing it on. The adhesive on the velcro just isn't as strong as it should be. The button holes are a little tight. Despite that, the activities are really fun.",

                "reviewText": "I got this Montessori Busy Board for my nephew, inspired by the success of a similar one I got for my niece, who played with this board often.What stands out about this busy board is the thoughtful inclusion of challenges that not only captivate a toddler's attention but also contribute to skill development and sensory/motor skills. The various buckles and knots provide just the right level of challenge, encouraging the little ones to explore and enhance their fine motor abilities. Some is harder to do than others, obviously.A standout feature that my previous board lacked was the counting kit, allowing children to learn and practice counting using their hands and fingers. It's a brilliant addition that adds an educational element to the play, making it a win-win for both fun and learning. Although this board did include addition stick-ons (velcro) such as fruits, decorations, alphabets and numbers like the one I had, I like it just as is because it's easy to maintain and clean up without the adons, which the little ones end up losing and throwing all over the place.One of the best aspects of this busy board is its affordability. Priced competitively (compared to many other brands I searched), it offers exceptional value, especially considering the high quality and educational features it provides. The compact design is a game-changer. Everything neatly folds into a small folder, making it incredibly light and easy to store or put away when not in use. It's the perfect solution for keeping the play area tidy and organized.",
