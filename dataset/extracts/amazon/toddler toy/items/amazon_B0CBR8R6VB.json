I am researching because I don\u2019t want to buy too many things and everything to possibly last for a while/having multiple uses. Plus we live in an apartment, so limited space is an issue.I ended up buying this product even with few reviews because it seemed more sturdy than most, and with a versatile design that will allow for immaginative play.What to say: she adores it. It\u2019s a walker, toy storage, a car where she rides in and the design is pretty cute.Assembly instructions are very vague, but it\u2019s not possible to really screw up assembly.Love this product.",

It was easy to assemble, and can be used for more than one purpose, but still for its main purpose it is lacking. I do not recommend it. Same problem in different surfaces.",
