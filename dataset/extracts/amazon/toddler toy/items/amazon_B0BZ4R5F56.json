Additionally, the cloud that makes a sound had a slightly poorly stitched part with cotton coming out.",

Even better the price was extremely reasonable.Highly recommended!!!",

They don\u2019t feel very secure and I worry about choking hazards or losing the pieces. My alphabet and numbers also came incorrect. I got 2 A\u2019s no S and no 7. You can tell the numbers come from two different sets of fonts and aren\u2019t great. I will probably end up making my own if the book lasts past our first trip.",
