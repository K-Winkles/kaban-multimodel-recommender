I bought them a set for their house. I also added the car set and the submarine set (great for bath time) for future gifts.As a grandparent I do enjoy the fun and creativity of the building blocks. They are easy to put together and fun to make things.I enjoy playing with them with my grandkids but they want all the blocks for their own inventions.It is the one toy that keeps my grandkids entertained for hours. They use them constantly always coming up with new designs.I bought them when my grandkids were 2 1/2 and 1 and at 4 and 2 1/2 they are still using them. Even when the older cousins come they play with them.I know some people think the cost is a little much but I would rather a quality product that is used over and over to a poorly made toy hardly used.",

We love how they connect and like the clicking sound as you turn them. My boys use their imaginations to make all sorts of things. Younger children like them as well, I just have to watch the 1 1/2 year old because she will try to chew on them. I can not leave her unsupervised with them even for a minute but she loves them when I let her play with them (and I am sitting with her). Expensive but a great toy to encourage imaginations!",

It\u2019s an excellent building toy as well as for the bath. The only thing problem I have with this set is there are no ideas for different things they can build. This is a little pricy but definitely worth it",

Although I think the price is a little steep for the amount of pieces you get, my little boy is having a great time playing with them.It allows children to really use their imaginations to connect them together and build different things each time. However I will say I feel once you build a little top heavy or try to pick your design up, it doesn't take much to break apart. Not much of a big issue though, they're great fun.",
