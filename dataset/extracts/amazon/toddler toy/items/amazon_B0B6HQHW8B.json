They are very safe and I am in no way nervous to let them use them.The ANIMAL CUT OUTS are tricky for even myself, so I removed them from the set because we ALL were getting frustrated. The PEELER has worked on a carrot and we are going to try a cucumber next. The GREEN HANDLED CUTTER works great on hard vegetables. KNIVES work great on softer items.Don't forget messes come with learning! Have a blast!",

My toddler grabs his set when he sees me busy in the kitchen and pulls up a chair to help me. Get this if you want to find ways to get your little one involved in the prepping of meals and/or to help sharpen motor skills.Put in dishwasher and it came out the same! If the cutting board slides, just put a damp paper towel under.",
