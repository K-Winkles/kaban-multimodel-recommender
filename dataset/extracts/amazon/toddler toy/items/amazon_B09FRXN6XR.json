I thought these are a nice little something to give them and boy was it. They all loved them. They played with them all night. They played games on them and they drew pictures to show everyone. I love the locking feature. Anything they drew that they wanted to show people was easy locked on the screen. It is great for the car or restaurants. It comes with some string to tether the pen with the screen. They are a great size too. Big enough to enjoy but small enough for little hands to carry around and not take up to much space in bags. I also like how the come 3 to a pack. So practical. The animals for the clear button are really cute. I am so happy with this purchase.",

My youngest (5) loves drawing on them and being able to erase them quickly to continue creating whatever masterpiece they want to draw. I love the fact there is an on/off switch. I tied the stylus pen to the board with some string so it won't get lost. Overall very happy with this purchase.",
