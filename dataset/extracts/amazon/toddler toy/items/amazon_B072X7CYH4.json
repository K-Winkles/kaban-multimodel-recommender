                "reviewText": "Overall, we enjoy this toy and plan on keeping it. The only wood on this item is the base and support beams. The \u2018parking area\u2019 and ramps are plastic. Additionally, the parking area does not fit 2 cars length wise which is shown on the box. They fit perpendicular which blocks the opening where rhe cars drive down.We have minimal issues with cars not making it all the way down the ramp so the angles and weight of the cars is better than a similar item we initially purchased.Fun and entertaining for my 1 and 3 year old boys",
