It is perfect to use with water outside and small/light enough to bring into the house during winter to play with. She is the perfect height right now to stand and play with it (30inches) but she will eventually have to sit to play with it when she is older. I have a lot of water toys so I chose this over a water table that comes with a lot of accessories and I like that I will be able to use it for other things since no toys are attached to it",
