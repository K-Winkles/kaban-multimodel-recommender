The genuine and pure joy on his face and in his smile riding it makes me so happy inside so thank you for making this wonderful product! Took less than 10 min to build and the only complaint I have is the wheel is hard to turn as the plastic does not do well against itself on the connection part.",

He likes using it both ways and it is very well built, excellent price and he has plenty of room to grow and use it for a few years. I would definitely buy again",
