Knobs are easy for him to maneuver and he doesn't have to touch too hard to get it to make sounds. This is a great product, interactable, and giftable.",

                "reviewText": "The VTech Turn and Learn Driver is an engaging and interactive toy that provides a fun driving experience for young children. With its vibrant colors, realistic features, and educational elements, this toy encourages imaginative play and helps develop essential skills. Here's my review of the VTech Turn and Learn Driver.The standout feature of this toy is its realistic design and interactive features. The steering wheel mimics a real car's steering wheel, complete with buttons, a gear shifter, and a turning key. The colorful buttons play a variety of sounds, melodies, and phrases, engaging children's senses and stimulating their curiosity. The gear shifter and turning key provide tactile feedback, enhancing the overall play experience. The Turn and Learn Driver requires two AA batteries, which are not included. It is advisable to have extra batteries on hand to ensure uninterrupted playtime. In conclusion, the VTech Turn and Learn Driver provides a fun and interactive driving experience for young children. Its realistic design, interactive features, and educational content make it an engaging and beneficial toy for imaginative play and skill development. While the need for batteries and the volume control are factors to consider, the overall performance and value of the VTech Turn and Learn Driver make it a reliable choice for young drivers in the making.",
