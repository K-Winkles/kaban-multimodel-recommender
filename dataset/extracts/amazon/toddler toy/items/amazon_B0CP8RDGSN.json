It's a toy that exercises colors, numbers, and letters. The bottom part, where he's using a magnetic stick to move little balls into different slots, seemed a bit complicated.My only real complaint was that the little balls were not packaged in any type of plastic baggie, so during shipping and while I was bringing it inside or moving it around, the balls were rolling around in their little area and making noise. There was no problem with them falling out and disappearing since that part of the toy has a cover, but it was a small noise nuisance.",
