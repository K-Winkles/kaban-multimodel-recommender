                "reviewText": "We have bought this toy for a couple of our nieces and nephews. It always ends up being the toy that all the kids fight over. The train and figures are built well and are just darling! It keeps little ones busy for hours. I love how this has different levels for different ages and has multiple sounds and buttons. If you are looking for a gift for your kiddo, I highly recommend this.",

It's a super sturdy toy and there are even more spots to fit other Little People/animals in the train if your child already has some. We have some of the farm animals so they can also fit in the train too!",
