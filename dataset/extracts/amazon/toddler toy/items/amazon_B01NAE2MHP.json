But Amazon was great as usual. I took her the gifts before Xmas. No way was this remaining unopened til Christmas! The balls come in a bag, which she promptly \"encouraged\" her mom to unzip. The fun was on. They're a great size for small hands and there's a variety of balls included. At one point, all of them was under the sofa. But we played catch and she was soo happy. Insistent too. Also the balls are foam. They won't break anything. That's a definite plus. Then she packed them up and carried them around. Great \ud83d\udc4d item and good seller. You kept your word re: shipping.

I love the size and softness of the balls, he can't hurt himself or things in the house. It is a great value with a bag to keep them in. You won't regret purchasingthese bags as a gift or for agrandson or an granddaughter. I think I will purchase one for my house, because the one I purchased was for my grandson is at my daughter's house.",
