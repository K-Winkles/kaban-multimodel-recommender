They can be repositioned with ease as well. These have been great for my 2 year old in learning to peel and place them himself. He loves looking at the pictures as well as all the \"stickers\" and telling us where to put each one. Some of the \"stickers\" have words on them, and it's obvious these were made by someone whose first and second language wasn't English. My husband and I have had a couple chuckles by the phrases chosen for some of the \"stickers\", but they don't hinder anything. All in all, I totally recommend. These are nice and compact enough to take along to a restaurant or wherever to help keep a little one entertained for a bit.",
