Bought them for my granddaughters and they love drawing pictures and then presses the button so they can start again. They also like the fact that they can lock the picture in place so it can't be erased until they unlock it. The toy is lightweight and travels and packs well. Older children can practise math questions or playing games like tic tac do. Great for in the car or when travelling on planes or trains.",
