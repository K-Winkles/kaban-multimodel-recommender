                "reviewText": "I was a little nervous about this toy. I have an eleven-month-old daughter, and this toy looked very much like something I would have loved as a kid. I also think it's cute as an adult, but I love things that are traditionally associated with femininity. So I was a little worried about getting this and pushing my love of pink and frill onto my baby (which, you know, is kind of not really relevant at this age since all she is doing is trying to eat it, but here I am anyway). But it had the mirror, and my baby loves her visage. So I ordered it, and it's not bad. It has some educational components, (round lipstick, square powder puff, alphabet, etc). It has a couple of modes - singing, pretend, and one other that I can't recall (educational?). It tells her she looks \"marvelous\" and says \"ooo la la\" and stuff like that, which some people may not like because it focuses on external appearance. At this age, obviously, my baby doesn't know WTF the thing is saying, and when she does understand, I think there are worse things in life than having a toy vanity tell you that you look marvelous. It is not an especially annoying toy, either, even when she activates the same song over and over and over and over again. I mean, I'm not going to rush out and buy the album, but it could be much worse. Interestingly, she does not seem overly excited about the mirror. I think it distorts a little bit.Overall, I highly recommend this toy. Very cute, not too annoying, fun for babies and (hopefully because I don't want to have to buy more toys) toddlers.",
