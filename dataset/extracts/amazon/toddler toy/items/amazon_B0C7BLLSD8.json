The talking flash cards alpha pocket came with many cards including different animals, colors, shapes, etc. My grandbaby really enjoys it when it reads what's on the card for her to follow. You can also adjust the volume. It's a perfect size for her to carry it around especially in a long car ride. I recommend this product for toddlers.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a 2 year old granddaughter who loves to practice her talking. She's good at manifesting small objects so is adept at placing the cards in the machine, which then reads the word. She enjoys it for about 10 minutes at a time.I sorted through the cards first, pulling out words that she's not familiar with or words that have different meaning in British English. She plays with about 15 words at a time, and I add a few each session. My hope is that she'll\"accidentally\" learn to recognize the word as well as the picture.It's a nice activity, small enough for the car or a restaurant and well worth the reasonable price.",

It is so easy for me to transport from kid to kid, the sound quality is very good for the price, and it holds a charge for a while so I don\u2019t have to plug it in often since I\u2019m always on the go. One of the parents let me know their daughter is already starting to talk using the flashcards every day. The pictures and variety of items on the cards are very good quality as well, i highly recommend this product to others!",
