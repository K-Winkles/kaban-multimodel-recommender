                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a cute little drum set, I bought it for my 8 month old because he likes his xylophone that he can bang on. He actually plays with it and it will grow with him. But, it plays music in the background as soon as you turn it on and you have to cycle through all the songs to stop the music. That should be the other way around, it should start off no music that you can then turn on. Then when it\u2019s on no music it constantly talks, and when you are drumming it\u2019s makes its own drum sounds. It is a very small drum set which I already knew, but that\u2019s fine because I got it cheap. It does have two options on the back of it for volume which is awesome. It just could have been executed a little better.",
