Your kids will love the fun colors and simple designs of each pipe. These kids' bath toys are great for encouraging imaginative and water-sensory-friendly experiences for babies and toddlers. Five pipe pieces come in this bath toy set that gives toddlers options on how to connect them. Use these toddler toys over and over again thanks to their durable design that is made without BPA.",

                "reviewText": "Cool concept, mediocre engineering. The idea of kids learning fundamentals of waterworks and hydraulic power is awesome, but the execution of this STEM skill is mediocre with this set of toys. The suction cups, well suck...in the worst possible way. They do not stick long and several of the components hang at an awkward angle because of how they are constructed. The pipes don't line up very well and the on the set that I bought, the water mills don't even rotate very well, if at all. My 4 and 6 yo kids still enjoy playing with them but the clumsy design makes the overall experience frustrating inasmuch as it is fun, especially given that the pieces keep falling off of the bathtub/shower walls due to bad suction strength. In sum, a fun bath toy that will entertain your littles for a short period of time before they become frustrated and disinterested. It's not worth the price tag.",

                "reviewText": "Our toddler has always loved the bath, and these tub toys have raised his experience to the next level. He enjoys sticking and un-sticking the suction cups on the side of the tub, pouring water into the tubes, and watching the drips, jets and water mills. If we let him, he would carry them around the house all day, but we prefer they remain a special bathtub plaything. These toys stick securely to the sides of the bathtub and the glossy 4-inch tile of our tub surround.To establish a continuous flow of water and set up a chain reaction in which every tube is activated, you need a patient adult with a bucket and a steady hand or some other kind of reservoir not included with the set. Otherwise, as the water level drops, the jets of water coming out of the bifurcate and J-shaped tubes will change angles, first overshooting and then undershooting the next tube in the series. We used a 2000mL solution bag with attached tubing to get a steady flow. This is more for parental amusement than anything else, as the baby is just as happy to play with each tube one by one.These toys have held up to several weeks of normal toddler play, but it is easy to see how rough handling could damage the tabs that hold the water mills in place. They are lightly built in order to allow the water mills to spin freely. I clean these tubes with the baby's other tub toys in a vinegar soak once a week and let them dry between uses. We have had no problems with mold, residue, or other buildup.These tubes have been great fun for the price.",
