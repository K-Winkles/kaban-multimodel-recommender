                "reviewText": "Ordered these for my 2 year old. First I got the transportation set . The pieces were a bit smaller and the puzzles were challenging at first. He got the hang of it and then I ordered the animal set. The animal set has bigger pieces and the puzzles are a bit easier because of the design. I should have ordered the animal set first because of that since we are just starting to do puzzles now. If you are purchasing for a younger child, I would recommend the animal puzzles first because if these. However he likes all the puzzles regardless. There is a bit of a learning curve with all wood puzzles because they must be clicked together from the top rather than sliding together. I have attached a photo for comparison Would buy again",
