                "reviewText": "This item wasn\u2019t prime so it took a while to arrive, but arrived sooner than their estimated date. Bought it for my baby\u2019s first birthday. He loves trying to figure out how to put the coins in. Mostly he loves pressing the nose and hearing songs he can dance to. The toy is all brightly colored and seems to be well made. The door on it to get coins out is easy enough for my baby to open and close. My only dislike is that half the coins are one size and their other half a just barely smaller. Not really noticeable visually, but when I pick them up, it\u2019s annoying some are smaller. It would have been fun to have the different colors be different sizes. Mostly this is just an annoyance to me, my baby couldn\u2019t care less. It is also so awkward to pick up as an adult. I have small hands so picking it up one handed is just not an option, but even my husband who has large hands says it\u2019s awkward to pick up. We love the toy, it\u2019s not too loud! It doesn\u2019t have any volume options so the sound level it comes with it perfect to me. I love that it teaches fine motor skills as well. A great educational toy!",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching g for a simple toy for my 15 month old.Criteria: Something that would entertain him, provide practice with fine motor skills, and would grow with him developmentally. My son is rough with everything, so another requirement was durability. Things that I wanted to avoid: Anything that was too complicated, came with too many pieces, took up too much space, or required a lot of assistance.Did this toy meet all of my demands?For the most part, yes.Pros: Simple, helps develop fine motor skills, is easy to use, doesn't require additional storage for the coins (they are stored inside of the piggy), talks (counts, sings songs, says phrases), has 2 levels that grow with your baby as they develop, is cute, and doesn't require much assistance.Cons: Tips over easily, slides away while my son attempted to put the coins in the slot. There is no volume control (that I'm aware of).It's a great toy, worth the price, and is cute. I would rate this toy an 8 out of 10. :)At first, he wasn't able to put the coins in the slot. After about 5 or 6 minutes of trying (I demonstrated and assisted him a few times) he figured it out.",
