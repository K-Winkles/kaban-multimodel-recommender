                "reviewText": "This lacing toy is very well made and sturdy. The colors are bright and overall, as an adult, i find it to be visually appealing. With that being said, i decided not to keep it for two reasons. 1. It is pretty heavy and bulky. You can see the thickness of it in the picture and it is solid wood. I was going to pack it as a travel toy, however when you have limited space in your diaper bag, you are forced to be picky about the items you bring. 2. My toddler just didn't seem to care about it, maybe because he is a little too young for it (21 months). We might repurchase when he is older.",
