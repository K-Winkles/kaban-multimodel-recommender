About 46 levels and if your kid pushes any button they'll end up losing within seconds and will be back to resetting the came again and again.The screen lights went off and on after a couple of minutes and after an hour it stopped working. Now they turn on when they want to, and you can't see the score.Kids and adults loved it. It's fun but not worth the price.",
