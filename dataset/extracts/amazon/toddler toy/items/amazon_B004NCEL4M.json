        "description": "Product Description A beloved classic toy gets an exciting new twist with this deluxe pounding bench. As the colorful, non-removable pegs on the bench go up and down, they play peekaboo, taking turns showing their friendly smiles while the child has fun practicing fine motor skills. And you\u2019ll enjoy that because the pegs are attached, they can\u2019t get lost. A sturdy wooden mallet is included. Children delight in striking a peg with the mallet and watching one on the opposite side pop up. Once kids have seen this cause-and-effect in action, they will enjoy predicting which peg will pop up next. As they develop hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, they will also be learning numbers and colors by counting the pegs and naming each color as it pops up. The Melissa & Doug Deluxe Pounding Bench Wooden Toy makes a great gift for kids 2 to 4 years. This product measures 5.25\" H x 10\" L x 5\" W and includes a sturdy wooden mallet. Add the Melissa & Doug Wooden Latches Board to round out the developmental play and learning experience. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.
