The xylophone has an octave of real musical notes and kids can learn to play actual tunes as they get older, or they can just enjoy the colors, pulling the toy, and playing random notes when they are younger, and count the bars a little later. The plastic stick/mallet is attached will a short cord so it is safe. it appears sturdy as most Fisher-Price toys areThis is a toddler toy that remains useful as the child grows, and almost all kids like to play with a xylophone. This one isn't too loud. I haven't opened the packaging completely so I don't know if a simple set of tunes is included or not, but hopefully it is as in the past. The product info does not mention one, though, so maybe not.One tune I still recall from decades ago goes (numbered from lowest to highest notes): 1-2-3-1, 1-2-3-1, 3-4-5, 3-4-5. 5-6-5-4-3-1, 5-6-5-4-3-1, 8-5-8, 8-5-8.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is one of the most traditional toys that still entertain babies and toddlers in 2021. It\u2019s also very inexpensive and doesn\u2019t require batteries. My grandson is a year old and his face lights up every time he bangs on this. The string that attaches the stick is a catch 22. It\u2019s great because you don\u2019t have to worry about losing the stick. However, it\u2019s a little short and makes some of the notes hard to play. But I get if it were too much longer it could possibly be a choking hazard and it could rap around a babies neck. Also, he bangs on this with anything (and I mean anything) he can find and it works so you don\u2019t necessarily have to use the stick. It also has wheels on it so sometimes he just slides it across the room. I would absolutely recommend everyone getting their baby one of these. It\u2019s fun and educational, super inexpensive, and very practical. This is honestly one of his favorite toys and he has so many that do so much more Lighting up in craziness. But there is something to be said about the simplicity of this toy.",

The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a xylophone. Another good aspect of this is that he can pull it as he goes room to room. Highly recommend! Hours of fun!",

I opted on sticking with fisher price and I am glad I did. Maybe a little different materials but still designed with longevity in mind. Great quality. I hope my boy loves his and still has it 50 years from now",
