She was super engaged with them and used them right away.The keys are all different and match with the car lock with the same number.The cars are all different kinds of vehicles, too which is super fun. Police car, fire truck, taxi, ice cream truck, etc. The wheels on them work, too, so they can be used just as toy cars!The locks are easy to open and close, too. So far, none of them have stuck or anything.They\u2019re good sized, too. We can actually put the locks on different things to make it more engaging.Very great for counting, number recognition, and reading the spelling of the numbers. Good problem solving toy.All in all, these are super cute and very fun. Might get these again as a gift for my friends\u2019 kids.",

                "reviewText": "3yo on the spectrum loves counting and repetitive tasks...I mean...it clicks open, and they are cars, and he can count the dots and read the numbers and find the numbers on the key ring, and it's a hit with him. It's a calming sort of task that I won't let him do all day, but it is good for manual dexterity too. I wish I had found these when he needed more manual dexterity training, it might have been more useful than just entertaining, they're cool. My one concern is the paint seems likely to chip...been keeping them from baby because I don't want her chewing on them because of the paint and wheels. I don't think I would recommend for any child who chews on stuff in all honesty, imo.",
