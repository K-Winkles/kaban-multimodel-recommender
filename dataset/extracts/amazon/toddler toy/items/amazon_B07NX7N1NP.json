We have had these for a few months now. These give them the perfect opportunity for creativity on car rides or to practice writing. They are a medium size which is perfect for the car. Not too small where they can still draw/write enough, but not too big to where it takes up too much car space when they are not in use. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Updated review 5/31/23- I originally rated this product with 3 stars due to the choking hazard and used state of the product. Shortly after posting my review, the company acknowledged my concerns, refunded my money, and ensured that my concerns would be addressed. They were very attentive and were very helpful. Because of the great customer service I have increased my rating to 4 stars due to the stellar customer service.I just received this product yesterday with the intention of putting it in my son's Easter basket so he would have it for our upcoming 6-hour road trip. Immediately upon opening the package, something fell out and I realized that the magnet on one of the shape pieces had fallen off. I was able to stick it back on but will go back and superglue it before giving to my son to ensure it doesn't fall off when he is using it since that is a definite choking hazard.The screen appeared to be used but after a few slides of the eraser it came \"mostly\" clean. The colors are not as bright as advertised and and are more of a dull shade. I like that it came with a travel bag and that the pen is attached to the board by a string to keep it from getting lost. The magnet design pieces just slide into designated holes and are otherwise not attached. I will most likely just remove those until my son gets older due to the choking hazard listed above and to prevent them from getting lost.Overall, this is a pretty cheap product, both in cost and quality so I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't feel comfortable gifting this due to the questionable quality.",
