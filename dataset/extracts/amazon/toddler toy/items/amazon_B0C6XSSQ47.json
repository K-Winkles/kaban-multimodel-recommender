                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these products for my toddlers, four and three years old, to have as a handheld fidget toy for when we leave the house (i.e. grocery shopping, or running errands). The idea was to keep them occupied while I shopped or made my runs but it didn\u2019t work. My son, the three year old, is on the spectrum but this toy didn\u2019t do it for him. It could be that he\u2019s still too young or he could just have zero interest. My daughter enjoys it more with making different shapes and figures. Either way, this only captures both of their attention for a brief (really brief) moment. It\u2019s super durable though and it maneuvers well, just not enough excitement for my little ones.",

But unfortunately it was very difficult for him to be able to work, which was disappointing due to the age being 3+. My niece whos 12 couldnt figure it out. It also has a high pitched squeak, and he freaks out. He only played with it 3 or 4 times. And hasn't touched it since. Very sad purchase.",
