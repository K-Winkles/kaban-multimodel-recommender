                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My son is obsessed with cars, but I want him to learn more animals. This book is a fun way to learn about animals and fun sounds they make. This was on sale when I bought it so definitely worth the price!mI like the fact that the sound volume can be adjusted and there\u2019s Spanish version if you want to teach them Spanish.Only minor thing I don\u2019t like about this book is that the animal pictures are not consistent and it can be confusing for babies or toddler because some animals look super realistic and some just looks like a clipart.",
