They are speedy little things and work well on all surfaces. They are extremely durable, we were running them into walls, furniture, dogs, ect and they just kept going. I have not had to replace the batteries in them yet. All in all I was very impressed with this purchase and highly recommend.",

Bought it for my 2.5 year old for Christmas and she loves driving them all over the house! Fun for parents too! I can see our family keeping these around for many years and I highly recommend. Note: these do not work well on carpet and do not work at all on heavy/thick carpet. Best on hard floors. Requires a decent amount of batteries but it\u2019s so worth it. Provides a lot of entertainment. They have fallen down a short flight of 6 stairs a few times and they still work.",

                "reviewText": "These cars were a ton of fun for our 3 year old grandsons!! They both could race each other. The cars moved smoothly and were easy to operate, but had lots of fun things to do like buttons to press for fun sounds, backward and forwards or go in a circle (the kids loved that), and little people to ride in them! Not too loud to be annoying either. Took lots of batteries, 10 total for the 2 cars and their controllers, but they lasted throughout the kids trip so a number of hours solid use. Stood up to 3 year old boys tossing them around too. A really fun toy that one or two kids can play with and race each other. Ran on all surfaces, wood, low carpet, and even bumpy terrain.",

                "reviewText": "Original review : I bought this item so that each of my two grandchildren could have their own toy to play with. Unfortunately, only one car works. This has caused a massive amount of arguing and fighting!!!Updated review : A few days after I posted the original review (see above), the seller reached out to me regarding the issue I had with the cars. He/she informed me that a new set of cars would be sent to my grandchildren. Today my son notified me that the new cars had arrived, and both cars work great. Both kids love them and are very happy.",

                "reviewText": "Our 4 and 6 year old use these. They are durable! The on off switch on each car is great. They sing and talk. Remind me of bumper cars. They run on carpet, but of course not fast. Every other flooring, they are quick on. Batteries last in the cars and remotes. Police office and racer don't come out of the car. Bright colors. Super fun for their first remote control cars.",

I decided to purchase for my son for Christmas and they didn\u2019t even last one week before they started to malfunction. One doesn\u2019t work at all and the other only spins circles. For the amount of money spent, I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re worth it since they don\u2019t last. Too bad everything is made in China and complete junk nowadays.",
