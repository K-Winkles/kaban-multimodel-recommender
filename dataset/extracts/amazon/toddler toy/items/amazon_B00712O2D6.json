                "reviewText": "My husband purchased this as a Christmas gift for my then 10 month old daughter. She has shape sorting toys but isn't quite big enough to comprehend those yet. This toy allowed her to learn a couple of motor skills, such as pushing the balls through the holes with her hands and clanking two together to make a noise. This may sound silly but the rubber piece that holds the balls into place prevents the balls from falling through obviously so she has time to make the connection that they need force to move. With the toy being wooden it is sturdy enough for her to safely lean on as well. She also pulls the musical piece underneath out on her own now and taps it. I love that she still has time to grow with this to learn how to use the rubber mallet to play music and tap the balls as well. There isn't too much going on with this, no crazy extra noises or distractions. It's a quality gift that will last until we are done having children.",

                "reviewText": "He LOVES this. So many fun things he can do. The only reason I took away one star was because the green ball slot is just a little too large, and sometimes the ball just falls through on it's own. But the wooden balls are amazing - he loves to hit them together and hammer them or push them through onto the xylophone. He also loves sliding the xylophone in and out. Great toy!",

Anschlie\u00dfend wurden die Kugeln von Hand durchgedr\u00fcckt und das Xylophon wurde entdeckt. Auch nach 3 Monaten wird immer noch gerne damit gespielt, es kann einzeln mit dem hammerspiel und dem Xylophon gespielt werden oder in Kombination.Ich kann das Spielzeug sehr empfehlen und es geh\u00f6rt zu unseren Top Must have Spielzeugen.",
