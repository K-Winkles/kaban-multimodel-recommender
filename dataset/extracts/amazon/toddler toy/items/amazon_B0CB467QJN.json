A lot of the musical toys become annoying when they're pressed over and over and over again. This worked perfectly! The toy is pretty sturdy, since it's made of wood. The switches and buttons feel like good quality. There is one item on the switchboard that makes noise, but it's a bird chirping, so I don't mind it. The only two drawbacks I've had so far are that it's a little heavy (if he throws it, I definitely hear it) and he leaves some of the switches on which would drain the battery if I don't turn them off. I would definitely purchase again.",

Playing with the buttons to find out it vibrates or makes bird noises, switching the switches and turning on the different coloured lights. It's an excellent problem-solving toy for small children. Their inquisitive minds will wonder what happens when they touch all the buttons, and with this product, they actually are allowed to touch them.Toy does seem a little delicate. It can handle minor drops, such as the height of little hands to the floor, but I suspect anything from about table height might be iffy. The product is securely sealed, so if anything internally was knocked loose there would be no way to access it.Even with those minor concerns, I'm very happy with this purchase. Very creative product and great alternative to the kids staring at a screen.",

                "reviewText": "Our 20-month-old loves lamp switches. My wife and I know this not because we let him play with light switches, but because we keep having to keep him away from them whenever we try and give him some extra run-around space in the house. I'd heard about toys like these and thought that if we gave him his own light switch to play with, that could distract him from the potentially dangerous stuff. This particular model offered by this particular manufacturer (POLKRANE) was the only one I could find which didn't have a lot of reviews complaining about parts falling out, so I went with this one.It looks and feels pretty sturdy, and the lights and switches seem pretty secure in their seats. As far as safety is concerned, I'm satisfied.But, only two of the three lights work. There's a lamp switch, a dial switch, and a push switch. The push switch and dial switch work just fine, but the lamp switch doesn't do anything. I'm not sure if the switch is bad or the bulb, or both, or if there's some kind of break in the circuit between the two, but regardless, it's broken. This was THE PART we were most excited for, so we immediately considered sending it back.But, the kid had already gotten hold of it and really, really loved it. Turns out he wasn't so much interested in turning our lamps on as much as he was in the clicking noise the switch makes. The switch on the toy still clicks, and he doesn't KNOW it's supposed to do more than that, so he's thrilled.Since he likes it so much my wife and I would feel like awful parents for taking it away, sending it back, and making him wait for a new one. He doesn't understand it's broken, he'd only know that mama and papa took his new favorite toy away for no reason. So, I guess we're stuck with it.This toy gets three stars for being safe, sturdy, and at least more than half-way functional, and a fourth star because our kid likes it so much and it is distracting him from more dangerous electricals. But I can't say we'll be buying another POLKRANE toy, not unless their quality control improves.",

The switches, lights and keys were so much fun to play with.the 1 year old\u2019s five and three-year-old siblings love the board as well and had a great time playing with it.I hardly ever write Amazon reviews, but when I came back to the product page to buy another one for my 18 month, old nephew, I decided to leave one. Quality product!!!",

                "reviewText": "My 16 month old is obsessed with light switches, cords, and remotes so I thought a toy like this might be a hit with him. The first time he played with it, it lasted for about 30 minutes, which is probably a record for him and one toy; usually he gets bored after a few minutes with one toy. Unfortunately, the little peg on the plug already broke off after the first time playing with it and a day later, one of the light circuits seems to be faulty as it doesn't turn on consistently unless I jiggle the switch. For $30 I would have liked it to last a little longer without issues, but the concept is cool. I would recommend that they replace the plug with a key and lock instead as that might be a bit more durable, and that they screw on the back of the toy instead of gluing it on so that if a circuit breaks, we can open the back and replace it if we want to. Then the battery pack can go there as well and there's more room on the front for an additional mechanism instead of the yellow and black box that takes up so much space. Just my two cents!",
