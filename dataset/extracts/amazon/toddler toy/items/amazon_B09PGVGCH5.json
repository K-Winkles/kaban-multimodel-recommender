                "reviewText": "We purchased the book for my 19 month old who loves Bluey. Immediately after opening the box she was asking to play with it. We filled the paint brush with water and she knew exactly what to do. She was so excited to see her favorite characters appear in color and find the hidden animals throughout the page. It didn\u2019t take long for the book to become one of her favorite toys.We initially purchased the book for an upcoming trip because of the small size and easy cleanup. The only downside is that some of the colors start to bleed through overtime, so don\u2019t expect it to last forever. Overall we are very happy with the purchase and will look to buy more of the aqua art books.",
