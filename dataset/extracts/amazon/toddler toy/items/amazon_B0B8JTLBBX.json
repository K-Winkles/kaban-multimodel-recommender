They're very cute, small, and they light up when they touch the water and they stop lighting up when they're dry. Unfortunately, they didn't last very long, they varied -some lasted a couple of weeks and Some lasted over a month but they all died. Apparently, the batteries can't be replaced and now they're just plastic toys --which would have been great if they started out that way, but she expects a lot more now. They are a disappointment to her.Pro tip, dry them off and don't put them on a damp surface so they don't light up when the kids not using them and the battery will last a little longer.",

First thing that I realized when we opened was one didn\u2019t even light up to start, and after using 3 times 4 more do not light up. We only currently have one light up but who knows how much longer that one\u2019s gonna work for. Would not recommend.",
