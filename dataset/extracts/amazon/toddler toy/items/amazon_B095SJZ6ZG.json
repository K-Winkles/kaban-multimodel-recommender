                "reviewText": "This busy book is awesome! Excellent quality. You do have to individually place each Velcro sticker, very easy, somewhat time consuming but you know that before you buy. Would be 5 stars if it were a complete set. We are missing the number cards. Like other reviewers we got 2 sets of holiday cards instead. Hopefully they can replace the numbers, too late to scan, print and laminate myself as the Velcro stickers are on. Would check the entire set before you sit down to put together. Overall great book, perfect for ASD toddler!",

As simple as putting a velcro dot on the back on the cards and a clear velcro dot on the specified spots in the workbook. The clear velcro dot let's the pictures in the book remain clear. Each page is laminated with dry erase compatible material, so you can wipe away any marks from tracing practice. I am contemplating getting getting 2 more so the girls stop fighting over it!",
