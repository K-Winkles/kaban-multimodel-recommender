                "reviewText": "I can tell you I definitely was not expecting to love this little learning activity backpack as much as I do!It's small, but mighty and is so soft! My two year old daughter loves this backpack. She takes it almost every time we leave the house. We rotate out her favorite books, toys, and stuffed animals. It can fit a decent amount of stuff depending on what you're using it for. I added a picture for context.I love all the busy things it offers for her to fiddle with as well. It's the perfect size for her frame, not too small and not big.Also, she got food on it and I didn't realize it until the next day and it wiped clean! I don't know how it might do with liquids, but I was impressed how well it cleaned up from her other messes.Would definitely recommend!",

I can fit a change of clothes, a couple of diapers and a new pack of wipes inside, along with quite a few little toys, such as crayons and mini activity books, a bubble popper, and a few more hand-held travel activities. The entire bag is made of soft fabric that feels like it could easily be cleaned. I haven\u2019t had to clean ours yet but it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be too difficult. The top of the bag zips and can Velcro shut which is nice having both options. I highly recommend this bag to anyone with a toddler or child. I\u2019ve already recommended it to a few of my family members and friends.",

Lots of fine motor skills can be learned so it can grow with your toddler. Plus it\u2019s a fun way to bring along their favorite toys and doubles as a short-trip diaper bag",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a busy book for my 14 month old\u2019s first plane ride. I might have overlooked this backpack except the reviews were so good, and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t! I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting from this busy backpack, but this far exceeded my expectations, & my daughter LOVES it! The material feels much more quality & durable than I was expecting. The size is probably my favorite thing. It\u2019s small & can sit in the grocery cart seat with my daughter, but we can fit a book, a toy, her cup, a snack, and a diaper easily in it. At home she drags it around with her putting stuff in & taking it out. Great buy!",

Great for on the go to keep the little ones occupied and teach life skills.
