                "reviewText": "Like i said in my title this toy is decent. Its not awful nor is it anything amazing. One thing I dislike about this toy is that it is very un sturdy. My son is about 8.5 months old he can pull himself up onto toys, the couch ect. Hes started to walk when holding onto tables and such so i figured I would buy him a toy to help him walk better. I walked at 8 months so I figured why not. This toy is a cheap plastic and isn't very sturdy the wheels are a very light hollow plastic. The toy isn't heavy in the least bit so if your child tries pulling them self up on it when it is in walker mode I will put money on it that this toy will fall over onto them because I have seen this happen multiple times. Now when it is in sitting mode that is another story. This toy is actually very nice to ride my niece rides it and shes almost three and it works for her when shes trying to show my son what to do. All in all.... i guess if your looking for a toy that can be changed from a sit and ride to a stand and ride this is an ok toy. But DO NOT expect this toy to be amazing. you will be disappointed. If your are simply looking for a toy they can stand and walk on. Pick another toy.",
