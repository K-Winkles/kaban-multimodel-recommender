The smiles from this little guy were heart warming. He immediately got the hang of it and could rock this little horse. His 3 year old sister wanted to ride it too. She really rocked this horse hard and it did not tip over. I am a huge fan of Little Tikes products. I will purchase them over any other comparable product because I trust their designs and durability.",
