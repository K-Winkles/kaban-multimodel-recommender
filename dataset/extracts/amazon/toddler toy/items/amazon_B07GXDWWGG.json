                "reviewText": "Our son's pediatrician recommended we buy him a toy doctor kit to work on doctor's office anxiety. He's still a little too much of a busy body to really focus on playing doctor, which is understandable at 2 years old. Nevertheless, he has a good idea on how to use each piece. He has a lot of fun packing everything into the bag that comes with this set, running around the living room, and then dumping it back out. He loves using the stethoscope and thermometer. Everyone and everything gets their \"temperature\" taken multiple times a day. We chose this set because we liked the variety of \"tools\" and we're very happy with our decision. This would make a fun gift for any kid.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Comparison To Old Kit",
                "reviewText": "Back when I was younger, 70s-80's, my siblings & I had one of these kits & we loved it so when I had my son in ' 97' the Fisher Price doctor kit was on my to buy list when he got a little older. This review is a comparison between the kit I bought my son in '99' & the new kit I just bought for my almost 3yr old niece.1. The kit I bought my son has held up for 22yrs of play between my son, his friends, my friends kids that I have babysat for over the years & all my nieces and nephews. This new set I just bought does not in any way seem like it will hold up for more then 2-3yrs before needing to be replaced.2. Carrying Bag/Box: I have to admit I'm torn on which one of these is better. The bag easier to get things in & out of because even after 22yrs the box is still hard to open & close for little ones, however the box has the cute dry erase chart on the front for kids to check things off as they make sure your not sick. So for now I'm going to use the bag but when my niece gets a little older I plan to bring the box back out.3. Blood Pressure Band: I am loving the larger band in the new set as it's much easier to get on, the pressure box is a bit dull & boring though & I'm pretty sure if it gets stepped on by an adult accidentally it will break. The older version band is sooo small & can barely fit on a child's lower arm but the pressure box spins inside and is just a bit more interesting then the newer one. Also, I have stepped on it many times over the years & the most that happens is my foot gets hurt so I might just let my niece pick which one she prefers.4. Thermometer: This is the real reason I bought this kit, to upgrade from a mouth thermometer to a forehead one. With the pandemic the last thing I want is kids taking turns putting this thing in their mouth or my niece putting it in her mouth & then trying to get me to let her take my temp & vis versa. The older one is sturdier then the new one but both are cute. For now the new one will go in the bag & the old one inside the box & into a storage bin.5. Eye and Ear: I prefer the older one because it has a piece of hard, clear plastic in the middle to make looking thru it better and is WAY more durable in feel. The new one feels like it will shatter the first time it is stepped on.6. Band-aid and Shot: Both items are comparable in both sets. The new band-aid is slightly smaller then the older one but it's just barely noticeable. I am putting both band-aids in the bag and the old shot because I like the look of the old one better.7. Stethoscope: The new stethoscope is horrid!! The ear buds are HUGE & that's saying a lot because they have always on the larger side. I remember the set I had as a kid didn't fit in our ears & my sons stethoscope buds are to large to fit in the ear also. The new one has no sound to it were as the old one did. The one I had as a kid & my sons you could hear a heart beat with, it wasn't super strong sound but you could hear it. Even with the foam padding disintegrating, due to age, you can still make a out light heart beat sound. The way the upper part of the new ones curve in at the top part also adds to problems of keeping the Stethoscope in the ears. Like some other reviewers said they did I went & bought a real toddler stethoscope. I do plan to re-add foam to the old sets stethoscope because that piece is the one the kids fight over so having 2 were a heart beat can be heard would be nicer. The new set stethoscope will go in the box and into storage. In the end I like the older Fisher Price doctors kit more then the newer one. The quality of the newer set is just not there & seems to be designed to break within a few years or the first time an adult steps on it by accident. I know they design the ear buds on the stethoscope to be large enough that if a kid pulls them off another they're not being pulled out of the ear just off & so kids can't stuff them up there nose but the new buds are just much to large and to flat. The newer shot & thermometer are the sturdiest part of this set & that's not saying a whole lot. If you have or can find an older set I'd say that would be a better use of money then buying this new set. The foam in most older sets is probably gone, which is a turn off, but you can replace it or just buy a working stethoscope for children(the one I bought was only $7).",
