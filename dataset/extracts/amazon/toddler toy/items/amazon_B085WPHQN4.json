It rips when you're trying to take out the painting, even if only minutes after putting paint on it. It's just poor quality paper. The item itself is great though, however it's somewhat of a high price to pay when you have to go out and buy your own paper. I'll attach a pic of the original paper and you'll see warping on it. And I'll attach a few pics my son did with paper i provided while using this item. Do not regret my purchase, but do wish better paper came with it.",

It\u2019s easy to clean and feels secure when closed BUT the paper rips so if you wanted to keep what you made it\u2019s impossible. The paper ripped apart just a few minutes after trying to open it back up after using. am going to try a different paper :)",
