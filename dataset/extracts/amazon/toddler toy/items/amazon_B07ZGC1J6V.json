                "reviewText": "Getting my toddler to graduate from the baby tub into the adult tub was a challenge. So getting water toys that can be place in the tub would make my job easier as well as the transition for him. Well it certainly worked. Thank God! And thanks to this bath toys for kids. If you need help to make the transition smooth or even to make bath time fun, this is definitely the toy to get. The only downside is the one I got doesn't function properly. One of the suction cups keep sliding down no matter how much I've moved it around. I don't think it's all of them. Just the one I happen to have gotten. I would still buy it again though. Thank you Water Toys for Kids!!!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter-in-law wanted new toys for my granddaughter that would be less prone to mold or mildew like some of the other bath toys she had that got water in them and couldn't dry out properly and got mold build up inside. This toy is mice because it mounts to the tub wall, has proper drainage and nothing to trap in water. The colors are bright and my granddaughter likes the interactive toy and has fun with it. I recommend this bath toy. I had to buy one for our house now for her to play with the next time I've got her overnight again. She'll be happy. Once she outgrows it, my grandson that arrives in May will be able to play with it when he's old enough. It's a solid toy, also. Nothing has fallen off of the one at their house yet and my 2 year old granddaughter tests her toys at times because that's what kids do. They said she lives it and that was my hope when I bought it before.",
