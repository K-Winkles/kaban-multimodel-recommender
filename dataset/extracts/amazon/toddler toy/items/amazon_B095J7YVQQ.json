They\u2019re good quality and it was quick shipping. Worth the money for us!",

Very durable as my son plays quite rough and he even bites these & there are no marks! The bottoms have a brown \u201czebra\u201d texture for gripping on carpet/rugs which is great if you have a wild little one. The size is wonderful as they\u2019re big enough to play on, but don\u2019t take up too much room. They\u2019re great to stack in the corner when not being played with. My son LOVES these and plays with them daily. My husband & I can even sit on them & they do not give way or collapse. Great for the whole family.",
