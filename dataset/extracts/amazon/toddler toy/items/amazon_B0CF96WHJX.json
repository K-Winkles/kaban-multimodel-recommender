We try to steer clear of those types of toys. This little remote is awesome!!! It has gentle noises and simple song tones (not entire songs). It only makes the brief sound when the button is pushed (cause and effect!!) There are no overstimulating flashing lights (no lights at all actually). When you push the numbers it actually says the numbers (educational) and it does so in a normal humans voice. I swear to you, if they made other items, just like this, I would buy all of them. Simple toys that aren\u2019t overstimulating and obnoxious need to make a come back. This is it!",
