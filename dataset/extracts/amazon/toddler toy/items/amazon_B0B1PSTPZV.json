The music worked and the little spinner thing spun but no bubbles came out. I was super disappointed but then my husband noticed that when I screwed on the little backing after I had put the batteries on, it wasn't 100000% flush. Once I finally got the plastic backing flush and the screws in, the bubbles came out just fine and my son loves it. If you aren't getting bubbles, I'd first check that the plastic backing is on just right before returning.",
