This swt has several animals with three pieces (a head, body and accessory) so they can lean how to begin sewing one piece on to another. The colors are beautiful, the quality of the laces is very good (the ends are sturdy so they lace through the holes well). My daughter was immediately attracted to the cuteness of the animals.

Activity skills of a child can be gradually improved as we can do many things using one product. The young kids can just match two pieces appropriately to form the desired animal shape. Then they can use the lacing technique to join two pieces. It's pretty interesting for the young minds to join two pieces by sewing using laces. Also, it includes accessories for each animal like bone etc as a surprise element. It kindles the child's innovative skills. It's very colorful and very much attractive for the children. Its lightweight , easy to carry to go activity. It's very sturdy and durable",

                "reviewText": "Our daughter's eye Dr. recommended we get her some sewing cards for Vision Therapy at home. Poking the strings in and out of the holes works on depth perception and other areas that her eyes are weak in. After reviewing several sewing cards I chose these because they were affordable, small in size for easy storage, and sturdy. There is also an added challenge to the cards because you have to \"sew\" the top of the card to the bottom. This step takes some coordination but is great for an added challenge. My daughter is 7 so these cards are perfect for her. Younger ages may require some help from the parent.",

I had gotten some from target dollar spot a while ago and they were cardboard and started to bend and break. These are sturdy, come with lots of different clothes, and are perfect for quiet time while her little twin siblings are sleeping! She actually said \u201cthank you so much mom!\u201d When I handed it to her she was very excited. I think the quality exceeds the price\u2014 This is not a paid review and not sponsored in any way\u2014 just glad to find an affordable product that\u2019s good quality to keep my girl\u2019s hands busy!",
