                "reviewText": "My 18 month old loves this. It is the perfect first ride on toy. The wheels aren\u2019t going to turn or anything like that with a steering wheel. But, it\u2019s easy to assemble. Easy for them to get on and off. He loves all the little extra toys on it and that the seat can hide stuff! I don\u2019t think you can beat it for the price. When shopping for a ride on toy, I came across a lot of them that were way more expensive than this. I\u2019m so happy that I went with something like this. It doesn\u2019t have any automated noises or need batteries but it still has fun toys and my som is super interested in them. A Total win in my book. My kiddo played with it almost all day long.",

This car only goes in a straight line, which makes it hard for our child to actually ride this and turn corners.#2 The little seat cover opens, but it opens towards the steering wheel and therefore doesn't stay open, which frustrates the toddler when he wants it to stay open so he can put toys inside it.Otherwise very cute, not too big or bulky. No assembly required.Shipped properly.",
