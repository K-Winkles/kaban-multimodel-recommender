                "reviewText": "These LOOK like they'd be much higher quality than they actually are. I expected them to be similar to Green Toys USA due to their colors etc, but they are pretty poor quality. My 2 year old can easily squish the small turquoise castle tops, and the shovels are barely strong enough to dig through sand without bending (the shovel and rake are basically useless). The dump trucks wheels don't turn at all. The light green bucket is much smaller than I expected (pictured next to a \"normal sized\" yellow bucket I got from a grocery store which doesn't look as nice but feels much stronger!). My daughter still likes to play with all of it, and despite the flimsiness the castle tops are a nice touch for building sand castles.",
