                "reviewText": "As a mother of a 2-year-old with mild speech delay, I've had the pleasure of trying out this product, and I must say it has been a wonderful addition to our learning and playtime routine. First and foremost, the variety of learning content in this set is impressive. It covers a wide range of themes, including alphabet, numbers, shapes, colors, and flags. It's fantastic to have so much educational material in one place. Additionally, they've made a smart move by removing uncommon objects, making it more suitable for preschool learners.This versatility ensures that it will grow with your child as their learning needs evolve.What I appreciate most is how easy it is for my toddler to use. You simply place the card into the card reader's slot, and it will pronounce the words, which is an excellent way to engage their budding language skills. Inserting animal or transport cards produces real sounds, adding an interactive and immersive element to the learning process. The repeat button is a great feature as well, allowing my child to practice pronunciation and sound effects. This is particularly helpful for reducing screen time and keeping my child away from mobile phones and tablets, which is a constant concern in our family.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for 4 year old niece. She is pretty smart and learning to read. She got the biggest kick out of device saying insert a card. She played with it some, but I think I liked it more than she did. I still recommend this as it is great for learning. I think it is something an adult can play with a child turning it into a game while they learn. It was great value for the money. Kids are unpredictable the old \"they played with the box\" not the toy can happen at any time, she liked it as much as any other toy. I noticed that the kids don't play with anything very long except their tablets. She will sit and watch videos on her tablet for hours. Other toys are a few minutes and on to the next.",

Cards are easy to bend, so they do need assistance. Hope there are more cards to add. Easy to take to stores or restaurants to keep them occupied.",
