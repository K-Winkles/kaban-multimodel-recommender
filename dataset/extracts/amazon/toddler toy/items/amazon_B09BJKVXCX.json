The best thing about this toy is that they\u2019re magnet so if the letter is backwards then it won\u2019t stick together so then the child will learn the proper direction of the letters. My son has started throwing the cars and they still look amazing. The quality of this toy is commendable. They also come in a cute container to house the toy when not in use.
