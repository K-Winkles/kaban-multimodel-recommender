                "reviewText": "!From the moment I turned it on, it became an instant hit with everyone in the family.The toy's design is adorable, with a cute cactus character that dances and bobs along to the rhythm of the music. Its funny expressions and movements add a touch of charm, making it an entertaining companion for kids and adults alike.The mimicking feature of the toy is where the real fun begins. The cactus repeats what you say in a comical voice, often with a hilarious twist. We've had countless laughing fits as the toy mimicked our words and added unexpected phrases, creating moments of pure joy and amusement.The talking feature is a fantastic addition, as the cactus can interact with us in different ways. It responds to various sounds and phrases, keeping us entertained for hours. Watching it react to our jokes, songs, and silly noises is incredibly entertaining and never gets old.The only minor drawback is that the toy's volume might be a bit too loud for some people. While it adds to the fun, it would have been nice to have an adjustable volume option for quieter environments.",

                "reviewText": "It worked for a couple hours and then stopped. With brand new batteries. It would turn on but I couldn\u2019t even get it to play the music it came with. It could barely pick up my voice when it did work, unless I was practically yelling 6 inches from it. I regret buying it. It wasn\u2019t working nearly as well as videos portrayed it to, even when it was actually \u201cworking\u201d.Update: After I had posted my original review, the seller reached out to me and offered to replace it. I figured why not? I\u2019d give it one more chance, and if the second one didn\u2019t work I was completely done. Well, they replaced it and it showed up pretty quickly. The new one works perfectly! The kids absolutely love this thing. I would say it\u2019s definitely worth it when it works properly!",

                "reviewText": "As a gift for a child, it's cool, but it doesn't last long. Firstly, if your child spends a lot of time with you, then believe me, this gift will drive you crazy very quickly, since the child will use it for everything, including to make you angry. So think carefully about whether you need it. Secondly, when the excitement passes, the child will throw this toy away, and then the batteries that remain in the toy will leak over time, since you forget to take them out, and after that, after 6-8 months you will remember about this toy but with leaking batteries you will have a problem with the operation of this toy. And most likely you will throw away this toy. However, maybe if your child loves to sing then maybe he or she might like this toy.",
