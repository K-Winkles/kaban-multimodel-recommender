                "reviewText": "First the only negative it comes already talking and singing in the box cuz it has no off switch. Sure it comes with the batteries but y they are installed is insanely weird. Poor delivery people. If you are buying for you child you would not surprise them if they hear it when it's delivered. The power button is pretend as shown in ad and it makes diff sounds depending on up or down switchNow it is exactly the size described. It's an early learning toy so I think it's perfect for those just starting to walk. The colors are great. It has a typically annoying voice that kids love and parents tolerate. I think it's adorable and a great value.",

The songs are catchy but not annoying like some other unnamed toys have. Great for the early walkers and the kiddos who love the vacuums!",

A bit disappointing; I thought there'd be an actual vacuum noise as they move it around (vs jingles, but maybe I misread the description). It doesn't stand up and is a bit on the smaller side.",

Manchmal tanzt er dazu, oft macht er ihn garnicht an und schiebt ihn immer flei\u00dfig hinter mir her \ud83d\ude42Er liebt das Ger\u00e4t und kann es kaum erwarten mit mir zu saugen.
