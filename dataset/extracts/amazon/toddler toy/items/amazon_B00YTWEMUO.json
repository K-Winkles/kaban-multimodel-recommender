She continued to gravitate toward it all that day out of the plethora of stuffed animals, games, and toys. A bit large and has a unique shape so we threw it in a reusable drawstring gift bag instead of trying to wrap it.We're about a month in and she still loves it.So much joy from such a simple toy.Took less than 10 minutes to assemble, it was very easy and intuitive to put together. You'll just need a screw driver.Durable and sturdy. Daughter is about 33 lbs and has used it regularly without causing damage or injury to herself. It has become a permanent fixture in our family room.",

This is a nostalgic toy for me. I remember having one when I was a kid. I can't wait to see her reaction and see her play with it! I'm sure my 9 year old niece will want to play with it as well.It was fairly easy to put together. You do need a Philips screw driver for the 3 screws and it takes 3 AAA batteries in the bottom cuz it does play music. Highly recommend this toy!",

I have a 2 1/2 year old great nephew, and knew this was the gift for him (well, one of the gifts, because who am I kidding - that kid is worth it!). It was really adorable to watch him sit on it and figure out how to get himself to spin - love that he can enjoy something I loved so much as a kid!",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe das Wirbelwind Karussell auf Grund der positiven Bewertungen gekauft. Und ich muss sagen, es lohnt sich, auf die Bewertungen zu h\u00f6ren :)Mein 2,5 j\u00e4hriger Enkel hat den Sinn bereits kurzer Zeit erkannt und war sehr begeistert. Er ist immer wieder auf das Karussell gestiegen und hat gedreht, was das Zeug h\u00e4lt. Er hat dann noch einige andere Positionen ausprobiert, z. B. hat er sich auf den Bauch gelegt und sich mit den H\u00e4nden vom Boden abgesto\u00dfen.Es ist ein mega tolles Spielzeug, was ich nur empfehlen kann. Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis ist auch super. Das einzige Manko ist, dass die Melodie etwas eint\u00f6nig ist, da sie sehr kurz immer wieder die selbe Frequenz spielt. Vorteil ist aber, dass man die Musik auch ausstellen kann und das Karussell trotzdem funktioniert.Ich vergebe die volle Punktzahl von 5 *",
