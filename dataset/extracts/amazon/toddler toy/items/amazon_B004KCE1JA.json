                "reviewText": "4 stars instead of 5 because the company didn't include the right number of screws to attach the handles. I managed to attached the handle with the longer screw that was provided, but sits a little funny, and I'm not sure how long it'll hold properly. It shipped fast, but the box was torn which I suppose is a post office problem. My son is 4.5 yrs old and has autism, he seeks pressure/input to his arms a lot so I figured this would be a good purchase. I like the size, it doesn't take up much room, it takes some muscle to pull for a little kid, but that's what my son needs. It's nice & sturdy feeling too which is nice, the price was definitely reasonable for the product. My son has used some of the other fitness equipment this company makes (bike, treadmill, elliptical) and is a little more excited about those than this. Wish the feet pedals were a little higher up or adjustable since my son has a hard time using properly, but he'll grow into it soon enough.",
