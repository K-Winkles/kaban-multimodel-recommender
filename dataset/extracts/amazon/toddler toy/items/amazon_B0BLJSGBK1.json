Often you can only get the \u201cFab Five\u201d but the Disney Jr shows with Mickey all have Daisy, and sometimes leave out Pluto. It\u2019s nice to have the set of \u201cfriends\u201d for imaginative play and story retelling.Second as far as collectible Little People go, the paint and printing on the characters faces is great. I\u2019ve gotten a few sets that didn\u2019t look amazing where the facial features were printed on. But since I buy mine to play with my kids, I already accept that they will end up looking like Weird Barbie before they\u2019re done.I bought these for my infant because Little People are reasonably safe toys that my toddler might also still enjoy playing with so the 2 could have a little side by side play time. Well my 3 year old immediately took this out of the Amazon box and insisted we open it. He plays with the little figurines daily. I bought the Little People Mickey house for the infant and put it away for Christmas. I think they will enjoy that addition.",
