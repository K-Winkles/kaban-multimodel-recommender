Was a slight disappointment. Can't deny how cool it is that the solution doesn't just pour out tho. So, all in all a fun purchase, definitely minimizes the mess factor, but not completely. I'm pretty sure the leak is really the solution dripping off of the wand. But, anyway...not a big deal. We love it. Just be warned. It's SPILL-PROOF, not LEAK-PROOF.",

Overall, I think Fubbles Bubbles is a great product for kids, but I hope they can make some changes to become more eco-friendly.",
