Good for fine motor skills, interesting for kids with the spinning! Love the colors. Easy for kids to place on. Only downfall is the bottom piece falls off easily with the other pieces. We ended up gluing on the bottom piece to help it stay standing and not have to put it back together all of the time. But overall, love this toy!!!",
