                "reviewText": "My son has CVI and is on the spectrum. Buying toys for him can be a challenge, he needs something to keep his attention, keep his fingers busy, but can't have anything visually distracting or it's overwhelming. The toys have to be big enough its not taxing to look at and solid primary colors or he loses the edges of the shape and can't identify it. These are perfect! I was surprised with the quality of the plastic, I had expected them to be cheap like most standard shape sorters that shatter when they get tossed but these are nice and thick, durable. I was pleased. The only thing that I was surprised by was the size of the bag. In the photo of the product there is a young child wearing the bag like a backpack...that was not our experience. If you read the dimensions for the product those are more accurate to what you will receive. The bag was big enough to fit each part of the toy and we appreciated the easy clean up that mimic'd closely the work he does with his therapists. The colors were bright and accurately pictured, great for him to see easily. The size of the edges of the nuts and the motion of twisting them really encourages kids to develop that pincer grasp which is the basis of most skills they will develop. My son loves traditionally opening and closing the nuts and bolts, but also will fixate on them as a \"wheel\". He will spin the toy around the axis as though daydreaming but he enjoys the sensation of the movement. I was impressed, this toy exceeded my expectations and I will most likely be purchasing the pegboards as gifts for his therapists this holiday season, or even more of these sets. This is a toy that masters both aspects of being therapy and a toy, enjoyable, yet educational.My son's therapists are big proponents as well, they often pull this toy out of his toy chest to work with him, using it in ways I hadn't considered. Versatile enjoyable toy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This set is really great! First let me say we accidentally ordered 2, we only meant to order one but I am actually glad we did, here's why. I have an active, curious and busy toddler. She is 23 months old and I am always on the hunt for things that are educational without being boring or electronic. When I saw this I thought, perfect let's give it a try. First, I was happy to see the bag they come in is not just a carry pouch but a little backpack, too cool! Second when we opened them I was happily surprised at the size of them, they are larger and more lightweight than I thought they would be. They have no rough edges, no weird chemical smell (some toys I have ordered her from Learning Resources we have had to return for having a strong chemical smell) and even though she may be a little young to sit and do the whole bag right now, they kept her busy and interested..which brings me to why I am glad we accidentally ordered 2 not 1. I have put the second set in the car! Sometimes we dash out for a quick few errands that turn into more, these have been perfect to stash in the car and not have to worry about batteries and heat and it easy to keep them from getting lost in the car since they have their own brightly colored bag and even though we might lose one bolt here or one nut there, unlike a matching set where everything has it's own specific match, if we lose a bolt, then she can just learn you can problem solve and screw a second nut on to a bolt with one already.",

                "reviewText": "Like a lot of persons on Amazon I rely on other reviewers when making a purchase. The feedback on this one was glowing and at times helpful so I went ahead on got this for my little one. There was no warning chocking hazard that I could see on the product description so I thought that all would be well. The product seems well made, bright, colourful, attractive. My son enjoys the twisting and opening motion so in time I expect this will be a favourite of his. The bolts are oversized but I do wish so were the nuts. Some are smaller than the other and I am quite concerned about giving it to him to play with right now. One reviewer mentioned that you can only pair like colours but I find that's not true. There are some pieces that I can mix and match and others that you can't. I received a first email asking for my feedback which I meant to respond to but it really gets to me when I'm contacted to leave a review in exchange for something else, albeit they did say an unbaised review. It raises suspicions of all other reviews on here and questions whether I made the right selection when purchasing this. This is my unbiased review. Thanks but no thanks to the free promised toy. Sorry but not interested. I'd rather have a well made toy, which matches the online description and is fair value for the money I paid.",
