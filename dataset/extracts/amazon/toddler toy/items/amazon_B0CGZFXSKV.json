However, the item that I received was only dinosaurs numbers.My kids love dinosaurs and loved these dino numbers but they really also wanted the dino letters.They are great; my kids like to mix and match them and counting along the way. Colors are nice and bright! It could have more of a variety of dinosaurs though, in my opinion! It's a good toy and the kids like the dinosaurs.The only con is that I did not receive the alphabet dinosaurs; which was a little disappointing!",
