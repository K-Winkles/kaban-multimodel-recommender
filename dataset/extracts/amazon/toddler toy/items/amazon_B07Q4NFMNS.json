Also, she loves the lantern light that displays a picture of a cute bug shining through the lens at the top, she sets the lantern each night. The plastic is not the highest quality and my daughter already broke one of the legs to the \"log\" tripod thing but overall its a good toy set for the price. I'm very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a cute set!! It has the tent, a lantern, canteen, fake fire, etc and each piece is just as cute as the last! My son has been wanting to go camping for the first time and I figured this would be a great way to get him started and keep him safe! He will get the \u201cwood\u201d and the \u201caxe\u201d it came with and pretend to chop the wood up and start a fire. Has a little hat and bug set. Bug set has a few random bugs, magnifying glass, net, stuff like that and he enjoys playing with it by itself. Price point is great for this product, especially for everything you get! Highly recommend for any little camper!!! Would also be great as a gift!!",
