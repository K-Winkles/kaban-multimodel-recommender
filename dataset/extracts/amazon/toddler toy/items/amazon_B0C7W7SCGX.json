        "description": "Watch Bluey from the hit TV series come to life as a swimming water toy! Swimming lengths in the tub is easy. All kids have to do is give a gentle tug on Bluey\u2019s seahorse friend to extend the cord \u2013 then let it go. Watch as Bluey\u2019s arms start wheeling round and round, and she starts swimming like she\u2019s scared of a silly blue whale! Place her face down in the water and she\u2019ll do a front crawl. Flip her over and she\u2019ll show you the backstroke. All the while, the funny seahorse just keeps getting closer until it\u2019s time to do it all over again. Bluey has a big smile and comes in all the familiar shades of blue and yellow that kids know so well from her show. Just like other bath toys from Toomies, this preschool toy is great for helping toddlers build confidence in water, whether it\u2019s hours in the bath tub or enjoying their time in the kiddie pool. While they\u2019re busy giving this wriggly Bluey a workout, kids will be giggling, developing their fine motor skills, and learning all about cause and effect. Be sure to drain the toy fully after use and leave to air dry. No batteries needed, it\u2019s all kid-powered fun for children 18 months and up!",
