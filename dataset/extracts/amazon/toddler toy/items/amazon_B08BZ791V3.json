I was going to make something at first but then figured amazon must have something. I searched and there it was! there are a set of buttons, laces, 2 zippers and about 9 buckles and he is obsessed. it keeps him busy, definitely helps with fine motor skills and hand eye coordination. I highly recommend this product. it is a nice size to bring anywhere!",
