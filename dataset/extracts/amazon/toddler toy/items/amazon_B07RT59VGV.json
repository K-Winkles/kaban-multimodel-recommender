                "reviewText": "I was seriously suprised by this toy! I got it for my 18 month old, but all of my kids have enjoyed playing with it even up to my oldest who is 9. So many different educational settings, I even learned something new from it. \"Solmization\" is the correct term for the 'do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do' scales, who knew?! Thanks to this toy now I do!I like the more muted color scale rather than the bright primary colors that baby toys typically have.Some other reviews talked about the volume being too loud, that issue seems to have been addressed because it is not too loud at all.I like the storage area underneath for the drumsticks. I like that its multiple toys in one (piano, xylophone, drums) The whack-a-mole game setting is so fun.All in all if you are looking for a musical toy with a variety of options for a baby/toddler age I definitely recommend this toy and it will continue to be fun for them to grow with for years.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it's been a big hit so far (she was 7 months when she got it and is still a big fan of it at 9 months). The only complaint I have is the volume control; it does have 3 different volume settings but the button to control the volume is a large green button on top of the toy near other buttons meant for the baby to play. For parents' sanity, it would've been nice for the volume control to be harder for baby to adjust, but overall it's a great toy.",

                "reviewText": "My 20 month old loved this product ! She had fun pressing the different buttons to produce sounds and banging on the drums. Definitely very entertaining for a toddler and it is well made and seems like it will last for a long time. My child loves using this toy to make music and explore producing different sounds. It\u2019s good that the battery pack can only be opened with a screwdriver so the child cannot take them out. The only feedback I have is the volume button is near the other buttons so the child might increase the sound to high and it could get annoying. I would prefer the volume button to be on the side so it\u2019s something the adult can control . Overall it\u2019s a great product that I highly recommend !!",

                "reviewText": "We all know that kids love toys that make sounds and light up. This one is no different. It can work as a regular piano and drums, it plays songs, and it plays animal sounds. The drums light up which helps keep babies engaged. The biggest perk to this toy is the volume button! It can definitely be loud, but the lowest setting actually isn't that bad at all. Very cool feature that I'm sure I'll be using pretty often. The only downside is that the volume button is on the front like the rest of the buttons, so baby can easily press it on his own and change the volume quickly. Thankfully, the off switch is on the back and only I can control that one.",

                "reviewText": "My 8 months old enjoys this toy. The only downside I have for this is that the volume control is a button you push three times to cycle through loud, medium and quiet and that button is on the top of the toy so my 8 months old naturally pushes it just as much as the other buttons. Would be nice if volume was on the bottom of the toy or was a switch that is harder for a baby to toggle. Otherwise the sounds are fun and it serves it's purpose.",
