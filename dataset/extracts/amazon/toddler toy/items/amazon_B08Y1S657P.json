It is closely related to the North American Deinonychus of the Early Cretaceous in that both reptiles were dromaeosaurs. Velociraptor was smaller than Deinonychus, reaching a length of only 1.8 metres (6 feet) and perhaps weighing no more than 45 kg (100 pounds). Tyrannosaurus rex Tyrannosaurus rex was a genus of theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex , commonly abbreviated to T. rex, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the last three million years of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. Triceratops Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period,about 68 million years ago in what is now North America.Triceratops species possessed a sturdy build,with strong limbs,short hands with three hooves each,and short feet with four hooves each.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this dinosaur assembly included an electric screw driver (batteries included) that actually worked, and came with interchangeable blade and Phillips tips. My 4 y.o. grandson used it to assemble the dinosaurs as I helped him position the pieces, and immediately caught on to the forward and reverse buttons on the driver. The driver even has a slip clutch so the plastic screws don't get over-tightened.The dinosaur necks, jaws, tails and legs all have some movement and provided for some interesting play fighting between them.The plastic parts seem quite durable, and overall I'm pleased with the quality.",

Something for a dad and son, or grandpa and son to sit down with and enjoy. You basically look at the pieces and figure out how to build the dinosaurs using either included hand tools (Phillips screwdriver) or a power driver (it even has a clutch). And not to be sexist, there\u2019s no reason a mom and daughter couldn\u2019t enjoy it too. In my case, my daughter looked at the lacking instructions and said to me, \u201cHere you go\u201d.",
