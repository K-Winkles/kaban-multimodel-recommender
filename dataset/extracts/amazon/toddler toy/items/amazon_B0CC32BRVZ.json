                "reviewText": "I watch three of my grand kids (2 1/2 yr old twins and 1 year old) during the week and I'm always looking for toys that spark imaginations and reduce screen time. I already have magnetic tiles, which they love, but these magnetic blocks have quickly become an instant favorite! They're colorful, lightweight, and easy to manipulate. They also produce the most satisfying click when you put them together. The best part is that the magnets are strong enough that the kiddos can pick up their smaller creations without them falling apart, and if you've ever played with a toddler then you know that is a huge plus! Even my 1 year old grand baby likes to play with them, and since the magnets are inside the blocks, I don't have to worry they're a choking hazard. There's a little booklet with samples of things you can build, and I think there are enough blocks in the set to build most, if not all, of the items. For example, I've included a picture of the sofa, and there were 3 blocks left over. Since these have been such a hit with everyone, myself included, I've already purchased another set, and may buy more in the future. They are played with multiple times a day, so I would say they're already a great investment for the money.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good starter set",
                "reviewText": "This is a fun starter set of magnetic blocks. The magnets aren't as strong as I expected them to be, based on the pictures (the connection breaks with just the slightest bump), but that's probably a good thing for kids. You wouldn't want to deal with a frustrated toddler who couldn't pull their blocks apart because the magnets were too strong (destroying the tower is as much fun as building it when it comes to blocks, after all)!!The set comes with 7 colors of blocks (3 black, 2 white, and 5 each red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) and a booklet of ideas for things that you can build and create. It's nice that the booklet shows beginner-level projects (\"Primary Model\") that you can mostly build with the blocks included in the set as well as more advanced ideas (\"Advanced Model\"), which would require additional blocks to build. Still, 35 blocks is a decent size set to try it out and see if you like them before investing in more. And this is a pretty decent price point for a set of building toys, so if you like them, you can always buy a second set to add to your collection. If you want to match the colors--not just the shapes--for the designs highlighted in the included booklet, you may need additional sets of blocks, even for the \"Primary Model\" builds. The heart on page 3, for example, needs 2 blue blocks, 6 orange blocks, 6 red blocks, 3 green blocks, and 6 yellow blocks. You'd need a second set of blocks to get the extra red, orange, and yellow blocks you need to build this properly. The fish on the same page requires 11 yellow, 10 orange, and 1 blue block, which would need 3 sets of blocks just to get enough of the yellow. (I don't know if there are sets available that are all a single color. I didn't see any when I looked, but to be honest I wasn't looking super hard, because I wanted to try these out before making any commitments to a bigger investment.)I actually got 2 sets of magnetic blocks (different manufacturers) to see which I liked better, and I expected that they'd work together to make one larger set. But I didn't verify the sizes, and it turns out that the 2 sets are 2 different sizes, so they kind of work together a bit, but the magnets don't really match up, so there's not a whole lot you can do with them together (not as bad as trying to fit LEGO and DUPLO together--these are approximately 1 3/8-inch cubes, and the others are 1-inch cubes--so they're close but not close enough). So if you buy extras to go together, try to get them from the same manufacturer, or at least compare to make sure you have the same size!And speaking of putting things together that don't really go together... I actually got these (and the other magnetic blocks) to see if they would coordinate with the flat magnetic tiles my granddaughter loves building with, to give her a bit of dimension and variety to her builds. As expected, the magnets between the different sets don't necessarily match up perfectly, but there is some potential here for creativity that is worth exploring some more, I think.",
