I love that it covers facial expressions, color matching/identification and shapes! I appreciate that you have to work a little to find the right spot for each egg and getting the tops on the eggs, not too hard, but enough to make it a challenge to where they are working on dexterity and also truly need to know what shape fits where. It's a very engaging toy and the cute squeak sound they make is probably my 2 year olds favorite part. They're also very durable, the case included! Buy these asap!",

                "reviewText": "This is an early Easter gift to my 7 month old son and he LOVES them! I figured with his age he would be too young but nope. He loves to dump out the eggs and pick up and teeth on the shells and rolling them around. He gives the biggest grin when he spots these and even goes for them during tummy time. He loves to knock the shells off the egg by banging them which is really easy to do. The eggs are super cute also and it's helping his dexterity and coordination to pick the egg up which is harder then the shell but he has done it a few times already. He loves for me to push down on the chicks to hear them peep. I love the mechanism in how it peeps by pushing against the screw inside. It's a very solid toy and looks safe. I have had fun playing with then also. They all have different ccolos and the shell has a face with cute facial emotions on every shell and there emotions colors match the egg color. It's also a shape sorter. It's great for matching, learning emotions and shape sorting and dumping out. Ohhh and of course teething and learning colors. This is definitely a toy that will grow with him as toddler and the price is great. My baby loves these during tummy time chasing the eggs on the floor. If you have a younger baby around 6 months all the way into toddler/small children stages they wilk love these adorable eggs. They are great year round. Anything that makes my baby happy makes me happy and these are fun to play with. The chicks are inside the top shell but the chicks aren't removable from the bottom shell, they are made into the bottom shell. These are super cute and definitely woth the $10 cost because of the versatility of this toy and it doesn't take up much much, it's a great price. Everyone needs these!. :)",

                "reviewText": "My almost 17 month old got these eggs for Christmas. As soon as she opened them, her two older sisters dropped their toys and swarmed over to their baby sister and her new gift... Play food is so much fun for kids, and these haven't disappointed yet.Our eggs' pieces fit perfectly, they squeak a great squeak accordingly, and the carton closes snugly. There are absolutely no problems with our product, which relieved me because I read so many disparaging reviews. The squeak, by the way, isn't a loud thing. It's reminiscent of old fashioned squeak toys that just peep. And there are no choking hazards with this set. Very durable, and the paint hasn't come off at all (and we have a major chewer in this house!)I like the fact that the eggs' expressions aren't colored because that makes it more of a challenge for the older two kids (ages 6 and 3). The point is to match the shell's face to the yolk's face. The expressions differ slightly to greatly, so it's fun to have them study the faces. (The 6 year old has no problem; the 3 year old is at a perfect age for this part of the toy.) The baby likes to put the pieces together and apart and press down to squeak them. The sorting and matching is a bit above her. And all the eggs' \"cracks\" are cut the same, so all the tops and bottoms fit each other. The bottom of the carton has a shape depression in each hole, and each bottom shell has a corresponding key shape that fits into it. That's the frustrating part for the baby, but she is getting the hang of it with the help of a big sister;)All in all, this is a great toy for your child to grow with. For infants/young toddlers, it works on motor skills. For older toddlers/preschoolers, the sorting and matching part is perfect. For older kids, the eggs are great for pretend play with cooking and kitchens. Take the chance and get this toy. If you do get a defective one, Amazon is great about refunding!",
