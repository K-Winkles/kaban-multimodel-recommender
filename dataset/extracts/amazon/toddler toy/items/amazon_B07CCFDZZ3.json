Great for pre-readers to see 1:1 connections between words and animals/objects and even early readers to hear Spanish (or English) alternatives. Great way for preschoolers to hear a different language if living in a single language home.",

If I remember correctly, I bought this for her first birthday.",

                "reviewText": "This book came with batteries installed and working well. It has a switch to select Spanish or English. There are also three modes to select, to get different responses from each image. It\u2019s not too loud, and it\u2019s very responsive to touch- the lightest tap activates the voice.Because I hold the book with a child in my lap to \u201cread\u201d it with them, I wish it had a small handle on the left side, or on both sides, instead of the one on top. It\u2019s tricky to hold it the way I normally hold a book without my fingers accidentally touching the left page and activating sounds.It seems to be durable and has features that will entertain and educate for an extended time. I found it in the three-year-old\u2019s room, so it appears she was enjoying it along with her 16 month old brother.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a speech therapist and I bought this for my nephew as a Christmas gift. This book is AWESOME! It's very easy for kids to use and even I liked playing with it. The vocabulary is age-appropriate and has some niche words that help expand vocabulary too. Under each picture it has the word in English and Spanish (though Spanish word is in smaller text). I like how easy it is to switch to Spanish mode too. My nephew is being raised bilingual with English and Spanish, so his mom found this extra helpful! I will be getting my son his own copy once he's a few months older.",
