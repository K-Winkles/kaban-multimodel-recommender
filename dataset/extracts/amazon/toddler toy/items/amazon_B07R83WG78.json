                "reviewText": "I guess this is just for display but I can't imagine a scenario where you would need to display a ukulele that's not playable. Body is made of plastic and the strings cannot be tuned. Instead of 4 separate strings that runs from the keys all the way to the bridge, they used 2 long ones and just looped it by the bridge. So if you tighten one string, the string next to it tightens too.I don't even have a picture of it cause I threw it right away. Just a waste of time, money, and I'm pretty sure I've just contributed to the world's problem of plastic pollution.I would definitely discourage people from buying this product. .. get something that says it's made of wood.",

It\u2019s all hard plastic, so it has held up to a toddler throwing it around and has yet to break or crack after a few months of play. Can\u2019t speak to the quality of actually playing it as I\u2019ve never tuned it to actual play.",

                "reviewText": "When I bought this for my son for Christmas I was beyond excited! Perfect size for a toddler. But I noticed something was wrong when I got the package cause I heard rattling. But I forgot about it and proceeded to wrap it up for Christmas.Well I went ahead and had my kids open one gift today to get it out of their systems and I let him open this one. Upon opening the guitar we noticed some cracks and that one of the strings weren\u2019t even attached. The \u2018tuner\u2019 piece was in the hole of the guitar and upon examining further it had snapped the plastic pieces that\u2019s supposed to keep the string attached and tuned.Yes, the guitar is plastic not wood (not durable plastic either). It would\u2019ve been a great gift if it didn\u2019t arrive already broken.(Pictures are of after we tried to \u2018Jerry Rig\u2019 it)Very disappointing",
