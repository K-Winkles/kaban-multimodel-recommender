                "reviewText": "We've gotten bath toys from name brand stores and we can't believe the terrible quality. For instance so poorly made they can't even squirt the water back out of them! But these are so well made. You can tell a quality difference just from holding them. They work wonderfully. They are colorful with a nice range of sea creatures. The net is a lovely bonus not only for playing in the tub but also for storing the toys when the kids are done. AND my wife's favorite part: two of the toys detect hot water. They change color if the water is hot. This calms my wife's concerns and give us a good indicator for adjusting it.Plus my wife's used it for \"science\" and taken it from a glass of cold water to a glass of hot water to show the other kiddos the thermal science behind these toys. Everyone's gotten some sort of enjoyment from this purchase and it was well worth it!",

The shark mouth shaped net makes for fun games where the shark tries to catch the other creatures. It\u2019s really well done as a set.However, I have concerns that the rubber toys will develop mold inside as toys of this kind frequently do. You can\u2019t really clean the insides of the rubber toys at all. You just have to be really good about drying them out fast after use if you want them to last as long as possible.",
