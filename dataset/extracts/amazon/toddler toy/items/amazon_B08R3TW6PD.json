                "reviewText": "My kiddo loves these. Magnets are not as strong as the competitors but that is part of the reason kiddo likes them- the real magnatiles are too hard for him to pull apart. He loved building with these and then crushing the buildings. We\u2019ve had our first set for over a year and they are like new - no magnets have fallen off or loosened. The storage bag they came in was cheap and we threw it away after a few uses but the toy id great. Just wish it came with more pieces. We have two sets now and still wish we had bought a third. Recommend these for 2-5 yrs old but with adult supervision ( because they do have magnets).",

I recommend this to babies and kids.My baby is more than 1 year old and starts to concentrate on playing toys which needs some thinking and understanding.So I bought this this for him and see if he likes playing these magnetic pieces. The results are satisfying.He loves these megnetic blocks and would like to sit there and play these blocks. I will wait a few days to see he loves these toys because he like build things or just because they are new.Pros:Not an expensive price for a starter set of magnetic toyscolorful, attract baby to play with it.quality seems adequate, but need to make sure baby not bite it.Cons:the strength of magnetic seems at the low bar. It is not strong enough to hold the structure unless there is support below the frame.",
