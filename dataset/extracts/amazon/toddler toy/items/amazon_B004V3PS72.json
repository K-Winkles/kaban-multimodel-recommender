It looks real, it actually sucks a little, it rolls around great, it was easy to put together, and the beads swirling around like \"dirt\" is a nice touch. The beads and the suction can run separately too so both do not have to be on at the same time. A few notes if you like this: The suction power is like its for fun only (for kids), do not expect them to be able to clean like a normal vacuum. It does NOT stand on its own, which is annoying but if you click out the little compartment slightly that holds the dirt it does, I think that is how its meant to stand. Its kind of heavy for a toddler toy so when they drop it it does seem like it could break but our hasn't.",

He follows me around while I vacuum, he pulls it onto the couch to cuddle it, he bangs it against stuff and it hasn\u2019t broken yet. Definitely worth the purchase and the fact that it really looks like it\u2019s vacuuming is such a selling point. Great for gifting and great for keeping.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Casdon Dyson Ball Miniature Replica for my 19-month-old child, and it has been an absolute hit in our household! From the moment it arrived, my little one couldn't get enough of it.This miniature Dyson Ball is not only adorable but also incredibly realistic. It's the perfect size for tiny hands and encourages imaginative play. My child loves to mimic me while I'm cleaning, and this toy allows them to do just that.The attention to detail on this replica is impressive. The suction action and the tiny colorful balls that swirl around in the clear cylinder make it even more exciting for my child. It's as if they have their own little vacuum cleaner.What I appreciate the most is the quality and durability of this toy. It's built to withstand the enthusiasm of a curious toddler. It's been dropped, banged, and played with for hours, and it's still in excellent condition.I can't recommend the Casdon Dyson Ball Miniature Replica enough for children aged 3 and up. Even at 19 months, my child absolutely loves it. It's a fantastic way to introduce them to cleaning and responsibility through play. This toy has brought so much joy and entertainment to our household, making it a worthwhile purchase.",
