Some of the pros I\u2019ve seen so far are that helps with fine motor skills, independent play and recognition of colors.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as an incentive for an autistic child, but it ended up being a great addition to my break corner overall. I was initially disappointed by the small size, but over time I realized that the portability of it is great as we transition from different locations. There's so many different methods to turn on that it can keep the kiddos busy and is a great for \"work first, then lights\" motivator. One thing I noticed though is that some of my kids struggled with the ones that were not simple on-off switches, so it was a great learning experience for them to figure out the knobs. The only thing I don't like about this is that there isn't a way to turn off everything with one switch, which means if I am not paying attention and one of them leaves just one light on, it's draining the battery overnight.",

                "reviewText": "We got one before this one for my son, and the key part broke on it but he liked playing with it and always hands it to us to help him or to play with him. So we got this to replace that one that seemed cheaper quality. But the one con of this one is either the batteries are partially already dead or some of the lights don\u2019t brighten up as well as the older one. But the switches seem to be a lot better quality.",
