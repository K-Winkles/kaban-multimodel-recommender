It was fun for him at first but you are only able to switch out the heads and bodies, and he was unable to attach the arms and legs (those weren't magnetic as described) very simple, but not very mentally stimulating and not all pieces are magnetic. I wouldn't recommend it as a first option for the price that its sold at, but it is fun for kids for a short while. The last thing I have to say about it is the display case that is advertised does not come with the item, it is a white standard bucket so that was disappointing.",
