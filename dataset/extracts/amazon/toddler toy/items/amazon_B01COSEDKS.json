                "reviewText": "I thought this would be a great toy for my newly 2yo daughter who loves to \"help\" play with tools and Daddy fix things, and I was right! She gravitated straight to use the drill to spin the gears, and was so proud to \"do it myself!\" Daddy was very enthusiastic that the drill was able to reverse and not only screw in, but unscrew as well with a flip of a little button -- just like a REAL one! Mommy was thrilled that the drill doesn't require batteries.This toy has some really cool features, including the two double-sided cards that fit over the holes and are interactive, helping to teach colors and numbers as your little one hammers/screws. There are buttons on the front that play songs, make noises and light up different colors. Admittedly, there are more realistic toy hammers and wrenches on the market, but the ones in this set are simple and functional with the screws/nails included.When my 2yo allows it (she's still learning to share,) my 5yo son enjoys this toy as well. Since he aspires to be a \"Fixer\" when he grows up, he has more realistic tool and building toys, but he still plays with this when he gets the opportunity! He really likes the cool reversing function and the ROAR of the drill, and seeing what the interactive cards do. He's been using the drill to \"fix\" various things around the house. My 11yo daughter isn't much of a handy-person, but she liked listening to the songs and figuring out the different features, too.My only gripe is that the drill can't fit into the toolbox, or there isn't a clamp to attach it to the side for easier storage/organization.I think this toy could appeal to a wide age-range of kids, and would make a fantastic gift. After two weeks, it is still played with daily here!",
