The toy is also made of durable materials, so it can withstand a lot of splashing and water play.Overall, I think the fishing toy is a great choice for the little ones. It is fun, engaging, and promotes hand-eye coordination. I would definitely recommend it to other parents. I used this in attempt to get my 2 year old who just started disliking baths suddenly a little more excitement. It is definitely helping!",

                "reviewText": "My 2.5 year old loves \u201cfishing\u201d with this bath set! Took him a minute to figure out how the magnets/connections work, (you have to hold the fishing rod/string pretty steady above the little bobble balls in order for proper connection) but after a few tries, he got the technique down! Easy for little hands to hold, connect, disconnect, etc. Bright, colorful and well made. Even the fishing net is durable and easy to clean. The only \u201cdownfall\u201d IMHO, is the rotatable reel. It\u2019s hard for him to turn due to such a small handle to hold and rotate at the same time. It makes a cute \u201cclicking\u201d sound when you turn the reel. Not a huge deal for him though, and doesn\u2019t take away from the continuous fun! Just keep in mind that the \u201chook\u201d is magnetic and will stick to anything metal, lol. My LO got frustrated at first when it kept sticking to the side of the tub, yet again, he quickly figured it out. :) Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "My son ripped the handle of his bath bucket and said he was going fishing, so I thought it was time to get him a proper fishing rod.The rod is perfect in size for my 2.5 year old. Its not too big where he is hitting the wall or where I am worried he will hit himself in the head with it. Its a nice bright and colourful green and easy to hold. The reel just makes clicking sounds which he is not very interested in.The fish are bottom heavy so they always float upright with the magnets facing up. This makes them easy to catch when you hover over them. The magnets are quite strong as well. If you have a metallic tub they will stick and stay. Even when wet and covered in soap they will not slide down, so I would say the magnets are good quality. My son has thrown and banged them many times and none have broke, cracked or lost their magnetism to date.I was initially disappointed that the rope didn't retract, I knew this before I bought it. But after giving it some thought, thinking about the soap and water going inside the rod and the mould that would occur, I am very happy it does. Makes rinsing and cleaning much easier and I know its not a toy that will make my son ill.My only complaint is I wish it came with 5 fish or you could buy others separately and in different styles.Overall, this is an excellent fishing set and would buy again and I may to get some additional fish and another rod to play along.Pros:- great bath time fun- easy to hold and play with; helps develop hand and eye coordination- quality is quite good and magnets are stronger than expectedCons:- would like more fish",
