They each come with a little animal and all boxes nest together with the animals all fitting in there too. They are fun bright colors and very sturdy for being cardboard. I obviously don't let her step on them because they would probably collapse but they are heavy duty for being cardboard boxes. I recommend these for busy toddlers who like to stack everything, just be sure they don't try to build a step stool with them!",
