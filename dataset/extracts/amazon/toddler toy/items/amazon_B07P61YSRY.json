                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the idea of a wagon that can help kids learn. Our son is 2 and his favorite this to do currently is push and pull anything with wheels on it. This toy is great because it can help him learn shapes, colors, numbers and such The wagon has 3 different levels and a small storage compartment for some of his smaller things. It is extremely durable and sturdy. This would make the greatest gift to any boy or girl of the appropriate age.",
