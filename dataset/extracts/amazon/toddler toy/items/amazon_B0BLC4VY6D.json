                "reviewText": "Holy wow it feels so real. Love all the different sounds, and that the power button is it's actual on off just like a real remote the volume is it's up down. Grate quality from the texture of the buttons down to the feel of the plastic and even the weight of it. Even how the buttons move it just feels so much like the real deal. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was my TV remote \ud83d\ude05 Perfect gift for a little one. I'd say anywhere from age 6m and up.",

This is nice because it\u2019s his very own remote we give him and not having to worry about him changing the channel ect. The volume button controls the volume on it, same with the power button is the on/off and there is different languages.",

My 18 month old was always crying for the TV remote which we keep hidden because the battery is a lethal choking/burning hazard. So I bought him this realistic toy remote with a screw in battery door he can't pop off and now he couldn't be happier!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my 12 month old who\u2019s obsessed with the remote. I don\u2019t like to give her the remote because then I have to take the batteries out and place them somewhere unreachable- because swallowing a battery is INCREDIBLy dangerous for a toddler or child. She also loves to hit the buttons and accidentally purchase random programming. In comes this lovely fake out remote. It keeps her occupied if I have to cook, it keeps her from crocodile rolling during a diaper change and it just all around is a great distraction if I need some time to do ANYTHING without worrying about the real remote being unsafe or getting broken.",
