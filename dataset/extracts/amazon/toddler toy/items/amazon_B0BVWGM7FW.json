The negative part of this dog though is the designer must have been inspired by a yappy Chihuahua because this dog barks all the time. The parents had to take the batteries out since they were annoyed with the yappy dog, but that didn't stop my niece from walking her dog around the house.",

                "reviewText": "A blatant case of \"you get what you pay for\". This fella caught my youngest daughter's eye and she couldn't wait to get it. Imagine her heartbreak when one of its legs popped out of place and it limped across the floor in the first ten minutes of simply letting it walk across the floor.No worries, replacement ordered, it arrived -- and it happened again. She insisted she wanted to keep it anyway, even with a limp, because she'd been saving up for it and had named it and it's cute. About fifteen minutes later, another one snapped. That was too much and we had to return it (again), this time for a refund. Too bad - it sure was cute. But also very loud with no way to change it, so maybe not TOO bad.",
