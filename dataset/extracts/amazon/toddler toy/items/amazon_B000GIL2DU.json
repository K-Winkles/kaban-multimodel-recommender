They don\u2019t make much noise when they tumble and they don\u2019t hurt the child if they fall on them. Kids love the pictures on them and it is fun for them to stack and nest the blocks. They end up looking a little beat up when they are played with a lot, but the play value outweighs that. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My son received these for his first birthday and they're probably the best toy he's ever received. He just turned two and still loves them. I keep them in the car all the time and he plays with them anytime we're at someone else's house, which is great because they're quiet and he's entertained by them for a long time. It's been fun to watch him do progressively more and more with them as he's gotten older. One thing, though--I do think that if he'd received them any younger, he would have put them in his mouth and ruined them. Twelve months was the right time to receive them. I noticed, however, that Melissa & Doug also make wooden nesting blocks, and that might be another way to go; they wouldn't be quite as light, of course, but I bet they're still a great toy.They are starting to get a little beat up NOW, and I will buy a second set for my second son, but that's not bad for the amount of use we've gotten from a $10 toy.",

                "reviewText": "For the pricetag, these stacking blocks are very cute. The images are cute and give plenty of opportunity for learning activities. They are a sturdy cardboard, but they have held up very well with my 2 year old with supervision.However, I've knocked off two stars for the misleading advertisement photos. I wanted the upper case blocks (as shown in the photos) because I wanted to use them as teaching tools for my 2 year old... however, I received lower case alphabet blocks instead. There is no way to select one or the other when ordering, so I feel that this is a poor business/ordering model. It's harder to teach lower case without first teaching upper case as the base... So I'm not happy with that.",
