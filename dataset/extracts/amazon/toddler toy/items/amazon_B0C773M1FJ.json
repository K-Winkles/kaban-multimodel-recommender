I needed something to keep her occupied and this was it! She loved it. All of the different gadgets kept her entertained for much longer than I anticipated. She loved being able to move and pull and spin all of the different parts, and turning the pages too. It held up really well during travel as well. I took it on the plane with us and through all of the smooshing of bags and of coarse her chewing on it every so often, it is still in great shape. Very sturdy. It was nice too that something was able to keep her occupied that didn\u2019t make a lot of noise. As to not disturb the others on the plane. I went back and forth between a few different brands and I am very happy with this one.",
