                "reviewText": "My daughter was becoming obsessed with light switches so we wanted to find something that would encourage her curiosity in a safe way. It took a few months for her to build up her finger strength to do most of the buttons, as they are a bit stiff (in a good way). She has just recently learned how to turn the bottom yellow and the red plug-which I think are the most difficult on the board. She learned very quickly that if she threw the board, it would not work anymore. When tossing, one of the two batteries may come loose-so you need to unscrew with a screwdriver to reset. This actually helped when she was first using it, to help control her frustration when she couldn\u2019t get one to switch. We recently took our first trip, and this was a must have for the plane! Plenty of fun and distraction, with no annoying sounds. Would definitely recommend!",

Some of the things were a little hard for him to move with his hands but he figured it out. During this process of discovery, he would get frustrated and throw the the toy. It didn't break after being thrown quite a few times. It is made out of heavy wood so it does hurt when you get hit. Just be aware it you have a toddler who throws things. It would be good if this toy had more and or different light switches, buttons, and a lighter weight wood so grandparents don't get hurt.",

                "reviewText": "I got two\u2014 one for my kids and one for my nephew. I figured the wood would be sturdy and even if the batteries run out the kids would still enjoy flipping the switches without the lights.The box says ages 3+ due to choking hazard but I don\u2019t see anything that is an obvious choking hazard. My 1yo and my 3yo love it. The 1yo has been carrying it around nonstop. But it slid off the table once and landed face down (a 3 foot drop) and stopped working. Once I tapped it hard on my hand (face up) it started working again, which made me think either the batteries can knock out of place easily or perhaps some other inner mechanism can. Either way, a toy for toddlers should be a little more drop proof. This has happened more than once so far where I have to \u201cfix\u201d it for the kids because it got dropped or bumped too hard and I basically have to tap the back of it a few times for it to work again. Maybe I\u2019ll try putting a little something in the battery compartment to ensure it\u2019s not the batteries bumping out of place. Annoying, but for the price it\u2019s still quite entertaining for the littles.",
