It looked like there was a small amount of sand in it so with such a great price, $12.00 each I ordered three.I\u2019m glad I did because that\u2019s what we needed to make this work.The sand is kenetic sand, which is kind of a sticky sand, that is a clean play, and great for a sensory feel. The rocks enclosed are pebbles that are a chocking hazard and the toys are cheap plastic. The shovel already broke after one play time. The tray with a lid is practical and nice to have but one out of three was damaged.It took three weeks to be delivered and the box looked like it had been tossed around a lot.I will replace the rocks with bigger ones and condense the sand into one storage bin.$36.00 for a bin of kenetic sand and a storage bin was worth it after all.My 3year old grand was excited to play with it.",
