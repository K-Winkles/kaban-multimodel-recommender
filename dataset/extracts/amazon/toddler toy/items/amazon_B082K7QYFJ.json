I have 1 in my and my husband's cars and two at home. These are great for car rides with toddlers vs giving them a tablet. It's great to throw in your bag and bring to a restaurant. My daughter is now 5 and still loves playing with this. It's a great alternative to coloring books and markers.",

I historically waste a ton of post-its and little pieces of note paper, writing down things I need to do and then tossing the notes. With this \"toy\", I keep a daily to-do list that is reusable essentially indefinitely. It's easier and cheaper than using my phone, an iPad, etc. It would be great to be able to erase one or two items and keep others... but this is a $10 toy. I just cross things off the list, then eventually erase the whole thing and start over. It's really a great and kind of silly and kind of fun and super simple and super cheap business solution for me. Would anyone else use it like this? I have no clue. But it's great for me!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the KOKODI LCD Writing Tablet for my 4-year-old, and it has quickly become one of her favorite toys. This tablet is not only entertaining but also quite educational. The 10-inch colorful screen is captivating for young children and provides a fantastic canvas for their artistic endeavors.Pros:Educational Fun: I love that my child is able to express her creativity while also improving her fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. The tablet offers a mess-free way for her to draw, doodle, and practice writing her letters and numbers.Reusable and Erasable: The erasable feature is a game-changer. My little one can experiment and learn without wasting paper or creating a mess. The erase button is intuitive and easy for her to use independently.Portable and Durable: The tablet's size is perfect for on-the-go entertainment. It's slim, lightweight, and the stylus is tethered, so I don't have to worry about losing it. The build feels sturdy enough to withstand toddler handling.Battery Life: We've been using the tablet for a few weeks now, and the battery seems to last forever. It's a relief not to have to constantly change batteries or worry about recharging.Cons:Limited Color Variety: While the colorful screen is engaging, I wish there were more color options available. This could make the drawing experience even more exciting for kids.Pressure Sensitivity: The tablet doesn't have pressure sensitivity levels like some other digital drawing tools. While this might not be a major issue for toddlers, it could enhance the experience for older kids.Overall, the KOKODI LCD Writing Tablet is a fantastic addition to our collection of educational toys. It's a wonderful way for my child to learn, play, and unleash her creativity without the mess of traditional art supplies. With a few minor improvements, like more color choices and perhaps some advanced features for older kids, this could easily be a 5-star product.",
