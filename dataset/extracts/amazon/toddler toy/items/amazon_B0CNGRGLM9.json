                "reviewText": "This is a super fun toy for kids and adults! I really liked that the magnet pen is attached unlike some other marble games I have seen. We had a birthday party the weekend after we got this and our grandkids and our kids all had fun playing with it. Even my wife took a turn and had fun with it. The entire board is smaller than I thought it would be but that actually made it easier for the little ones to carry. The cover is made of durable plastic and the board is made of wood. The marbles are all magnetic as are the movable pieces within the board. Our grandchild loves matching the colors and numbers and it was amazing to watch her concentrate as she played. The board is perfect for little ones as the marbles cannot get out of the board and even if the board is shook up, you can get all the marbles back into the home base either by tilting the board or using the magnet pen. All in all, this is great learning game for kids (even adult kids!).",

Of course, you\u2019ll need to practice counting and the colors with your kid because this item doesn\u2019t have audio but it\u2019s great. My son likes it. I enjoy the two levels of difficulty it has. One way is to move the magnetized beads to the right then there\u2019s a straight drop down to the colored labels. The other way is to use a maze where there are magnetized carrying ramps that you slide and take to other ramps until you get to the colored labels. I didn\u2019t think my son would figure this out for a while since he\u2019s recently 3 but he was able to do it which surprised me. It took a while but he played with it a lot. He takes a break for a few weeks then he\u2019ll break it out again counting and doing the colors again. I wouldn\u2019t expect any kid to play with this nonstop but it will surely bring repeated entertainment with your encouragement and excitement.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This magnetic color/counting board by Zhiwuzhu is pretty cool. I didn't realize the 'harder' course had movable 'obstacles' that also hold the ball, so you transfer the ball into one and move it over and then transfer it again to the next. It's tricky, but great for motor skills and brain development, making you think harder. I don't know if my 4 yr old is quite ready for the harder course, but she most likely will need assistance with it when she's ready. I do like that this comes with a 'hard' course and 'easy' course. It's a fun obstacle game that can easily be used to make learning to count fun, while still exercising the brain. I do recommend reading the box and instructions. The magnet can be a little tricky, be careful with the balls touching the sides and also don't go too fast or it'll detach from the magnetic pen and fall back down. That can make it a bit tricky for a toddler to guide them. I think after some practice and explains how it works, your toddler can get the hang of it but there will probably be some frustrating moments while learning. Also, use it tilted up a little bit for the magnet to work better and if you don't want the beads to fall out of their spot. If any beads get stuck, just shake it a bit to get them unstuck, it truly works and helps. Overall it's a great, fun learning board that will be super useful in teaching my 4 yr old, helping her not only with coordination but exercising her brain and counting. I am hoping it will give my 4 yr old some practice in a fun way.",

It seems very sturdy and can grow with your little one to present an increase in challenges. My little one was please to attempt moving the balls and it let her entertained long enough for me to attend to the dishes.",

A Great car-trip thing to have to keep kids busy if they are bored... You use the small magnetic wand and sort the colored beads into the sections that they go in. It's not easy there are obstacles and it does take some dexterity skills too. Also a good diversion from screen time too...!",
