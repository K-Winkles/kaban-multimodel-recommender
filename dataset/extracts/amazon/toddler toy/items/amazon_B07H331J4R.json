It is easy to put together, works well, and to see him laugh so loud was worth it! The only negative I would say is the reservoir where you put the bubbles is open, so when Will tipped it over, the bubble mix spilled! I know he's just learned to walk, so is tippy himself, but the stuff spills easy! Outdoor toy??? LOL",

                "reviewText": "My son (he is 1 now) LOVES to push the button for the bubble motor and then WALKS AWAY. I go turn it off since he's across the room playing with something else and he turns to give me the stink eye, then proceeds to toddle back over and turn the button back on for background noise, then goes and finds something else to do (insert facepalm emoji here). The motor on this thing is decently loud and VERY annoying when you're inside and trapped in the same room as this glorified noisemaker, but the kid loves it so it's here to stay. I think we actually put bubbles in it once- like others have mentioned, the bubble reservoir is completely open on top and my son loves to flip things over with wheels so he can spin them. That and our hardwood floors make actually putting bubbles in the mower (inside the house) a really bad idea. I bought this for my son after he started walking, thinking this was sort of a \"help-me-walk\" kind of thing. Well it's not. And it doesn't say it is anywhere on here, so that's my own fault.If you have it out for someone that has a little kid and there is some random holiday coming up, BUY THEM THIS! Just include 3 AA batteries for them so they don't get off easy without the torture of the sound this thing makes.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my almost 2yo bubble loving toodler. I figured it's a lawnmower bubble toy, so it's a nice mix for a kid that likes to follow and do what dad does -- mow the yard. However, there isn't a cover or anything to keep the bubbles in the container. And that makes all the difference. Can you think of a single bubble toy that doesn't have a way to keep the liquid inside? This one. This is key if you're talking about a toy for a 1-3 year old who has no concept of keeping things upright to keep liquid from spilling out of bowl-like containers. The result? My kid managed to dump the bubbles everytime he tried to move the toy from its wayward path. When the toy tilted because the 2 year old got excited, bubbles spilled out. When he tried to walk on the grass with the toy, it got stuck and bubbles spilled. So he picked it up, which caused bubbles to spill. We had used the first bottle within the first 15-30 minutes. And because the bubble compartment needs to be halfway filled for the cycling wands to catch bubbles, it became a shortlived toy. We did better on cement because it was a smoother ride than on the grass, but my kid doesn't walk straight, so every couple of steps we were realigning his path. He loves the toy, but if I'm buying a toy that blows bubbles, I want it to actually be able to keep the bubbles inside and serve its function. I'm really not sure why the manufacturer didn't think of that if toddlers are the target audience. Beautiful concept. Horrible execution, especially given this is cheap, cheap plastic. Cheap as in you could find this toy in the Dollar Tree, but Five Below wouldn't sell this. So 1 star because it's a poorly made product, because my kid actually likes it despite it not doing it's primary function well. In truth, I'd give it a 1/2 star for the kid considering he also likes taking pens and turning them into drum sticks and turning his fingers into microphones... it doesn't take much for him to enjoy himself. There's another lawnmower that lets you attach the bottle to the bottom so all liquid stays. Though I can't return this, I will get that. Anything is better than what we have.",
