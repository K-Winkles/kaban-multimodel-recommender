Packaging was excellent, the toy itself was a great buy for me FOR my son because it does keep him occupied running around for the balls that shoot out of the top. I highly recommend it for a toddler that doesn\u2019t sit down for 3 minutes lol",

I gave them the information they needed and they responded again immediately! I am so impressed especially in a day and age when customer service is almost no more. Way to go VTech!!!",
