Our boys have had pretty much every type of toy you can imagine in our house, at friends houses, at childcare, etc. but this set of dinosaurs is the best! I cannot think of a toy that has been played with or used more times by not only our now almost 3-year-old but also our six-year-old. At least once a day, one of the boys will pick up the dinosaur tub and carry it around the house to do some sort of activity with the dinosaurs. Today I found the dinosaurs lined up in our master bedroom bed. \ud83d\ude06 I love the fact that there\u2019s no holes so water cannot get into them. They\u2019re extremely durable (have been chewed on during teething) and fun colors. I would recommend the set to anyone who enjoys dinosaurs! \ud83e\udd96 \ud83e\udd95",
