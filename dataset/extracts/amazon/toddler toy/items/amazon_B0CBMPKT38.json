                "reviewText": "As a kid I always wanted a Sit and Spin, but my parents could never afford one. SO when my granddaughter put this on her Christmas list - we bought it for her. BUT this sit and spin is so much more amazing than the ones when I was growing up!! This sit and spin is the COOLEST. It is a UNICORN sit and spin and it has lights and music!! My granddaughter had the biggest smile on her face, not only when she opened it on Christmas day, but while she was spinning circles on it. She can control how fast she wants to spin, which helps with hand and muscle strength. Since she is the one in control she can go slow and enjoy the lights or she can spin like a tornado with the music pumping \u2013 it's all up to her! What girl doesn't like unicorns and the unicorn design is ADORABLE. The bright colors and sparkly details make it extra special. The quality was top-notch and I am pretty sure this will last her for several years. Our granddaughter was extremely pleased and we highly recommend it.",
