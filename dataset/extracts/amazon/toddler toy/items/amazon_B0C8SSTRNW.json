He\u2019s young\u2026 still trying to teach him that so we sometimes tape it in the on position for now while he\u2019s playing with it. On the upside, it doesn\u2019t run out the battery being left on unintentionally. It could also use a carrying handle, but not a big deal to install. Great gift for the age group & price.",

If you get one that works, it's an amazing product.My 18 month old LOVES this toy, and I love it too. It keeps him engaged for long stretches and is portable. Unlike similar toys, the lights don't hurt eyes, and there is no sound (huge plus for parents). The only thing I don't like is that he likes to put the cord in his mouth so this is probably a better toy for a kiddo that is past the all in the mouth phase. Also, the keys have to be turned for the board to work, so before you think it's broken, turn the keys! ;-)",

                "reviewText": "If you are a Montessori mom like me then this is a great product for helping develop more precise hand-eye coordination and color matching.Some cultures use toothpicks so this is a bit safer alternative and has the added feature of color as well.My 2 year old enjoys it and we name the colors as he puts them in, but I would have introduced it when he was around 18-22 months if I had it then! It would be best introduced early enough that it is challenging to them and keeps their attention for longer because if it.If your kids are used to electronics or toys that entertain them then this might be short lived or uninteresting.",

I was unable to turn the rest of the lights on due to this. Seems like this is made for older kids. I found another brand that has the lights work independently from each other and not connected to one switch. I will not buy this again.",

He likes it a lot and is able to play with it without me being next to him all the time. He is quite rough when playing so I'm happy to confirm no buttons has fallen off and the toy seems quite sturdy as well which is great. We accidentally left it outside for one night and the wooden part is in immaculate conditions still which was a great (positive) surprise for me. The only downside (if you can call it that) is the actual size of the item. For some reason, the photos gave me impression of bigger item. the size was visible on the website, so not sure how I missed it. So, if I could choose again I would probably purchase the bigger (more expensive) size of the same toy.",
