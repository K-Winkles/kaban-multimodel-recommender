                "reviewText": "Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog has been a delightful addition to our home, providing not only fun but also educational value for my little one. This toy is brilliantly designed to foster fine motor skills development, and it\u2019s wonderful to see my child\u2019s hand muscles strengthen as they play.The chunky, peg-shaped quills are perfect for small hands to grasp, making it an excellent toy for both toddlers and preschoolers. The vibrant colors of the quills are not just appealing; they serve as a fantastic tool for teaching color recognition, sorting, and counting. It\u2019s been amazing to watch my child arrange the quills by warm or cool colors, create sequences and patterns, and count them as they play.Another aspect I appreciate about Spike is its use in occupational therapy exercises. It\u2019s a great resource for parents and therapists looking for engaging ways to improve fine motor skills in children. Additionally, its suitability for visually impaired children highlights its inclusive design.Storage is a breeze with this toy. After playtime, the quills fit snugly inside the hedgehog\u2019s body, making clean-up easy and keeping all pieces secure and organized. The plastic material is easy to clean, which is a must for any toy in a busy household.In conclusion, Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog is more than just a toy; it\u2019s a valuable educational tool that aids in the development of crucial skills while ensuring hours of fun. Its thoughtful design, educational benefits, and ease of storage make it a top choice for any parent looking to enrich their child\u2019s playtime.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it for my young child (17 months) because every time she sees a specific scene of Ms Rachel counting and playing with Spike and helping him get his Quills back in, my baby laughs and laughs. hearing her giggle like that made me look up Spike online so she can have her very own hedgehog to help and play and I have the pleasure of hearing her laugh. Especially when she's got \u201cQuilliam\u201d out at the same time Ms Rachel has Spike out during that particular episode. She enjoys playing with Spikes brother \u201cQUILLiam\u201d... whether your child is a fan of Ms Rachel or not, it's a pretty great toy and babies find it captivating and are pretty intrigued by the colors, feel, and puzzle like quality. The ONLY thing I can say it lacks are extra quills ... I wish it came with an extra set of quills because baby girl has lost half of them already. That's why I rated the durability 3 stars.",
