I think he loves the sound it makes when he scrunches it then pulls it apart. Actually I like it too. It's oddly soothing. Or maybe because it satisfies the fidget urge. Whatever the case these are compact, easy to travel with and because the box come with multiples, easy to have in various locations. They are all in different colors but serve the same function. I was a little worried though because he's chewed on a few of them. But it's actually \"chew proof\" in that he has not broken any little pieces off. I'm sure that's not what this toy is intended for but....he's a toddler who chews on things. The ends are just smashed with teeth marks. LOL He has them at home, in the car, at my house and in my car. This was another good purchase.",

They were perfect for keeping him entertained on long flights at 10 months old. They have held up really well after months of daily play time. The little grooves are a bit difficult to clean in the event of a baby accidentally throwing up in one, which my son definitely did. I didn't have anything long enough or narrow enough to scrub inside of it. Had to clean it by spraying it with a lot of water, but it got clean.",
