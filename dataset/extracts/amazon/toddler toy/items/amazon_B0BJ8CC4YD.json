He loves it, loves drawing on it and using it as a little table. It can be a bit hazardous when kids this age pick things up and leave them lying around face down - my son has tripped and fallen on it with the legs facing up a couple of times so extra care is needed when playing with it. I\u2019ve taken the legs off now because it isn\u2019t safe for children to be left with it if your eye isn\u2019t in them all the time. I turn around for a split second to grab a nappy and that\u2019s all it takes. The string for the pen is frustratingly short as well and it does get my little one upset that he can\u2019t hold the pen comfortably at the opposite end of the board. I suppose you could either cut it off or extend the string slightly but otherwise it\u2019s a lovely little gift.",
