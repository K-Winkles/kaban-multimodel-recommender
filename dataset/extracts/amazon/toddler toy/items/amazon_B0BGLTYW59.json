You can basically make whatever your littles minds cand imagine while also helping with there fine motor skills and much more. The different colors and shapes definitely help my toddler learn. These are of great quality and have lasted for years. We wanted to add more to what they already have and the kids are never disappointed when they get these. They came with a nice carrying bag and are great for car trips/airplane trips as well.",

They seem just as good, and are the exact same size, so they work well with the Magna Tiles we already had. I would recommend buying two sets (or a larger set) in order to build something bigger. Good value for price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these magnetic tiles for my 6-year-old son and he loves them. He can build all kinds of shapes and structures with them, and they are very durable and easy to clean. The magnets are strong enough to hold the tiles together, but not too hard to pull apart. The colors are bright and attractive, and the tiles come in different sizes and shapes. The package also includes a booklet with some ideas for building projects. I think these tiles are great for stimulating his creativity and imagination, as well as developing his spatial and motor skills. He plays with them every day and never gets bored. I highly recommend these magnetic tiles for kids who love to build and create.",

After gifting a set, my friend bought two more because she wanted to be able to build bigger creations with her child. The only downside with this set is that it is not very big, so you may want to consider purchasing more than one set or a larger set if you have an older child that will be using the tiles. These are great for children ages 4 and up. An 8-year-old will have as much fun playing with them as a five-year-old. Great gift idea!",
