They were delivered very quickly. The cars are working beautifully and these littles are as happy as Christmas morning. Very happy with this company's integrity and customer service. The kindness they showed was above and beyond! Without question, I would feel very comfortable purchasing from them again.These remote cars were the hit of my 2 and 3-year-old grandchildren's Christmas morning. They loved them! The problem is they are not durable enough to last more than a few days. One car had broken gears by New Year's Eve - it lasted 6 days. These cars were only played with at my home (grandparent) and always played with appropriately as directed. Very sad they are not made for actual play. Very disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Update:Within an hour or two of my original review going live, the company reached out to me and offered to replace the broken toy at no cost. While I wish I could have found a customer service contact so I didn\u2019t have to leave a bad review in the first place, the point is that when they did reach out, they were quick to reply and solved the problem. They even sent the replacement via expedited shipping. I waited a couple weeks before updating to see how the new cars held up, and I am happy to say that they are still in good working condition and still a favorite for my two year old. I would buy from this company again knowing that they stand behind their products.Original Review:My two year old LOVED these cars. They were easily his favorite birthday gift. He\u2019s owned them for a total of 5 days and one of the cars is already broken. The front wheel is loose and can\u2019t be controlled by the remote. It\u2019s not visibly broken and the wheel doesn\u2019t come out. It\u2019s just loose and not connecting with whatever is run by the remote. The music button still works, but the toy is essentially useless. Such a disappointment. Yes, they were owned by a two year old, so he\u2019s not exactly gentle with them. However he also is not a destructive kid and wasn\u2019t overly rough with these. I\u2019m not sure if we just got a lemon or if they are all this fragile.",
