The drawbacks that need improved are the fish constantly fall out of the board. (Maybe a flat little magnet on the board to hold them back in place?) The alphabet is a little bit out of order. The A is on the top line all by itself. So it seems that the alphabet starts with B. And what toddler starts counting with 0? Numbers should run from 1-10, not 0-9. The fishing pole has already been lost at least 4 times! (Drill a hole in the bottom and loop it to the board)If they fixed those things I'd give 5 stars. But for now just 3. It's still fun for a two year old, but I have to keep track of 36 fish and put them in order. So 3.",
