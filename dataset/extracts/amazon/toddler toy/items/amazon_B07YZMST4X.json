The cough sounds muffled and took a second to realize that was what was being depicted but that really isn't an issue. The bag is a nice touch as it can be used to hold more toys or items the doctor says are needed. The needle may be a little too long for little one's hands to really use but they eventually grow making this problem really insignificant.",
