And for babies, our gear offers simple solutions (more sleep, anyone?!) you can't possibly parent without. Making Learning Fun in 1965, Mattel released the original See 'n Say toy, The Farmer Says. The fun and innovation of that first talking learning toy live on with the new See 'n Say The Farmers Says. With electronic sounds and multiple pages of play, learning is more fun than ever. Develop & Grow Children love animals, and The Farmer Says engages children by providing colorful images and sounds of animals. Children will enjoy hearing sounds from and fun facts about their favorite animals as well as discovering new animals. The Farmer Says encourages learning through repetition and memory. As children learn to identify the animals, they are rewarded by hearing their favorite sounds. More Features Helps teach words and object identification.

There are two songs, one on each \"page.\" Some of the sounds are a little annoying, but so are all the sounds and songs on these toys after you're heard them 2 million times. My daughter was excited the first time she got it to work on her own by pulling the handle all the way back. For those purchasing based on owning one of the old school versions, keep in mind that this thing is about 1/2 the size of the one we probably all remember.

                "reviewText": "Wow, this thing is garbage. I ordered it on sale as a Christmas gift for a 2-year-old. The box was unusually small, which I opened to find this poor excuse for a toy that I cannot believe Fisher Price puts its name on. This \"updated\" toy is less than half the size of the classic toy, which makes it look very cheap and feel insubstantial. There is no pull string anymore, now it is a lever on the side that the child pulls down. Except the small size of the toy makes it very awkward and I can't imagine a 2 or 3-year-old having the patience to try to hold this tiny thing while pulling the side lever. But even if the child can pull it off, the dealbreaker is the lever is so darn loud and the noise is so prolonged that it drowns out the sounds that the toy makes. And there is no volume control, so the average to quiet audio chip playback is nearly impossible to hear, especially at the beginning when they announce the animal. This is such an obvious design flaw--which I'm guessing is because the old toy was a taped recording powered by the string mechanism (no batteries needed) that played seamlessly AFTER you released the string, while these new ones have an audio chip (batteries required) that starts the sound clip way too soon after you pull the incredibly noisy lever--that I really can't believe any child plays with this toy or that anyone paying attention would ever bother gifting this junk to a child.Back in the box and I'm returning it tomorrow. Shame on you, Fisher Price.",

I am sorely disappointed in what is now on offer as the see and say. It is a prime example of \"shrinkflation\" as it is much smaller than what I remembered even taking into account the adult vs child memories. That itself was not what disappointed me - the toy makes so much noise when turning the pointer you can not hear what the toy is \"saying\" about the animal it was pointing to. It does not live up to memories or expectations!! I would give it a miss!",
