Lots of spray shooting way up there (the kids loved it). Equally fun with the water just \u201ccracked\u201d on for a low spray... which is how we use it the majority of the time (as not to waste water). Good buy, easy to use, lots of fun.Also - I hooked it up to our garden hose which is on a hose reel. Based on other reviews, I was anticipating a \u201clow trickle\u201d and planned to add a \u201cy\u201d in with a short piece of hose... but when I tried it on our \u201cregular\u201d hose (which is on the reel) - it worked perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 4 and a half yr old granddaughter. She did enjoy it, especially jumping over it and dancing around it. And it cooled her off on a very hot day. The good: I love Melissa & Doug products because I can rely on them being well made and good for children. This is a pretty sprinkler, though some may find it more attractive to the girls.. I think there is a dragon one some boys might like better. The not so good: the fountain of water was much lower than either of us expected. I thought it would go up high and splash her whole body. But it was quite low, just 2 or 3 feet up in the air, even with water on full power. We found something to set it up one (a bucket turned upside down) so the water would be higher. The other thing to watch out for is that it attaches to a hose, so the children have to be careful not to trip on the hose. But thats probably true for all sprinklers. One more thought...in California we are still careful about water usage so it might be best for people with lawns or areas that need water (I dont have a lawn) so you aren't wasting the water.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitant because I saw some reviews claiming their hose didn\u2019t fit, but I thought I\u2019d give it a chance since the toy seemed sturdy and I like Melissa and Doug. But sure enough, my absolutely normal and standard hose didn\u2019t fit at all, it was spinning freely on the threads. Lucky me, I had an unused 4-feet hose at my disposal, and it fits perfectly. As a bonus, I can leave the small hose attached on the toy at all time and disconnect it from my longer hose, so I\u2019m less likely to break the plastic fitting of the toy. (Here\u2019s the hose I use : https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/gp/product/B00167U0PG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)As for the toy itself, it was shooting 10 feet in the air and all the way onto the patio at first, so I had to crank the pressure down a lot. I really don\u2019t understand why some have complained about getting only tiny jets at best.The toy seems durable, and I like that the flowers and rods are made of silicone. The kids can stumble on them without breaking them or hurting their fragile little toes, which is a plus. My 4 years old really likes it and it is already helping her to conquer her fear of getting sprayed on by a jet of water.",
