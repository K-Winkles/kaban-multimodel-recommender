With the legs screw in and out its easy to take with us so he can use in car even if wanted to or at doctors. It's light enough he can carry it and lift it and perfect pen holder on side as well.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. \ud83d\udc49 Prodotto ricevuto attraverso il programma Vine di Amazon, in modo da testarlo e fornire una recensione obiettiva e sincera.\ud83d\udd0e Ho richiesto questo prodotto per il mio bambino di 27 mesi che ama disegnare e scrivere. Devo dire che la utilizziamo anche noi genitori per ritornare indietro negli anni.\ud83d\udce6PACKAGINGLa scatola esterna in cartonato personalizzato \u00e8 ben realizzato dal punto di vista grafico ed esplicativo rende il prodotto perfetto per un'eventuale idea regalo. Al suo interno troviamo:- 1 x lavagnetta grafica magnetica;- 1 x pennina grafica per lavagnetta con laccetto;- 4 x supporti;- 1 x manuale d'uso.\ud83d\udcccCARATTERISTICHELa lavagnetta magnetica a 4 colori della \u201cSMASIAGON\u201d \u00e8 stata veramente una bella scoperta. Partiamo dal fatto che non si spreca carta e quindi contribuisce a preservare l\u2019ambiente. Inoltre \u00e8 utile per far disegnare i nostri bambini senza il problema di sporcarsi gli indumenti.La scocca esterna \u00e8 realizzata in plastica leggerissima cos\u00ec come la matita in dotazione. Provvista di una maniglietta in gomma per il trasporto e di 4 piedini ad incastro per essere utilizzata come tavolinetto. Il montaggio risulta semplice e veloce.Nella parte centrale troviamo l\u2019ampio spazio dove poter scrivere e disegnare. L\u2019unico accessorio presente \u00e8 la pennina grafica correlata di laccetto e vano porta penna in gomma. Mancano le formine presenti in altri prodotti pari livello. All\u2019interno della cornice, la lastra della lavagna vera e propria consiste in un rettangolo bianco con un reticolo molto sottile, al di sotto del quale si trova uno strato di gel dove si muovono particelle molto fini di frammenti di ferro magnetizzati. Quando il bambino passa la penna con punta magnetica, questa attiver\u00e0 i frammenti di ferro nei punti solcati. Per cancellare il disegno basta far scorrere la barra cancellino bidirezionale di cui \u00e8 dotata la lavagna e che passa sotto tutta la superficie, annullando l'effetto magnetico della penna. Bisogna effettuare 2-3 passaggi affinch\u00e9 il disegno venga totalmente rimosso.Il tratto \u00e8 ben definito e con colorazione (rosso, giallo, verde e blu) preimpostata nei diversi quadranti. Praticamente in base al punto in cui si disegna, questo cambier\u00e0 colore.\ud83c\udfc1CONCLUSIONIAl momento della recensione il prezzo \u00e8 di 23.99\u20ac. In definitiva si tratta di un prodotto veramente utile, rispettoso dell\u2019ambiente e adatto ai piccoli artisti. Mio figlio lo adora e si diverte tantissimo a scrivere e cancellare. Da considerare come ottima idea regalo. Infinitamente consigliato!Spero di essere stato utile \u270c\ufe0f",
