                "reviewText": "Functionality: It's a little lacking, but probably not more than similar products. Our toddler used the toy without much difficulty and enjoyed it. The magnetic pen, board, and balls are very small, but perfect for little hands. The toddler had no trouble using the pen or the board due to their size. However, both she and I found it somewhat difficult to control a single ball through an entire run from the grouping area to the specific jars without losing it a couple of times due to snagging in the maze or pulling away from the board. It wasn't terrible, as I mentioned, not any worse than what I have seen with similar boards, but nothing special.Quality: Overall, I would say it's good. The pen was attached to the board by string and had a nice storage area that kept it secure. Despite its small size, the board was well-made and safe. The front screen was smooth and secure, and the board itself was smooth.Value: Considering the product's quality and the playtime it offers for the toddler, I'd say there's good value at this price. The toy can be used at home and, if held mostly flat, even in the car, which is convenient.Would I Buy? Yes, I would. However, there isn't anything particularly special that makes this magnetic board stand out from similar products. If you appreciate the aesthetics of the jars and are looking for a good toy for your toddler or to give as a gift, I would recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased many of these different magnetic boards for our medical clinic to mount inside our exam rooms. Thanks to covid and other potential germ ridden problems, the majority of our toys for our pediatric patient's had to go bye bye and its not easy to find easy to clean, contained toys to keep the kids busy.These are wonderful for providing distractions for our kids while they are in the clinic and exam rooms. There is nothing more frustrating for staff when you have rooms full of kids who are pounding on walls, jumping off the exam tables, and getting into drawers and cabinets... it makes the overall stress of the job 100 times harder and increases the anxiety of the entire clinic.Mounting one of these in each room has been a godsend. Not only are they fully contained and have no removable parts, but they are simple to wipe down and clean. We had them mounted on the wall so they could not be removed and it gives the kids a focus and something fun for them to do while they wait to see the provider. It seems to help keep the staff AND the parents more relaxed and it is sooo much more joyful in the work day, keeping the kids alot quieter and less disruptive.The magnet that is on a string was busted the first day, but we found a way to replace the string with a wire tether that keeps the magnet itself attached.Honestly, I wish I would have thought of something like this sooner... it really has made a difference in the entire office, especially with stress levels.",
