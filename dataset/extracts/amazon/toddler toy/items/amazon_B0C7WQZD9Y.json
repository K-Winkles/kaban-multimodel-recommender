Some of the cards have the word and the sound i.e. the dog card says \u201cdog woof woof\u201d. But the dress card just says \u201cdress\u201d because obviously a dress doesn\u2019t make a sound. I\u2019m a little disappointed that the letter cards don\u2019t say the sound the letter makes. The cards are a tiny bit more sturdy than a regular card like in a deck of cards. The toy is smaller than I expected but perfect for a toddler\u2019s hands.",

The toy comes with a variety of double-sided flashcards that you can insert into the reader. My daughter quickly got the hang of inserting the cards and loves the interactive aspect.Pros:- Educational: It's a great tool for teaching kids new words and letters.- Engaging: The interactive nature of the toy keeps children entertained.- Durability: It can withstand drops and rough play, making it suitable for young kids.- Adjustable Volume: The voice is clear, and the volume can be easily adjusted.- Large Card Collection: The set includes a wide range of cards, providing good value for the price.- Rechargeable: The toy comes with a built-in rechargeable battery.- Organization: It includes a drawstring bag for keeping everything together.Cons:- Card Orientation: Cards need to be inserted right side up; upside-down cards won't work, which can be frustrating for young children.- Cleanup: Kids may enjoy dumping out all the cards, leading to some cleanup for parents.- Age Range: While suitable for 2-4-year-olds, it may not hold the attention of older children.In summary, this toy is a fun and educational addition to a young child's playtime. It helps expand vocabulary, and its durability is a plus for active kids. While it could benefit from a few improvements, it's a great choice for toddlers.",

My toddler can hear the words pronounce clearly and encourages language development. The sturable design holds up against my toddler's rough handling. The flashcards are built to last. The cards are beautifully designed with vivid colors and attractive illustrations which captivates a child's attention. This toy has helped my child expand their vocabulary and is also made learning more exciting and an interactive experience.

I especially wanted to find a learning toy that would aid speech, reading and be engaging for my four and five year old grandchildren. This learning set is just amazing!I really love this product! It is wonderful for older toddlers and children with speech or language difficulties, English as a second language, Autism etc.First of all when you turn the kitten shaped card reader on, it warmly greets your child. There is a giant dec of two-sided cards that you insert and the device reads the word for them. I love that the vehicle and animal cards also have sound effects (watch the video). It makes reading and learning so fun.This set is well made and comes with a nice carry pouch to hold everything and a charging chord. Yes it is rechargeable, which is wonderful. The illustrations are very engaging and there is such a wide variety of words. They are colour coded and broken into groups like persons, vehicles, foods, vegetables, alphabet, numbers, essentials, animals etc.One of my granddaughters has speech issues and isn't speaking as well as she should. This toy makes her giggle and she tries to repeat the words which is really big! This is great for children learning English as these sight words are ones in every day speech, and will help them gain confidence in reading and speaking the language.This would be a great for gifting or for use by your own child.I highly recommend this product.",
