                "reviewText": "My first two kids were obsessed with the buckles on high chairs and car seats. They could sit all day with a car seat buckle and once they figured out how to get it together they would cry because they couldn't get it un done. Now I have my third who is 18 months and was showing interest a few months ago in all the things we had that buckled. I had to pull her away from another moms car seat while we were out one day and she threw such a tantrum. I accidentally found this toy on Amazon one day and on Easter morning it was in her basket. She was instantly in love. The bright colors attract her to it and she can find it when she wants it among the pile of toys in the playroom. She can easily carry it and the material is so soft I have even let her keep it in her bed when she's resting. She hasn't gotten to the point yet of being able to buckle them if they are all open. She has gotten one together a few times but I like the buckles are different for different colors to help. That will help her with color identification as she gets older. I notice if she's not around my 3 year old likes it as well. The buckles on most things he plays with are tough to get apart, like high chairs and car seats. These buckles are easy to clip without getting pinched and to get apart without becoming frustrating. This hasn't become one of the toys she looked at for a while and put aside, this is something that comes with us in the car, to the store (I like clipping it around the cart handle), to a restaurant and even just on the couch. I am so happy I found this and would definitely recommend it if your kids are into buckles like all mine were. Thank you to whoever make this!!! I guess the only thing I would say is that it's kind of pricey for what it is, but the quality is great and the entertainment time it has provided so far is definitely worth it!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s been 30 years since I\u2019ve had toddlers so I was pretty surprised when my toddler granddaughter suddenly because fascinated with the buckles on her high chair, stroller, and store shopping carts. I almost didn\u2019t but this toy because it seems like she would quickly lose interest, but the other reviewers were so right about this toy holding their toddlers\u2019 attention for a long time. I love watching her so patiently manipulate the buckles until she gets them to click. It was also great for her to learn color matching, and she\u2019s quite fascinated with the princess and the mermaid in particular playing peekaboo under the numbered flaps. I love that she figured out which of the different types of buckles on this toy go together that are not the same color as well. Watching her play with this toy has been unexpectedly fascinating for me as well. It\u2019s been a long time since I got to see the growth and development of babies and toddlers and I love watching her hone her fine motor skills, color skills, identifying numbers 1 through 5, and growing patience and perseverance. Whoever made this toy is a genius!",
