                "reviewText": "These blocks are so versatile in stacking that you can not go wrong when placing one on top of the other. My 18 month old grandson tried them today and really enjoyed them. We took turns putting a block on the stack. However, there is a little book inside to show several towers a kid can make on their own and I think that kids even up to age eight would play with this toy. I wouldn't buy it for a child that age, but to have in the house for visiting children it would appeal to a wider range of ages. There is a nice draw string bag to keep them together in the toy box which is a plus! I am not for sure why the rating features suggest \"for teething\" because it isn't a teething toy. In fact the smaller blocks, I'd remove until I knew the child wouldn't put them in their mouth.",
