We all get a kick out of watching him laugh as he bounces non stop. Sometimes, he'll only stop for a sip of water and just keep jumping until he wears himself out! It keeps him busy and active, and has done a great job of holding up since I bought it in September of 2023. It doesn't slide too much on hard surfaces and does well at standing upright. Additionally, it was pretty easy to inflate and quick to set up.",
