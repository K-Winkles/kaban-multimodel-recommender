There is so much to do in this busy board and it is made impressively well. Matching shapes, color stuff, locks, keys, shoe laces, animals, emotions\u2026. IT HAS EVERYTHING. My KID LOVED IT. And she has so much more to grow to love with it (like she is great at shape stuff, learning colors and yet to learn shoe laces and locks\u2026). This is perfect for travel!!!! So glad I got it + wish i didn\u2019t waste money on plastic reusable sticker books.",

It's got a lot of useful learning materials and keeps him busy (and quiet\ud83d\ude06) For a good amount of time! He does like to throw the small pieces around but that give another learning opportunity for cleaning up!The only thing I would say needs to be upgraded is the velcro pieces. They aren't sticky enough and keep coming off of the book and the small pieces and need to be re-applied. We are just going to buy some better quality velcro and swap it out. Otherwise it's a great purchase!",

Well\u2026it guess it actually was so that\u2019s on me but I would not buy this again. The Velcro is not strong enough for the pieces to stick good. A light shake and everything falls out. I tried putting more than one Velcro dot on the back of some pieces and it didn\u2019t make a difference. My niece is at the low end of the age range for this and even though the tasks are great for her development, this is just not executed very well. Boo",
