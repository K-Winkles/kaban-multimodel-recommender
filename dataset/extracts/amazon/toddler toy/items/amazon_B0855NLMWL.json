                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50The CoComelon Official Musical Bedtime JJ Doll is a delightful and comforting companion for kids, making bedtime a soothing and fun experience.Pros: 1. Musical Bedtime Friend: This plush JJ doll is not just any stuffed toy; it\u2019s a musical bedtime companion. When you press JJ\u2019s tummy, he sings clips from the popular \u201cYes, Yes, Bedtime Song,\u201d creating a soothing and familiar bedtime atmosphere. 2. Soft Plush Body: The doll is made from soft, huggable plush material, ensuring that it\u2019s gentle and comfortable to hold, making it the perfect snuggle buddy for bedtime. 3. Includes a Small Pillow Plush Teddy Bear: The inclusion of a small pillow plush teddy bear adds an extra touch of coziness. Kids can have a mini teddy bear to cuddle along with JJ. 4. Kid-Friendly Design: The doll is designed to be kid-friendly, with no small parts that can pose a choking hazard. It\u2019s safe for children of various ages. 5. Promotes Routine: The JJ doll helps in establishing a bedtime routine, making it easier for kids to wind down and prepare for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep.Cons: 1. Battery-Operated: The doll requires batteries for the musical feature. While this is common for musical toys, it\u2019s essential to have spare batteries on hand.In summary, the CoComelon Official Musical Bedtime JJ Doll is an exceptional addition to a child\u2019s bedtime routine. Its musical feature, soft plush body, and inclusion of a mini pillow teddy bear create a comforting and enjoyable experience for kids as they prepare for sleep. While the need for batteries is a consideration, the benefits of this doll as a soothing and routine-promoting bedtime companion make it highly recommended for parents and caregivers looking to make bedtime special for their little ones.",

Stomach is a little hard to press and mine came defective with a whole which is going to cause me to have to do a bad sew job (my reasoning for giving 4 stars)but my daughter loves Cocomel\u00f3n and it won't last long with the rip. Can I suggest around the busy holidays season to double check items to make sure of these types of things but my daughter loves the doll.",
