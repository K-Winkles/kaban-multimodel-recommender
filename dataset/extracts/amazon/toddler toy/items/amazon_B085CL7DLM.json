Toast is not to be in the toaster. Its proper place is on the floor or tossed at the cat tower.2. The fork is good for gumming on, along with the egg.3. The knife is a warning to all who attempt to pinch her cheeks over the holidays. At least that is how her waving it about like a feather duster has been interpreted.4. The jam jar spins about nicely and makes a lovely \"clunking\" noise when falling from the high chair.5. Lastly the plate. Which somehow can be turned into a Frisbee, spinner, and snack tray, manages to be a daily favorite. Perhaps due to its versatility.",

                "reviewText": "This set was cuter than I thought it would be, the lid actually comes off the jam jar which I didn't expect, the pieces themselves are pretty durable in my opinion so far, the bread pieces aren't cheap and don't feel like they'd crack If my kids accidentally stepped on them which I know they will. I like the 1,2,3 detail in the center of the plate as well as the other small pictures on it, the toaster itself talks about the items it comes with, I love the little breakfast talks it gives, asking to spread the jam on the toast, I think it even said something about making an egg sandwich. So it gives my kids cute food ideas which I like.As for it being age appropriate I believe it said 12 months and up, my youngest who I got it for is 18 months old and he doesn't quite seem to get the concept of how to use the toast. To be fair I didn't at first either. Every kid is different though so my kids experience is likely totally different from yours. Like most toasters and toy ones though I'm usually used the Lever pulling the toast down and popping up after a minute. I pulled the Lever down and it made the toast pop up. My partner had to tell me I'm supposed to manually push the toast down myself a-ha.. I can't say I'm too thrilled with that feature if I had to give this item a con. I don't want my son thinking that's how toasters work.",
