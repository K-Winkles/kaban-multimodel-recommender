My toddler grand has fun building and stacking with these, all while developing fine & gross motor skills, as well as maintaining some focused play. Nice starter size for one child. After we showed him once how to build, and place the peg in the hole, he was off and running with it! The peg holes in the pad are snug, so we encourage his pushing strength to push the peg into place. You can always buy more if needed once you know if yours will enjoy it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 18 month old. Specifically for hand and eye coordination then once he gets older for the colors and the shapes recognition. My 4 year old loves to play with it to! He likes to build towers as tall as him, he likes matching the shapes and organizing the colors as well. My 18 month old likes to stack them up and knock them over. I might have to get another set cause they need more pieces between them both to play without fighting over them.As for the only thing I would change or wish was different would be the base. It\u2019s just a lightweight foam piece and when my kids build anything tall it just topples over. I wish it was a heavier base so they could build tall without me needing to hold it for them.Over all it\u2019s definitely a neat toy and probably something my kids will play with many of times not just a once and done toy. I\u2019m glad I bought it and I\u2019d recommend it to others with kids around 18month-4 years old",
