                "reviewText": "Learning Resources has done a nice job of combining a learning opportunity (colors, sorting, fruit/veggie identification) with a wonderful set of play food that will work great in your child's play kitchen. The set contains 5 plastic \"farmer's market\" bushel baskets with 25 pieces of play food (5 of each color). I mainly selected this item because I was looking to add additional fruits and veggies to our play food stash. The teaching opportunities with this set are just an added bonus for me.There's a nice variety of play food which includes some you don't typically see in other play food sets (eggplant, cucumber, pumpkin, 3 different colors of pepper, yellow apple, peach, plum). Like all Learning Resources play food, the quality is amazing. As an early childhood teacher and a mama, I've seen my fair share of plastic play food and I did a lot of comparison shopping before I purchased the play food for our play kitchen. Unlike others, this food is well sized, very detailed and made of soft plastic (it has a little give if you press it). Take a look at my photos and you can see some side by side comparisons of \"other\" play food (left) vs. the Learning Resources food (right). You'll see from the picture that the Learning Resources food is much more realistic looking. To get a sense of size, I've also included a picture of the tomato and orange pepper on our play kitchen's counter (the Ikea duktig). Another nice touch is that the sorting baskets have a color label on the outside and inside of the basket. It's a thoughtful detail and helps children who may be looking down into the basket when they're sorting.While I'm using this in my home, given that the food is so realistic looking and durable and there are lots of learning opportunities with the set, it would make a great addition to a childcare/school setting as well.** I purchased this product at full price for use in our home. If you found this review helpful, please click the \"YES\" button. Thank you! **",

It great for occupational therapy because it involves sorting by colors, and using their hands to sort. If you are working on color skills this is a lot great for that. I got a great deal on this and wish I had purchased for gifts. This item is also very durable and will last for years to come.",
