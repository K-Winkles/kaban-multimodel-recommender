It is small enough for my nephew to hold it, throw it, crawl over it and still be in good shape. He is able to put the blocks into the toys without issues. The sides of the toy that have the bands are stretchy so he puts additional toys into it too lol. The blocks are big enough so the are not a choking hazard. The cube and blocks are a hard plastic so if he does chew on it they will not break apart.",
