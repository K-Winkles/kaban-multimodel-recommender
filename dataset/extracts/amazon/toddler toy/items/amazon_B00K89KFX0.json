For easy cleanup you can just leave the pieces inside the dinosaur and then when you are ready to play again just dump them out.",

                "reviewText": "My one year old son loves it! And my four year old had fun playing with it with my one year old! Great for both ages! It includes activities that both can learn something from! My son liked to try to put other things in its mouth too. So, be aware of that if you can see your child doing that. But the design is straightforward enough that things don\u2019t get stuck very easily. Just have the coins around it so they\u2019ll be more inclined to put those things in instead.",
