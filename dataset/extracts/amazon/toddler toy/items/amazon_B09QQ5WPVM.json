They are bigger and more chunkier, so easy for her to grasp.She can sit on the floor and play with them, they roll very easy backwards or forward. There is a lot of critters in the set, all different kinds of cute animals.I also like that there is a storage box to put them up in, after play. She is enjoying play with them, she is 1 year old.",

If the photo had been honest it would\u2019ve been a perfect review, it\u2019s perfect if you are looking for small. Check out my photo next to bananas.",
