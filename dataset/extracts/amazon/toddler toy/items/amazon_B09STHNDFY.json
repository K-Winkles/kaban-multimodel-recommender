                "reviewText": "My son likes the set. Lower rating due to poor quality check. There was a lion missing a tail as you can see in the picture. It is not worth a return for me, but I want other buyers to be aware in case they are purchasing a gift for someone else.Update: The company contacted me after seeing my original 2 star review and was easy to work with. I updated the review to a 4 star since they had great customer service.",
