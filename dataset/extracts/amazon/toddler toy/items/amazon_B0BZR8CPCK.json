                "reviewText": "Yay: My 3 year old loves playing with this. Even if they are unable to color sort or count it is still fun to move the beads around. Great to bring to dinner or play in car since it requires no extra pieces!This would make a great gift ages 2-5Nay: it\u2019s large if you plan on putting in diaper bag. I left it in the car and while you drive you hear the beads roll around which is just annoying. My 3yr old also dropped it and scratched the front plastic. It\u2019s still operational but a little disappointing",

I even caught myself playing with this toy...it brought back memories from when I was a kid. It's a classic toy that still delights.",
