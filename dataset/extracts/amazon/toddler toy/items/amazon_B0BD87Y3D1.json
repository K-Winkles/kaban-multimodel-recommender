Nevermind that it doesn't make any sense why you have a carrier for miniature fire vehicles. I gladly purchased this because my toddler has been into firetrucks lately. But what a disappointment when this arrived. First, the scale of the toy is extremely deceptive in the product images. The smaller vehicles also seem to be a mismatch b/c the wheels don't quite fit the tracks on the larger carrier. And the build material and quality are quite different. For the actual size of the toy, it's not worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "This is 100% my fault, the sizing is correct in the description, but I was in a rush and just glazed them over. This was a gift for my nephew and I love that the trucks were all very well put together and not flimsy whatsoever, as he is 3 and I didn\u2019t want any \u201cloose\u201d pieces he could break and choke on! So a great review on the material\u2026. But the photos are a little deceptive when it comes to the actual \u201csize\u201d of the \u201cbig\u201d & \u201csmaller\u201d trucks.",
