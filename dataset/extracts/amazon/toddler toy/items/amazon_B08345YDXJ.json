                "reviewText": "Great little toy! Love all the interactive pieces. The Amazon title clearly says for kids 1,2, 3, 4. In the description it also says for infants. Most of the pieces are suitable for all those ages, but the box clearly says 18 months and up. I got this for my 11 month old and he LOVES it! My only concern is that he likes to stick his hand in the top where the ball goes and as he grows I can foresee him getting his hand stuck. Wish there was a little more consistency on ideal age for this toy, but overall a fun, cheap, easy toy.",
