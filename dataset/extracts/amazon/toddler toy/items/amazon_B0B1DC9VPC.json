Took a star off because the roller stamp came damaged, but other than that, everything was perfect. My son loves to color and this is a great mess free LARGE area for him to color on. Definitely would recommend if you have a little artist.Just a note: my son colors really hard so some of the coating rubbed off and left marks so if you want to avoid that from happening just remind your little one to be gentle!",

The mat was a nice size not a big as it looks on the picture but it's large. It clears up after awhile as long as it doesn't get soaked. My 2yr old thought it would be funny to pour the bowl of water on it and then do his hand prints. It took a good amount of time to dry out and become clear. It also doesn't go back white but a light pink. It doesn't bother me. He's two who cares. Overall I don't regret buying it. It served it's purpose to keep him busy.",

                "reviewText": "I previously purchased this for my niece when she was about 2, and have newly purchased it for my 15mo son -- he had shown an interest in colouring but kept putting the crayons in his mouth, so this option seemed suitable to get him the skills while we learn to not put everything in your mouth. He absolutely loves it! He will point excitedly at the mat (folded up on the shelf) when he wants to use it, squeal when I get the message and take it down, and scribble like a maniac on the mat with the \"markers\". Yes, he tries to put them in his mouth and I have to take it away sometimes, but in general he just loves to scribble. Note that his attention span isn't great so it'll offer entertainment for about 5 minutes before he's onto the next thing, but we use it frequently so it's def getting its money's use :)About the product itself, it is holding up well, no stains on it (as I read on some other reviews), dries nicely, feels durable, comes with lots of accessories (we put most aside, just have a few \"markers\" and stamps out), and has cute animal letters around the outside that he loves pointing at and having me tell him what they are.Def recommend :)",
