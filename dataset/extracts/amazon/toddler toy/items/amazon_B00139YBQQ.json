                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Product, I have MY treadmill back too!",
                "reviewText": "This is a great little manual treadmill for kids (of appropriate age)! It is solidly made of metal, and I've been very impressed. I had one little \"glitch\" and that was that one of the only plastic pieces broke (the belt adjuster) but I was able to fix that by running to the hardware store and getting a washer to hold the tension screw... so far, so good... and I placed the plastic cap back on, so it looks like nothing ever happened.As far as other reviewers with the smell... I believe that is just ridiculous. *Of course* there is a smell at first, it would be silly of anyone to expect it not to! It has metal gears and and belt that moves, it HAS to have a lubricant put on the internal gears, or it would rust and fall apart (since it is made of SOLID metal gears and welded metal tubes!). It would be useful to adults considering purchasing this to use some common sense, if your family can't tolerate smells for a few days, put it in the garage or a room with open windows. We put it in the garage for about 3 days and completely got rid of any odors for us before we brought it inside... but it was definitely the smell of gear lubricant (if you've ever smelled it, you know EXACTLY what it is --no mystery here).As for some reviewers stating that it's not safe, I'd have to say their child must have been too young (be it physically or mentally). All children progress at their own pace, but I can say this, I own an adult treadmill, and my child was constantly trying to walk/run on it... to the point that he would get on and manually \"make\" it run, (yes, he is that strong, lol!) even though it was unplugged. Now that is unsafe, and this little treadmill fixed that problem completely.Now he knows he has his own treadmill, I explained to him that I weight too much to walk on his, and he doesn't weigh enough to walk on mine --and he completely understood. ;) It's working out great, and WE are working out together!!! It's awesome to look over and see your little boy walking with you!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my active 3 year old daughter for Christmas 2011. Since opening, she has been on it every single day, multiple times a day. She uses it for its traditional inteded purpose, but also likes to stand on it and rock back and forth not alternating legs. She likes to throw a big blanket over the entire thing, push down the center and sit on it, pretend she's a baby and swings on it. She also sits on it without the blanket and swings back and forth.I enjoy it because:1. It is very sturdy. I would have thought with all she does with it, it would have fallen over by now but it hasn't! (I have it set up on carpet).2. She is getting a lot of exercise, which is always great; especially during the winter months when we don't do a lot of outside play.3. It keeps her occupied and she has found various uses for it.It was fairly easy to put together, although a couple of steps were missing from my directions; however, it was easy to figure out where the pieces went on the machine by looking at the picture on the box. I did have to take pieces off to fix it, but it was no big deal. It took me about a half an hour to put together.My 9 year old son also enjoys playing on this - very sturdy when he is on it as well, although he is a little big for it so I would not purchase something this size for a child over 6, as I don't think they would get much use or exercise benefit from it. I would reccommend for ages 2-6.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for our three year old, shortly after having purchased a Sunny Health and Fitness Magnetic Recumbent Bike for my wife. While the price between the two was fairly similar (this bike was roughly $35 cheaper) the juxtaposition between the general quality and ease of assembly was pretty overwhelming.My wife's bike went together like a dream, and even though I'd been a bit skeptical when we purchased it, I was really impressed with the quality of it. Based on that success, and hoping to find a good outlet for an exuberant 3 year old during a cold winter, we bought this for our daughter.To preface things, I actually really enjoy assembling things, and like to think I'm pretty good at it. This bike though, was more or less infuriating to put together. It does come with several tools included, which at first seemed like a nice touch. Sure, they were cheap, the wrenches were just punched out of sheet metal, but I appreciated the idea, and started the assembly process without bothering to grab my own tools first.As it turned out, of the included tools, not a single wrench actually fit the nut it was intended for well enough that you could even use it. They were either too small to even fit around, or so big that the slightest bit of torque would just end up spinning the wrench around the nut. I was literally able to tighten things further with my fingers.In that same vein, many of the included nuts and bolts were so thoroughly the wrong size, that they would have been unusable without a lot of extra little bits and pieces that I luckily had lying around. As the most notable example - the bolts for attaching the \"body\" of the bike to the crossbars that sit on the floor came with capped nuts. Obviously, you want to use those for a bike you're building for your child since they're nice and rounded, instead of just leaving the raw ends of the bolts pointed up for your kid to step on, but they can only be tightened down as far as the cap allows, so it's important the bolts are the correct length.The bolts included were almost a full inch too long, which meant that even if you put everything together as tight as it would go, the crossbars were still so loosely attached that the bike may as we'll have been duct taped on. I had to use a stack of washers for each bolt in order to make it work.Had it been for anyone else, I would have returned the thing right then, but no daddy is about to tell his 3 year old daughter that the bike she's been waiting for all week is a piece of junk and she has to wait for that to get straightened out... You figure out how to make it work, and since I had the pieces I needed anyway, I did.Finally got the thing together, despite a slew of other little adventures with poorly fitting parts and flat out terrible design, and while I suppose that technically, it functions, I have nothing good to say about it beyond that.There were no reviews available when I bought this, but given our previous success, I took a chance. This would be easily judged as terrible on its own merits, but having had such a great experience just a week before with a similarly priced bike for my wife, this easily ranks as the worst purchase I've made in recent memory.",
