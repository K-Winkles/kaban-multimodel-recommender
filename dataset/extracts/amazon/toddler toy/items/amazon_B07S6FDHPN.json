                "reviewText": "This is a really cool tracked play-set. The kiddo loves it and it's fun to just watch the dinosaur cars go round and round and crash into each other. The track itself is flexible in the sense that the tracks can shift around easily, which makes for installation and routing to be very easy. Also comes with a couple of ramps and a bridge to allow for interesting track design. The doors function nicely and don't hinder or cause the cars to go off the track, and there are some neat little additional aesthetic pieces to add to the whole scene, as well as a couple of plastic dinosaurs as well. The dinosaur cars themselves are super fun, they are battery powered with a simple on/off switch which allows the tires to spin, so you can even watch them scoot around the house if you want for additional functionality. One is also faster and lighter than the other which is cool because you can then kind of race and battle them together to see which one will fall off the track. All in all, very fun to watch and play with, and the kiddo loves them, which is the most important part. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": ". The track snaps together easily. The bridge isn\u2019t very good but you can just use the two ends of the bridge and remove the center section and it works great. The cars will drain a battery pretty quickly so have extra batteries on hand. one of the cars had light up eyes but the other car did not. Overall this set works and the kids have fun with it.",
