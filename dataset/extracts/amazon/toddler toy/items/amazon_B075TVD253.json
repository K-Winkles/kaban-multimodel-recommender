I bought 200 2.2\u201d balls but it didn\u2019t even cover the whole bottom so I bought 3 more, ending up with 500. 500 seemed a little too much because they were spilling out pretty easily so I ended up returning one of the packs of 100 balls and found that 400 was the sweet spot. As others mentioned, it\u2019s pretty flimsy but it definitely holds up to my 15 month old crawling right on top of things and still keeps it\u2019s shape. We\u2019re both very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this for our playful pit mix who loves balls and hula hoops so I wanted to try a tunnel and ball pit , he immediately tried the tunnel and ironically that was his favorite part but he didn\u2019t like going through the tunnel as much as throwing all around the room and pouncing it . He played with it for about 4 hours straight by himself and there were only a few minor rips in the mesh see through part . He likes ripping things up and I expected it to get ripped but I was surprised how well it held up before ripping . I was able to sew up the rips later to extend the tunnel use since he loves it so much . The only reason I didn\u2019t rate it a 5 star is because I wish the tunnel had a more secure way of attaching to the ball pit and tent to prevent the top and bottom from separating from them when going through it . I was worried this entire thing would get destroyed in minutes but I\u2019m highly impressed with the durability and it holding up with approximately 60 lb rough and rowdy pitty jumping biting and scratching it . The pop up tent has become his hiding hole to save things for later , eat treats , or try and chew up toys . I used a fuzzy dog blanket bed in the tent and a play mat in the ball pit along with some of his favorite pillow type toys . Worth the money for sure ! Hours of entertainment for him and for me watching him.",

                "reviewText": "Just as an intro, I had read a bunch of reviews on this play tent (and many comparable ones,) and they all seem to have many happy customers, with a couple of folks mainly unhappy with general quality/sturdiness.I figured- what they heck- this toy isn\u2019t meant to last like a house, and if it gives my kids even a couple of uses of fun before it shreds, it\u2019s worth it as an experience, being cheaper than say, a trip to a local jungle gym or trampoline/bounce place.That being said - it is surprisingly durable! My kids have been jumping, crawling, and completely abusing this play tent and I simply don\u2019t see where the negative reviews in that regard come from. Perhaps the seller/manufacturer improved the quality since then.So here\u2019s how it all went down:The package arrived, and it was a complete surprise for my kids. No occasion, or reason, except for perhaps the fact that their mother spends too much time browsing Amazon suggestions.As I withdrew the slim, circular pouch from the box, I breathed a sigh of relief as I realized that this would not be responsible for the displacement of an important appliance or necessary item(s) in its stead - it is way thinner and smaller as folded than you would believe. I have very limited closet space, and I actually now store it hung on a hanger in a closet- it\u2019s no thicker than the kid\u2019s spring jacket hanging next to it.And as I opened up the package and proceeded to assemble the tent, my three-year-old literally jumped up and down with excitement and cackled with glee. His entire being physically quivered from the unrestrained joy that this larger-than-his-life, colorful, climbable monstrosity brought to him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him so excited. And all my doubts melted away - sheesh - if I could bring such sheer bliss for $33 to everyone that easily, I\u2019d start a national organization with this play tent featuring in its mission statement.I first propped up the three pieces separately, and it was all I could do to keep the kids from scampering through them before being able to connect them to each other. (It was really simple, by the way. No instructor necessary.)And then, I let \u2018em loose.They spent close to three hours doing EVERYTHING in this play tent. They crawled through it a gajillion times. They sat at opposite ends, and rolled a ball through the tunnel to each other. The played hide and seek, and chased each other in and out. They brought books in, and read quietly inside for a bit. They brought play food into the units, and set themselves up a kitchen. They took linen off their beds, and set themselves up camping.I surmise that any given activity is just waaay more fun inside the tent than outside. I\u2019m beginning to question traditionally held beliefs regarding livability and space. Maybe all we need is a little colorful pop-up tent with someone to share it with to make us happy?Anyhow, this one\u2019s a real hit. I ordered a package of 200 balls separately for a second level of excitement, but really - it\u2019s not necessary. This tent is very entertaining for the kids and inspires a lot of imagination - after they\u2019re done with all the physical activity involved with crawling through it/climbing over it, etc.And folding it up, as packaged (and as stated before) - it\u2019s a pleasure how little space this takes up. The actual disassembly/twisting the three pieces back into shape takes a bit of maneuvering, but once I got the warpy hang of it, it\u2019s not that difficult.All in all, given my kids\u2019 reaction, this is probably my best amazon purchase yet.",

They pounce in it, on it, claw it, bite it, and so far it looks the same as the day we bought it. Very impressed with the mesh netting surviving this long. Some complaints say the hooks come undone (the loops connecting the tunnel) but you need to double twist them. Put the hook/latch thing into the loop. Then twist the loop into a figure 8 shape and then slide the hook around into the top of the figure 8. It is difficult even for my small hands, but they will never come undone. This product is pretty big and takes up a quarter of my living room. Very easy to setup, just open the bag and it pops up into shape.",

My little one loved it all the same. Very quick to assemble as pops into shape as you undo ties. Would recommend. Pegs into grass with pegs provided andball secures together and is fairly robust",
