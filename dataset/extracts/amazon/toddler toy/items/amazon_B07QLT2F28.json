I had my eyes on some other ones promoted by influencers, but when researching and finding dino versions - I knew we had a winner!I was curious to know how these worked when I decided to get them and was worried it would use batteries or electronics, which I don't want in the water, but I figured they are sold as bath toys and work for everyone else. However, I was excited to see metal conduits on the bottom of the dinosaurs that activate the light when they come in contact with water! What an excellent opportunity to teach our kids about STEM!They are durable, adorable, and bright! We can see the light in them whether we have the bathroom lights on or dimmed/off. We like to combine these with our bath building blocks and create little houses for the dinos - which our toddler then successfully destroys with his dino, and we repeat that process!It is a successful product and an item our toddler consistently reaches for! We will be getting more of these in the future!",
