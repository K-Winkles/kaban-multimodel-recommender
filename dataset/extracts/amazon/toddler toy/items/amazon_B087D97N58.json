                "reviewText": "I suggest parents buy a better brand of the bubble solution like Gazillion Bubbles. The mower comes with 4 bottles of bubbles but it's like water. Only a few bubbles blew out then nothing for way too long then 2-3 bubbles then nothing again. I'm glad I tried it out before the child played with it. I already had leftover bubble solution that I noted here. Pour in up to full line & bubbles blew nonstop for more than 15 mins until I shut it off. Update: I still think this is a fun product because the child I bought it for is small for her age (almost 4 but looks 2-3) and she loves it. Yes it might be to flimsy for a bigger child. But the amount of bubbles make it a lot of fun",
