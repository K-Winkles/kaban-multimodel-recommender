It\u2019s the perfect toy to bring in the car for little ones to distract themselves with or anywhere that requires waiting (doctor\u2019s office, restaurants, etc). The size isn\u2019t too big and very easy for toddlers and preschoolers (or older) to use. The quality itself is great, trust me, my kiddos have tested it with tantrum-related slams and throws and has still held up very well!",
