                "reviewText": "Great size for toddler hands, but they aren't as indestructible as they'd seem. Each piece had at least a 2\" sliver of the tip broken off within 5 minutes of drawing on the chalkboard (due to a drop on the floor) which resulted in an inconsistent drawing experience until it was smoothed out. (Tip: you can draw some pretty cool \"waterfall\" effects when this happens; this was my method to circumvent the meltdowns because they were \"broken\".) There is one color that appears that it would draw in some shade of purple, but comes out really close to the orange and peach colors; 3 of the 5 are very similar colors on a chalkboard. Overall, a good purchase for our boys' first set of chalk, but for the cost, we may try another brand next time to get more color variety.",

More expensive than I prefer BUT i feel the price is worth it because it doesn\u2019t contain harmful chemicals, doesn\u2019t break easily, lasts a very long time as long as your toddler isn\u2019t like mine and doesn\u2019t INSIST on throwing it in buckets of water meant for the sandbox every time you look away (it gets soft and begins to break down- it definitely is NOT waterproof).",
