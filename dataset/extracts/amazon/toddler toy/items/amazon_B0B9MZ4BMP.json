After only playing with it 3-4 times, I found her with the little red gear shift toggle in her mouth. It comes out of the zig zag wood pattern quite easily. Shouldn\u2019t leave this toy unsupervised with your little one, I\u2019m waiting to see if any other pieces come loose. But for the cheap price I guess it\u2019s not bad.",
