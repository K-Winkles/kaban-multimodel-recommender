                "reviewText": "I have used the older design on my Swiffer Power Mop. The fibers on the older design were very tightly woven, and really dense and thick. It was harder for me to mop my tile floors because I experienced a drag that made the mop harder to maneuver. The new and improved design is thinner than the old design. The yarn on the new version is not as tightly woven as the older version. The new version's yarn is looped and protrudes outward a bit. It looks kind of like a shag rug. The older version looks like a tightly knitted fabric.Functionally, the new version glides across my tile floor easier than the older version. I think this is because it is thinner and because the fibers are looser and not as dense as the older version. I had no difficulty mopping my tile floor without having to do anything special. The older version had a bit of a drag only on my kitchen tile flooring. To counter this, I had to soak the mopping pad in water to completely saturate it, and I had to poor cups of water on my tiles in order to be able to get the mopping pad to glide easily across the floor. I did not have to do that with the newer version of the mopping pad. I included pictures of the new version, the purple color, and the older version, the blue color, so that you could see the difference in their construction.The older version seems more durable than the new version because it is thicker, more dense, and the yarn is more tightly woven. But in terms of ease of use, the new version wins. It is easier to maneuver on tile floors. It works more like the manufacturer's mopping pads in that respect. Both version were better at removing more dirt comparatively to the manufacturer's disposal mopping pads. There was no difference in how both versions worked on my hardwood floors.This design is better than older version because it is easier to use on tiles. Because of the issues that I had on my tiles, I am glad they re-designed these to work more like the manufacturer's replacement pads. I generally liked these replacement pads over the Swiffer Power Mop replacement pads because I can save a few dollars by using these instead of having to constantly buy their replacement mopping pads. I also feel like I am doing my part to help the environment by helping to reduce waste.",

                "reviewText": "The six 14 1/2\" by 4 3/4\" mop pads have a smooth backing the holds on tightly to the velcro surface of my mop head so they don't slip or wrinkle when I mop the tile floors. They machine wash well -- I let them drip dry afterwards and they are dry by the next morning and ready to use again.The front fabric is rough enough to scrub off the dirt but soft enough to avoid damaging the floor. I found them to work very well as a dust mop when I used them dry on the wooden floors.The reason I only rate them with 4 stars is because they are rather thin and have no padding between the front and the back fabrics. The lack of padding makes them less absorbent when I need to sop up spilled liquids. The lack of padding doesn't affect the way then clean though.",

The dampness picks up more than a dry broom alone.These pads would be the exception. They seem fluffier and more absorbent than my other mop pads, meaning I can actually use them as proper mop heads for cleaning the floor, as well as wiping up liquid messes (as opposed to what usually happens, which is that the liquid just gets pushed around). Since they are absorbent, they also dry my floor more quickly and don't leave as many streaky marks.They stuck easily to my generic mop base. The only thing I needed to do was pull up the washing care tag so that the entire pad could stick to the mop. There is a small elastic loop as well - not sure if it's for a certain brand of mop or if it is just a loop so that you can hang up the pads, but it's handy.Overall, a very impressive and reasonably priced product.",
