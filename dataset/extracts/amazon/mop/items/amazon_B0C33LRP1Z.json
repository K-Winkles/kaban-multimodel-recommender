There's a trigger on the handle which works fine!! No cord or batteries! Only had for a month but love on my hardwood floors!!!! I just use plain water and then toss pad in the washer--such a money saving feature!!! No pads to throw away or buy and you get three pads!!! Great buy!!",

                "reviewText": "I used a Swiffer with the disposable pads before and comparing the two, the pole on the Swiffer is flimsy and weak compared to this one\u2019s. Also the pads are expensive to be buying all the time and I feel like the Swiffer doesn\u2019t clean very well. This one is sturdier yet extremely lightweight and the microfiber pads are great scrubbers and being washable is an absolute money saver! The spray bottle works like a dream too. I love putting my favorite Mrs. Meyers surface cleaner in it. I highly recommend this if you\u2019re sick of your Swiffer.",

                "reviewText": "I love that it comes with a few other pads. It was super easy to assemble and holds enough water solution. Sometimes my hand gets tired of spraying the water but it is so much easier than getting a bucket of water. Easy and efficient - makes the task of mopping my floors more manageable. and it doesn't take must space to store which is a plus! I truly recommend it! Perfect for small homes.",
