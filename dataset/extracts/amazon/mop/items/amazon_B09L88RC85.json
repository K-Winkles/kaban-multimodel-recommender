                "reviewText": "Very easy mop to use, I like how it has a spinning option where the liquid to mop is placed as well as to rinse the water. It can be made longer which is a pro if you plan on cleaning the walls with it. It does come with a brush (head) as well. The only flaw it has is that it does leave water on mop once its spinned down.",
