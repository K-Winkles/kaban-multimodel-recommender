                "reviewText": "This mop will do the job. It comes with an extra mop head and it has the added feature of a scratch pad at the bottom to remove tough debris. The things that keep me from giving it a higher score are the instructions, the use of the scratch pad, and the multi-piece handle.The first step in the instructions is to put piece 1 into piece 5, but I couldn't find piece five, which was hidden by the mop head. I gave this an initial one-star review because I thought it was defective. When I discovered my error, I tried it out and discovered the other things lacking in this mop.The scratchpad is a good idea, but after you've wrung the water out of the mop, the mop head strands get in the way of the pad, rendering it useless. I had to fiddle with the mop strands to uncover the scratchpad, which isn't great since you have to do it every time you wring out the mop.The issue with the multi-section handle (besides the obvious unscrewing with use) is that one of the connectors gets in the way of the wringing action and makes it feel bulky and a little awkward.If I wanted to get picky (I usually am), I'd take away another star for calling it a \"self-wringing mop\". But it is your'self' that does the wringing, so maybe that's the answer... right.",
