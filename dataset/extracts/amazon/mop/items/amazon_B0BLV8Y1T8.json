I like that you can use it as a dry mop or wet. A big money saver because the wet and dry Swiffer cloths aren't cheap.",

These stay on thight even when scrubbing, and absorb surprisisngly well for the polyester fabric. I just rinse out what ever cleaner I have used, and squeeze them out. They are dry in several hours. I also put them on my hand and dust away what the paper dusters Do Not hold that gets me sneezing Unnecessarily. I have used with strong diluted cleaners, bathroom foaming cleaners, dusting spray and steamy hot water. For a muddy floor just saturate one and flip it off in the sink, replace a second which a tually takes less time thean sticking my fingers into those sharp and pinching corners of the dry or wet mop and clear up any resdue with a nice \u201cfantastic\u201d or cleaning spray. If you ned it dry fast use a 3rd to polish it to a shine.I have bought more for my daughter and she loves them. They save. Ton of money for the overpriced cloths that don't hold the dirt as well as these pads do when wet or dry. Thank you to the common sense inventor and manufacturer of this great product! I like the green color as well.",

These are amazingly easy to put on my Swiffer dry green mop and are very absorbent and seem to scrub REALLY well. My floors look and feel cleaner and the product washes up nicely. I did not dare put them in the dryer to make sure they didn't shrink. Left them on my countertop overnight. They dry fairly quickly if you put them Terry cloth outside texture side up (not the more meshy under side up). I would buy more but these got my floors covered. Only needed 6/8 for my most recent cleaning adventure.",
