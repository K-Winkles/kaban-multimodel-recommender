I would have to say that they only thing that I don't like about them is how much larger they are and how they fit too snug in spinning compartment, but they do the job well and come clean when you wash them.",

                "reviewText": "While these aren't exactly a \"bad\" product, I will not likely purchase again and am only giving 3 stars.Who knew there was such a thing as too absorbent? At first glance they appear to be the same as the brand replacements, but upon further inspection and observation, they are not. They do their job, sure enough, but I am leaving this review so that others can make a better educated decision. The strands are longer by at least 2 inches. Once they have absorbed to their capacity, they are heavier. They absorb way more than the original brand replacements. So, I guess that's bad for me peraonally because *my newly refilled mop water is being soaked up and wrung back into where my \"used\" water goes. (Let me clarify that I use a 2 gallon plastic mop bucket that I've inserted into my spin bucket. This is my clean water. When I wring the mop, the used water goes into the spin bucket). So after only about 4 times of dipping my mop into the clean water, my entire 2 gallons of freshly poured mop water is in the used water bucket. As far as moping goes, it does the job efficiently enough, but it doesn't glide as easily as the originals. It kind of drags a bit. I will use them but when it's time to replace these, I'll pay the few extra dollars for the originals.",
