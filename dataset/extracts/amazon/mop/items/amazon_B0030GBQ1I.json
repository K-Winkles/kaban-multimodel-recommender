                "reviewText": "Necessary To Know- This Fits Quickie Mop that requires S Refill PERFECTLY. I bought this because I found a measurement for the spacing of the screw mounts and it fit perfectly on my Quickie floor mop. The sponge looks good and so do the attached Scrubbers. All considered, this is Great and Comparable to the NameBrand replacement at about Half The Price. I'll be using these from now on. Looks like it might even outlast my old ones, will have to wait and see.",

                "reviewText": "The sponge part is an artificial sponge. It did not pick up all the dirty water. At the end of each stroke on the floor, there was a mark of some of the dirty water that was not all absorbed. I had to compensate by carefully lightening-up pressure at the end of each mop stroke. When I used a Quickie mop replacement, that was real sponge and it absorbed all the dirty water. It left no mark at the end of the stroke and was easier to use.The one positive of the Lola was the scrubbing edges on the front of the mop. But that was not enough to compensate for the poor mopping - in my opinion.",
