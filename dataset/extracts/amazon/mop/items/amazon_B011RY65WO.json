I have started the ceilings and walls and what I have done so far in 1 hour would have taken me so much longer than doing it by hand or a normal mop. I am very happy with this mop. Has made spring cleaning so much easier and it's a worth while product",

                "reviewText": "I want to say this was great, however, the head would not stay in place for cleaning against the door frame & base boards. To extend the handle we had a terrible time getting the handle grip to loosen so the handle could be extended. But when we did the handle extended the item was helpful but not as easy to manuvere as I had hoped. If I was in the same bind as this year needing a wall mop I would most likely buy this model. Having popcorn ceiling texture this would not work as the clothes will catch on the texture.",

                "reviewText": "It does what you expect, it didn\u2019t surprise me. There\u2019s a lot of love and hate with this mop, but I don\u2019t regret buying it simply because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else significantly better in terms of a mop for the walls and ceilings.The love: the duster is great at removing dust off the door, baseboard, and walls - especially for my high vault ceiling which is the highlight of this mop. For the wet mop, it works well if you have a large area you just want to generally wipe for cleanliness. Works great if you have smooth surfaces/wall (non-textured).The hate: the screwing on the mop head and the extension handles keeps coming undone when I\u2019m trying to scrub hard with it. The wet mop itself doesn\u2019t slide smoothly on my textured walls when I\u2019m cleaning the edges/corners - it flips and flops, so you gotta work extra hard to clean than expected. Because I have textured walls, the wet mop doesn\u2019t remove harsh stained areas that well - I had to get Mr clean magic eraser to do the job, then use the wet mop to remove the residues. Although, on smooth non-textured surfaces it works like a charm.",

I have bought 2, the second bought few weeks later to use in other premises. The first purchase has a shiny metal looking handle which does slip a bit, again I can negotiate that as considering it is time to replenish the cleaning agent. The second purchase of same item, bought only a few weeks later has an appalling handle. As soon as I extended it for the first time, the handle came apart completely, and I was holding part of the extension handle in each hand, and am unable to put it together again so it works. This ones colour is yellow (colour does not matter, its just interesting that the yellow one was a real dud). I live in Australia and the bother of returning the whole purchase to USA for the handle is just too much of a hassle. The head fits other handles I have so it is not a drama, but really for the price the handle should not separate at first twist. I use extension handles all the time and this is the first time this has happened.",
