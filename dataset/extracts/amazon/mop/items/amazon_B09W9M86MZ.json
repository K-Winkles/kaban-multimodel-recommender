I bought the mop in September and I'm looking into replacement heads now(that I have not found yet.) I love the ratchet wringing and microfiber, without getting your hands wet or dirty you can get the mop very clean and as dry as you'd like for any occasion to include storing almost right away. Sometimes the mop gets hung up when lifting to wring which is expected and the scrubber can wear and cause the head to fall apart (my first mop head). The pole is four pieces and feels like it's going to break with the heavy duty messes but it's holding up minus some rust at the bottom of the pole (don't leave it in water). The manufacturer should consider separate replacement parts and a slightly stronger stitch pattern, but the current one works.",

A red flag was that it was titled \"Instruction,\" singular, not \"Instructions,\" plural! Singular vs. plural is FIRST GRADE ENGLISH! And it was awful from there. It was not clear in how to put it together, and, as a result, the wringer did not work. After about a half hour, I figured out it was assembled wrong due to the poor instructions, but I wasn't about to touch the filthy mop head and try to fix it. Just awful!",
