                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As you can see from the video, I use a collapsable bucket to save space (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PVBMSNM/). In the same vein, I wanted a mop that didn't need its own shenanigans of a bucket draining system that takes half of my already-tiny-place to be stored. Then comes this heaven-sent idea which actually worked better than I expected. Assembly was pretty straightforward for me and it was ready to go in less than a minute! operating it was also simple, dip, ring, mop, then dip and ring again. Voil\u00e0! the cloth is really absorbent and yet, when rung properly, doesn't drip anymore and you can store it standing to dry. The fact that the head can be detached to be washed is genius, especially that the mop comes with two heads so you can keep using it while one is being washed. Additionally, the tip has a floor-safe scrub pad that you can use to deep clean certain spots when needed - pretty thoughtful! The stick is long enough to keep you comfortable when working, and all in all, I believe that along the price tag, this is pretty good deal. Okay, almost perfect, but could have been really perfect if a more neutral and subtle color was alternatively offered (like light grey?) but that's ok, won't snatch a star from a perfect score.+ Great space-saving idea: self-rings and can standup to dry+ Head can be washed separately, 2 heads are offered+ A non-scratch scrub pad comes on top for deep cleaning without ruining your floors+ Good quality and just the right length+ Easy assembly and operation- Why is that strong purple the only color option?",

                "reviewText": "This mop will get the job done if you're casually cleaning but it's not good for bigger projects. it does absorb and does clean the dirt and grim. It just doesn't feel very heavy duty or sturdy to me. At points I had a difficult time getting the mop head off.It really does work, I've just had better mops in my life. For the price, it is worth it though.",
