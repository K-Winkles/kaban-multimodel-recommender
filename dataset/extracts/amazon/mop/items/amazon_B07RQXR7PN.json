                "reviewText": "I am not satisfied with this product at all. There are three problems with it that makes it not perform like my old one that I had for over 10 years. one: The pressure on the entire mop is not evenly distributed, so instead of cleaning the entire 18 inches, only the middle six inches actually put enough pressure on the mop to touch the floor and clean that area. Secondly, taking the removable mop on and off is a nightmare. usually you step on the button and the mop collapses and the mop pad is easily removed and stays on the floor. Not with this one, the mop pad is so tight and the construction so poor that every time you have to push the button with you hand and pry the mop pad off of the mop, and it is just as a pain in the neck to get it back on to continue cleaning. Thirdly, the place where the two bottom mop handles are attached wiggle loose and require you to try to tighten them up at least 5 times with slippery soapy hands.I guess that I wont buy a cheap look alike version of my name brand mop again since the frustration today was not worth the savings.",
