                "reviewText": "I've had mixed feelings about the \"assemble your broomstick\" type items, but this one is a winner!Tip: Use plumbers tape (or maybe thin masking tape) on the threads to get the segments to really stay locked and not come loose.At $15, this thing is a steal. Plus you can break it down for storage and put in a bag, that's pretty awesome.It works great, and the extra wide style is the best. It's super light and works wet or dry and is a joy to use on stuff that is not a joy to deal with.",

                "reviewText": "I should have bought this sooner! This reusable mop works great for both wet and dry surfaces. Comes with 4 reusable microfiber pads that are easy to wash. easy to buy replacements. They connect by Velcro and feel secure if you are getting replacement pads, make sure that they are 18 inch ones. As you can see from the second picture they also have a clip on them so you can essentially put a rag and clip the rag on as well. The handle was strong and long so I was able to reach spots without having to bend over too much to clean wet. I just use a spray bottle full of diluted Lysol multipurpose cleaner, spray on the floor and then use the mop simple as that. I'm very happy with this purchase. Good value for the money would definitely recommend. Happy cleaning.",
