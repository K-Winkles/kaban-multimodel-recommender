Just make sure you soak it in Hot water before you use it for the first time as it comes in very hard but after soaking it it softens right up and remains soft. If you try to wring it out before it is soft you will damage it. Otherwise I can see this lasting years. I hate that the comments are for three different mops",

                "reviewText": "I use this mop often and while it does a very decent job, it is difficult to expel the excess water. You see, you have to pull up the mop head until it reaches a grid on the pole. then you have to twist to wring the mop. I have arthritic hands and twisting the mop head causes me much pain. And releasing the head to get the mop action is still a hit and miss for me. I bought one for my Mom as well. At 86 , she finds it looks better in the corner and she'll continue to get on her hands and knees to scrub the floor. Both of us have pinched our fingers trying to use this mop. Please work on a better way to wring the darn thing. Oh, and sometimes the handle slips into short mode. Some how it releases the lock and shortens mid stroke. That's a bit dangerous for elders.",

                "reviewText": "I clean houses part time. This is my third purchase of this product in a year. Why third? Because just like other pics describe, it break when rinsing. I think the plastic just stretches out and it slips down. Why not make that piece more solid? You can push it back up into place, but that\u2019s super gross to touch a dirty mop over and over. And then when I try to rinse, I have to hold top in place. Very cheaply made for the price I pay. Unfortunately I need a telescoping handle to fit the mop neatly in my trunk. Another maker could totally make a telescoping handle on a better mop and i\u2019d buy it. In the meantime, I will continue to buy this piece of crap, because they have me by the short hairs. I need it to compact. So, thanks for your expensive, piece of crap mop that doesn\u2019t last, but that I\u2019m forced to buy for lack of another telescoping mop. I will switch the minute I see one come out.Mixed rating: Great idea. Horrible production.",
