                "reviewText": "Ok, I will be honest, I was ready to return the item but after using the system a bunch of times, I am totally converted. First of all, if you are reading reviews about the pole seeming weak or like it is going to break, that means the person did not follow the directions properly when it was assembled. The pole assembly is in a specific direction and if not done correctly, it will indeed feel like it is going to break. Once assembled properly it is very strong. Second, even though the bucket is not that big, it means it is light enough to carry and the square shape means it will be super easy to store. Third, in spite of the small bucket, a little goes a LONG way because the system separates the dirty water. Fourth, the mop lies flat so you can easily mop under dressers and beds. Fifth, the mop comes with an extender so it\u2019s great for taller people or to clean walls.Yes it is annoying that you have to rotate the head to clean both ends but I\u2019d rather do that than constantly clean out the bucket. Yes the mechanism is a little stiff at first but with use, it gets easier and easier to clean the head.The pads also seem better at scrubbing the floors compared to other mop systems and it\u2019s great that this comes with extra pads.I am quite happy with this product even though I initially felt it was too much to spend on a mop. As an apartment dweller, this system works well for my needs.",

It\u2019s great on the walls and I love the seperate water chambers.A few things I don\u2019t like but can over look:The mop rod keeps unhooking. This is annoying but I can overlook it, it\u2019s an easy fast fix.The chamber you put the pad in to get clean water does get a bit dirty but not as bad as if it\u2019s all one bucket.The last thing which I can\u2019t seem to get over is all my mop pads are ripping. The center edge where you dunk it in the water has shredded on 2 of the pads which makes it extremely hard to use. Also it\u2019s been less then a month\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to get replacements, I don\u2019t feel like I should have to pay for them. But I don\u2019t want to return the whole thing either.",

                "reviewText": "It really does separate the clean water from the dirty water. It does this by scraping the dirty water off and depositing it in a dirty side then you move the mop over to the clean side and refresh the mop with clean water. It's a little on the drier side - like a well wrung out regular mop, but on today's floors that's probably a good thing. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, but I don't think it's worth much. Their website is closed down and they don't respond to emails. The pads that you use to clean with started hanging up when I was getting more water, and when I looked they were starting to rip at the seems where they're held on to the mop. I don't think they'll last too long, but so far I've been pleased with this and would recommend, even though it is quite pricey.",

                "reviewText": "For me, $70 was a major investment in a mop and I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. So far it is. I have never \u2026 I mean NEVER enjoyed mopping before. Now, I find it so immensely satisfying to see that nasty water separate to another compartment so that I can then refill the mop with clean water. Don\u2019t judge\u2026but our house used to be one that got mopped like every six months. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05 Since this lil dude arrived? Weekly.I use this on our hardwoods, linoleum, and ceramic tile. It works really well on the hard wood and linoleum. The tile does ok, but I can tell that I will likely eventually have to scrub the grout separately.My one complaint: i noticed it was harder to push the mop down on one side compared to the other. The edges of my mop cloth on that side have frayed and torn because I was stubborn / naive and thought \u201cIt just needs to be broken in. We shall persist as auntie Elizabeth tells us\u2026\u201d Bad idea in this instance. I can mend the cloth so it\u2019ll be alright. I know I will just have to be less forceful than in the future.It\u2019s worth it. One star got knocked off because I don\u2019t think many folks will be as inclined as I am to mend a torn cloth for mopping.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Reading all the bad reviews on the handle almost scared me off of this product but then I recalled the tide pod challenge and decided to chance it.Lo and behold, if you actually assemble it correctly, you\u2019ll find the handle is plenty strong. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d 275lbs. I think if it\u2019s strong enough for me, it\u2019s strong enough for you. Just make sure you read the instructions and for you crayon eaters, look at the pictures. There\u2019s no hope for you tide pod eaters, just buy a wood mob and don\u2019t burn what brain cells you have left.I use this to clean the floor in my Snap-On truck. The floor is full of mud and dirt this time of year and I can clean the entire floor like new with only one bucket. Traditional mops, I have to change the water 3 times and it still dries dirty.",
