                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I own a high-end cleaning company and have tried many mops through the years and this is by far the best I've had! I have used the O'Ceder mop and bucket for over 5 years now for my Aromatherapy cleaning business. I have gone through two in 5 years. Let me just say this to all the negative reviews... \"YOU MUST WASH MOP HEADS BEFORE FIRST USE\".These are microfiber and like anything \"microfiber\" they have a natural oil base which makes them feel yucky at first. Causing them to smear, smug, \"flip an flop\" (or stick to rough surfaces like stone or other rough tiles, etc.) and basically if they're not washed first, they are not going to work very well.With that said, I have been using this mop and bucket and all my customers have purchased one just to have it because they love the results when I am done cleaning their home. I am super anal about streaks on the floor and in my business, it is important to \"never leave behind a film\". And I hate having to go back and wipe up smudges on my hands and knees! Let me also add, that I clean high-end RV's with super shiny marble flooring and I never have any issues as I have seen some of these reviews claim.Here are a few tips and tricks I've learned through the years that will help you avoid some of the mentioned...HOW TO USE THIS MOP FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS:1. Vacuum floor thoroughly. (This is probably the most important step that people skimp on) How dirty is your floor after you vacuum? You may want to get an industrial mop for filthy cleaning jobs. Although I have done some really bad floors with this mop and it never failed me!2. Always wash your new mop heads before your first use and after major cleanings.3. Always use HOT water when you mop your floors. The hotter the water the better results you'll get. Think \"STERILIZE WITH STEAM\"4. Spray the floor with cleaner and then mop over with your HOT, wet microfiber O'Ceder mop.5. Be sure to spin all access water off! (Pump the pedal 3-5x's at least) This helps deliver smooth strokes across the floor, and also helps with the prevention of access of water in cracks that could cause mildew.By doing the above process you will see a shine like no other and you will LOVE LOVE LOVE Your O'Ceder mop just as much as I do! Hope this helps you all!",
