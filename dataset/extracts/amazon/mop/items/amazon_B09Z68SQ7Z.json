            "HIGHEST QUALITY MICROFIBER: Better Microfiber quality means more coverage. The density of microfiber allows it to hold six times its weight in water as compared to regular cotton mops. This means that one mop head can go for about 400-500 square feet at a time before being stored for washing",
            "MAX CLEAN: This mop is very fine blend, allowing it to secure dust, and dirt within the actual fibers. Compare this to cotton, which pushes dirt and debris around instead of picking it up compared to tradtional mop heads",
            "SUPER DURABLE: These mop refills just don\u2019t wear out. You\u2019ll be using these commercial mop heads for years and it\u2019s machine washable!",
            "HIGHLY ABSORBENT: Lint free mop has the ability to grab dirt and not let go! The mop is super absorbent it\u2019s really ideal for cleaning up spills. This means it\u2019s a great mop for use in fast food restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, kitchens or anywhere else liquid is spilled. as a scrubber!",
            "USAGE: Ideal for smooth surfaces and rougher surfaces like concrete and can be used on any floor surface (hardwood, laminate, tile, vinyl) at home, office, school, hospitals etc. This mop head will fit onto any standard mops."
