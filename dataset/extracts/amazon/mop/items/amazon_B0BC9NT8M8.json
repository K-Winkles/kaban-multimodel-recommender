The mop heads are great also. Two came in this order and the ones I have from the previous mop do fit in this mop just as well. It is a good deal since I had to buy one- and did not need a mop bucket at this time.",

                "reviewText": "The handle pieces screw together and you make as long or short as you want. Having multiple heads is nice so you change it more frequently. The only thing that would make it perfect, in my opinion is if it had a grip that allowed the mop to spin inside it while spinning it, preventing your hand from potentially getting burned or rubbed while holding it. Otherwise, quality is fair and heads are pretty easy to pop off. You can stand on the mop head \u201cstrings\u201d on either side and jerk the mop handle up to remove cover, and simply put new cover on floor and press handle into it to click.",

This really holds up and a great value to. They are cheaper here than that Chinese site temu. And you'll get it in a couple days instead of a couple weeks. Just buy it. Your wife and bare feet will thank you.",
