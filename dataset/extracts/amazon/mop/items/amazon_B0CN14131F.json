I like this small, light weight spray mop. It is light and feel very sturdy when mopped the whole house. The spray is very powerful and easy to use. I was intrigued with the spray mechanism, but I could not figure it out. It came with 4 easily removable pads and all together is enough to clean my whole house. I then threw the 4 pads together with a couple of rugs to the washing machine to clean up.I think this works well with any hard surface floor and I recommend that you give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a mop for our trailer and was interested in something that would clean easily and not cost much up front, or throughout the time that I had it. I ordered a BUUROOHM spray mop cleaner. The microfiber spray mop is designed for home, or business use. It has a flexible rotation mop head to reach difficult spots with its 360 degree rotation while measuring 17\u201d long X 5\u201d wide. The mop cleans hardwood, laminate, or tile floors. It comes with a dry cleaning mop, 6 washable, reusable pads, and a 500 ml (16.9 oz) bottle, 1 scraper, 1 mop holder that will hold up to 22 lbs.I really do like the pads because they also attract hair, dust, and oils, and absorb fluids. The microfiber pads adhere to the Velcro tightly on the bottom of the mop. The mop itself is really easy to use. You need only be pull the Then the pads can be machine washed after use. When you want to use the spray mop, squeeze the handle to release the cleaning fluid. You do need to make your own spray cleaner and it is recommended that you not use hot water or strong chemicals in the cleaning bottle since this could cause the bottle to become damaged. So you should definitely mix your cleaning mix with warm, or cold water before adding to bottle.The only time that I wasn\u2019t totally sure about my mop is when it first arrived at my home. As I was opening the super compact box, I noticed that the instructions were printed on the end of the box. They weren\u2019t difficult to follow, just a bit awkward to have to look at the end of the box for each step. I would have preferred a printed piece of paper inside the box. Thankfully the pieces went together easily, but I\u2019m not totally sure how long that the mop will last. It doesn\u2019t seem to be of very high quality. But I do think that it will be just fine for what its purpose is for, which is cleaning the floors in our trailer. It works just fine.",

The difference is stark! Unlike my previous mop that felt flimsy and lacked efficiency, my new mop boasts exceptional craftsmanship. The microfiber mop stick is absorbent, holding onto water efficiently without getting soaked easily.One of the standout features for me is the inclusion of additional mop heads. This thoughtful addition allows me to use multiple mops while some are in the wash. It's a small but impactful detail.The misting effect of the spray is genius. Unlike other mops that spray water in a forceful stream, this mop gently mists, preventing excessive water usage. This not only ensures thorough cleaning but also facilitates quicker drying of the floors. It's an absolute game-changer, and I'm genuinely impressed by how efficiently it helps in maintaining dry floors post-cleaning.",

There are a few things I would change but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.The prosIt\u2019s lightweightLarge spray areaLarge mop head to clean a bigger area at oncePivoting 360 mop head to get in small spacesUse Wet or dry6 microfiber washable padsConsHard to remove bottle to refillNo cushion on handle , hurts my handThe mop came in a small box and pieces were all separate as pictured. It was pretty easy to assemble, most pieces just snap together . It comes with an attachment that you can hang in your broom closet or wall to hang it up which is nice. The mop itself is lightweight and a lot smaller than expected but the coverage area is great . The bottle that holds the cleaning solution is small so depending on how big your home is you may have to fill each mop. It is hard to remove to refill though . I did struggle with that as there is no where to grip it .The microfiber mop pads are great, they do a great job of pulling up the dirt and do not leave the floors overly wet when mopping . It comes with a small brush attachment , I wasn\u2019t sure what it was for until I looked back at pictures. I believe they recommend using it to scrape off hairs on the mop pads. It may also be nice to scrub tough dirt or stuck on food when mopping.As mentioned in the cons there is no cushion on the handle and after a few minutes it started ti get painful as it\u2019s a hard plastic . I had to wear a glove when mopping so my hand didn\u2019t hurt . That is the reason for not giving five stars .",

It definitely helps get the job done quicker.It feels sturdy and I have had no issues with the spray.Having 4 extra pads is just great as i can throw the used ones in the laundry and dont have to get to washing them right away!!",

I can remove the mop head and throw them in the washer and reuse again. The spray tank can hold enough for a month\u2019s worth of cleaning solution.",
