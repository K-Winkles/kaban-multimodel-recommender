                "reviewText": "These are old style like mopheads, the kind seen in schools, that work with a classic clamp mop handle. These are capable for doing tough dirty jobs, where I want to apply lots of water and cleaning solution to an area, and then squeeze the mop out, then go over the area to absorb all that dirty water back up.These mopheads are, from what I understand, a blend of (75%) cotton and (25%) rayon. To me, they feel slightly lighter, when wet, versus traditional all cotton mopheads, which are much heavier.Because of the rayon, I think this ads to the mopheads ability to clean and hold water more diligently and efficiently, especially as for absorbency, they do absorb.They are easy to use, I simply clamp onto their reinforced head. I have had no issues with their durability, such as loose or disintegrating mop strings.I do not throw mopheads into the wash machine, however, I do hand wash them in the utility sink and/or a bucket. These wash clean and seem to have a faster drying time than all cotton mopheads. If they are too soiled, I toss them.The price is reasonable, at about (20%) cheaper than a competitor [December 2023].Country of origin?Made in ChinaListing accuracy?I think the listing\u2019s emphasis is more on cotton than the rayon blend that these are.WeightThese are about (1\u00bc) pounds (dry) each, slightly lighter than an all-cotton mophead.They arrived shrink-wrapped, which I appreciated.I have no real negative complaints, therefore, am rating them five (5) stars, surrounding my particular use.I hope my thoughts helped add information.",

Plus, there is three in a pack which means I'm not constantly hunting for a clean head.My only small gripe is that they're a bit heavy when wet, but hey, that just means they're doing their job. They are a solid choice for anyone who wants a heavy-duty mop head that can handle anything. These are the big boys.

I've gotten some that were almost too thick to wring out well. Like other mop heads, it seems like it takes a couple mops for them to break in nicely. I meant to prewash a mophead before using it, but, then had company coming over on short notice and had to just use it out of the package as it was. It did work fine like that. Haven't had any loose string yets, though I've only used a couple of times.I will update if they don't hold up, but, so far no complaints and I anticipate they'll last as long as my other mop heads have.",

                "reviewText": "One of my new year's resolutions was to find more sustainable ways to clean. I bought these wet mop heads to replace disposable pads and the chemical solutions they use. These cotton blend wet mops come vacuum sealed but shake out instantly once you unwrap them. They attached to my standard mop handle (not included) and fit perfectly. Once attached to the mop head, I tackled the basement floor. First time ever. These mops are absorbent. I had to change dirty water so many times, there's no way a Swiffer could have done the job effectively. If you have a big area or dirty job to do, seriously consider old school wet mops. You won't be sorry and neither will your budget. Thanks!",

These actually weren't bad at all they cleaned the floor good and didn't leave behind a lot of water when done. I primarily used them on my up stairs tile and wood floors and they did a nice job over all.They arrived well packaged. They arrived in good condition. They were of a good quality. They were at an affordable cost.Overall I would recommend these mop heads",

                "reviewText": "The kCarpoly brand's \"3-Pack Mop Head Supplements\" appear to be a high-quality and versatile option for mopping various floor types in residential and commercial settings.The heads are well made, durable, and clean well.They are easy to keep clean by either hand or machine washing. I recommend hand washing to keep floor residues out of your washer. If you wash them in a washer, do so alone or with a towel to help balance the load and avoid transferring dirt from the floor/mop to your other laundry.Don't use any form of fabric softener so that you will maintain absorbency in the mop heads.Pros:Durable: Made from high-quality cotton materials for long-lasting use.Absorbent: Cotton rope design effectively soaks up spills and water.Lightweight and easy to use: Weighs only 480 grams (16.9 ounces) and has a circular end for maneuverability.Versatile: Suitable for wet and dry cleaning on hard surfaces like hardwood, tile, stone, concrete, and vinyl.Reusable and washable: Machine-washable for easy cleaning and repeated use.Universal headband: Fits both clip-on and side loading mop handles.Cons:None that we've noticed.General:A product of China.",
