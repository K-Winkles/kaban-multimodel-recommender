This mop and bucket set comes with a half-and-half compartment where you have clean water on one side and wring out the dirty water on the other side. The lid really does a good jump of squeezing out the water so the mop is not too wet and not too dry. It also comes with extra replacement pads for rotating through the mop heads. So far so good!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this mop/bucket set! It's a game changer for me personally and professionally. In addition to cleaning my own house, I clean houses on the side for extra cash. This mop and bucket makes mopping a breeze. The overall weight of the bucket (even filled) is lightweight and easy to lug around, room to room. The bucket design is brilliant; one side for the clean water and cleaner of your choice, while the other side has a \"squeegee\" effect, pulling away all the grossness to a separate compartment. This makes the \"clean\" water side last far longer than conventional mop buckets. The head of the mop is cloth, but strong enough to tackle sticky, muddy floors while still being soft and gentle on expensive hard wood flooring. I personally appreciate the removable and washable mop clothes. This set comes with 3 in total, so you always have a clean one handy. This is an affordable practical set that I highly recommend for anyone with hardwood/tile/linoleum flooring. Excellent product!",

                "reviewText": "Really do love this mop. Simple to use. The entire pad gets dirty and not just where the Velcro is like my other mop.The lid only goes on one way so you need to pay attention to what side you fill with water. Filling it half way is enough to get the pad clean when you dunk it in and out.Minus a star because I can\u2019t find additional mop pads. These pads have the tab built into them. Wish it came with more pads.",
