                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. THIS GIRL DOES!! I never really liked cleaning, let alone mopping, but having recently discovered the intoxicating smell of purple Fabuloso, I\u2019m now jumping at the chance to clean. When searching for Fabuloso, this mop and bucket came up in the results, so I figured I\u2019d give it a try. I thought it would end up in the closet along with all the other systems for mopping that I had tried. But not this one! It has a prominent place for easy access when needed. I jump at the chance to use it. Easy to fill with water and even easier to dump with the sturdy handle. The mop head (it comes with 2) is easy to attach and detach from the mop, can be thrown in the wash if needed, and really does a superb job of cleaning. The spinner works great, and you can customize how wet or dry you want the mop head, by pumping 2-3 times, or 6-8 times. The more you pump, the less wet the mop head is. And when you\u2019re done, and rinsed the soap and dirt out, you can spin till it\u2019s practically dry! No more moldy or musty mop heads!! The mop handle is screwed together and has a handle that you hold while spinning to allow the pole to spin in your hand. That\u2019s the neatest feature! The mop head swivels to get under spaces too!I LOVE THIS MOPPING SYSTEM! Going to dispose of all the others!And it works with wood or tile floors too.",

Mopping was not my favorite thing because well it grossed me out to touch the dirty water or dirty mop. I have tried the swifter but found it didn't clean my floors and way to expensive for the pads. My mom had a more expensive spins mop and I loved it. I found this one much cheaper and ordered it June. I use it twice a day and absolutely love it. It works just as my mom's expensive one. It cleans my kitchen floor perfectly. My kitchen floor gets most of the traffic because let's face it \" the kitchen is the heart of the home \"., and the spin and mop does not disappoint. Two months later it is still the best. Plus you get two mop heads which are machine washable and hold up nicely in the washer. Buy the Fabulouso spin and mop bucket you won't be sorry.",
