The bucket is a good size so you can do a lot of cleaning but it's not too heavy to carry from room to room and to fill and change the water. It's a nifty cleaning tool to make cleaning easier.",

I have noticed, as time goes on the \u201ccommon\u201d house hold mop just keeps getting reinvented over and over again. Gone are the days of a long wooden stick with a large ball of yarn.. I like this mop because it is very simple, light weight and the shape of the mop pad is great because I am able to get underneath my fridge, sofa, Oven. I can effortlessly maneuver underneath my kitchen and coffee table while I weave in/out and through the legs without missing any spots! I also like that the dirty water is not mixed with the clean water by using an innovative way to rinse the mop pad and squeeze the excess water out. The mop itself even breaks down and everything fits perfectly right into the bucket. It also came with two extra mop pads!! I definitely recommend this mop.",
