                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Super Convenient But Upgrade to Reusable Pads",
                "reviewText": "If you haven\u2019t heard of the Swiffer you\u2019ve probably been living under a rock. That said I had never owned one until now. We recently swapped out our carpet floors for bamboo so we needed something easy to clean it with that wouldn\u2019t take up a ton of closet space. I guess all the commercials worked because I gravitated towards this mop.It shipped quickly, was easy to assemble (didn\u2019t need the instructions), and it\u2019s easy to maneuver around. The handle doesn\u2019t extend or anything but I\u2019m ok with that. Also it comes with a few disposable dry pads and a few wet pads. I\u2019ve given both of them a try and I think the dry pads have more use in day to day life but honestly the pads are the weakest point of the mop. Super convenient but not the best at actually cleaning.Also maybe it's just my sensitive nose talking but I found the wet ones to be really strong fragrance-wise. They worked well, but the smell just seemed to linger and I wasn\u2019t really a fan of that. It seemed to dry fast though.That said I quickly realized how expensive these pads are to replace, especially if you use 5-6 pads during your weekly cleaning session like I do.So instead of buying another pack of refills, I ended up buying a set of reusable microfiber mop pads that I can wash and reuse from Amazon. If you search reusable swiffer pads on Amazon you can likely find them, they are the green multi-surface ones with the white straps on the backside.Anyways, they work great with the swiffer. The size matches and you can put it on easily with the velcro. The only thing is that they\u2019re not pre-wet (since well, they\u2019re more of a cloth) so you have to use it with a separate bottle of cleaner. I just ended up using white vinegar and water, spray the whole rooms floor in like 30 seconds and then get down to business.I will say, however, that the swiffer is not designed for heavy scrubbing. I mean, you could probably do it but honestly for spots that need that kind of cleaning, I just go on my knees with a regular cloth.A list of pros and cons:(+)- The swiffer is compact and very lightweight- Easy to set up, you can start using it within minutes- Doesn\u2019t take up much space in the storage closet- The mop is really cheap so I\u2019m not worried if one of the kids breaks it- It comes with all the stuff you need to use it right away(-)- The handle is kind of flimsy and not extendable so you might have to bend down- Refill pads are kind of expensive but you probably already know that- The mop head isn\u2019t very big so it might not be best for larger areas- Wet pads have a very strong fragrance that lingers after cleaningOverall\u2026I am still pleased with the purchase. It's not perfect but then again I didn\u2019t expect it to be anyway when I bought it. For under $20 (not including the refills that you have to get), it does the job well and I\u2019m satisfied with the results. Plus with how light weight the mop is basically anyone of any age can use it. If you\u2019ve got kids or elderly parents in the home this is probably one of the better options out there.",

We found that the heavy duty mopping pads smell so good and clean the floors well.The negative is that 2 pads to clean our 24' RV - they just don't go very far. It is already wasteful to use disposable pads, and I dislike that it takes more pads that I would have expected for that amount of space.I am very happy with the product except for that.",

                "reviewText": "I have a cat that pretty much lives in my room, complete with food and litter box being in here. My room however, is extremely small, and with a cat in there as well the floors get disgusting pretty quickly. Now I am partially to blame, I hate sweeping and mopping. Having to break my back sweeping everything up and then lugging the bulky and heavy mop upstairs, yeah not my favorite thing to do so I may or may not avoid doing it.The Swiffer literally changed my daily habit and how I feel about sweeping and mopping so much that I actually now sweep my bedroom floor everyday and mop it every couple days! It's light as a feather so I don't have to exert a ton of energy to move it around, and because its so thin and lightweight I can sweep/mop the annoying corners or under the bed that originally required me to move the furniture to get under. The mop and sweeping pads pick up a lot of the dirt better than my actual broom and mop, plus the refills are honestly very cheap so its not just a money drain to get the refills. (Stores like Walmart and Target typically carry their store brand version for cheaper too if you really can't spare 8-9 bucks)I honestly have no bad reviews for this other than the regular mop pads seem to dry out a little quicker than I would like them to, which causes me to have to press a little harder near the end of my mopping. Not really a big deal though.If you're on the fence about this and are thinking about getting an expensive and fancy mop or broom, just get this. You save your money, and keeping small spaces clean becomes a hell of a lot easier.",
