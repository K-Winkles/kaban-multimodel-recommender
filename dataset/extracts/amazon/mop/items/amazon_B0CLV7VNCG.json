The tightness of the fabric on the mop head makes it drag a little on the floor as there is no give. Easy to wash, but I did not put in dryer because I was afraid it would shrink. This is an example of how more is not better - lots of cloths in the bag for a reasonable price, but product is produced for volume of sale, not for quality of use.",
