Really like how quick and easy it is to load the mop head. Stays put. Another great feature is that when you loosen it to remove the mop head you can just hold it with mop facing down and it will drop out of the clamp without even having to touch the dirty mop. Sometimes the handle gets a little loose but that\u2019s just the nature of screw together products and definitely not worth removing a star.",
