I just submerged the pad into hot water and a bit of Pine Sol, squeeze out the excess and drop it on the floor where the mop, when aligned properly with the pad, grabs the pad and off you go. The biggest problem I have is in the alignment of the mop with the pad. Takes a couple seconds to get them aligned but then the pad is firmly stuck to the mop. Floors look great afterwards. Mopping is now a breeze for me. I am a male in my 70s.",

                "reviewText": "I'm reviewing this for floors only, since that's what I'm using it for. Fortunately, there are instructions when assembling (fairly straightforward assembly), and most important, how to lock the swivel. There is a bottom ring just above the mop-head that limits the swivel from uncontrolled movement of the mop-head. You just turn a plastic ring a quarter turn to lock the swivel. That is where it will stay for my use,. There is also still some play, even after 'locked', and tightening the hex nut at the end of the handle with wrenches, but it won't affect floor cleaning. The pads are velcro-attached which is nice/convenient. They appear to be of quality pads. They are advertised to be easy to clean. The handle could be longer, or an extra 'extension' piece provided for an extra foot or so in length. For a 5ft 7 in person using the mop on floors, the length of the handle is fine.",

                "reviewText": "We have a short term rental so cleaning is at the top of our priority list for guests. Found this very affordable mopping system and have used it just once so far but really love it. I chose to spray the floor with my solution as I go. Worked super efficient with time saving for not having to dip my mop into the bucket, wring it out etc. Saving water too! It gets easily into corners and I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m \u2018pushing\u2019 debris into the corners like my last mop. For those who said the handle length was too short for them it does appear that you could add some sections to the handle. I\u2019m short so it was perfectly comfortable for me. Highly unusual! All in all I\u2019m a happy host who\u2019s ready with super clean floors for my next guest!",

                "reviewText": "This was just delivered and it looks like a quality, sturdy mop I gave it it a little bit of a \"dry run\" right after I unpacked it. The description says, \"extends to from 36\u201d to 59\u201d overall so even the tallest users can mop comfortably without bending over\". Sadly, this is not so even at the full extension of the handle. I'm 6' tall and I found myself having to bend over more than I was comfortable with. We have over 1500 sq feet of vinyl plank flooring and any sort of bending gets painful in the amount of time it takes to mop that much floor. I had no choice but to return it, but I would certainly have kept it if the handle had been longer.",
