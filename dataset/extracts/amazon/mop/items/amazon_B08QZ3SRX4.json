These really hold the dirt and they are fantastic at collecting hair. I was really surprised at how much more hair these collected compared to a Swiffer. As far as cleaning, I pulled out the surface dirt and hair and then hand-washed it and it was as good as new. I will clean it again before using it again, but I didn't want to leave a dirty cleaning pad lying around. These exceeded my expectations!",
