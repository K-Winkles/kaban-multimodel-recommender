I'm so glad I didn't get a Swiffer.One note--because it doesn't take batteries, the spray function is like a spray bottle. If you have large floors, your hand might get sore. Thankfully I have a small apartment so it's manageable. Plus the spray is spread wide, not a stream, so you really don't have to spray that much. Easy compromise for the price and lack of waste.",

The best feature for me is the little tool to brush the pet hair and solid gunk off the used pad so you can wash the pad without just putting filth in your washer.It's easy to put together. It's lightweight.It's aluminum not steel so it's not really made for deep cleaning/scrubbing. It's solid for what it's supposed to be though. A daily mop. It's not going to do edges or scrub or anything requiring much pressure. Which is fine.Would recommend",

It cleaned smoothly and sprayed beautifully with one single push of the handle. After a couple of months every time I would squeeze the handle it would get stuck and not want to spray but just a few drops. Needless to say, I kept trying to use it and would push the handle down so that I could pull it up and liquid would come out. Today was the death of the mop. It stopped spraying altogether.",
