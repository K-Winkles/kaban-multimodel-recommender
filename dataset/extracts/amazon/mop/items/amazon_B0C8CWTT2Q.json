                "reviewText": "I am fixing up a house that I just had renters move out of (let's just say they were rough on the place). I have used the full extension to clean the walls for painting and made it shorter to mop the floors. With it fully extended, there is a bit of flex in the rod while scrubbing but it's minimal- I'm happy with how sturdy this is. Dry mopping with just the fluffy head picked up a ton of drywall dust out of the grooves in the hardwood from where I have been patching and sanding. Using it with Odoban has done a very good job of reducing urine smells from the flooring. A tip for the baseboards since I saw a review saying that the edge wasn't bending easily: take the pad off of the corner, flip it up, and THEN reattach the pad- however, if you want to flatten the head, you will have a groove in the pad and will need to readjust it again to get rid of it. It's a very minor inconvenience given how easy to use this product is and how well it works. The only thing I have to complain about is that sometimes the head gets stuck in a flat position, and you have to reach up and adjust it back out to continue using it. I haven't used the squeegee on any windows yet. Overall I am thrilled with this purchase as it's making my life a whole lot easier.",

It's well made with each section screwing in, not slipped in like some products. The cleaning mop and duster provided are well made too and easy to clean. I just throw it in the washing machine and air dry. Makes cleaning walls and ceiling so much easier to reach plus it does the cleaning job! I would highly recommend this product.",
