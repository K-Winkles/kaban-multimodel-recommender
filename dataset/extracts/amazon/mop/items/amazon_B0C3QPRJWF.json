                "reviewText": "I bought this product mainly to use as a dry mop to pick up dog hair. While it picks up the dog hair well, it would be nicer if the mop was longer so I could pick up more hair and dust quicker.I do like that the mop bends in the middle. It makes it much easier to slide the different mop heads on and off. We had another mop that didn\u2019t have this feature and it was a hassle changing the pad.I also like that the company includes more than one pad. A plus when one is in the wash and you can have a clean pad ready to go.",
