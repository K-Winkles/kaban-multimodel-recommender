                "reviewText": "This is a solidly constructed item that works very well on hardwood floors. Great maneuverability. And the mop pad stays in place even with heavy scrubbing, which can't be said for many similar products. Two minor points: 1) it requires some finger strength to open the clamps that secure the mop pad in place. People with arthritis might have some difficulty with it. 2) The instructions, like most anything you buy these days, are Google-translated from another language with limited graphics and are pretty much useless. Fortunately with a little trial and error you don't need them. They do not include any reference at all to an extra piece of hardware that seemed to have no real purpose but that clamps onto the handle. I later found out it's a brush to clean the mop pad.",

This mop is less flimsy and provides four reusable microfiber pads that pick up and retains dirt much better. There are two easy to use snap on strips that hold the pad in place. I tested floor cleanliness with Swiffer and with this mop, and this one hands down. I also didn\u2019t have to keep putting pads back on and replacing them because they weren\u2019t cleaning anyway. Ditch your miserable Swiffers.",

They are washable also, and I expect them to hold up for a long time. Really impressed with the design and functionality of this mop!!",
