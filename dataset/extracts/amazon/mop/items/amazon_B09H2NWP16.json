This was the best compromise.I can do both with this mop and I love that it is easy to pick up and move as I work. I like that I can wash the pads afree every use, too.One drawback is that it is a tall bucket and I have to fill it either by using a separate vessel to to add the water or use a sink or shower to fill the tall bucket. My laundry sink faucet is too low to fill the bucket at the sink.",

It cleans well, I love the separate clean dry compartments. I have mixed feeling about the washing pad. The downfall is the durability of the Velcro pad.. it tears after a couple of uses and it gets stuck going in and out of the dry compartment. But I like how after you are done cleaning the floors you can just throw it in the washer/dryer and have a fresh and clean pad for next use.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Update: I looked at my original packaging and realized the company extends a one year warranty on their mop and bucket system. Once I reached out to their customer service, and explained what happened, I was asked if I wanted a refund or replacement. I chose the latter because i loved this mop before it broke. One day earlier than expected, I received my replacement mop and bucket, and I\u2019m so happy!!What I love:I love that, although when you get a mop you have to basically build you can feel the weakness in the stick but, this stick is sturdy. It doesn\u2019t wobble in the joints. And the metal is firm, not flimsy.I love not having to bend over to wring anything out, and although I used to be biased against anything not a traditional cotton mop head, I don\u2019t miss the random cotton braided stands all over the place after mopping.I love that I\u2019m able to disinfect (most times with bleach) my floor without degrading the mop head. I love how effective it is at actually cleaning my floor without the extra weight of the wet \u201chair\u201d slinging around behind it. It\u2019s just a less strenuous job, yet still gets the job done. I\u2019m a stickler for a clean floor, so I also love the fact that the mop pads can be swapped out and washed/disinfected as needed. So while one is dirty, I can just use another clean one.I love that the wringer not only extracts water, but also scrapes off any dust and debris that gets stuck to the mop pad.And that even when full, the bucket isn\u2019t super heavy, so even on my floor\u2019s deep cleaning days, I can easily empty my dirty water and refill with clean to mop a second time.The only thing I wish were different was if the dirty water went to a separate chamber, and not back into the clean soapy water.FYI: the lid does pop off and on fairly easily, so you can rinse everything out and off when you\u2019re done.Original: Ironically the mop is sturdy, but the mop head broke at the hinge while I was using it. Before that, I absolutely loved this set, I'm disappointed that it snapped on me. I originally gave it 3 stars, but it\u2019s back to 5 based on everything.",

                "reviewText": "This was almost, but not quite, a really good mop. If I had an apartment with wood or laminate floors I\u2019d probably give it 4 stars. There are a few things that made me look for a different option, though. It doesn\u2019t get into my grout (like didn\u2019t even get it wet or get crumbs up with using it as a dust mop) and that was the biggest deal breaker. Another was that, when using the bucket, you have to fill it all the way to the full line and maybe even top it off halfway through if you\u2019re mopping a lot of area, otherwise the part of your mop that is always turned to the top (you can only instead the mop one direction into the bucket so the same part is always at the top) never gets fresh water on it. This means that there\u2019s always part of your mop that stays either dirty or dry depending on how much water is in the bucket.Maybe I have unrealistic expectations in a mop, but the floors don\u2019t feel all that clean due to these issues.Pros:lightweightEasy to storeGets right up to the baseboardsGood system for \u201cringing\u201d with the bucket to get debris off when dry moppingBucket topper is very strong and attaches really well to the bucket, itself. I never felt like it was going to come off when carrying it and spill water all over.Mop pad attaches really well to the baseCons:Really small (for the amount of floors I have to clean)Handle is VERY short (I\u2019m 5\u20193 on a good day and it was too short for me)Doesn\u2019t get into groutAlways a part of the head doesn\u2019t get water due to bucket set up (this would be solved if the head could flip either direction into the bucket.Bucket has to be completely full (same solution as above would fix this)Mop head flips into the \u201cringing\u201d position really easily while using. Great for rinsing, but not for actually mopping",

                "reviewText": "I love stuff that is really well engineered and well thought out. Whoever designed this put a lot of thought into it. The drying side does a good job of squeezing the excess water from the pad, and most of the water goes back into the rinse side. The parts seem to be good quality and it does a better job of actually cleaning than any other product I've owned from more well known manufacturers that either didn't work or broke in short order.The pads (you get three) are machine washable and much better quality than I've seen on similar products. It's a bit more expensive than others, but the quality of it suggests that it will last longer. You get what you pay for.A couple of very minor quibbles. I'm 6'2\" so the handle is a little short for taller people. Would have been nice to have the option of one more segment to add to the length of the handle. Also, the circumference of the bottom of the bucket is small, which is great for storage but could make it a bit tippy when full of water, so you will want to be a little careful leaving it unattended around rambunctious kids or large dogs.",
