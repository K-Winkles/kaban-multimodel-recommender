This looked like it might fit, and it did! It was a bit loose but hammering the slot to make it smaller worked great! These are functional, less expensive, and fit the self wringing (w handle) mops sold by many manufacturers.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a Libman mop several years ago after trying several others that just didn't get the job done. I love this style because the mophead had a rough texture that really scrubs the kitchen and bathroom floors and effectively cleans the grout as well. The \"wringing\" action of the mop gets excess water out very well. The mopheads also last a long time. I replace mine every 4 months or so. They hold up well even with more abrasive cleaners (I use a lot of bleach).I ordered these on Amazon because I was having trouble locating them in stores, but was happy to find them here because this was actually a much better value than buying them in store. Really excellent product for anyone (like me) that's very nitpicky about having their floors super clean looking.",
