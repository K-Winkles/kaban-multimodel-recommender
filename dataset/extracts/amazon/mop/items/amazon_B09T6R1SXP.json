                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Microfiber mop/sweeper",
                "reviewText": "The product seems to be very well made. It does just as it is described to do and that is clean floor. Now with that being said it would also be great item to wash down or dust walls as well with the appropriate pad applied. It comes with multiple pads in 2 different types, one for dry sweeping and the other for wet mopping. It also comes with a hand little item to clean the hair and dust bunnies from the pad during use. To me this one part is so important and makes all the difference in using the product overall because you can remove debris from the pad without having to change it as often if the tool wasn't being used. Plus the item snaps directly to the handle so your not having to try and keep up with it as it will always be within reach on the products handle. The head rotates 360 degrees and you can maneuver the sweeper/mop to easily get up under furniture much easier. My wife and I both love the product and agree that it has helped to remove a lot more pet hair than using our old similar product that you have to buy replacement throw away pads for that don't last very long at all The ability of the pads to be washed and reused makes all the difference and having multiple pads of each style makes sure your never out of the fight to keep your floors clean. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to help keep their home clean and remove hair, dust, and debris from the floors prior to mopping. Along with all the benefits you get from buying this, the price is unbeatable for what all you receive. We purchased 2 extra ones after we first used/reviewed this to give as Christmas gifts to my sister and sister in law.",
