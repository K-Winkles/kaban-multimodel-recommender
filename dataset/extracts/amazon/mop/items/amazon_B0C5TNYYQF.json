                "reviewText": "This ceiling duster arrived quickly and looks exactly as it does in the product images. The assembly takes under 5 minutes and it\u2019s ready to dust. The ceilings in my home are vaulted and the AC ducts could use a good cleaning but we rent, so there isn\u2019t too much that can be done as of right now. This lead to the ceiling getting dust right near every vent in our home (I change the main filter monthly) so this product was definitely necessary for us! This helped a ton with getting it off, but I do want to note that if you have a popcorn-textured ceiling it\u2019s best to try and be somewhat gentle or some will fall. The only extendable pole was more than long enough to get the job done and the pads are so handy. I haven\u2019t used the flash ones to wash my walls yet but I\u2019m really looking forward to doing that as well to give my home an even fresher scent. Thus far I\u2019ve loved how useful it\u2019s been and I\u2019m surprised by its overall durability! For $20 it\u2019s a steal and I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.",

Sometimes that leaves this adhesive spot on the ceiling, which drives me nuts.This is really easy to assemble and I can reach the ceiling without having to get out a step ladder. I like that it comes with multiple cleaning pads, and a squeegee. This covers all of my cleaning needs for walls and windows. Overall this has been extremely useful for me, and makes my job much easier. The best thing is that it's budget friendly!",
