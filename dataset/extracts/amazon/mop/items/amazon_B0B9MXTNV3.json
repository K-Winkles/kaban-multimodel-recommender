                "reviewText": "Okay, I have been beyond frustrated with mops lately. I tried the Swiffer mop - NO! I tried the O'Cedar wring mop - NO! it broke on the very first use. In the past I have tried other mops and they all failed me. This mop actually worked!It is easy to put together. It has a ratcheting system to help wring the the mop out better than other simple twist mops. You can shake the mop head down a few times if you need to (I don't know why you would do this but it was very important for some friends who also tried this mop out) with no issues or loosening. It makes a nice poof of fabric/strings (?) with its mop head when you mop, so you don't have to worry about the strings separating and scratching the floor. The little scrubbing dot on the tip is sewn on and can take some fairly vigorous scrubbing. The metal tubes that make up the handle are much stronger than the O'Cedar mop or Swiffer. The tubes screw together rather than just push together.It really is a great mop. It wrings out very well without having to use your hands - at all. Fits nicely in a 10 quart cheap bucket from Walmart. I want to add, by friend request, it cleans baseboards and walls nicely when damp. Finally, I really appreciate the longer handle. It makes reaching the bathroom ceiling much easier (I'm 5'4\") for cleaning.I also want to add, this is a real review. I am not just giving this to get some free junk item for posting a positive review. It took me way too long to find a mop I could actually use and feel like it does a great job. I just wanted to share this is a good mop at a fair price. I say, \"Buy this one! It does what it says on the tin.\"",

Except twice now the plastic holding the mop to the handle broke (it looks like a zip tie?), so then the entire mop head comes loose from the twisty part. It's still attached to the handle, but you can nob longer wring it dry. I would buy it again since it's so cheap but really wish it would last longer.",

In reality, the head is at best halfhe size of what it looks like in that photo, and the handle significantly thinner. .",
