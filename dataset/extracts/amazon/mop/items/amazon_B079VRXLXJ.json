I needed mop heads that could withstand many washes and clean leaving minimal water behind.Pros: They\u2019re relatively durable so far, not super heavy and the floors dry quickly.Cons: MAJOR SHEDDING problem! Even after several cycles in the washing machine, these mop heads still leave fuzzy blobs everywhere- on the floor, in the bucket, in the washing machine! FYI, these mop heads don\u2019t dry quickly when on a mop handle; they can get mildewed if left sitting overnight after being squeezed.",

                "reviewText": "This 3 pack comes with each mop head individually vacuum sealed in space efficient wrap. Once opened, the mop heads are your standard commercial loop style mop. The fibers are soft and highly absorbent. This style of head works with a range of mop heads but check compatibility before buying. The benefit of these heads is that they are absorbent, inexpensive, and machine washable / easily renewed and reused. These 'commercial' style heads hold more water, mop up more mess, and make moping move faster than most 'residential' heads which are smaller and less durable. The only 'issue' is that the dirty head takes FOREVER to dry out so you need somewhere to store a damp/dirty head until you reuse or wash. No way around that but good to plan accordingly.",
