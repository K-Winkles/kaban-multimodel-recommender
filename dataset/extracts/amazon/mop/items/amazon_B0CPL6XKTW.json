These came vacuum sealed very tightly, but expand when opened to be as fluffy as the original. I tried one so far and it fits securely and cleans about the same, no complaints. Having four mop heads now allows me to dirty them all before I do an exclusive laundry load with just floor mops and pads. I\u2019ve always found these to be way too filthy to wash with other things, yet I could never use the machine to wash just one mop head\u2013 too wasteful. Now I have enough and can mop to my heart\u2019s content. Glad I found this replacement pack. Just make sure these are the right fit for your model before ordering.",

                "reviewText": "For the longest I was purchasing the wrong mop heads. I was getting the two tank system mop head instead of the spin mop replacement head. If you have a two-tank system, this is not the mop head for you they are very different. The two tank mop heads are smaller and doesn't fit the spin mop system. When you first attach the mop head to mop and dip into water, the mop head will become heavy and fall of the mop pole. All of the replacements do this, so be careful when pulling the mop out of the bucket, go slow and try not to let the mop head come off. When you start drying the mop you will not have this problem anymore. Happy I found the right mop head.",
