O\u2019Cedar should partner with this company and use these to begin with. They are great!! And they are longer for taller people!! Definitely worth every cent!!",

                "reviewText": "The handle on the oceder is kinda short and this is the perfect solution. It doesn't collapse the same but you can just disconnect it in half and it fits well in small spaces. The extra length on this handle is amazing so now my husband can mop more comfortably. Highly recommend.",
