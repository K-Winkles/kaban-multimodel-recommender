                "reviewText": "This mop system is fantastic! It's very loght but does a great job of getting up dried, stuck on stains. The wash water section of the bucket is small and may require more than one fill during mopping, but because it's small, it's also light and fills quickly.It is not a heavyweight mop and would likely break with rough handling. Hot water, and several passes works well.There's some learning to get the system down. I saw a review complaining that the wringer left the mop wet. Yes... that side collects water and should be emptied. You could also try letting it drip on the wash side first and ending wringing with an upward pull. Regardless, by the time the squeegee side has collected that much water, the wash side is probably ready for a change. It's not magic, or rocket science.Small and easy to store. The pads clean well in the laundry.The only thing I dislike is changing pads. It's a little tricky getting them over the 3 slots. I find it easier to roll the pads up first. Then the pad doesn't get caught on the \"velcro\" while I'm getting the slots lined up.",

                "reviewText": "I love this system, and it is a competitive price compared to others. Comes with several mop heads for different areas like bathroom or kitchen to not cross contaminate. Swivel is super great & the material is plush. Cleans floors well. Long mop handle & it takes a little practice to get it in the bucket, but it works well. Drain plug is a great touch. If it matters, this is a really compact design so it would be ideal for an average size home unless you want to change the water out more. Perfect for apartment or small-average size floors.",

First time, using a mop like this, I was using a spray mop with a microfiber mat and having to rinse it out every couple feet due to the high volume of dirt that comes into my place due to where my property location is in the amount of dirt and Farmlife around it and visitors in and out. I liked the ease of use. This is a cut my mopping time down in half. As you can see in the video, my floors are high traffic, and that was just in a weeks time with winter rains and snow. The mop has cleaned up pretty easy. There wasn\u2019t much dirt and discoloration in them after the ringing process I did go through with water after I mopped in the bucket and did the floors again and got more residue and my high concentrate cleaning water up. My floors look pretty darn good and I am satisfied with this purchase. I\u2019ve just feel that the mop mats could be made a bit better and that is my notch of a star .",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Mop System - works and performs just as advertised!",
                "reviewText": "Walking in to discover my husband using my kitchen mop to clean our old, decrepit concrete basement floor I new I'd need a new one asap! I maintain separate supplies of mops, sponges and brushes for the bathroom and kitchen because the idea of cross contamination makes me shudder. I'm sure there are other folks like me would be grossed out by that.I usually just buy my mops or new mop heads for the traditional wring mops I use from Dollar General or Walmart. But this time I decided to check out what I could find here on Amazon. That's when I discovered mop systems. Call me naive. I never realized these things existed outside of commercial applications. After researching all the options and configurations I found here, it took me a few days to narrow down a few mop systems based on my new-found criteria and finally decide on what I thought to be THE BEST ADVERTISED MOP SYSTEM.Nearly a week later the Aifacay Mop System had won my personal Amazon advertising contest! Next question was could it deliver on those advertised features and performance in real life? I decided to order the Aficay Mop System to find out.Well, my new Aficay Mop System was DELIVERED SUPER FAST! I ordered it on Wednesday, 6/17 and it was delivered 2 days later on Friday 6/19. I tore into the box immediately and put the mop together in less than 5 minutes. One of the microfiber cleaning pads came pre-attached to the mop head, letting me see how it is attached without having interpret instructions or leaving me to figure it out myself...not that it should be hard to do. Anyhow, the box contained an additional 7 cleaning pads, so as promised this mop system was delivered with a total of 8, reusable/washable microfiber cleaning pads.The box also contained two spare drain plugs, with a third already installed/attached to the bucket. Note, there is a plug only on the one, \"dry\" or wring out side of the bucket canister. I assume this is to provide you an easy method to drain waste rinse water and refill with clean rinse water during a mopping session.The handle came disassembled in 5 sections and it was super easy to screw them together. The fully assembled handle is more than 4 feet long, so while I can use it that way, it's bit too long for me to comfortably/naturally mop the floor as a 5'6\" tall person. I used the mop on my first go with all sections assembled, but will probably remove one of the sections for a more natural flow. However, when I want to use this mop to clean walls or reach my 10 foot ceilings I'll definitely be happy to have that 5th section.The top of the handle itself is nicely padded making it very comfortable to hold and lessens any risk of blistering or pinching the skin on your hands and fingers like bare wooden or metal handles do. The top section has a rigid plastic loop to let you hang the assembled mop, or you can alternately store it upright in one of bucket slots. You can also disassemble the entire thing and store all parts in the bucket canisterI was surprised at the small size of the bucket itself and the internal chambers that hold water. However, the amount each chamber holds is actually PLENTY of water to a general cleaning job. I filled up cleaning solution-based water in one the \"Wet\" side, and on the \"Dry\" side I added plain water for rinse and \"wringing\". For this mop system, you are actually scraping instead of wringing, since each side's slot-based dunking mechanisms scrape excess water from the microfiber cleaning pad. And when you dunk the mop into the \"Dry\" side after taking a few passes at the floor, the scraping mechanism also pulls dirt and hair, from the mop head, leaving alll that nasty behind in the \"Dry\" chamber.When you're not accustomed to using this sort of mop, using little water seems strange. It's doesn't feel like mopping without plopping an over-saturated wring mop (or sponge mop - same deal!) on the floor, smearing cleaning-solution water to and fro, dunking and wringing the old mop back in the bucket to soak up some dirty, cleaning water to give it another go. But, all you get from your wring-mops are a false sense of \"clean\" because you have the cleaning-solution scented fresh smell and the water to dirt ratio seems wide! But it's not.With the Aficay Mop System you're starting with just enough clean water to take a few passes with your mop. When ready to wring a normal mop, with Aficay you instead insert the mop into the \"Dry\" or rinse chamber to rinse and dissolve dirt, remove particles and hair - leaving it all behind in the chamber. Next, insert the head into the \"Wet\" chamber to restart mopping with fresh, clean water with each new take to the floor. You'll find you need little water to actually clean the floor, and you'll soon realize how gross you've been living all these years ...you'll NEVER be able to GO BACK. I know I won't.The mop function itself is wonderful too! The back and forth motion is very natural and free-moving. The flat head gives you even mop to floor coverage with each pass. This mop also cleans to the edge and contact with the microfiber pad is not obstructed by it frame from any angle or any side of the mop head. Its swivel motions are fluid so that the head doesn't get stuck, nor does it fly crazily around it's axis. You can easily drive the mop forward and smoothly transition around corners and under furniture. I haven't tried it yet, but dry mopping or dusting ceilings or walls should be a breeze!So, after a few days in as an owner of an Aficay Mop Sytem, I confidently announce that this product does indeed perform as advertised and successfully fulfills on its features as promised!I am 100% SATISIFIED AND EXTREMELY HAPPY with my decision to buy the Aficay Mop System!I will NEVER return to purchase another tired old, wring mop again.For the record, here's my list of winning criteria which Aficay meets on all points!- offers separate chamber for wash and wring/dry- cleaning and waste water never mixes/meets within the bucket canister- large microfiber cleaning pads clear the edge of the mop head \"frame\" to allow for edge cleaning- large quantity of microfiber pads included- cleaning pads are reusable, washable- adjustable and sturdy pole- comfortable handle- mop swivel system works well - it's fluid and sturdy! (* see my important note below)- bucket made of strong, plastic with well molded parts - Aficay is very solid!- as few bell/whistles as possible = fewer opportunities to fail, and less to worry about- compact storage- drain plug to make it easy to frequently change out dirty rinse water- this is a bonus!- under $50 if possible* IMPORTANT NOTE - MOP HEAD/SWIVEL MECHANISM: I recommend that new owners study/look over the engineering of the mop head's swivel mechanism to learn how its swivel motion works. This will help you understand how to maneuver the mop in just about any situation or scenario of use. The mop head frame is plastic so I'd expect that IF someone were to work roughly with the swivel mechanism that it could break. For example, if it were to get stuck under/around something, to carelessly yank or roughly pull at the mop without a logical backing out of the motion that got the mop stuck in the first place could harm the mop head - causing cracks or breaks.",

Apparently you need to fill up the wash side of the bucket to the top which makes it difficult to lug around.The good: Packaged well and arrived unbroken. Valve at the bottom if the bucket makes for easy emptying but watch out! That water gushes out like a geyser. The mop pads seem to be well made.The bad: Everything elseI'm returning this and going back to my old mop.",

                "reviewText": "En mi caso el tap\u00f3n del \"desag\u00fce\" de la cubeta no sella bien y esto hace que se tire de poco a poco el agua que le pongo a la cubeta, haciendo peque\u00f1os charcos de agua d\u00f3nde quiera que pongo la cubeta. En cuanto a la limpieza la verdad es que si limpia bien siempre y cuando no tengas manchas muy pegadas sin embargo es m\u00e1s cansado de usar que un trapero convencional, ya que causa m\u00e1s fricci\u00f3n la mopa con el piso y no desliza igual de f\u00e1cil que un trapero (en especial en pisos laminados la fricci\u00f3n que hace es a\u00fan mayor). En cuanto al mecanismo de exprimido de la cubeta... Realmente no hay un mecanismo que exprima bien el mop, me gustar\u00eda que le hubieran a\u00f1adido una especie de peine de pl\u00e1stico o algo para que \"talle\" el mop cada vez que se introduce en cualquiera de los 2 compartimientos... Y en cuanto al compartimiento de \"dry\" o secado... Adem\u00e1s de que no exprime muy bien, el agua que si exprime se divide y cae entre el agua limpia y el compartimiento de secado.. haciendo que poco a poco se llene de agua el compartimiento de \"dry\" y esto es un problema porque cuando metes el mop en \"dry\" para secarlo... esperarias que salga lo m\u00e1s seco posible y sin embargo realmente lo est\u00e1s metiendo a otro compartimiento con agua sucia y dificulta que salga seco. Lo \u00fanico rescatable son los mops, trae bastantes, son algo gruesos y faciles de lavar ( aunque no s\u00e9 porque algunos vienen m\u00e1s gruesos que otros y he notado que los m\u00e1s gruesos funcionan mejor con el mecanismo de la cubeta)... Otro punto a favor es el largo del tubo, lo cual facilita la limpieza de paredes y ventanales grandes.",

It is a little bit difficult getting the pads on the three plastic tabs at first but once you get the hang of it there is little problem. Once the pads have been washed a few times it gets easier.
