                "reviewText": "After purchasing 3 different Swiffer Wet Jets in the last 18 months, I took a chance on this mop system. The Swiffer's battery-operated system would just stop working after 6 months, making them too disposable. Not a great plan. This microfiber spray mop works with a trigger system, like a spray bottle - no batteries! The container will hold any product(s) you want to use, making it more versitile as well. I've seen others say the bottle is too small, but it holds as much as the Swiffer does. The mop head is very plush and absorbs nicely for a quicker dry time. Does a great job of cleaning. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this because I am having hand surgery and can't lug around a bucket and mop. I had no idea that this would change my life. We have a Labrador who manages to drink water like a wildebeest .....this means that every time she takes a drink there are large puddles of water everywhere!! This little mop is so easy to use that I can clean up the puddles quick and my floor looks great. I can also use it one handed.I love it so much I plan on buying a back up so I am never without it.",

I do wish there was a scrubber feature on the mop. I wish that it would spray upside down to better clean walls with. The downside is it broke after 1 year. They spray triguer cracked off on the inside.",

I like that the mop cloths are thick and absorbent, then can be thrown in the wash when you're done. They also wash up well and come out nice and ready for the next use. The spray bottle is easy to remove for refilling, you can use any cleaning solution you choose, and it's large enough to get the whole job done. I actually like this product so much, I suggest it to clients! It certainly beats those disposable heads and pre-mixed solutions you have to keep buying! A great value for the price!",

Gray is my color scheme, and the more I like the look of my cleaning tools, the more likely I am to clean. :)Have only used it once so far, so if anything changes, I will come back and update.Nice big pad surface. To get the bottle out, pull straight back. Swivel works well. Sprayer works well. The overall feel is mostly sturdy, with a bit of \"rickety\" feel that they could improve upon in future upgrades. Comes with 3 pads, and I bought extra pads as well. Again, the more cleaning tools available to me, the more likely I am to clean, and clean more frequently.Very happy with purchase. :)",
