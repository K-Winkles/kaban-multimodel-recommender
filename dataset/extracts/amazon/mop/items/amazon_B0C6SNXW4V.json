Yes I'm aware this company states it is for wood floors, but I have no problem with it on my porcelain tile along with appropriate cleaner for the tile. I dilute the cleaner. I usually use fabuloso. The pads are microfiber and scrub good to remove dirt and stains. The mop is compact. It is is easy to assemble and use. It's lightweight and sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "My kitchen and dining room floors (wood and tile) get dirty SO often with 4 kids (age range from 1-13yrs) and a hubby who works in a dirty machine shop. I needed something I could grab quickly that wouldn't need a bucket, didn't leave a ton of water on the floor for my 1yr old to slip on, and that didn't require special refill floor pads, floor solution, or need a recharge or change of batteries. ...ENTER this little spray mop. Super easy to assemble, came with 5 washable mop heads, and seems to be sturdy enough for daily use. Plus, it meets ALL of my requirements! It even comes with this little tool that you can use to scrape those stuck on blobs or scrub a little area that may need it. It fits right onto the handle so you don't lose it! I absolitely LOVE this little bonus tool!! I tried out the mop immediately with water and a little bit of dish soap and it did exactly what I needed it to. I was impressed that I didn't need to scrub excessively at the spots like I sometimes do with some other mops. This thing is extremely convenient and works well!My biggest issue with this mop is that the handle is a bit short for me (I'm 5'7). It would be super nice to have an adjustable handle. It still works great though, and I plan to keep it in my arsenal of kitchen cleaning tools. Would definitely recommend!",

First, I love that it's much more environmentally friendly with its reusable pads than the name-brand floor sprayer I'm replacing it with which uses single-use pads covered in detergent. I have three adult cats and now three kittens in my apartment. That means a lot of litter LOL no way around it, and because they all eat wet food and eat like precious little psychos, my floors are just... perpetually horrifying. Litter dust and dried food and a carrot they stole from someone's dinner plate and pieces of catnip from two months ago that appear anyway, plus hairballs and who knows what else. Do you want a cat yet? Anyway, this is wonderful, and the texture of the microfiber REALLY cleans all of my floors so well (I have linoleum in the kitchen, wood throughout the main rooms, and tile in the bathroom - works great on all three). Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble - built and ready for use in 2 minutes. I like the way the pads just attach with downward force rather than needing straps or handling when replacing a dirty pad. Despite this, the pads stay there until you pull them off. Pads are easier to fit than for some well known brands.Instructions say just add water to the bottle, but advert had said \"use with preferred cleaner\", so I added the first cream cleaner I found under the sink and in a flash, started to clean a laminate floor where we had just removed some furniture. I swept first to avoid fluff clogging the cleaning pad - maybe your home is cleaner and will not need to do that. The spay works well and reduces the amount of water on the laminate floor.Very happy with results, so moved onto two different tiled floors, one with a shiny surface and one with a textured finish - it performed well and made both look much better, but I did need additional effort on the textured finished.Results were good, so moved onto a real challenge - an anti-static floor protector in the office that has been down for 3 years and never been washed before. On the upper surface it performed excellently and there was a definite improvement, although one stubborn mark required me to remove the stiff brush, supplied and attached to the hands of the cleaner to remove the mark. It was unable to remove all the marks from the \"grippy\" under side of the floor protector, but it did remove all but the most stubborn marks. I know that this requires a hard scrubbing brush and a specialist cleaning spray, so delighted that it removed much of the mess.No reason not to give this 5 stars - it was surprisingly effective and easy to use!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the EXEGO Microfibre Spray Mops for Floor Cleaning and have found them to be quite efficient. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to clean under furniture and in corners, which is a big plus. The inclusion of four reusable washable pads is also a great feature, reducing waste and saving money in the long run. However, for larger areas, it can be a bit time-consuming as you need to refill the spray bottle frequently. Overall, it's a handy tool for everyday cleaning, especially in smaller spaces, but may require more effort for extensive use in larger homes.",
