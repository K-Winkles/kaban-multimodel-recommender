These reusable mop pads from Papclean are a must buy if you love to save\ud83d\udcb2money, prefer purchasing eco-friendly options and love an efficient product that delivers good looking results!Firstly, make sure you measure your mop head before purchasing this product. These will only fit the Swiffer Powermop and other compatible mops that measure 13-15 inches in length.I love how easy they are to attach to my Casabella \u2018infuse\u2019 mop. The firm Velcro grip guarantees no slipping or movement whilst in use. They are very plush and made of high-density microfiber, that quickly absorbs, locks in dirt and debris with ease, resulting in a clean looking surface with no streaks! The pads are effective at cleaning wet or dry messes, on a variety of different surfaces.What I love most about them (other than coming in my favorite color \ud83d\udc9c) is they can simply be hand washed or placed in the washing machine, after use. Make sure you don\u2019t use fabric softener or bleach while laundering, so that these pads continue to perform at their highest level. Air drying the pads are my recommendation as well. They have a convenient built-in hanging loop for an easy storage option, or while air drying.Ok, let\u2019s go over the positive features of this product -\u2022Great value 6 pack\u2022Awesome colors to choose from\u2022Cleans wet or dry messes with ease\u2022Eco-friendly/Sustainable option\u2022Money\ud83d\udcb2Saving\u2022Built-in hanging loop for storage/drying\u2022Cleans a variety of surfacesThe only negative feedback I have about this product is that it won\u2019t fit every kind of mop brand on the market. It will also require extra time for laundering duties. Not a big deal for me! The positive points easily outweigh the negative in my opinion, with this product.I recommend these wholeheartedly \ud83d\udc9c. You really don\u2019t have that much to lose; just a whole lot of dirt, dust, grime and pet hair.Definitely a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f product in my opinion!Happy cleaning!! \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased Papclean power mop refills for my Swiffer Power Mop and found them to be an excellent addition to my cleaning arsenal. These pads, compatible with various Swiffer models, come in a pack of six, making it easy to rotate through them for consistent cleanliness. Despite being tightly vacuum-packed, which suggested pre-soaking, I skipped this step and was pleased to see they expanded and worked well regardless.The dual functionality for wet and dry use is a standout feature. The absorbent chenille material ensures a streak-free clean in wet use and effectively picks up dust and pet hair in dry use. Their environmental and economic benefits are notable as well; these machine-washable pads are a sustainable alternative to disposable cloths, and their durability through multiple washes without losing effectiveness or color is impressive.Ease of use and versatility further add to their appeal. The pads attach and detach from the mop head effortlessly, and the inclusion of a small hook on each pad is a thoughtful touch for easy storage and drying. Suitable for a variety of floor types and other hard surfaces, these mop refills have proven to be a practical choice for not just homes, but also dorms and offices. Overall, the Papclean power mop refills offer a blend of efficiency, convenience, and sustainability, making them a valuable tool for routine cleaning.",

They fit my Swiffer Powermop just fine and grip well, no slipping or flopping around. They leave my floors pretty clean, maybe not as clean as the disposable originals but, picking up dust and pet hair is not a problem. Being machine washable makes them super convenient. Just toss them in the washing machine and they're good to go again. Sure, they take a little longer to dry, but the eco-friendliness and reusability make it worth the wait. I could see them not sticking to the mop after many uses, but by that time you would have saved a tree or two and quit a few dollars. We will definitely get more of these pads.",
