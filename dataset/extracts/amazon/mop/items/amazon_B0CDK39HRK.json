                "reviewText": "I like an old fashioned mop! A real good cleaning for our floors is so necessary once in a while,, out here in the rurals. The swiffer treatment is good for most of the time. But I need this REAL MOP once in a while. I'm afraid I'm going to break it tho! Because it's divided into pieces, I'm not expecting years of service from this handle. We'll see. I'm not rough on things, but the sheer weight of the cotton head and the swinging back and forth (always mop in a figure-8 pattern), may be too much for this screw assembly handle to bear.Neutral on recommendation. Try at your own risk!",

                "reviewText": "The 60 inch heavy duty commercial mop handle is very sturdy and made to last. The handle did need a little assembly which was extremely easy. It has a nice thick long handIe with cushion padding on several places making handling it very easy. The mop head attachment is simple too, just unhook, slide on the mop head and relatch the hook. I ordered this type of handle to add a heavy duty mop head for outdoor use such as mopping the porch and steps and cleaning off porch furniture. This is definitely the right mop handle to tackle these jobs. A great product to own.",
