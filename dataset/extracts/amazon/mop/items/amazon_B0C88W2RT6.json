The velcro straps mean they stay on the Swiffer much better, are far more absorbent, and the terry cloth texture means they are better for scrubbing. We use them for a multitude of things, cleaning the shower walls, washing the floors, cleaning the tracks on the treadmills. They wash well, the velcro is super sticky, and they last a long time.",
