                "reviewText": "I rarely write product reviews but here is an honest review from an unpaid customer who just loves this product. This has by far been a huge game changer! At first I was worried the bottle was far too small but, so far, that hasn't been the case. They spray has great coverage, and the pad is very large in comparison to the swifter. The fact its all washable or refillable is a wonderful feature. I can clean my floors anytime and I dont need to wait to go to the store first or whatever. The sprayer is also really quiet and doesn't make excess noise. Also, knowing exactly what is in the formula and being able to change its products or scents based on my needs has been so wonderful. I am very well pleased with this product! Assembly was a breeze as well. I have literally nothing bad to say about this product!",

So I found this little cleaner on Amazon, for half of the price of a swift jet. There are no batteries, you add your own cleaning solution; my preference is Pine-Sol. But it is a great little sweeper. It is lightweight and it does a great job on wood floors too. It comes with two microfiber pads that can be washed and then ready to go. I would highly recommend this.",
