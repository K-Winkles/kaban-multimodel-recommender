It's like the two pieces were made separately and no one checked to make sure they were built to match. I thought it was a mistake, but I see others have the same issue. I can get the mop head to stay on for a short period of time, but it constantly comes off. Also, buyer beware, you need to either hand wring or use a special bucket that wrings out the water. Otherwise, the design of the mop head is good. If only it fit with the pole.",
