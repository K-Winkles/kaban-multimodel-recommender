                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had my eye on this mop for a while now and was so excited when my husband surprised me with it!The concept behind the mop is great. It was simple and easy to use. I was able to mop my living, dining, and kitchen areas (roughly 700 sqft) in about 15 minutes. Which is a huge plus!The spinner is genius! I have hardwood floors and the spinner removed just enough water to protect my floors while still getting a good clean. It made mopping kinda fun, and the bucket was easy to rinse out.It\u2019s lightweight which is great. However, I feel that because it\u2019s so lightweight, some of the structural integrity is gone. For instance, the mop head would detach from the handle periodically from the weight of the head once wet because the handle couldn\u2019t screw in tight enough without stripping the plastic. Not a major issue if you don\u2019t mind tightening it every once in a while.I also love that the mop \u201crefills\u201d are machine washable! Giving you a clean start every time.Overall, the mop is fantastic for the price and I would recommend it to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "I have hard wood floors and tile floors to mop. 2 Kids that spill everything. I mop once a week with the regular 12 inch sponge mop type (the kind you pull the lever to drain the water). It works okay, but usually just pushed the stuff around, so you really needed to do a good vacuum and sweep job first. Wanted to try the O-Ceder and finally ordered. Used it for the first time yesterday and was skeptical of the whole spin thing... It worked amazing! Here are some of the PROs that I was really impressed with:- Sturdy design, easy to move the bucket around, has a handle and spout for easy carry and drain- Mop handle is sturdy as well, easy to telescope and retract - takes up minimal space, and attaches very easy to the microfiber mop head- Using the mop itself was actually a thrilling event - it navigates around the corners and tight spots very well. Picks up everything. Just soak in the bucket, then drop it in the spinner and BAM, you're ready to go again!- Mop head is shaped in a triangle so the tip is great for the corners spots, and then flip it around and you have a wider range of mop for more open space mopping. Its really maneuverable. In addition, its not too big that you cant get into smaller areas. My office has lots of tight angles so this was perfect!! (my old mop was too wide, so I had to previously do it by hand).- Its a pretty basic design, so I can see this thing lasting for quite a while. Again, the whole design is pretty sturdy and durable.- Came with 3 microfiber mop heads, which I think should last me a while. I will certainly order more of the mop heads when needed.If you are on the fence, I was too. But I can say without hesitation, this is a great mop and design, and at a great price. I'm not always that impressed, but this had me smiling.",

                "reviewText": "This mop is easy to use. First, you have to make sure to fully extend the entire mop handle. Some reviewers said that this mop handle is extremely short. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about 48-50 inches long (aka 124-125 centimeters). Other users must have only extended one of the handle extension joints. In the photo I posted, you can see that it\u2019s almost as long as my swiffer mop pole.It can be difficult to see the Max Fill line at first. It\u2019s a few inches below the ridge. See photo. The fill line is molded into the bucket itself, in most cases yours will not have a sticker nor white letters pointing out where the fill line is. You have to look for it under the light before you fill the bucket.This O\u2019Cedar mop got my floors WAY cleaner than a spray mop or a swipe mop (I.e. Bona microfiber detachable mop pad system or Swiffer, etc.).Once I figured out where the Max Fill Line was (lol) it t was easy to wring the mop dry, because the \u201csalad spinner\u201d-esque wring bucket hovers ABOVE the water line in the bucket, so, the more times you press the foot pedal to spin-wring the mop head dry in between or after uses, the dryer it gets.The size of the mop had is perfect: it\u2019s smaller than some, which is great for getting around a kitchen or bathroom with crevices, corners, and nooks.The mop head comes off and goes in the wash. Voila! Good as new.I recommend this mop with no hesitations. I used simply water in mind and I am just loving walking barefoot in my house now because my floors are so squeaky clean. :))",

Long gone are the days of dreading chores with huge industrial sized mops, wringing out a few of those huge thick and heavy yarn laces at a time and STILL over soaking the floor. With this there isn\u2019t even a need to bend. It\u2019s also very lightweight making it excellent for older people. When you\u2019re finished, throw that bad boy in the washer! It\u2019s PERFECT!If there was a con, I would say that the stick isn\u2019t as sturdy as a I wished it would be. Then again, my group might just be super strong from the huge mops I grew up with.Regardless of what you\u2019re used to, I have no doubt you\u2019ll love this product!",
