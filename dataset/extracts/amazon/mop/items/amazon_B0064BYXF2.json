Admittedly, I don\u2019t use the dry mop that often so today I decided to take it out on my den, wood laminate and kitchen white porcelain floors. After all this time my feelings are the same. The wet mop works great. The dry mop not so much! issue I have with the dry mop is how filthy and disgusting it is after using it. Most of the hair the hair, dust and dirt collects to the mop, which requires you to have the brush to scrape off all the garbage and scrap off the dry mop into the trash can. Then you have to go back and sweep up what\u2019s left. I\u2019m going back to vacuuming my floor and then using the great wet mop to clean it. That said, I\u2019m not sure I would spend this much money on the system. The attachment for using to wash windows outside, don\u2019t bother, definitely a pain doesn\u2019t work that well.",
