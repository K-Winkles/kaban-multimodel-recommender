                "reviewText": "Main Points: Expensive as mops go & does a decent job, but well worth the extra money as it saves all that mop hand-wringing.Purpose: Replace traditional cut-end mops with an easier to wring mop without spending a lot on replacement mop head supplies. Using to mop tile floors in two 5000sqft buildings.Pros:1. Very easy to wring (foot activated). I am recovering from a hand injury which prevents me from wringing a mop without pain. So this is great!2. Can control how wet the mop is simply by controlling how fast & how many times spin the mop head.3. Does a good job of cleaning, evening sticky stains. Never have to worry about \"refolding\" like with cut-end mops.4. Mop bucket comes with this system. In the past, I spent this much just for a heavy-duty hand-wringing rolling mop bucket for our traditional mops.5. Spin-mop heads really last. I've used heavily for 2 months (originally a really dirty/gunky floor) & haven't had to replace the mop head yet.Cons:1. Spin-mop head is relatively small. You will end up doing more back-n-forth. For our two 5000sqft buildings, it adds up. But not having the hand-wring the mops, and the ease of use, is worth it.2. No wheels on the bucket, you have to carry it around.Neutral:1. The spinning gears are plastic, which makes me wonder how long this will really last.2. The mop handle seemed awfully flimsy upon first adjusting/tightening, & I've read complaints about them not working properly. But my handle has stayed stiff & in place so far.3. I don't plan on washing the spin-mop heads in my clothes washer. Third party spin-mop heads are so cheap now, I've bought those to simply replace when the time comes. I was expecting to replace them every 2 months, but the original mop-head has continue to hold up well.4. No rotating grip on the mop handle. So when the mop is spinning to wring, you have to gentle \"hold\" the handle so it spins freely. If you have sensitive hands, this is not for you -- but then again, if you have sensitive hands you probably shouldn't be mopping.This was a good purchase. I bought a second one for myself to use at home.",

Vacuum the floor first, fill to the line marked inside the bucket, snap the microfiber mop head in (SO soft!!), screw the handle together, and have at it! The wringer part of the bucket is fantastic. No chemical cleaner either. I purchased the cleaning pods you can put in the bucket as well. Buy this \u2014 you won\u2019t regret it.",

I don't have a lot of bare floor to mop but with the rain, snow, salt and mud being tracked into the house the floors were hard to keep clean. I used Swiffer wet cloths but the shape of the mop does not allow much flexibility into corners and tighter spaces. And the cloths were getting extremely expensive, crazy expensive. I could not be happier with this product, it does an excellent job cleaning and I don't have to touch dirty pads or wring a dirty mop. It is easy to set up, use and put away. I would highly recommend this mop to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I had used this mop at work, and so I bought one for home. It really does an excellent job cleaning floors, and because you spin a lot of the water out of the mop, the floors dry quickly. The mop assembled very easily and it seems to be strong, but it does have limitations.There are really only two issues I found with this mop and neither is major. First the long handle \u201cfeels\u201d a little weak so you have to be careful not to put a lot of weight into your scrubbing. That is why I only gave it a 4 star review for deep cleaning. The upside is you could replace the handle with a wooden painter\u2019s handle, if it ever broke. The handle\u2019s end is threaded so you can get any threaded handle as a replacement; I\u2019m just recommending (if needed) a 4 foot wooden painter\u2019s handle because they are very strong.The other issue is the bucket, and I never noticed this at work. The way the bucket is designed, when you lift it up, it tilts forward. The handle is in the center of the bucket, BUT because of the mop\u2019s spinning mechanism the bucket doesn\u2019t fill evenly. Water is only in the front 2/3\u2019s of the bucket, so when you lift it, it tilts forward. Just be aware of this so you don\u2019t over fill the bucket, or you\u2019ll have water on the floor every time you lift it. I never noticed this at work, because I don\u2019t move the bucket; it sits on the floor next to a floor sink ad I work it right from there.With these two negatives being mentioned i still recommend this mop and bucket system! It does a great job of cleaning and it is way superior to a sponge mop. It leaves no water lines or drops on the floor and it does a quality job of picking up any spills. The mop head seems to hold in the dirt until you put it back in the water and wring it out. Like I previously said, the floors dry very quickly when you are done, so you don\u2019t have to stay out of those rooms for 30-45 minutes waiting. If it weren\u2019t for the bucket issue of being unbalanced, I would give this mop a 5 star review!",

                "reviewText": "Love this mop, it's easy to use. Loved the fact it came with extra mop heads, especially since after using one on the floor for so long there is no way to get it clean \"like new\" ever again. They keep their shape, they don't shed, they clean nicely. I have vinyl laminate floors that look like \"fake\" wood and this mop works perfectly on them. It spins out the water just like it's supposed to. After wringing out the water, the mop head dries rather quickly. I'd buy this again for sure.",

This mop is so easy to use and keep clean. The centrifugal feature works fantastically and I love that you can get so much water out of the mop this way. Once you\u2019re finished mopping, just throw the (detachable) mop head into the washing machine, and\u2026 voila! I wish I\u2019d bought one of these years ago.",
