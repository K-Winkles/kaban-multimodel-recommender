                "reviewText": "I got tired of buying Swiffer replacement pads and separate ones for wet mopping and dry mopping. I remembered how we had these o\u2019Cedar mop heads when we cleaned our home for sale, and how effective they were, so I purchased a couple of sets of these. I could not be happier, nor could our housekeeper. Not only are they reusable and cost efficient, but they also pick up dust and dust bunnies far better than the Swiffer ever did. All of the little nubs are in use as opposed to just the outer edges of the Swiffer. We also love that we just throw them in the washing machine when we\u2019re done and the cost of water and soap are far less than a package of replacement Swiffer. We also don\u2019t have to spend extra time and extra money to find and purchase the extra long Swiffer, which can be hard to find. We use one of these for every room, first try mopping with the blue nubs, and then wet mopping with the flat side. My dark cherry floors have never looked cleaner, and I\u2019ve never been so streak-free. I\u2019m thrilled to be getting rid of all of my \u201cconvenience\u201d staples From when I was single and replacing them with what I should\u2019ve been using all along because they are so much more convenient and effective. I cannot recommend these mopheads enough. They are fabulous, and I knew it, and for reasons I can\u2019t explain, I just simply forgot.",
