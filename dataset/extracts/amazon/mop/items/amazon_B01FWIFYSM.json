                "reviewText": "I bought 3 pads so I could easily mop my whole house of wood & vinyl floors. IT ALL TAKES ABOUT 15 MINS. Using the Libman mop pads, all I do is run clear water over the previously \"washing machine\" washed pads in mysink, ring out the water with bare hands...then, mop. Then, I take each dirty pad outside, lay it on concrete and hose each one down with the jet spray on my garden hose. THIS CLEANS THEM WELL ENOUGH TO USE AGAIN. I either just let them dry and use them next time as is. Or, I put them in the washing machine for the next mopping.When I used to mop with a regular mop, I used to do the following.1. Wash my dirty sink first to not add more dirt to my floors.2. Fill the same sink with soapy water.3. Dunk the mop in and ring it out with gloves on.4. Mop and then drain the dirty water & run clean water in the sink.5. With gloves, dunk the dirty mop into the clean water & ring it out 3 times.6. I would repeat this process 3 times per mop area.I DID THIS PROCESS 6 or 7 TIMES or until my floors were clean and the dirty water was finally clear.THIS ALL TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR OR MORE. IT WAS A BIG PAIN. NOW IT'S A BREEZE the pads !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
