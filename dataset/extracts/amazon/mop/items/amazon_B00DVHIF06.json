                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve always used microfiber mops, I find that they work best for the types of floor that I have (hardwood and tile). They don\u2019t last that long though which is why I\u2019ve gone through several over the past few years. In fact, the handle on my last one just snapped, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.The reason why I got it is simple- it was cheap. I got it while it was on sale for a price that I just couldn\u2019t refuse. It came with all the stuff that I like too like reusable pads, a swivel head, and a telescoping handle. I\u2019ll admit the qualitys not the best but then again most mops are like these nowadays. You just gotta replace them once they break. Thats probably why they\u2019re affordalbe in the first place. What I did notice was the pads was kind of floppy on the ends. Compared the other ones Ive used the material is also thinner. What I\u2019m planning to do is replace them with microfiber pads from turbo mops - they\u2019re the ones that I used before. I looked at the measurements and it looks like the corners will stick out a bit but i\u2019m okay with that as long as it allows me to mop more efficiently.Anyways, the day after I got it I gave it a try. Assembling the thing was easy, you just put the parts together. Once I got that done I decided to use it to clean the kitchen. Its been over a week since my last mop broke so a bunch of stuff has accumulated on the tile floors since. As always I began by wetting the microfiber pad. You cant get rid of anything with a dry cloth after all! Afterwards I got out my spray bottle and used it to mist the floor (Its a DIY solution that I made from vinegar and water). Then I went over it with the microfiber pad. It got dirty quickly, I had to switch the pad once in the middle. *I know Bona sells their own line of cleaners but I would much rather just use stuff that I already have at home. Maybe someday I\u2019ll try their stuff but not anytime soon.*Pros:- Lightweight and easy to push around- Uses microfiber pads instead of disposable ones- Swivel head swings 360 degrees which makes it easier to mop- Great for reaching under furniture and objects- You can use any cleaner you want with itOverall I\u2019m happy with how the mop worked. Its comparable to the ones I used in the past- the swivel head lets me get into those nooks and crannies and the extendable handle means that I can reach way farther than I can normally.Its likely that I won\u2019t buy this product again but thats not because I don\u2019t like it at all, its because I have a habit of trying different mops once the one I\u2019m using breaks. For what it is, I would say that this mop is worth the money. Its cheap and it gets the job done for your hardfloors!",

                "reviewText": "I am rating this Bona Microfiber mop a 4/5 based on Amazon\u2019s scale of a 4 being \u201cI like it!\u201d. The mop is a nice size and does exactly what it\u2019s meant to do, but I feel like the mop handle itself could be a little bit more sturdy. I have only just received the mop, and only used it a few times so far, but I do think a stronger mop handle would be better in the long run, especially if you will be using this frequently. I have wood flooring in my kitchen and dining room, and therefore, tend to use the mop 1-2 times daily, depending on meals and messes, etc.The mop is fairly easy to maneuver and is pretty lightweight. It doesn\u2019t take up too much room when storing it either. I am able to discretely place mine on the far side of my refrigerator and have quick access to it when I need to use it. The mop comes with a microfiber mop pad as well as a dusting pad. The microfiber pad attaches easily and effortlessly. I have already washed mine two times and it has not changed the way the pad fits back onto the mop. I did not dry it though, as I wasn\u2019t sure if it would shrink, and it really wasn\u2019t worth the risk. Not to mention, microfiber dries almost instantly, so within an hour or so it was dry again anyway.I would recommend this mop to anyone who has wood floors in their home. I feel it is a good value for what you get. It is very simple and easy to use. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will be happy to answer any that I am able to answer. Enjoy. :)",
