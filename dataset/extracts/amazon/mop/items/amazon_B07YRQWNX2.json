                "reviewText": "I purchased this product to reduce my use of costly and un-eco-friendly one-use/disposable cleaning products.I think the quality of this product is pretty good for its price. The only issue I've had with it so far is that I used the white fabric tab to pull off the pad on the first use and it ripped, so one of my pads no longer has a pull-tab. I don't use the pull-tabs to remove the pads anymore-- I just grab the edge of the pad and take it off the mat.The mop is very lightweight, which is great in theory for storage and use but requires more elbow grease to clean the tougher spots since the mop itself doesn't put much pressure on the floor to scrub it. Especially along a wall or corner, I have to put my foot on top of the mop to press it down to scrub harder to clean the tougher spots.The refillable container holds about a cup and a half of liquid, which lasts me about 3 weeks of cleaning my floors once per week in my small apartment (I only have tile in the bathroom and kitchen). I imagine in a house with mostly hard floors, this would only last you one time of cleaning. I fill with a teaspoon of Dr. Bronner's Castille soap and add distilled water to fill.I would not recommend purchasing this if you already have a swiffer wet jet- it is always more eco-friendly to use what you already have and modify it to make it better for the environment. If you have a swiffer wet jet, I would recommend looking for a refillable container that will fit into your wet jet that you can fill with a non-toxic floor cleaner. I personally did not yet own a wet-jet/wet-mop set-up and was using my regular swiffer with a wet pad to wet-mop my floors, so I purchased this product.Overall, I am very happy with this product and its ease of use!",
