It's nice to be able to use my own spray formula or water as I choose. Though the first one of mine was missing a pad and I had to get a replacement. Works well on picking up liquid spills but if it's a puddle, you're better off using a towel first. And if you need some hard scrubbing, do that first and use this to clean up the aftermath. It does feel a little \"breakable\" but I'm not one to try to break thin pipes so it'll last me just fine.",

I am able to use it with my own cleaner, which is a cost savings and allows me to use it on multiple floors using different cleaners. It also came with two extra mop pads, and a small plastic scrubby tool that is attached to the pole, which is quite handy and convenient to use. This is a great mop for quick cleanups.

                "reviewText": "The hunt for an easy way of mopping my apartment led me to this compact mop. Although it does what I wanted it to do, I'm only giving it four stars as I do not believe the quality is all that great.Overall Performance (4/5): This mop is practical and does its job nicely. It's been a useful tool for cleaning my small apartment. Its narrow shape and the fact that it does not need a bucket, make it easy to use in small spaces.Build Quality (3/5): Yes, it works, it will do its job, but I do not think that it will last long due to its quality. The individual parts appear to be very cheap, and I have some reservations about how this mop will continue to hold up over time. When I was putting it together, I kept feeling like I was going to snap it. It is not very sturdy. However, This is not a deal-breaker for me since I'm moving soon and won't be keeping it for long.Longevity Thoughts (3/5): If you're looking for a cleaning solution that's going to last, I don't think this is it. I am moving soon, and it is cheaper than Swift and other brands, so I really did not need something to last, but if you do, I would probably steer away.In conclusion, this lightweight mop effectively cleans up spills, dust, messes, and what have you, and it should be fine for temporary use. However, if you're looking for something that will last longer and be more reliable, you may want to consider spending a little more money.",
