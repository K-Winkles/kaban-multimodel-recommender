                "reviewText": "I love the bucket with the separate tank for dirty water, and the spinner- I really love- not touching the dirty mop head to wring it out. The original handle was not very sturdy and I ended up duct taping it in the extended position bc it contantly would not stay in position. This one is a bit better, but I am going to try a different brand mop head & handle bc I don't really like the way the light weight flimsiness of this and I really dont like that the different buckets have a different heads. I will see if a generic mop & head will spin in this.",

                "reviewText": "Looking at the pictures, I thought that this set was an exact duplicate of the O'Cedar, only much cheaper -- but I was wrong. The mop head itself, and the fuzzy mops, are quite a bit smaller than the O'Cedar, but as it turns out, this has advantages: I can now reach the mop into places previously inaccessible to my standard O'Cedar! AND the important thing -- the handle DOES WORK with the original, larger mop heads! which is great, since that's what I bought it for -- to replace my O'Cedar mop handle that was co-opted for another use. SO -- different but on the whole, a bit better!",
