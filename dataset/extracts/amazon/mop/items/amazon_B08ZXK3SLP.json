                "reviewText": "When I saw that the sponge I use for my mop is labeled a \"Frequently Returned\" item, I was surprised. I believe this is the only sponge that fits my mop, which leads me to believe that the mop is also frequently returned. However, I am confused as to why people are returning the sponge. While it requires a bit of effort to scrub the floors with it, that is the case with any mop. With any mop, all you do is push the dirt around. I use this mop and sponge for quick cleanups, but for more thorough cleaning, I prefer to use a bucket, scrub brush, rag, and toothbrush for the baseboards and cracks. I have been using this mop and sponge for the past seven years, and I have never had any issues with it. You need to rinse the floors after mopping to ensure you don't push the dirt around, but that is the case with any mop.I am curious to read the reviews to find out why the sponge is frequently returned. However, since I have been using it for so long, I am just going to purchase it again. I only use the mop on days when I don't have enough time to do a thorough cleaning. If my memory serves me right, at one time they did offer this mop in two sizes. The mop I have is the smaller of the two, and I don't think they make the larger one anymore. Therefore, it is possible that the sponge is being returned because people who have the larger mop keep buying it in hopes that it will fit their mop, even though it won't. If you have the smaller of the two mops, this is the mop head for you. Don't hesitate to buy it because it says \"frequently returned.\" This mop head is very durable and holds up well, as long as you clean it after each use and do not use bleach on it. It is one of the best mop heads available on the market, and for the price, it is a great value.",
