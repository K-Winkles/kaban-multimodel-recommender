I hate assembling anything, but this was very easy. The cloths are thick and durable and are machine washable. The pick will come in handy before washing. The bonus for me, was being able to use any solution of my preference. You can't beat the price. It sprays evenly, and you can adjust that too. If I could do a commercial for this wet/dry mop I would:)",
