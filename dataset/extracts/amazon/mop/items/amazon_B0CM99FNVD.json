                "reviewText": "I have no doubt that this is a superior mop pad. I say that having tried dozens of different pads over the past years. For the most part, those are all the same.When it comes to the short-nap (short fiber) mop pads nothing I've seen comes close to these. They're thicker, and tighter. There's simply more fibers in these, and that makes for more surface area, and more liquid pickup & retention.These are not floppy like all the others, either. They're rather rigid, and that's because the backing is better, as well. They even look different with grey & white striping on one set, and the third being a sort of grey & white marbled design. Very unique for a truly unique (and high quality) mop pad.These don't seem to cost any more, either. They're priced essentially the same as the others, and in fact, they're less expensive than some that are just inferior.They are very well bound, and this is the only brand to provide support on the outside edges on the bottom, where the pads have a tendency to curl up.Works like a charm, cleans easily. Toss 'em in the washing machine, and they come out like new.Fantastic product, and clearly way better than the competition. Great value.",

I\u2019m very visual and I work hard on not having those colors in my home. (Rubbermaid are you listening?) Gray is perfect for me!The quality is good and the stitching professional. They attach to my mop very nicely. Be sure to measure your mop head. It doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect match but the Velcro on your mop head needs to at least be covered by the pad to stay attached.I think the value is good and these should survive a wash or two to be reusable.I would order these again",

                "reviewText": "With my previous wet mop handle, it works perfectly! Excellent alternative mop head! was relieved to find that the refills are so affordable. I simply give the pads a quick wash in hot water, wring them out in a pail, and hang them out to dry. Even though I don't think I need to, it's nice to know that I can machine wash, if required. I now have extras to switch out as well.",

                "reviewText": "I find these pretty absorbent, if a bit on the thin side. These did not come in a vacuum sealed bag like some I've received, so I did not have to pre-soak them. They are a generic size but you still need to measure if you use the end tabs on the mop head. The measurements on the listing are accurate. I see these lasting several months at least.",

                "reviewText": "The HiBaby brand's \"Flat Mop Pads\" are a reusable three-pack of flat mop heads.They perform well and can be reused many times. When laundering or hand washing (which is what I recommend for longest life and to avoid transferring floor dirt to your washer), don't use any fabric softener so as to maintain absorbency.Pros:Universal compatibility: Fits various flat mop brands, potentially saving you money on buying brand-specific refills.High absorbency: Microfiber material tackles dirt and absorbs water effectively, making wet and dry cleaning a breeze.Reusable and washable: Saves money and reduces waste compared to disposable mop pads.Easy cleaning: The ultra-fine fibers capture dirt and grime efficiently, leaving floors spotless with minimal effort.Cons:Pricey compared to alternatives: Disposable mop pads can be cheaper, and other reusable options might offer similar performance at a lower cost.Brand reputation unknown: HiBaby is a relatively new brand, so its track record for quality and customer service is yet to be established.Keep in mind that using and laundering microfiber products releases microplastic particles.",
