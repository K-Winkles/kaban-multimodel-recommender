                "reviewText": "As a career Sailor, I know a thing or two about swabbing decks (Mopping floors for you landlubbers!). I have real hardwood floors throughout my house. They have much of their beautiful grain and are not sanded flat. I'm getting on into my geezer years, so I wanted to avoid resorting to the trusty cotton mop, and heavy, yellow mop bucket. I tried the sponge mop, the mop with the cloth strips, and the various Swiffers. None of them did a great job, especially under furniture and in tight spots. The Swiffer Wet Jet left a film on the wood. I decided to try this before I went back to Ol' Yeller. The O Cedar is easy to handle and very maneuverable. It gets into tight spaces like corners, under furniture, and along the baseboards. Best of all, it cleans the low spots on my hardwood floors. The spin wringer is super simple to use and removes just enough water so it doesn't leave puddles on the floor. The bucket doesn't have wheels, but it's light enough to move fairly easily. Since the mop doesn't drip, I can leave the bucket in the living room and just carry the mop down the long hallway. No mess! After mopping, I rinse the bucket and the mop twice with clear water. I let the mop dry on my truck's tailgate in the sun. It never stinks. This is a great way to clean your floors. I wish I would have gotten this in the first place.P.S. I never thought I'd be writing a review on a mop. This thing is just that good!",
