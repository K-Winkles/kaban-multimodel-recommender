The unique design and structure of PVA mop heads can effectively clean various types of floors, including hardwood, tile, and laminate, without leaving streaks or residue. So PVA mops do not require the use of harsh chemicals.",
            "You need a PVA sponge mop \u2013 All floor mops for cleaning will leave a lot of water stains, only the PVA sponge mop can absorb 80-90% of water. You don't worry about falling anymore. It works best on tiles, hardwood floors, marble, and your kitchen and bathroom.For use on wood floors recommended that the Angle between the PVA mop and the ground be less than 45\u00b0 to reduce friction, and the Angle of 30\u00b0 is the most energy saving.",
            "Superior Absorbency: PVA material has high absorbency, allowing the mop to pick up and hold more water and dirt than traditional microfiber or sponge mops. Microfiber",
            "A UNIQUE PHENOMENON \u2013 The sponge absorbs water as you mop, so your floors dry in minutes. When not in use, the sponge dries hard so it will not pick up odors or smells like other conventional and sponge mops. When you need to use it again, just soak it in water for a while and it will be restored. Wring out only when the sponge head is completely soft and wet and fully absorbed with water.",
            "Durable and Long-Lasting: PVA mops are made of high-quality materials that are resistant to wear and tear, making them more durable and longer-lasting than traditional mops. Due to the influence of PVA material, it will become hard after drying, please soak in water for 1-5 minutes before use, warm water is better."

So there\u2019s virtually very little time to wait before you can go back across the floor.The only issue I had with it, which was my own fault. Is it an extra large mop. It makes it a little bit more difficult to work with especially in smaller places.I did find a similar one that was 11 inches I believe and it worked much easier for me.

I was searching for another to replace it with and found this new and improved mop. It took me half the time to clean my floors, as it is wider and covers more area. My floors dry in minutes! I love this mop!",

                "reviewText": "Initially this mop assembled easily and worked well. After several uses we noticed a brown substance that was discoloring the sponge head. It looked like it was coming from where the sponge connects to the mop assembly. We assumed it was rust. We left it to dry suspended over our utility sink and the \u201crust\u201d stained the sink which was hard to clean up. The sponge has since hardened to the point if left in hot water for 15 minutes was still too hard for the squeegee to work without breaking the plastic parts and had to be hand squeezed to soften the sponge. In retrospect I could not recommend this mop even though it had an attractive price.",

                "reviewText": "So upon opening the product I was satisfied with how wide the mop head is. Will mop more area at a time. I was not happy that one of the mop head are ripped *see pics* I don\u2019t like spending my money on new things that don\u2019t come in great shape. I can see this not holding up for long due to the damage in it already. The directions could have also been better. It wasn\u2019t hard to put together per se but you do need to put a little muscle into sliding the mop head on and off and connecting and disconnecting the piece that attached to the pull bar. Be careful though as to not break the plastic. It\u2019s not made super sturdy. We shall see how long it hold up. Not sure right now it\u2019s worth the money. Will update later if need be.",

It takes more then 5-7 minutes to soak and get soften before you can even mop. very hard to maneuvering and takes lot of pressure to mop. Product details does not clearly said that. because of hardness of the sponge Wringing mechanism could break anytime. Complete Waste, Do not BUY",
