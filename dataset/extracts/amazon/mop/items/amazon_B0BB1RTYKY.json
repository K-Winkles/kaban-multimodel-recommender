                "reviewText": "This is my 4th electric mop in close to 4 years time. Its also the first time I've ever purchased/used an AlfaBot mop. The 3 previous mops I owned all started out fantastic at first. One lasted a year and a half, one lasted 6 months, the other lasted nearly a year. All 3 broke the same way. The piece that connects the pole to the bottom of the mop was small and plastic and broke in all 3 mops. After the 3rd mop broke, I wasn't sure if I should get another. I looked at various electric mops for sale here on Amazon and decided to go with this mop thanks to the reasonable price as well as the helpful reviews left by other customers.Assembly is simple. Took me less than 5 minutes. It did not come charged so I had to charge it prior to use. (That's not a complaint...wasn't a big deal to me that I first had to charge it) Once it was charged I was excited to test it out. (I'm a clean-freak...I LOVE to clean-that's why I was excited to try it out! Weird, I know...lol) The mop is smaller than my previous 3 and works just as well. The little piece that broke my other 3 is bigger and FAR more sturdy than the others. The mop is lightweight, glides across floors with ease and is easy to steer. Thanks to its smaller size and ability to swing 180/90 degrees it does a fantastic job of cleaning 'hard to reach' areas. (The LED light also is a factor in getting 'hard to reach' areas -its very helpful) The mop does make a noise while in use but its not loud at all)4 pads, a charging cord/adapter /measuring cup and an ION battery are all includedI'm loving this mop! Easy to use, well made, works great and is very reasonably priced. I have a good feeling about this mop! I think its going to clean my floors for a long time.",

It does not have that function. So if you're looking for something that will assist with a deep clean, this is not the product. This product is solely for daily message and spells.",

Hay un par de mapas que tienen algo m\u00e1s de fuerza sin da\u00f1ar el suelo.En mi caso lo uso para madera natural, no hab\u00eda le\u00eddo opiniones al respecto y prob\u00e9 y estoy encantada. Yo no veo cercos ni nada de eso que dicen. Pongo incluso la cera . Las mapas se retiran para cambiarlas o lavarlas perfectamente. Las meto a la lavadora son de buena calidad, no pierden un pelo, salen perfectas. El sistema de velero tambi\u00e9n funciona correctamente no se mueven.La luz es un extra a\u00f1adido especialmente al limpiar zonas de m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil acceso.La mopa es muy ligera se flexiona en cualquier direcci\u00f3n y se endereza muy f\u00e1cilmente y es s\u00faper estable. Tambi\u00e9n se recoge y guarda muy discretamente por ello. Quiz\u00e1s por ello el dep\u00f3sito no puede ser m\u00e1s grande pero es suficiente.La bater\u00eda a mi me parece que dur mucho, incluso para m\u00e1s de 2 usos alguna vez. A veces presi\u00f3n para insistir en alguna zona y ni se para ni pierde fuerza, estoy encantada.Tarda unas horas en cargar, dir\u00eda que unas 4. Antes de descargar se pone un rojo intermitente que a\u00fan permite un breve tiempo de uso.LA RECOMIENDO TOTALMENTE",
