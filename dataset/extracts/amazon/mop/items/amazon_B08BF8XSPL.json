As soon as you buy them, they are discontinued and replaced with something else. Then you\u2019re stuck with gadgets you can\u2019t use. I have a bad back so sweeping with the broom is painful for me. Using these things allows me to be able to vacuum, mop the floors every day with ease! I love that you just toss them after the fact! They hold a lot of debris, and hold up to mopping right after you vacuum! My only complaint is that the price can be a bit high at times. Other than that they are great. I will continue to order as long the price is reasonable.",

I was convinced I had ordered some knockoffs because they don\u2019t work half as good as the grey pads. I\u2019m so disappointed. I recently moved and all more floors are wood and ceramic. I was so glad I had previously purchased the Shark Vac. I have given the vac high praise, but these replacement pads totally suck! They fall apart and tear up. I want the same kind that came with the vac, not some imitation of the original. And if these blue pads are the new original, I am truly disappointed!",
