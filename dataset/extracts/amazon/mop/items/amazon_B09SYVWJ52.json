                "reviewText": "I have been through countless brooms and mops of different sizes, brands, types\u2026 Swiffers, O\u2019Cedars, wring out mops, plain Jane old fashioned squeegee mops, plastic bristle brooms, straw brooms\u2026. this one puts all of the rest to absolute shame.I have all faux wood flooring throughout my apartment and a short haired, 75 pound doggo that sheds incessantly, and many little messes made by the doggo\u2019s super toddler. This thing is practically a miracle.In just one sweeping/dry mopping session the dog hair is nonexistent (which is a freaking magic trick or something), all of the fine dirt particles (and cracker crumbs and little things that were probably something are one point in time but have been chewed beyond recognition), dust particles\u2026. it\u2019s all gone in a once over.I have not yet used it as a wet mop. I do stop use my O\u2019Cedar spray, microfiber mop to do sanitation and a wring out mop to take care of big spills.I was kicking myself in the rear and for spending $30 on a broom. This is, quite literally, probably the best $30 I\u2019ve ever wasted. I\u2019ve noticed less dust particles flying around (wooden furniture is not in need of a deep dusting right after I sweep) and my allergies have even improved after starting to use this dust mop/broom. I\u2019m sold. It came with 5 microfiber cloths (instead of the three) but I haven\u2019t even had to use another one because the scraper that comes with it (the little grey plastic piece with teeth that attaches to the pole) knocks off all of the excess dog hair and dust like a charm.I\u2019ve used it daily since it arrived a couple of weeks ago. So, I\u2019m not sure how durable it is going to turn out to be with Velcro being what attaches the cloth to the pole\u2026 but surely the Velcro will stay in place for a good while\u2026 and if not, replacing Velcro isn\u2019t a difficult task and would be well worth it.Def won\u2019t throw the microfiber in the drier. Will be air dried all the way.Every time I use this contraption, I\u2019m more and more impressed. Like, my floors actually FEEL clean after using this when walking around in bare feet\u2026 even with a doggo and a kiddo running around. Freaking amazing.Def has Swiffer and company beat, hands down. Very sturdy; seems durable; outrageous amount of money spent on a broom that was well worth it. I suspect it\u2019s one that will last for years (fingers crossed, Hail Mary).",

But once I removed the pad to wash it, it absolutely would not work like it was supposed to. Not even with a new pad. The squeeze bar is supposed to glide over the pad to remove excess water. Like I said, beautiful the first time. Thereafter it just would not \u201cglide\u201d correctly over the pad. It kept getting caught and if forced, it would spit and splash the water along with moving the pad. I have tried everything I can think of and it is just so frustratingly awful. I got so angry I just threw the stupid thing and then of course it really broke!!! DO NOT BUY THIS MOP!!",

I am pleased, though, with the size of the cleaning pads, their quality, and that it comes with one already on the mop head and four extras! If I can figure out how to keep the middle section of the handle from constantly popping out, I know I'll love mopping with it.",
