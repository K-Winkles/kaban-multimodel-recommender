Including our Swiffer Wet Jet and the pad is longer than the wet jet base but it works for me that it covers more floor with each pass. Not a problem.My favorite features are that it saves money, is washable, and can be washed hundreds of times. It\u2019s flexible because we have used it dry and wet. It has been great at picking up dust and dog hair. It has worked great cleaning our hardwood and vinyl flooring. We get better coverage and it cleans better and seems to be more absorbent than the disposable single use pads. I ordered these for our vacation home and I told my mother to order this product too. So, it\u2019s clear I recommend this and I really like it.",

This did help a lot but is kind of a pain finding a place to dry them. Other than that they work well and pick up the hair and dirt well. The size is spot on as well. Price is on par with others.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really great deal for reusable mop pads. I followed the directions on them and soaked them for 15 minutes and then let them air dry before trying them out. They fit perfectly on the swiffer power mop and stay attached really well. They also work well with the swiffer wet jet, they just have a little bit of overhang in the sides. I use them mostly in my kitchen and living room and they clean my floors really well, just as well as the disposable ones. It\u2019s really convenient that you can throw them in the washing machine also. I\u2019m very excited to save so much money not buying the disposable mop pads anymore.",

                "reviewText": "The size is great and makes it easy to clean along edges and baseboards.I soaked pads and let them dry per the instructions and the pad stuck to the mop the entire time, unlike other brands. After I used it, it took effort to get it off.The pads clean extremely well especially on textured tile that I normally have to use a scrub brush on to get clean. These rinse off easily, including hair that is tough to remove from microfiber cloths. There were no care instructions so I'm not sure how to launder these or care for them long term to be sure they last as long as possible.I used the same pad to mop about 900 sq ft of tile, rinsing after each room and it was still cleaning as well on last room as it was in the first! I really like how well they worked and my wife was amazed too.**Note** The side of the box indicated by the \"check marks\" these are to be used Hardwood and Laminate, not Vinyl or Tile. I believe this is a typo however I could be wrong.God Bless,Pastor Michael Rodriguez",

We like to use one for the kitchen, then change the pad each time we move to a different room. They clean very well. We wash them, lay them flat and let them air dry. We have used them several times and I feel like these are going to hold up nicely to be able to use them many times. We like the reusable pads better than the disposable, because it\u2019s cost saving and the reusable are thicker. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy using washable mop pads for my spray mop. These come in a set of 5 and are great for large houses since I change my pads after using in the bathroom before mopping in the bedroom, then another for the living room, and another for the kitchen. I even use a mop pad for the back screened in porch. They wash easy and lie flat to dry, This set has a lower nap on them and i haven\u2019t noticed any big difference comparing to them the ones with a thicker thread and bigger loop nap. I think the bigger loops and bigger thread pick up and hold more than these. But then again, there are 5 in a pack so I still get a clean house.",
