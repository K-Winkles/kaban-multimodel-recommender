            "TWO IN ONE MOP SYSTEM. This dual-action replacement mop pad fits rectangular chenille style mop handles. It is a two-in-one mopping system that gives any hard floor surface of your home or work space a masterful clean, wet or dry.",
            "DRY DUST OR DEEP CLEAN. With 360 degree technology- one side features an ultra-dense chenille fabric for dry dusting and dirt pickup; the opposite side contains microfiber padding for a deeper clean. Pair the chenille pad with your preferred floor cleaner or glass cleaning solution. Or, simply use water or a diluted natural cleaner for an eco-friendly clean.",
            "SUITABLE FOR ALL SIZED SPACES. The head is sizable enough (17.6 x 5.3 inch) to fully clean even the tightest spaces in less time. The microfiber padding collects small particles such as dust, dander, pet hair, and other allergens while you sweep, rather than move debris around like similar pads currently on the market.",
            "REMARKABLE SUSTAINABILITY. With a 3 pack, these mop heads are durable and easy to switch out, this replacement pad can also be machine washed up to a hundred times without losing efficiency. It is suitable for use on all types of hard floor surfaces in homes, work, schools, restaurants, and much more.",
            "SIMPLE APPLICATION: All you have to do is slip this replacement pad onto your mop with the flick of the wrist, and attach the hook and loop closure. Then you can get to making your house look spick and span!"
