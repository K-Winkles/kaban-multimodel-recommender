                "reviewText": "These work well. The Velcro fits nicely and strongly adheres to the power mop. I have used both laminate and wood flooring and the mop pad did not scratch, picked up dirt extremely well, and was highly absorbent. The strong absorbency helps the floor dry more quickly, which is an added bonus.I have not yet washed the pads and given no instructions on how to care for the pads, I plan on washing in a laundry bag to extend the life. We have a relatively small kitchen area we mop regularly, and a quick rinse has been enough to keep the pad going without needing a full wash. In addition to these working so well, they will save you money by being reusable and are better for the environment than the disposable power mop pads.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking at various ways to swap for more sustainable products around my home and this was one of the easiest swaps.In the past, we would buy those swiffer mop pads, use them once and toss after. This is so much more sustainable and even more cost effective!This set includes a 2-pack of microfiber mop heads that easily attach to your already existing swiffer mop. You can use the mop multiple times before throwing in the washer. Washes well and ready to use right after!So glad I ordered these!",
