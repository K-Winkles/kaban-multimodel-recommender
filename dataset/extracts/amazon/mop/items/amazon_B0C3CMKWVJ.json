Anyway, this is a great simple little mop and I like that the pads are washable. However, I will not be putting cinnamon in the cleanser container this time. I'll just keep it in a separate spray bottle!",

                "reviewText": "Much nicer than swiffer. Solution sprays out in a triangular fashion. This mop is wide so it cleans a wider surface floor area. Sprayer works great on the handle and I don't have to worry about accidentally squeezing it while mopping. Mop glides smoothly on wet floors without the washable microfiber pad feeling like it's gonna come off while using. Assembly only took 5min to put together. I used it as soon as it arrived and my kitchen floor looks clean using my own personal cleaning solution. Im gonna save a ton by not having to buy disposable pads and pre-made solution. No batteries required.1. Would I recommend to a friend? For now I would say yes, but that can change after a 3-6 month **Update** coming soon.",
