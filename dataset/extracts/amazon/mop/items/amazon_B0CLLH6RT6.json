The handle attaches easily together just by tightening. The last piece of the handle has the top of the mop and it just snaps in place over a mop head . I took advantage of the new mop head , went over ceiling corners and crevices for a quick dust. This attacks dust , it\u2019s a dry mop that can do a whole lot of dusting .Easy enough to clean, I put it in my mini apartment washer for a quick wash by itself .Very HappyEnjoy",
