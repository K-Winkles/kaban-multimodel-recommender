Overall, a very good mop and I would recommend it.",

I read someone say \"streaky.\" IT absolutely does not leave the floor too wet, nor streaky. The sponge part of the mop does a great job leaving the floor as wet or as dry as you want, depending on the pressure you put on the mop head. It is a sponge, obviously, so if you press hard enough you can get it to leave water on the floor if you want to, but under normal pressure it will leave you with as nice an \"almost dry floor\" as you could want. Depending on the angle of the sponge this mop skips a bit on the pull-back stroke, which is fine, I guess. I think that most mop heads will require a precise technique if you want to avoid that.The size is good because while a little narrower than mops from decades past, this means that it fits into the top of standard round bucket pretty well. This size also doesn't really seem to affect the size of the task much, so overall the size is a benefit.My biggest gripe with this mop, is the location of the wring lever. I much prefer a ring lever closer to the top of the mop. The wring lever on this is quite low causing the user to have to bend over the bucket to wring it. Aside from the inconvenience of a sore back, there is also a greater risk to clothing damage if you are using a cleaner like bleach, due to close proximity of the mop and bucket to the upper torso when you wring it. I don't want a mop to require I wear special clothes and shower afterwards. I'd remove three stars for this, but given the lack of competition-- I didn't.Second is more of a concern than a flaw, the plastic tab that holds the mop head on is pretty thin. That aspect doesn't seem that sturdy to me, but so far the mop-head has stayed snug. I've mopped a 6x8 room about 10 times.Lastly, the pieces of the handle screw together, and inevitably they do loosen and have to be retightened every so often.Would I buy this again? Yes, but I would leave it in a heart-beat for something half-way decent with a lever closer to the top.",

It cant hold what water you put in it nor what it picks up without dripping. Like the difference between a sponge scrubby from target scotch brite or a 10-pak from 99\u00a2 store. They molded it to look like cellulose too! But it isnt",

I was looking for a mop that would clean the surface of the tile and all that sticks to it. If it got the grout clean too, that would be a bonus. This mop does neither! First of all the design is ridiculously flawed. The 3 piece handle continues to loosen as you use the mop, so you must stop what you are cleaning to tighten the pieces, or else the handle comes apart. Second, The mop head and added squeegee are not well thought out. Who designs these tools?? Look at the photos attached. You cannot clean a corner unless you take the squeegee off first otherwise you cannot get the mop into the corner. Third, IT DOESN'T CLEAN! I use a 2-bucket cleaning system. 1 bucket is plain water for rinsing the dirty mop off and 1 bucket is soapy for cleaning the floor. Many people have the same such system. After cleaning an area (approx 5'x5'), using my 2-bucket system, I noticed neither bucket of water was getting very \"dirty\". I let the floor dry for about 1 hour, then went back with my dreaded Swiffer Wet cloths. The floor was SO dirty. See the pictures attached. The mop did not clean the floor. Gross! I will be going back to my Swiffer cloths, which seem to be getting most of the dirt up (and can get into corners) until I find a better option. CAN NOT recommend this mop...",
