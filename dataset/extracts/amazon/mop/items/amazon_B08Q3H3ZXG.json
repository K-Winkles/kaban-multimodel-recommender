The pads barely fit and if you do not take the time to put them on perfectly, you will scrape the baseboards. if they added a couple of inches to all sides and strengthen the pole, it would be GREAT and I would give it five stars.I DONT THINK IT WOULD HOLD UP for cleaning very dirty floors; the pole would not survive.",
