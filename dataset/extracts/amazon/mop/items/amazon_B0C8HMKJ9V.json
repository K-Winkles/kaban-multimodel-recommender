They\u2019re awful, hardly any \u2018fluff\u2019 on them whereas the vileda ones are really full. Once they get wet there\u2019s hardly anything to mop with. I bought this spinner cz it was on sale for \u00a316 in Asda, I think that I\u2019ll be sticking to purchasing Vileda but unfortunately made the mistake of buying 2 packs of these. It\u2019s false economy. I definitely will not be purchasing any \u2018cheap\u2019 mop heads & will pay the \u00a36 in Tesco {on Clubcard special for \u00a34.50 I think they were today}. Will certainly be purchasing a few if those whilst they\u2019re on sale. My opinion DO NOT BUY! Cheap isn\u2019t worth it.",
