I loved the simple design of this mop, the very reasonable price, as well as the ability to attach other mopping pads/reusable cleaning cloths.

Unfortunately within five minutes of mopping my floors, the metal mopping stick (handle) completely bent to the point where I cannot use it again. If the stick was made of a stronger material this would really be an ideal cleaning tool for this price.",

I have 2 other mop sweeps an old one (retired now )as the fabric started to become unravelled and was very difficult to get it clean, and a cotton industrial one, very good for dry seeeping but fronds too long for wet mopping or oil application. This new mop sweep is perfect for damp dry sweeping or damp mopping. The microfibres are short and won\u2019t pull and unravel, they are easy to clean , either wet or dry. The pads attach/ detach easily and are are machine washable. The pad I use for oil application is kept in a bag and not washed\u2019 daily.The swivel joint on the plate/ handle attachment is easily manoeuvred making getting under / around furniture a breeze.My only gripe is the collapsible handle feels a little flimsy and wobbles a wee bit during use, my other mop seeeps have sturdier handles.But that being said it\u2019s a great product.",
