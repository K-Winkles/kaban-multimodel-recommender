                "reviewText": "Love this set. So versatile. I can modify it for the current need. Also lightweight and very transportable which is actually why I bought it. Assembles quickly & easily. Can adjust somewhat to different heights. Cleans well.I needed a mop once a week for a different location, but no place to store a mop there. This completely answered that need. I can take 3 poles for the handle and the flat mop in very little space. Easily fits in my backpack and adds next to no weight! Does the job quick and does it well. It is reasonably sturdy, especially considering how light weight it is.The only hiccup is that the bucket, while easy enough to \"open,\" it is really difficult to collapse again. But that stiffness may loosen a little over time. Right now I am not using the bucket but I see many uses for it.Absolutely glad I bought it. Would recommend.",
