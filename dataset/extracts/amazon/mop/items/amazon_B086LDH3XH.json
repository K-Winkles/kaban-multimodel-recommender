It does an excellent job of picking up dust and pet hair and is very easy to maneuver around the house. My only annoyance is the handle does not stay extended and needs to be adjusted quite frequently. I did see this was an issue in some of the reviews but I wanted to see for myself. I do love the quality of the dust mop but this is one thing that could be improved upon. I\u2019m pretty handy so I think I can figure out a fix. Go ahead and buy it; it\u2019s great.",

                "reviewText": "My household recently moved to a house with luxury vinyl flooring.My household also includes two dogs, one of which with a long double coat that sheds all the time.I was looking for a cheap and easy dust mop with easy-to-maintain changeable heads, because trying to use a regular broom to sweep was taking forever and seemed to be kicking up more hair than it was cleaning. This more than fits the bill.It came in a small box with pieces of the handle that screw together, and took all of about a minute to assemble. The handle feels surprisingly strong and durable, much better than any of the regular brooms we have. What would have been ten or fifteen minutes of sweeping was accomplished in literally two minutes, and the floors looked better than they have since we moved in. The only thing that could be improved upon is a swivel option, as the head is locked into position and isn't always easy to maneuver at weird angles or if it's held too far from the body, but that's a minor complaint and not a deal killer.To clean the head, I use held it up over a trashcan and brushed it off with my fingers to clear most of the dog hair and dirt. There were a few things that the dustmop didn't pick up, like gravel, that I had to get with the regular mop but that's generally how dust mops work.I haven't had to wash the mopheads yet but both feel like they're decent quality. Other reviews have mentioned the mopheads fraying in the wash; I'll update my review if anything changes. Until then, I highly recommend this product.",

My floors finally look clean after using this broom.",
