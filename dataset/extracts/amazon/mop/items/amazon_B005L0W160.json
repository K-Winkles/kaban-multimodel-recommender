                "reviewText": "Everything about this bucket is high quality! Being able to choose the color is a nice perk. I bought this and it arrived the next day. I have not used it yet & will update soon. Two things: the wringer needs to be held closed before you remove the zip ties due to the spring being very strong and tight and will snap open and possibly cause injury to hands. I read about that in the reviews and it is true. Second thing mine was missing 2 washers and one nut I don't believe it will diminish anything about functionalities at all and I don't mind going to hardware store to replace them. I have been using wringer buckets for over 25 years. I used the Ace Hardware buckets and I absolutely hated how cheap, unsturdy plastic, handle and wheels would fall off and tip over too easy they were. Today was like Christmas for me when I took it out of the box! Good professional quality buckets are Hard to find. This is that 110%I clean houses for a living so I need a good sturdy bucket that won't tip over and cause untold expensive damage. It is heavy though and I will have to adjust in time. It also is bigger than I expected which is okay too! The pictures in the reviews don't really help gauge actual size.",

                "reviewText": "I can use this product, but for the price I would expect a well rounded product. The wheels are difficult to insert and the plastic sleeves they insert into allow the wheels to slant and not roll well. Other than that the mop wringer appears to work well and appears strurdy. I have only had it one day but I forsee possibly taking the wheels off. There is poor design in the plastic wheel sockets.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this mob bucket after reading a lot of reviews about how difficult it was to install the caster wheels. Some complained about the wheels falling off. The caster wheels are easy to install (see attached instructions that come with the mob bucket). There are 4 spacers and 4 casters included. I applied a small amount of silicone gel/grease to the spacers and inserted them my hand (a little pressure) and then applied a small amount of silicone gel to the caster stems and inserted them my hand (a little pressure) into the holes in the spacer. Silicone or other grease will suffice for a little lubrication. I did not use a rubber mallet or a hammer. The casters snapped into the spacers without a glitch and none of the casters came out. Took me less than 5 minutes for this entire installation. I still have not used the bucket and will post a full review after the use.",
