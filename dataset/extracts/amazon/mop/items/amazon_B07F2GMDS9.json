                "reviewText": "We have linoleum and tiles in the house that get dirty quickly. Aside from our cats, there are also the occasional spills and whatnot that we have to clean up. I\u2019ve tried several different mops but this is my first time using one with a spray. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was what I needed but now that I have it, mopping has become a lot easier! It really speeds everything up.I followed the instructions and assembled it in a few minutes. Just a lot of snapping things together. Obviously the next thing I did was put it to the test. I poured a water and vinegar mix into the bottle it came with and used it to clean our laminate floors. The spray trigger at the top of the unit was easy to use and dispensed just the right amount of liquid. I like how it doesn\u2019t require any batteries\u2026no extra costs!Pros:This mop is a lot lighter than the mop I was using before- this makes it very easy to maneuver around the house. The mop head also moves in multiple directions, which is great for when I\u2019m trying to get underneath beds and other furniture.The container is also a great size. The mouth is nice and wide which makes refilling easy. The fact that you can use whatever cleaner you want is great too- I hate being tied down to a certain product. I might add a few drops of essential oil next time, just to give it more of a fragrance.Cons:The pads wore out quicker than I thought. Two months in, I found myself having to buy refills because they no longer absorbed water that well. Instead of getting the ones that came with it however, I got the mop pads from turbo mops. They\u2019re a little longer than the original ones but they work a lot better, in my opinion at least.",

                "reviewText": "In short - you get what you pay for. It gets the job done and it will absolutely serve it's purpose of saving money on spray products and pads. The wide head is nice but to say it saves time cleaning is a stretch. Lightweight but not sturdy, I feel like I will break this faster than I did my old Swiffer. I'm 5'6 and feel like I'm bent halfway over to mop. Feels shorter than a Swiffer.Cons: it's cheaply made, not sturdy at all in comparison to Swiffer (which isn't very sturdy itself), leaks through sprayer hole as I mop which sucks, have to go back over areas to get up drips. It's shorter than I expected so I'm bent over.Pros: it's very lightweight. The spray is a very fine mist and has great coverage. Pads are machine washable and have held up in the wash really well so far. Solution container is small but it really goes a long way because the most is so fine. Also fits under things easier because of it's size.It's really mediocre but for the price compared to similar, bigger brands, it's a good spray mop. I'm happy with it but I don't know how long it will last. I break Swiffers like it's my job so I have a feeling this one will be in the trash soon, and I'll spend the money on a better known brand - but if this thing lasts longer than my Swiffers I'll probably buy another one! Time will tell",

                "reviewText": "This mop is easy to put together and very slim. I will eventually try to hang it, but for now, it can be stood up and leaned against a wall without the wet pad touching if I've just used it. I love that it comes with reusable pads that you can wash and that you're able to add your own cleaning product instead of relying on having to purchase a specific brand or fell wasteful if you don't utilize a provided product.It's easy to add more liquid in the vessel and is lightweight. You can kind of control the amount of liquid that comes out when you squeeze the sprayer. You can't make it more powerful than it already is, but you can squeeze lighter and less liquid will come out as well as not travel as far.I have two cats and moving into a small space has been made more enjoyable with this mop because I can clean up spills and accidents easy without pulling out a whole song and dance. I will say that if something has been sitting on the floor and dried, you have to let the water sit for a bit, not the best for super deep cleaning, but I wouldn't expect a product like this to work like that.I highly recommend this product and feel you will be pleasantly surprised by it!",

                "reviewText": "Perfect for a tiny apartment with small floor space. It's compact and easy to set up and put together.The bottle is small and only hold about your standard water bottle in the amount of fluid but that is easy to work with in a space that requires only a little attention. It came with a little detailing tool that can be used to clean the pads of hair before washing and I imagine the blades and hooked edge can also be used as scrapers for edging the floor, with the silicone portion also kind of used as a scrubber.The thing is pretty handy and fits perfectly in storage in a small space because it itself is tiny.I'm a big guy, so the thing is kinda tiny by comparison, so my only criticism to it would be that it may be easy to manhandled into a broken state if your not careful.Pictures show man hand holding the pump handle and the detailer. Be careful using the detailer to lift off the hairs or you might pull a seam on the pad; thankfully you get three! Also, remember that any left over solution in the bottle should be either dumped or the bottle should be removed and turned upside to avoid having any solution eat away at the rubber seal.I gave it four out of five solely because of it's possible flimsy nature but that may not be honest in the future if it holds up to use. Definitely convenient and worth the money spent",
