                "reviewText": "As far as a hand mop, this is the kind that works wonderfully for me. I will say that I\u2019ve probably bought 10 different types top-of-the-line that do all different things but they\u2019re too heavy and awkward and hard to clean. I don\u2019t even care for the sponge hand moppers because they just don\u2019t get in the crevices like I like.I will never use a swifter, although one of my family members does and I believe those chemicals in their pads are not good for pets either. When doesn\u2019t have a choice when you have a swifterWith this mop, I have a choice of what I want to put on my . That means everything in the world.I use all natural either vinegar or Shaklee basic h or some other, natural products to clean.I\u2019m typing this review because I think a lot of people would like something lightweight that\u2019s easy to clean and does the job where they can choose their own products to put on their floors.This is lightweight and that means a lot to me since I have a bad back. I really enjoy mopping with this mop , so easy to use, well thought out in the design!!Less is better sometime",

                "reviewText": "This product is not made well. The pole assembly has a part where the pole keeps detaching from the slot it slides into.....it does not lock or screw into place so everytime I go to wring it out it comes apart. I guess I should have paid a little more and bought a better one. It is short too. The picture is deceiving. It looks much longer in the advertisement. I gave it one star because it does mop up dirt off the floor. My recommendation is do not buy this mop. Spend a little more and get another.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I actually thought that I was sent the wrong pieces and/or directions that didn't seem to fit well together. I was planning to return it, but husband came to the rescue and, with a bit more force, got the mop together. When together, it is quite sturdy, works well, and wrings out fairly well without having to touch a wet mophead.. It came with 2 mopheads, so i am hoping I won't need a replacement for a good long while. I bought it to replace the spongemops that I am not pleased with, and it is definitely an improvement!I like this new mop and will buy again if it passes the test of time..",
