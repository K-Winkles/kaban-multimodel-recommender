                "reviewText": "Let me be frank. My house is a disaster. We have 3 kids, 6 large dogs, two cats, a pair of birds, and it\u2019s 6000 square feet of hardwood floors that I\u2019m mopping constantly. These are great for preventing sneaker prints on the still wet floor when you inevitably forget your wine glass on the other side of the room. You\u2019ll actually be able to appreciate how beautiful hardwoods really are for the 12.3 seconds you get before something comes in muddy, dripping, sticky, or leaking on them.Also, apparently makes a great dog toy when one of them fishes it out of the laundry basket full of clean dish towels and cleaning rags that you asked your kids to put away....Pros: Fun colors, launder well, not slippery, pets enjoy ripping them apartCons: Small (won\u2019t cover 16 year old son or husband\u2019s shoes...so probably designed by a man), doesn\u2019t come in a style I can make my dogs wear.Overall: If you hate leaving foot prints in your freshly mopped floors, I\u2019d definitely recommend!",

I Bissell my floor with the crosswave wet vac every night in lieu of sweeping. In the past I used a towel under my feet and slid along not to leave foot marks. These Duster Mop Slippers take the place of my towel, and make my life a little bit easier :) Hubby calls them my clown shoes :), I have washed them, and hang dry on my Bissell machine so they are ready for the next day. No more step marks where I JUST washed the floor! I do not see them as great floor dusters. BUT they are great to use while washing the floor. They absorb extra water, and in most cases i can use my toe with the slipper to loosen up those stuck on spots. Yes I would by them again, and recommend!",
