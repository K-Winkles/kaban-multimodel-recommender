                "reviewText": "The mop comes with two mop heads, of which I've only used one so far. It certainly works well for mopping the floor, though I do have two gripes about it (one minor, one major):1. I wash my mop head after (almost) each use. The cotton definitely pilled quite a bit and the blue fabric looks quite aged after a handful of washes (though this may be related to point 2 below). This technically doesn't matter, but it's something to keep in mind if you plan on washing the mop head frequently.2. Getting the mop head on is not easy. Maybe my handle is defective, but it takes quite a bit of effort to push the blue part into the handle because of the teeth on the end of the handle. I've tried going in through the side, ramming it in, going slowly... Once it's in and you've locked it, it's a great mop, but it's a pain to get the mop head on. So much so that sometimes I'll just get on my hands and knees and clean the floor because I can't be bothered with assembly.I'd say if you don't need to change your mop head very often, then the issues I mentioned aren't so annoying. But I certainly wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend this mop because of the inconveniences. Three stars because once put together, it works great.",
