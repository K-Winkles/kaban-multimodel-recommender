                "reviewText": "I recently put in laminate vinyl flooring. The flooring isn't as 'smooth' as in my previous home so I needed to use a different kind of dust mop. Finally after trying a couple of other dust mops this one seems to work best. After each room or two I take the dust mop outside to clean it off and it cleans off easily. I have 4 furry family members and this mop seems to pick up the most hair. I'll only use this mop dry myself and I love that it came with extra washable pads. I also sprayed a tiny bit of furniture polish on the bottom of the pad. A+ from a very picky old lady!",

This mop stick is so convenient that my son saw me using it once and has started cleaning any spills he caused.I am able to give a quick mop of the kitchen and living space every night and I wake up to a clean house. The spare pad are very absorbent and easy to clean. It is very sturdy and large and also comes with extra handle part to lengthen if needed.I recommend this product to any house, especial a house with children or pets.",
