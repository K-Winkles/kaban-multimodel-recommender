                "reviewText": "This is such a great deal for mop heads. I mop my hard floors weekly which means the head needs to be replaced every 3-4 weeks. Single mop head replacements cost around $7-$10 at Walmart and it was getting too expensive. I found these and decided to give them a try. They are essentially the same quality as the more expensive ones and I\u2019m so glad they come in a value pack so I don\u2019t have to order these as frequently! I have to say the first time using the head, they aren\u2019t as absorbing as I would like but the second time using them they are perfect. I clean my floors with vinegar, hot water and essential oils and these will become a permanent product in my home.",
