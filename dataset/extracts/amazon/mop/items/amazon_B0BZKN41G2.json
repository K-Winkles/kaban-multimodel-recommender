                "reviewText": "These mop heads are meant to be for 2 tankO cedar mop system. They come in 4 pack at a super affordable price. They are very much comparable to the original mop heads. They areeasy to install, just snap it onto the handle, that\u2019s it. I have cleaned our hardwood floors with this mop head 4 or 5 times until now and they clean the floors very well (except for the first time using it) and my floors are now streak free. They are machine washable just like the originals and hence reusable. I had no problems with these mop heads, so far.",
