                "reviewText": "The Tineco iFLOOR 2 Complete Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. As a pet owner, it effortlessly tackles the daily dirt and grime, ensuring my home stays clean and fresh. While I find the button on the handle for releasing more liquid a bit perplexing and not entirely necessary in my routine, the vacuum\u2019s standout features more than make up for it.One of the highlights is its impressive ability to dry the floor after cleaning. This not only saves time but also prevents any slips or accidents. The self-cleaning feature is nothing short of amazing. It takes the hassle out of maintenance, allowing me to focus on the cleaning task at hand.As someone who uses this vacuum every single day, the ease of use and reliability make it a valuable investment. The Tineco iFLOOR 2 has truly transformed the way I approach daily cleaning in a pet-friendly household. Highly recommended for its efficiency and time-saving capabilities!",

                "reviewText": "Super easy to use (even my husband can do it). Not that great on rough tile in the bathroom or mudroom, but great on hardwood floors. Super quick drying time and easy to store and charge. Cleaning the products are a little confusing as far as taking everything apart and putting it back together, but it can be done. Super lightweight and easy to move from room to room. Usually one canister can clean 3-4 rooms depending on the size. Cleaning solution has a very mild, nice smell and not strong at all. I have gone from not hardly ever mopping my floors, to mopping them once a week (which is a win for me in a VERY busy home).I have a rainbow system and I love to use it to mop/vacuum. But it is bulky, heavy and has so many extensions and parts. With the Tineco, I can easily get it out and mop way quicker than I could my rainbow. I also like the trigger on the handle, that I can control how much water/solution comes out.If you are a busy mom that barely has time to wash and [dry] your hair, this product is for you.",

                "reviewText": "I am so thrilled with this purchase. I have been researching different wet/dry vacs for a while now and finally landed on this one. It is a big investment but the quality you are getting is amazing.Pros-No cord to trip overThe dirty water is separate from clean waterIt has a self clean feature (amazing)Leaves floors shiny and smelling good.Easy to clean when doneComes with extra roller brushComes with two bottles of cleaner (you only use a cap full each time if you choose)Pretty quiet when usingIt is easy to push2 year warrantyPicks up pet hair and human hair really well!!Cons:Finding a spot to store it and plug it in to chargeIt says it lasts 22 min on one charge. I was able to get my whole floor done no problem thoughCleaning it after takes a few minutes of extra timeIf you leave the water in it has a foul odorPriceSome people have said that the power on and off button gets turned off when they are cleaning. I did not have this problem. It is on the handle but my finger never touched it. It should not be a deal breaker.If you are debating on which wet/dry vac to get you won\u2019t be sorry you got this one. I have loved using it and it is so much better than a swifter. My husband even noticed a difference with the floors and that is saying a lot. There are a lot more expensive models but this one works just fine! Also, if you can find it when it\u2019s on sale\u2026even better! Happy cleaning!!Edit 7/1/23Still love this vacuum!The self clean feature is amazing. Make sure you have water in there so it can self clean. I have mine in a closet and notice a little smell of you don\u2019t dry completely. I just take the parts off and let them air dry before putting back on. Still would 100% recommend!Edit 9/19/23Still use this everyday and works amazing! So easy to keep my floors clean. This is a good investment!Edit 11/17/23Vacuum still works great! If you keep it clean it does not leave an oder. If you forget to change the dirty water out it can start to smell. Still very happy with this purchase and not sure how I kept my floors clean without it. It saves so much time!!",
