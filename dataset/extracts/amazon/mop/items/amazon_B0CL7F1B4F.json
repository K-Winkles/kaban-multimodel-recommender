            "\u2728\u3010Upgraded Spray Mop, Better Cleaning Effect\u3011TMA spray mop is made of sturdy aluminum alloy mop rods, which overcomes the common phenomenon of loose push rods of similar products. The entire production process using automated equipment testing eliminates the risk of water leakage, special pump nozzle design ensures uniform mist diffusion and effectively prevents nozzle clogging.",
            "\u2728\u3010Easy to Install and Use\u3011Hardwood floor mop adopts a modular design and can be quickly installed by simply plugging and unplugging the mop handle, mop rod, and mop head. Mop with sprayer can spray cleaning liquid evenly on the ground by pulling the handle, avoiding frequent soaking of the mop and achieving efficient cleaning. The spray mop with washable pad features a convenient snap-on closure that allows quick replacement of cleaning pads to meet different cleaning needs and save time.",
            "\u2728\u3010Multi-Purpose Cleaning Tool\u3011The Wet Mop for Floor Cleaning is designed with every floor in mind and can work on a variety of floor types, whether it's hardwood, tile, concrete, or laminate. And that spray mop with the reusable washable pads can easily handle both wet and dry mopping, providing you with a more flexible cleaning experience. Its application scenarios are not limited to the home, but can also easily meet the challenges in commercial environments.",
            "\u2728\u3010Flexibility and Maneuverability\u3011The 360-degree rotating mop head allows the spray mops to rotate freely in all directions, especially in narrow or complex spaces. Spray mop for hardwood floors can more easily reach difficult-to-clean areas under the floor, such as the bottom of furniture, narrow gaps, etc., ensuring that cleaning covers corners and edges without leaving any dead spots, improving the comprehensiveness and thoroughness of cleaning.",
            "\u2728\u3010Economical and Practical\u3011 TMA reusable mop is simple and practical. It comes with 2 reusable and washable mop pads.

                "reviewText": "This spray mop is very nice. It's made out of lightweight metal and assembly is easy. The head is on a joint that allows you to push it (sideways) flat under furniture, and it makes quick work of cleaning my hardwood floors with any cleaning solution of my choice or just plain water. The fabric mop sticks on like velcro and stays secure, and tosses in the washer and dryer. I had mop envy; my mother has a spray mop similar to this one so I ordered this one when I saw it, and compared to hers, the mop head is the same shape and roughly the same size - this one is a smidge larger in length and width, but it's interchangeable with those you can find at chain stores. The bottle that holds liquid, however, is a lot smaller. It's adequate for mopping a small to medium sized home without needing a refill, and it does not leak, but the big brand mops have larger capacity. That being said, I have to believe the price is a typo! It is the same price they sell a whole vacuum cleaner for - the price would be fine for a vacuum but it's about 4 times what it should be for this little spray mop! If this were priced competitively with others on Amazon or at chain stores, I'd give it 5 stars. I do not think the value is there if the price being asked is correct.",
