                "reviewText": "So I'd heard of these electric bathroom shower cleaning brushes and wanted to try one. I searched and searched and only picked this one because I could get it the next day vs two days later. It was the least expensive and I figured I would try it out and if I liked the idea, I could upgrade to another one after this one broke.Well!This one met my needs!It's affordable, easy to assemble, easy to use and gave me some of the results I was looking for. I say some because it's not the fault of the brush, but the bathtub's issues that left it only partially sparkling!It cleaned just fine on the lowest speed. I have yet to use all of the attachments and may update this review then. We used the scrubber on the stubborn bathtub stains and WOW did we see results!I would not use this on my floor as I have a steam cleaner for that. Otherwise I can see the beauty in this thing.NOTE: my research pointed out that the handle is very important with using these scrubbers at their full length and on their full power so I chose this one due to the little hanger-on-thingy on the handle instead of the ones that look like straight sticks. It made a difference.",

                "reviewText": "For me these power brushes are nothing new. I have been using various brands and styles for a couple years now. I also own a commercial grade cordless scrubber that is indeed more powerful than this but 10x the cost and 5x the weight. Comparing this to others I own and have owned it is by far the best tool for around the house. Not something I would use all day every day on heavy duty commercial projects. First thing that I was excited about was how light this scrubber is. By far the lightest i have used but still has the power to compete. Considering home use, this has more than enough power IF, and I want to stress this, you let the tool do the work. You DO NOT operate this like you would a scrub brush. With this you need not put heavy pressure on the brush head, and you must work slowly. Follow the flow of the tool, which will be a gradual circular motion. Overlapping 50% as you work across the surface. You need to be sure to keep the surface wet and soapy. You need this to reduce friction and allow the motor to spin as designed. You won't get the job done any faster than by hand, but you will have a better finish product with much less wear and tear on your body. As per the description this is an upgraded unit based on customer feedback which is a brilliant way to design a tool. In any industry you need to listen to the people using the tool on site. It's easy to figure out the operation and switching the accessories and the heads stay on super tight yet are easy to remove. A very good job of designing a tool for around the home. I have been using this every day, several times a day for over a week and the tool works as well as it did on day one. Maybe even a little better with the run time. As with so many products from across the ocean it is amazing how they can sell these quality items so cheap. This is a good find and will fill your need for a motorized scrubber/cleaner for residential use.",

                "reviewText": "I got this 2 speed electric spin cleaning brush just before the holidays. It comes with 8 reusable brush types and a charging cord. It does not come with an outlet plug so you'll need your own USB outlet or power bar. It comes with an extendable pole and extends to about the length of a standard mop or broom, maybe just a an inch or two shy of that. I love that it can be taken apart and put back into the box for easy storing.I can honestly say this product worked a little too well for me! Let me preface this by saying I wash my floors regularly, I swear. Come to find out my version of clean is lie. I made the mistake of using this the day before I had a huge holiday party thinking it would make floor cleaning faster. Instead this giant spin brush got in-between my tiles and ruined my day by revealing how unclean my floors actually were. I was not prepared for the level of cleaning this machine had in mind. So, if you have tiled floors and want an easy way to deep clean them, this machine is for you. Since that eye opening day, I've used it to actually clean my floors (more) and I tested it on walls and bathroom tiles which thankfully didn't come with the same feelings of shame. The only con to this is that the extension rod could be longer. I still have to bend a little ( I'm 5\u20193) and the higher speed is pretty powerful so it's a task to hold. Either way, love it, happy to have it. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This cordless, USB charged Electric Spin Scrubber, Cleaning Brush is really quite something.And is very powerful, much more than i thought it would be for sure.It has 2 Speeds that are changed by a simple touch of a button on the hand held handle and both are pretty powerful. i would almost dare to say that you would mostly use the lower speed, as that one is great for just about anything you are cleaning. Maybe the higher speed for harder to clean surfaces or depending which accessory head you are using .There are 8 accessory cleaning heads and 1 interchangeable Velcro head that you can change 4 Types of cleansing pads to use in different areas or on different surfaces pending what you want to clean with it. 4 of the attachments are Click on Brush type heads that you just push on and pull off when you want to change them.-There is no CLICK sound when they attach really, but they DO stay on! And with a firm pull. you can take them back off again. Just be sure to line them up correctly when attaching the heads. They do have a particular shape ( you can see in photo ) so just follow that and you have no problem. 4 of the attachments are the ones that you attach with a Velcro backing. as one of the Base heads is just a velcro base to attach them to the base. These all stay on pretty good, I would like to note, that because the speed is so fast, you really need to line up the pads evenly, or the cleaning pad attachment seem to \" wobble\" around. they do not fall off, but it just makes it a little awkward to hold and use. Line them up and there is no problem.Powerful Spin - you can see in couple of my photos where the cleaning tool was on and spinning and you can actually dip it into your cleaning water a little , as there no way for water to really get into the base as long as you don't stick the whole handle under the water, which you kinda of almost not be able to anyhow as the spinning is so powerful it spins all the water all around in an kind of whirlpool action. This is great for mixing your cleaning solution with your cleaning tool as well.It worked incredible for cleaning Bathtub when using the white bristle attachment. The Curved Bristle attachment worked amazing for the curved corners of bathtub as well! I have to say i was really surprised at how well this little machine worked. It also ( see photo's ) worked wonders in toilet bowl.I tried multiple attachments on a variety of surfaces, such as Tile, Laminate Flooring, Tub , Toilet, sink and even on walls with the extender .Battery life lasted longer than what product said a full charge would last. And i did a mix of High and Medium speeds ( allot of both for trying everything out )I would have gave this item 5 stars, but i give 4 this is why. The handle works great using in your hand as it is fits shape of hand easy plus is easier to use and you can move & control the brush allot easier.But, though the extender is good for hard to reach places, because of the shape of the main part of the tool that holds the spinning heads, you have to have it held FLAT to surface in order to use most of the attachments. Basically all the tools are hard to use on extender for surfaces that are Higher up , like reaching up to clean walls or a space that is up above you, as its almost impossible to keep the attachment flat to the wall to use. it becomes very awkward very quickly. I tried multiple cleaning heads for this and all were the same except for the pointed Corner type bristle brush as it was not flat. that one seem to work really well on things like corners etc.the extender does work well when using on things like floors, but again, it really works best by Hand.otherwise, it is just awkward and can become very time consuming.Over all though, and amazing little tool with very good battery life and allot of power!If you use it for nothing else but Toilet bowls , Sink and Bathtubs, I believe you Still would be happy with this product!",

                "reviewText": "I'm really impressed with this spin scrubber. I ordered this to help with the least favorite cleaning task: cleaning the bathtub shower. The scrubber with the extension attachments made the tub cleaning so much easier. I do not miss the wet mess of my arms, scrubbing, the straining, reaching and bending from cleaning the tub walls the old way. All that was virtually eliminated with this scrubber. As for the cleaning performance on the tub, I would give it an A+ with essentially 20% of the effort. I barely used up 20% of the power. I next cleaned the kitchen sink. I can't believe the ease and how quickly I was able to scrub down both sinks and effortlessly clean the creases around and in the drain openings. I'm so impressed with my experience with it so far, I cannot wait to try is on other jobs like car washing.I recommend this electric scrubber.",
