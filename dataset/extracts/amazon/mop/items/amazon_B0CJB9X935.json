From picture attached you can see stitching has ripped already on 2 out of the 3 chenille pads. The microfiber pads do not have a slot on the corners and they stick by velcro, once I removed, it took tore the stitching after one single use. If you look closely it is single stitching, not even double or triple to be ruggedize. This is probably the first and last time I will get to use this set. Seems to be disposable. Save your money and buy something else.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this corner dust/wet mop . I does exactly what I wanted and more. It gets close to the quarter round (toe mold)very well and corners . it dusts shoe mole and walls easily. My husband liked it so well he wanted one for cleaning some items of his in his barn(shop). I did order another. I have not done windows yet but will at some point. Also , after dusting I take my mop outside and brush off the mat and reuse so I don't wash it every time. I do live in the country so brushing it off does no harm to anyone. RP",

                "reviewText": "This arrived with no instructions for assembly or how to use it, and it took me several tries to piece it together because one of the threads would not fit one of the pieces. Now this states it is adjustable- yeah, it is, but you have to unscrew the pieces and screw back together to shorten or lengthen this wall mop. You can\u2019t just twist it to shorten or lengthen, once you assemble it, that\u2019s where it stays. If you have limited storage space you will probably want to take it back apart and toss it in a storage bag, which it does not come with. This would have been handy considering how much work goes into assembling and taking it back apart. They knew this would be a chore.At its longest length the middle bows when you apply pressure. I\u2019m not applying excessive pressure either, just simply mopping my apartment walls with some cleaner I sprayed on the mop pad. Nothing excessively dirty, so that tells me this isn\u2019t the greatest quality of materials, but for the price, I expected as much, just didn\u2019t expect it to be THIS flimsy.You get several pads of two types, which work well when washing the walls. I found it cleaned pretty well with my choice of all natural and gentle floor cleaner.I like the idea, and it does do a decent job, but I fear it\u2019s not going to last very long because of the way the middle bows. If the middle were sturdier, I would be able to rate this higher. As it is, I just can\u2019t.This is my 100% honest review after testing and using this product.",
