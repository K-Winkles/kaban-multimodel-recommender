I most recently purchased this product over a month ago, but did not open/use it until today as I\u2019ve successfully in the past. The first head (threads) broke within a couple of minutes. I replaced it with the second head, and it started coming apart almost immediately. I was not able to complete even one room. Unfortunately the return/refund date has already passed. If you buy this mop, plan to use it quickly in case you get a bad batch of heads like I did. Lesson learned.*** am updating my rating to 5 stars because Eyliden US reached out to me over my most recent experience and review. They offered an apology and full refund. While I am unhappy my product broke, I am pleased by my customer service experience. Since I\u2019ve enjoyed this product in the past, I will use it again.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the mop was good but didn\u2019t last long over the months. When the mop was brand new I enjoyed mopping up around my house more. I have a 4 bed 2 bath so there is a lot of surface to cover.The mop heads are large and very absorbent, however after a few uses the hook that attaches to the mop stick broke apart. I still made use of it and would continue to mop because the twist to ring out function was still operable. Sometimes I would have to ring the mop head by hand with gloves on, which is no biggie because I\u2019m resourceful.It was like I had a new life out of the mop once my husband replaced it with 2nd mop attached that came included, that was very appreciated because I did like the mop for what it was worth. I tried to replace it myself multiple times and could not that\u2019s why my husband did it for me. It was simply too tight for me to loosen.Didn\u2019t hold odors. All in all, I\u2019ve had twist mops that I purchase from Ross & DD\u2019s that held up for over a year. I wish I could\u2019ve got the same amount of life out of this mop, because items I purchase via Amazon are usually quality & durable.",
