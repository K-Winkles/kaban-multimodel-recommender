                "reviewText": "It's ok, it's a sturdy plastic/silicone type material. I was just trying to find a larger bucket for my mop with a strainer. This almost works, but not quite. I haven't measured how much water I've put in it, I'd say it easily holds 3-5 gallons. The problems I have with it, I can't get it to totally expand open and stay open. It sags down a couple notches. I've pulled on it, stretched, and just can't figure it out. I'll get it to do it, but then once I set it down it sags again.The other issue is dipping the mop head in to get wet. It's a tight fit. I don't know the exact mop I'm using; it's a Rubbermaid with yellow plastic clip that you slide a washable mop head on and click it on then twist a center cap down over to hold it on. I've got two different mop heads, one a yarn one and the other a microfiber. The microfiber definitely fits a bit better since it's not as wide. And then the drain basket, same thing, tight fit and microfiber one fits a tad better. Neither mop heads or the mop are considered a commercial type.Other than that, it's not unusable, but it just needs a bit of a work around from me to make it work. It's decent quality/materials, lightweight. Not sure which type of mop this is made for, don't recall seeing it in the description anywhere. Due to the issues above, I'd say it's about 3 1/2-4 stars for a rating.",
