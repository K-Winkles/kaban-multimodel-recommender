I've had this mop for about 3 months now, and I regret nothing.Live in a Northern state where there's snow, salt and mud. I also have 4 dogs and a husband who works in construction. My floors need constant mopping.I have tried a commercial grade mop (think Janitorial type), sponge style, swiffer wet jet and such. This is by far the best.This mop is easy to use, doesn't take up a ton of storage space, comes with several extra mop heads that are quick and easy to change and a scrubbing head. I simply put the mop head in a laundry garment bag and wash it with a load of towels.You can decide how wet you'd like it by the number of spins you give it. The mop itself is extremely maneuverable and gets into tights spots and corners. I love the extra feature that removes hair from the mop head. (I have long hair and soooo much pet hair.) It is easy to empty with a removal plug on the side.Getting the handle to fit into the part that spins the mop takes a little bit to figure out, but it's nothing serious. I wish the bucket moved a little better, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. Those are the only 2 things I've found that could be considered areas of opportunity to make it any better.",

                "reviewText": "Backstory:I\u2019ve had the O-Cedar original, the double bucket one, and two different knock-off varieties. The O-Cedar original lasted almost three years, but it constantly broke down from day one and wouldn\u2019t spin properly no matter what I did. The mop handle was shorter than was comfortable, and it was a pain to move around when full. The heads popped off frequently, and it was so lightweight that you couldn\u2019t really put any power behind cleaning tough spots. The double bucket system was like most things, meaning it was all well and good in theory, but horrible in practice, and the knock-offs made it to the trash within a couple of uses. All of them had small buckets, but you don\u2019t really need much mop water when you\u2019re using a spin mop system, so that was never an issue. The pedal giving out and needing to be fixed every time I used it was the real issue.Review:None of those things are an issue with this mop system. The bucket is still small, but it has wheels, a dump spout, and no pedal to break down and render the spin mop useless. The metal basket is nice and since there\u2019s a little thing you put the mop on to spin it, it doesn\u2019t really sit in the basket and get it nasty, or in the bucket to sour and soak up dirty water. The handle is metal, sturdy, and my only complaint is that sometimes it doesn\u2019t latch properly and will collapse on you. It\u2019s not that bad, and doesn\u2019t happen often, and it seems to happen less if you make sure your head is flattened out before you go to spin it in either compartment of the bucket. The mop heads attach easily and stay attached without any issues. It\u2019s got some weight to it, and it\u2019s nice and long, so it\u2019s easy to put some real elbow grease behind it and get things cleaned easily and quickly. The mop heads are quality, and definitely clean the floors well. I use mine to clean my walls and ceilings as well, and it does a fantastic job. I haven\u2019t used the scrub head attachment yet, but it\u2019s sturdy and the bristles don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll mar whatever surface you use it on. The little brush cleaner inside the bucket seems to do its job, and hasn\u2019t snagged or torn the mop heads. The elongated \u2018pulling\u2019 handle on the bucket is a bit short and flimsy, but I have yet to actually need to use it, so that\u2019s not really much of a problem. It moves easily thanks to the wheels, and there is an alternative handle you can use to guide it along.I won\u2019t lie, I originally clicked on this one because the lack of a pedal, longer mop handle, and metal components spoke to me, but the hilarious translations on the infographics sold the system. I am still laughing. How can you not?But!When I tell you I was absolutely shocked and disgusted by the water once I finished my living room and hallway even after I had just mopped thoroughly three days before, then swept twice and vacuumed with a Shark vacuum three times right before I used it, I mean I gagged. I always use boiling water so the floors dry faster (I have original hard wood and updated industrial linoleum throughout my home) and I use gentler cleaners because of my pets, allergies, and flooring. I have a small house, too. Like, under 1000 sqft. I\u2019ll attach a photo of the water after three months of using a traditional mop and bucket. It is of the water after one pass over just my living room and small hallway. Feel free to judge, but with six pets, three humans, multiple guests in and out daily, and no one removing shoes or watching what they drag in, I do the best I can with what I\u2019ve got. Also, I professionally cleaned for five years, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m just letting things go, either.It\u2019s literally the quality of the tools you\u2019re using that makes all the difference, and this mop system does the work of a professional with an industrial steam mop. My floors need to be refinished, and they looked brand new even after they\u2019d been dry for several hours.Takeaway:There are things that could be better, sure, but it does a fantastic job even though the bucket could be sturdier. My back didn\u2019t hurt after spending two hours cleaning the floors and the walls, I didn\u2019t have to touch anything or stick my hands in dirty water, and it was easy to take the bucket apart and rinse all of the pieces and dry them before I stored it away for the next time. It was easy to get set up, held more water than I thought it would, and immediately simplified and eased my cleaning process.4.5/5. I highly recommend this mop system, and you get six mop heads, the mop handle, the bucket, and the additional scrubbing head attachment. For the price and the quality, it\u2019s definitely worth it.[*Photos are of the water in the bucket after one pass of the living room and hallway, and right after the floors dried when I had to take a quick break to answer a work email.*]",

                "reviewText": "I recommend buying this mop...I like this product and with a few improvements on the design, it would be the best on the market, IMHO. I have had a spin mop we've used for many years. Not the foot pedal kind that is a pain to use, but the handle rotating mop kind that spins a drain bucket fixed to the mop bucket bottom. It worked well but the sturdiness and quality were always a little suspect. But it held up.This mop is quality made and someone actually put some thought into its use. It spins VERY effortlessly. I only had to push down on the handle once and the thing just kept spinning. With my old mop, I had to continue to push and push to generate enough RPMs to fling the water out of the mop.The spin bucket is removable and at first was a pain because it kept lifting off when I pulled the mop out... (Breaking Bad habits) With my old mop, I would immediately yank it out of the spin bucket once I thought it was prime. Until I learned to use the convenient handle stop-lever to stop the mop from rotating, then the spin bucket would stay in place.The cleaning spin/hair brush thingy I thought would lead me to sending thing back once it entangled itself so much I would have to cut the mop out of its grip... That is until I learned that if you fill the bucket to its maximum, this became a great mop cleaner. My old spin mop, I would have to plunge the mop into the open side of the bucket like I was making buttermilk until it looked \"clear\". With this mop, the mop head spins and the hair brush doesn't get tangled. It was actually a good design. Someone was thinking again, I suspect. Good for them.Design suggestions for the creators of this mop: The bucket handle is on the wrong side to use because I have to put the handle down before using. Also, the center balance point is off to one side when picking up this bucket full of water... It tilts when full of water/cleaner causing it to spill onto the floor (yes, I proved this out, but I cleaned it up)Also, fellas, my wife likes this mop when it's in my hands. Says it looks handsome. Hmm, not sure I buy into that one",
