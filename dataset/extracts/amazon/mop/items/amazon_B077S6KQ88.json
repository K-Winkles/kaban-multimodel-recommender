It works so well on my tile and laminate floors. It removes spills and spots super well. It\u2019s lightweight and glides across my floors very smoothly and effortlessly. The pads are easy to put on and take off. I\u2019ve been handwashing them after use and they seem to come clean easily. The cord is long enough for me to do my kitchen and dining room without having to change outlets. I have dogs and cats so it is really nice to be able to give my floors a deep cleaning! I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "There\u2019s before and after photos on the grout on my kitchen tile. Black was before. White is after. This was years of dirt in the grout that came out with very little effort with this steam cleaner. The assortment of attachments is also amazing. They thought of pretty much everything for the attachment. It creates steam almost instantly. I can mop my whole kitchen floor on one tank basically. Even if I have to refill it, it heats up so fast it doesn\u2019t matter. Easy to use and it folds up which is nice. All these other steam cleaner were way more expensive. I saw this guy for that price and decided to try it. I\u2019m only mad I didn\u2019t buy this years ago. The only thing that would be even better is having something or somewhere on the mop to store the attachments. Or even a case or box for them. But I have plenty of boxes so it\u2019s no big deal. You don\u2019t need to use any chemicals either to get anything clean. I\u2019m going to be cleaning so many things now that have been a pain to clean because you have to scrub hard for so long just using a brush and chemicals. Like I said this thing is basically effortlessly to get things clean. Amazing product!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased my home almost a year ago from the sweetest older gentleman I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He was not in the greatest of health, and unfortunately the home cleaning part he fell behind on, as he simply didn't have the energy to keep up with it.Despite my best attempts, (and many tik tok mopping hacks) that gross black layer that has formed over the (incredibly retro) floor in the kitchen barely budged, and much to my dismay became even more obvious when we relocated the refrigerator across the kitchen and left that clearly clean spot that the portable dishwasher just isn't large enough to fully cover. (See picture 1.) So my hunt for something that could hopefully get the stuff to come clean, so I can quit lamenting over just how much I hate this flooring and want to replace it.I've used steam mops in the past, and I can vouch for how good they have worked before, but I personally haven't had access to one since I lived with my mother. I also have 4 cats, so I wanted something powerful, but also chemical free, and personally loathe playing the floor is lava for the hour following a standard bucket and floor mop session.I purchased the PUR Steam mop because it had the long handle for floor mopping usage and ALL OF THE ATTACHMENTS!!!!! I like attachments, it makes me feel like I'm saving money because I can use the machine in a multitude of ways, and I went all in. I got it, opened the box, and put it to WERK. It comes with a handy little funnel and a measuring cup that is conveniently just the right size to fill the device. Neat!I started by mopping my kitchen floor. the velcro on the floor usage apparatus is powerful, but it's velcro. So I'm sure after many uses, it will start to weaken. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. My bonus kids watched in awe as I effortlessly mopped my kitchen 3 times in 15 minutes. It's a tiny kitchen. And they went trekking through in socks as I was doing so, and I'm happy to report there were no complaints of wet socks! I wish I would snapped a pic of the aftermath of the kitchen mop, because it was BAD. I giggled like a maniac and took my mopping adventures to the bathroom. Where our litterboxes are. Our 2 recent cat additions like to track their poo on the tile in the bathroom because they MUST get immense enjoyment out of stepping in it, knowing I'm going to have to clean that up, because EW. My white tile is white again, and the dried on poo stood NO chance. Needless to say the microfiber pad was much worse.I then turned my focus to my stove, to which I've used probably every degreaser under the sun to limited success. I actually kinda cheated a little, (Sometimes you need a little extra help the first time. Hoping for chemical free cleaning after this) and liberally applied my favorite degreaser, let it sit for about 10 minutes, then went to town on the stove with the detached steamer unit, and the large and small scrub brush. It's plenty light, even when full, and the cord is pretty long, so my arms didn't get tired as I was furiously scrubbing the stove. There was so much steam that I couldn't tell where I had already gotten, and my glasses were super fogged up, but I felt like I had gotten everywhere at least a few times. Wipe it up with a paper towel, and my stove hasn't looked better! The only pitfalls so far to this machine is that I kinda ruined the brushes, which with 212 degree (on the instruction booklet) steam, and enough downward force, I expected it. I'll be shopping around for some replacements, but I figure I still have a few more good uses out of them, and when your not using the floor mop handle it is LOUD. I went looking for earplugs after a little while of stove cleaning. I then tackled the glass for the stove in the same manner. Heavy degreaser, wait 10 minutes, then go to scrub town. I was so chuffed with the results, I couldn't be done yet.I swapped the pads and tried the carpet glider attachment. The carpet in my home is old, and so packed down in some places, I've been considering just purchasing new carpet, as I've seen the hack to re-fluff your carpet is with a damp towel, a hot iron, and a carpet brush. Well ain't nobody got time for that. Once again getting the bonus kids socks seal of approval, this machine didn't leave any wetness in the carpet that stuck, so I ran the carpet mop over the floor several times, turned my shark robot vac to high, and let it rip. You can tell where the carpet is trying to fluff back up thanks to the agitator brush on the robot, so I figure a few more times of that and hopefully it'll be fluffy again.The machine pads are machine washable, so I threw them into my washer alone, with a detergent pod, and a scoop of washing booster powder, and they came out looking dang near brand new. I was SHOOKETH. I'm going to buy more later so I can have a microfiber pad for each room. I can't wait to try out the window squeegee attachment, and the grout cleaner attachment in my shower.I definitely recommend this product. Was worth every penny in my eyes. I hope it lasts a long time.",

Positives relatively light weightfolds easily can remove middle portion to fill at sinkheats water quicklyeasy assembly priceFor under 60 dollars this really does the job and works as it should.

If this is the kind of quality I won't be buying this or any product from this manufacturer in future. Waste of money",
