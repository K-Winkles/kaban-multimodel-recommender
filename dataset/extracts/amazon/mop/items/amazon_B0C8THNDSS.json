But these came in VERY quickly and I even turned another one of my mops/broomes into a spin mop. They fit exceedingly well with the name brand replacement mop string things. I have not had any issues with cracking or fading. I would recommend these for anyone with the mop bucket itself and just need a replacement. I think they were very easy to put on, especially because it just spins on. I'd say I'd buy them again but these don't show any signs of needing new ones ANY time soon.",
