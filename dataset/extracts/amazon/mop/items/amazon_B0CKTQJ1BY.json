                "reviewText": "Not only are 4 replacement mop heads included, but the entire mop is included too! I have ordered replacement mop heads for different products through Amazon before and they did not include the mop, but this does. Note that the bucket for the system is not included. Extremely pleased that the mop is included too. Excellent value!Note that there are 4 replacement mop heads, but they are shrink-wrapped in pairs of two. When you first open the box, you will only see 2 small packages of mop heads. However, once you open the package up and separate them, you will see there are actually 2 inside each shrink-wrapped package.Assembling Tip: This is a very easy assembly, but if you are not used to assembling mop handles yourself, here is a tip - The mop comes in 4 pieces that screw together. Save yourself some frustration and start assembling from the bottom of the mop to the top of mop. In other words, screw together the piece that is closest to the mop head first. That way, there is little room for error for screwing the rest of the pieces together and you'll be able to fit it all together in probably less than a minutes.",

                "reviewText": "These are great replacement mop heads. In a few pictures, I compared the mop head and the part the mop head clips into with the OEM on the left and the replacement on the right. They appear to have no functional differences, but replacement base (the red piece) has much firmer angles. I'm not really sure how to describe that. The OEM mop can take on various angles easily as you're mopping, but the replacement base has more distinct positions. It seems to have the same number of positions, they're just much firmer. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but I got these for the replacement mop heads, not the base they clip into. The handle also has a major issue. I couldn't use it. It comes in four pieces. The top piece has the hole for it to be hung up. The bottom piece has plastic threading to match the base. Both the OEM and the replacement use the same threading. However, as you can see in the picture, the lower rod (the one with the plastic threading on one side for the base) has threading that won't go into the upper segments of the handle. The narrowed portion doesn't go up high enough compared to the others, so I can't get it to go into the other segments far enough to grab the threading. That renders the handle useless. Perhaps this is a one-off manufacturing defect, but the handle is trash as far as I'm concerned. Again, I got this for the mop heads, not the other parts. I would prefer to buy just the mop heads by themselves.",

                "reviewText": "So other reviewers state they can't tell the difference in these and the original. I might disagree, but haven't done a side by side comparison with an unused original. So, first impression is they are larger. They seem to fill the entire bucket! They hold a lot of water, spin out perfectly, and maybe don't get as much stuff stuck in them as the originals do. At just under 20 bucks...get them. They work just as well as the original and apparently most people can't tell the difference. My originals have been washed multiple times and so they never quite returned to their original form, but even if these are somewhat different, they are no less effective. The only thing I can say is that I had one mop head detach while soaking, but couldn't replicate it again with the same head or others, so I won't say that is an issue.",

The replacement heads come in a package, and you have to connect them to the handle just like the original one. It's really easy to do and you can start using it right away.
