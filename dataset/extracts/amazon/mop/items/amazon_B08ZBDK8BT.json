                "reviewText": "I purchased this mop and bucket after returning 2 others that were hard to use. Can you be in love with a mop and bucket? Why yes you can!It was easy to assemble the mop and handle out of the box. You can use your own cleaning product in the water reservoir. The water reservoir is also light and easy to lift in and out of sink to fill. The big foot pedal on the bucket makes it easy to spin the mop dry.The mop head pivots to accommodate around objects and even flexes to clean base boards! The mop is easy to push. Let me repeat this part\u2026 the mop is easy to push. This was a key feature for me as other flat cleaners almost grip the floor and are exhausting to push. The mop head is machine-washable, and is holding up wellThe bucket has a nice comfort handle and is well balanced making it easy to pick up or push around.The \u201cfresh water\u201d inner bucket fills with clean water from the reservoir when you lift a little lever. This feature keeps the mop cleaner.I highly recommend vacuuming or swifering prior to moping.Check out my shiny clean floors. I used Murphys oil soap in warm water on vinyl plank flooring to clean dog and shoe prints. Highly recommend. Would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "I was very impressed with the performance of this mop system. I got it specifically for cleaning walls and baseboards but have used it on floors too. It works as promised. I just finished cleaning an open 1,000 sq. ft. basement studio apartment-like area so it got trial by fire. The spin feature, as well as the dirty water staying separate from the clean, are what I like best besides how wonderfully the mop heads came out of the washing machine (I did put them in lingerie bags). It was nice it came with three mop heads that were easy to pop on and off when one got too dirty. The only slight down side is having to frequently dump the dirty water and refilling the clean. But if the capacity was greater, the weight would be too. I really wouldn't want it any heavier. Consequently the mop heads are a little small but after using them on baseboards, they were just the right size and the triangular shape really helps get in corners.",

The mop is a bit small so takes a little longer to clean the floors, and the price is cheaper on here then Walmart. I highly recommend you throw away whatever mop your using and buy this immediately. I will never switch to any other mop or brand. If you finally want clean floors this is your magic mop and it's so easy to use and I love that it keeps the dirty water separate. So happy with this purchase. Buy it right now and say goodbye to dirty floors forever. So easy to clean the mop I clean it in the bathtub and it looked brand new!",

Other than that, this is an excellent product. It is well designed, separates dirty water from clean, wringer works effortlessly. I'm very pleased with this product. All my floors are LVT and between the dog and I we track in a lot of dirt. I needed something a bit heavier duty than Bona & microfiber push mop. This has filled the bill perfectly.",

It separates the dirty and clean water very well and it's super easy to empty and clean. I love the mop heads as well. They click into the handle easily and once you're done you can just throw it in the washer and it's clean.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this mop. Deep cleaning? Probably not the best choice, but my hardwood floors have never looked better. It's on the small side, I suppose to be handled easily and kept lightweight.DISLIKES: 1. it should come with one extra mop head. You are forced to buy spares. 2. Microfibers collect a lot of debris and it can be difficult to dislodge from the fibers 3. A telescoping wand would be better than the fixed, 3-part wand. 4. bulky to store. 5. Limited clean water supply requires frequent water-changing. (That is not really a bad thing, just wanted to mention that you get about 10 dunks before you have to refill the clean water chamber.)LIKES: 1. very easy to use. 2. Easy to control the amount of wetness in the mop head. 3. Really saves the back and the hands from heavy mopping and wringing. 4. well-designed and engineered. Genius really. 5. Easy to mop up spills, fairly absorbent mop head. 6. No dirty water gets back on your clean floor! <---that is the BEST feature! 7. Cleaning solutions can go directly into the clean-water tank. I only use white vinegar so I cant comment on other cleaners or over-sudsing. 8. Bucket handle is generous and has a mop-holder feature.",

                "reviewText": "I don't normally write reviews but I just have to for this one. I was unsure it would work the way I imagined (imagination inserted here: mop with clean water). I received it today and here are my dislikes:1. Mop head is way too small for my liking. It's ok if you have a small apartment. 2. The mop stick keeps coming undone.3. Moping with clean water is just not possible. Here's why, once you wet the mop, and pick up your dirt mess and grime, you have to kind of rinse it in the clean water tank and therefore the rest of the water gets dirty. I guess it is cleaner than the trad mop and bucket, I will say that. IDK, I was expecting something different for a 50 buck mop and bucket set.What I do like about it isNO NEED TO DIRTY YOUR HANDS.IT WRINGS OUT VERY GOOD.and for those two reasons Im keeping it.I actually had to have a secondary bucket with just plain water to actually rinse the mop and then wring it AND THEN wet it with the water that has mopping solution.",
