                "reviewText": "It does smell like the original pinesol just not as strong a pine smell as the real original, but still a good piney clean smell. I had purchased some Pinesol about a year ago from a big box local chain store and had to return it because it smelled so bad. It had a uriney smell!While surfing on Google, I came across an article or site, don't recall exactly where on the net, and discovered other people complaining about it too and then somewhere read that the real original Pinesol had been discontinued or modified and now \"Original\"Pinesol could only be sold over the internet but using a fraction of the pine oil it used before. So I started searching for pinesol on the internet (Amazon) and looked to make sure the bottle had it printed that it contains pine oil. This bottle does state it has pine oil and it does. Great Price too. Thank you Amazon.",
