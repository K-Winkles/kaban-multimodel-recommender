The kCarpoly mop heads are excellent mop head replacements for the heavy cotton mop we have. They appear well made and fit the mop handle just as well as the original. The cotton \u201cropes\u201d are good and thirsty, they can soak up spills quickly. I must concede, my spray mop and steam mops can\u2019t accomplish that task nearly as efficiently.I will only be using these sparingly as they are quite heavy when wet, and that causes me back pain. However I find these mop heads to be excellent quality, and offered at a great price for three replacements. I also love that they came in dark blue. They won\u2019t acquire that dirty looking gray color that others do. Perhaps it\u2019s foolish to care about the color of your mop head, but I appreciate this feature.****About me: Integrity is very important to me. Reviews I've posted will be from items I've had direct contact with. These are my honest opinions. I will not post a review for a product I have not had personal contact with.",

These replacement mop heads are designed for heavy-duty use and are suitable for commercial, industrial, and residential areas.What stands out about these mop heads is their cost-effectiveness. They're great for the price and pretty durable for several uses. The deep blue color is also a nice touch, adding style to cleaning.The mop heads are cotton with thin ropes, which I've found effective for thorough cleaning. They attach easily to the mop handle and are just as simple to remove and wash, making them a convenient option for regular use.One of the best aspects is not feeling guilty about disposing of them after several uses. Their affordability and quality make them a practical choice for those who prefer to replace mop heads regularly for hygiene purposes.The kCarpoly Mop Heads are an excellent choice for affordable, effective, and easy-to-use mop heads. They offer great value and functionality, making them an intelligent purchase for keeping spaces clean and tidy.",

                "reviewText": "The kCarpoly brand's \"3-Pack Mop Head Supplements\" appear to be a high-quality and versatile option for mopping various floor types in residential and commercial settings.The heads are well made, durable, and clean well.They are easy to keep clean by either hand or machine washing. I recommend hand washing to keep floor residues out of your washer. If you wash them in a washer, do so alone or with a towel to help balance the load and avoid transferring dirt from the floor/mop to your other laundry.Don't use any form of fabric softener so that you will maintain absorbency in the mop heads.Pros:Durable: Made from high-quality cotton materials for long-lasting use.Absorbent: Cotton rope design effectively soaks up spills and water.Lightweight and easy to use: Weighs only 480 grams (16.9 ounces) and has a circular end for maneuverability.Versatile: Suitable for wet and dry cleaning on hard surfaces like hardwood, tile, stone, concrete, and vinyl.Reusable and washable: Machine-washable for easy cleaning and repeated use.Universal headband: Fits both clip-on and side loading mop handles.Cons:None that we've noticed.General:A product of China.",

                "reviewText": "The kCarpoly 3-Pack Mop Heads are a good quality replacement mop head. They are probably geared more towards industrial use, but they fit my household mop handle just fine they are pretty beefy so it takes some effort to wring them out by hand, but if you have a wringer you shouldn't have any problem. Easy to pop off the handle and throw in the wash as needed. And for only $5 for each mop at the time of this review, they are a great deal. The blue color is a nice change from the normal drab white-soon-to-be-gray color of other brands.",

                "reviewText": "A great affordable price for replacement mop heads. These are vacuumed sealed which makes them easy to store until use. I like that while they have thin ropes they feel very premium. I like that I had zero hassles with attaching to the mop stick. 75% Recycled Cotton + 25% Rayon Blend makes these great for washing. After using, you will be glad these are machine washable because they do pick up a lot of dirt! While they are soft loops they are also great for scrubbing as well. I like that they ring out majority of the water and do not leave you with a puddle of water while using. I will note that I use a wringer so that might affect the dry factor.",

                "reviewText": "One of my new year's resolutions was to find more sustainable ways to clean. I bought these wet mop heads to replace disposable pads and chemical solutions they use. They come vacuum sealed but shake out instantly once you unwrap them. The fibers are thick and appeal to my dog (very important). They attached to the mop handle (not included) easy. Note, the dark blue mops are a universal handle fit. I first did the tile floor bathrooms. Honestly, I was a little shocked at how dirty the water was. I concluded that I probably wasn't changing those disposable pads often enough and had simply been re-distributing a lot of the dirt. This only reinforced my decision on using old school wet mops. Next up, basement floor. First time ever. Wish me luck. Thanks!",
