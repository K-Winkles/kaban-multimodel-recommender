                "reviewText": "As an owner of several older pets, I must always have a mop on hand. I have long been searching for a good quality reusable mop and have finally found just that in this Midoneat mop set. As an added bonus, this set includes two mop handles and two mop heads! Additionally, I had grown tired of cheap mop handles stacking up in corners of my home after they are all used up, and thanks to these reusable mop handles, that will no longer be an issue for me. Now, I can simply replace the mop head and be on my way.These mop handles are very well designed and are very well bulit. The aluminum handles are sturdy, and can withstand the pressure required to remove even the most stubborn of messes. Assembly is easy, the four handle components simply snap together, and are retained by heavy duty locking clips. The rubber grip then simply slides over the end of the handle. The height of the mop is adjustable, which is certainly handy when using in tight areas. This can be done by simply omitting or adding any number of the four handle components. The steel jaws that secure the mop heads are very heavy duty, and are very easy to operate.The included mop heads are of very high quality, and are machine washable. They will certainly last quite a while. The mop head simply slides into the jaws of the mop handle, and then the jaws are clamped down onto the mop head by adjusting the built in wing-nut. The mop heads are also easily removable. A benefit of this style clamping jaw is that many different mop head refills can be used with these handles.Overall, I am very satisfied with this Midoneat mop set. The handles are of excellent quality, and are most definitely built to last. The steel clamping jaws are very heavy duty, and can be used with many different mop head refills. This means that I no longer have to put up with cheap, disposable mop handles piling up in my home. The included mop heads are machine washable, and will last me quite a while. The build quality of this mop set makes it an excellent value, and I expect that it will last me a very long time. I would highly recommend this Midoneat mop set to you.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not really a looped string mop fan, but I have family members who use them all the time. I do, however, know quality when I see it. These wet string mops have good, but not great components. The aluminum rods are very solid, but could and would bend if used on an everyday basis commercially. Once a mop is put together, it should last. There are no instructions in the box, however, assembly was intuitive and quick.This loop-end string mop itself is made of a heavy-duty cotton. There are two mops, a real plus for me. My husband, one of the mop\u2019s fans, says it will be easy to wring out by hand. True, but I do have a mop wringer, an easier method. The mop head can be removed for laundering and easily replaced. I especially like the fact that it can be laundered.As mentioned, the mop can be disassembled, if so desired, and put back in the box for storage. One of these mops will be going to a relative who uses them frequently. If being stored at home, it has a nice loop on the end for hanging. Keep in mind I wouldn\u2019t consider this to be a commercial mop. Even though the rods are a decent enough aluminum and the plastic is impact-resistant, it\u2019s probably not meant to be used heavily on a daily basis.",

                "reviewText": "These are definitely the weight and absorbency I needed, unfortunately they began to fray and the loops fall apart the first day of use. The floor surface I was cleaning was smooth cement, but these mop heads look like they've been dragged across a very rough surface. I would recommend these for only very smooth surfaces - sport court, etc. The wing nut/tightening mechanism does not remain secure, but that was an easy fix. I wish I could give this 5 stars but the falling apart mop head prevents me from doing so.",

I've been using this type of mop for my home for a few years now and I'm never going back to those crappy grocery store slopslushers or ridiculous wet spray machines. These are the tried, true, tested, and best way to clean your floor. Heavy and durable, can be used and reused many times. Easy to disinfect in the tub in some bleach and can even be tossed into the washing machine and cleaned. For best results, don't dry it in the dryer or wash on hot. Properly cared for these can last a very long time. Highly recommended.",

It takes a bit longer to adjust and change out the mop head but it holds the mop head in place far better than the plastic one.The pole is aluminum so it does not appear to be as durable as the wood mope poles but it is definitely lighter and thus less tiring to use.Overall, I think these are great and priced accordingly (the current price is 39.99, for the set).",
