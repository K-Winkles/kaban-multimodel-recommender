                "reviewText": "Pros: I usually use a spin mop on my hardwood wood floors and title. This made it so much easier on me! I have one bad wrists and a worst wrist. Actually having another surgery on the worst one next week. This is a self propelled mop and it made life so much easier. I just guided it around the room.It didn't put to much water on the floor, it was just the right amount. It cleaned the floor better than the spin mop, not quite as good as doing it by hand, but who has time for all of that?It was super quiet, way quiet than I expected. I mopped while my granddaughter slept in the same room. I can also mop while holding her.The water tank holds a lot more than expected.Cons: The chord is shorter than I would have preferred. The solution that it came with is just okay. Easy fix is too use my normal brand.It doesn't get into the grout too clean the tile floors very well. But the title floor itself is very clean.The scrub pads are easy to remove and to put back on, however the are held on by velcro. I is a must to have an extra set of pads or when you remove them the Velcro will become less effective. Bad design flaw there.This will NOT replace sweeping or vacuuming before use. If you want a combo this is not the machine for you! It will only push dirt or debris around it will not vacuum it up.Overall, I really like this mop and am happy with the purchase! I'd recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An easier alternative to traditional mopping",
                "reviewText": "I have been using an O'Cedar spray mop (but the spray broke so I had to spray by hand with a bottle). I have textured, light LVP throughout the 2,200 SF house with grouted tile in the bathrooms and laundry. We're a 2 adult/2 dog household. I dry mop 1-2x wk, vacuum 1x wk, and then mop. I purchased this to work on the high-traffic areas, but also possibly replace the other mop.Overall, it's a good alternative to the hand mop approach which is quite a workout for me.- Pro: very easy to put together and use- Pro: pads are easy to install and remove- Pro: pads are easy to hand clean if you want to do so between rooms or dirtier areas of the house- Pro: easy to store; doesn't take up a lot of space- Pro: low noise level with a beep when misting floor with cleaner- Pro: uses 2-cups of water before adding formula (I use white vinegar). This covers a 2,200 SF home.- Pro: easy-to-use water/formula bottle; no tricky installation or removal.- Con: if you have arthritis, carpal tunnel, or any hand sensitivity or neuropathy, this could be challenging to manage and guide. While there is no noticeable vibration, the need to guide its direction might require two hands. You can use two hands because it's not very fast or ornery on its own. Just know that you might have to take a hand break.- Con: because the speed is slow, cleaning a full house could take a bit of time. I think it's a good 1-2 hours compared to a shorter time for a traditional mop (because we're more likely to push/pull faster). You don't want to push/pull this mop too fast, it won't be as effective.- Con: this doesn't apply heavy contact to the ground that you'd likely be able to apply with a traditional mop. It does pick up dirt, for sure, but not quite like I've achieved with a hand mop. ** Tip: wet the pads, wring them out, and then install on the mop. When I used this the first time, with dry pads, they didn't pick up as much dirt. The water primes the pad to clean and pick up dirt. I did this with my standard mop with the same success. **- Con: this won't clean your tile grout, dug-in stains hardened dirt, or grooves of tile, hardwood, or LVP. This is a standard mop that rotates while going in a vertical direction. I think it has an advantage over a standard mop, but it's not the holy grail I was hoping for. I use the soft and scrubby pads (striped white and gray) that came with the purchase. I might invest in the scrubby pads (they're pink)This mop has made this activity easier than bending over, spraying the floor then mopping. I'm also more likely to mop the full house vs rotating between sections in addition to always mopping high-traffic areas each week. I might not get the same workout as with the mop, but I'm happy with it. I will keep the other mop for minor issues. I also keep a Swiffer for quick tile clean-ups. Edited to add photos.",

                "reviewText": "We got this to help do a better job at cleaning with floors without requiring a ton of elbow grease. So far, I love it. It's very easy to use and operate. The pads are holding up well through use and washing (I let them air dry, tho, to try to prolong their life). I love that the I can see how dark the white pads turn after use since it makes me feel like I'm truly getting the dirt up. We also liked the pet cleaner that came with it and ended up ordering a larger bottle. It's got a nice, fresh scent without being overwhelming.",
