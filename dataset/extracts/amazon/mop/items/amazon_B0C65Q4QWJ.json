                "reviewText": "I just got hardwood floors and asked Jacob (a professional cleaner) for advice on what to use for maintaining and cleaning. Of all the choices, this is the one he recommended, and I absolutely love it. The pads are easily applied by sewn on velcro strips; they\u2019re very thick and sturdy, easy to remove, and wash well. The handle has a trigger that releases a fine mist, covering about 15 inches wide and 12 inch deep onto the floor. On Jacob\u2019s recommendation I use water with maybe 1/4 cup of Meyers Clean Day added to fill the vessel; it lasts a long time and doesn\u2019t put more fluid than necessary to clean the floor. The mist is so fine that it doesn\u2019t need drying after cleaning.",

It might be best suited to someone 5'8\" or shorter. To me it doesn't look like it extends beyond its capacity. Should make an extendable version for taller users.",

It has four interchangeable pads so you may use in different areas of your home without using the same one everywhere. It cleans well and you may use your cleaning solution of choice. I had no problem putting it together and it did a very nice job, especially behind the toilet, hard to clean if mop is too large. I'm glad I purchased this mop.",
