                "reviewText": "I really like these and want to get another pack. Im a housd cleaner and I started with a few sets from walmart. Dont waste your time there, the size runs small at walmart and always know when Im using those because they dont cover the sole of my shoe as these do. This brand is great! Larger size. I have a 9 female shoe and there is more stretch room for a larger foot. I like the color variety because its fun to pair them up after cleaning and I can keep tracknof each pair better.I love the thickness because they dont get wet very fast, they are absorbant and great for a quick spot scrub on the floor if you missed somthing. My clients really like that i wear booties into their home so im not bringing outside dirt in.",

You can also put it on your dry Swiffer sweeper and then give them a shake outside and then wash them in the laundry when they get soiled. That way you can cut down on buying all the refills.They're actually quite robust. Even using my weight to hard wipe spills on tile floors with my foot did not break or leave strands of fringes of the fabric on the floor.",

In the picture you'll notice the inch long mircofibers that should be pointing out are stitched inward. This makes them uncomfortable to wear. They are made small and only fit up to a size 10 women's when you are bare foot. Lastly they don't last. Sometimes they wear out at the bottom but more often they come apart at the elastic band",
