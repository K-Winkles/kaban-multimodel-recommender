                "reviewText": "I just received this mop. I was really wanting something that can be wrung out without touching it with my hands. This is just that, indeed.I also wanted it to have a tall enough handle, cuz my old mop was a bit short and, even though I am not really tall, the short mop made me bend forward too much. My third requirement was for the mop head to be a color other than white. This mop is tall enough and has gray mop head on it. Yay and yay again!I took it out of the box, and although it did NOT include any instructions, I was able to figure out how to assemble it pretty quickly. After which I immediately went about testing it out. The mop head fits well in my sturdy mop bucket. My only complaint is that there were NO instructions so I didn't figure out how to wring it out right away. I didn't think I was doing it right and I wasn't. Once I figured it out, I was able to wring it out very nicely. If you buy this mop be sure to push the yellow sleeve thing up the handle until it clicks onto the little peg thing then twist.At this point I do recommend this mop. I'm hopeful that it will be durable, because I have a large kitchen and breakfast nook area, plus two bathrooms that are all with tile floors and I need to do a lot of mopping. I also hope it won't fall apart in the wash.We will see. But so far so good. It was a reasonable price point, too.",
