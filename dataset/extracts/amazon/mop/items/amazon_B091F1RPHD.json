                "reviewText": "It makes mopping so much less of a hassle. The mop and bucket are small and take up very little space. They also aren't ugly so if you leave it out, it doesn't really detract from everything. The mop works on all kinds of surfaces, and the mop head stays on well and can be washed easily. It's very light and the extra mop heads that come with the standard purchase are more than enough.I will say my only issues are that the mop does come apart a bit too easily and when you wring the mop, some dirty water will run off into your clean water.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought the JOYMOOP Mop and Bucket with Wringer Set, specifically the White Flat Squeeze Bucket Set designed for floor cleaning. With its inclusion of a wet/dry wall cleaner and a long handle, coupled with the additional feature of being a Hardwood Floor Mop, this set comes complete with three microfiber cloths. Let me share how it's become a game-changer for me, especially considering the need to be extra cautious with our vinyl floors.Our home is adorned with vinyl floors, and as you may know, excessive moisture can lead to buckling. Given this, cleaning can be a bit of a challenge. Enter the JOYMOOP Mop and Bucket set \u2013 a true savior for our vinyl floors.What sets this set apart is its flat squeeze bucket design, ensuring that the amount of water applied is controlled, preventing any excess moisture from seeping through. This feature has been a lifesaver, allowing me to clean effectively without the worry of damaging our vinyl flooring.The long handle provides added convenience, sparing me from the need to bend over excessively during cleaning sessions. This not only makes the cleaning process more comfortable but also more efficient.The inclusion of a wet/dry wall cleaner and the option for hardwood floor cleaning with the same set is incredibly convenient. It's a versatile solution that caters to various cleaning needs around the house.The only thing I dislike is that adding water can be difficult. Other than that I do recommend it.",

Makes for easy storage especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of space. The mop breaks down and stores nicely inside of the bucket. I also enjoy how easily the bucket glides on the floor, making moving around effortlessly. The only thing I don\u2019t like is sometimes when I\u2019m using the drying side for the mop head, it detaches from them stick.Other than that, the mop head is a good size and does a good job getting up dirt.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to aid in the deep cleanup after a fire. I needed to clean the ceilings and walls, and this beat the heck out of climbing up and down a ladder every two swipes to rinse a rag. I had a real cheap Dollar Tree version of the flat mop I was using, and it was good, except the mop head was small and not very thick, so it was good for one swipe, then had to be rinsed out to remove the soot. So, I saw this and thought it was a FANTASTIC alternative and ordered one right away.All seemed well, until I went to use it. On a dry run, I tested the two slots, to be sure I would be able to stay on the ladder to rinse and squeegee dry. What a time saver!I dipped into the clean water tank, and it took a few tries to get it in the slot in the right. When it did go in, it was easy. I pulled it back out and commenced with the ceiling. BEAUTIFUL! It worked very nicely for me. Then I went to rinse it, jabbing it up and down a few times, inserted in the squeegee dry slot and pulled back out.I would have been utterly ecstatic, if not for the simple fact that the tank is not deep enough to rinse the entire mop, nor is the dry side deep enough to squeegee the entire mop. It is about an inch too shallow. The mop comes out mostly clean and read to go again, except for that inch or so at the top side. All the sludge and soot IO just cleaned is still there, unable to squeeze it out or rinse with clean water in the tank. That might be easily remedied if one could just turn the head the opposite way and dip again. That is not possible, as the head has a strong magnet that is made to lock the swiveling head in place for the rinse and dry. It only locks one way, and if you try to fit it in the slots the other way, it won't fit. I also found myself fighting the magnetic lock when using it overhead, as it tended to snap into the lock position when I didn't want it to.I don't know how such a major flaw got past R&D, when logic would tell them the tank HAS to be deeper than the length of the mop! The amazing squeegee takes out almost ALL the dirty water, allowing you to dip into the clean tank and emerge with a very clean reloaded mop. But only once. Since it is already not quite deep enough to submerge the whole mop, it also becomes less and less accommodating as you use the soapy water with each new reload.I would have loved to give this 5 stars, but right now, I wasted my money. It would be great for light cleaning, but nothing about my needs entails light duty anything.",
