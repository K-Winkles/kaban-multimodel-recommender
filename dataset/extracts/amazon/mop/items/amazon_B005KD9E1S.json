                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace a metal handle that snapped. I hoped wood would be more sturdy, but this doesn't feel like it's going to last any longer than the metal handle it replaced. I can feel the wood flexing when I need to really put in some elbow grease on a tough-to-remove spot. The handle really needs to be at least a quarter inch thicker in diameter so it has more rigidity. However, if you are looking for a lightweight, light duty, handle this will do the job. I would prefer something heavier, intended for commercial use.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this along with the Rubbermaid Commercial Wavebrake Mopping System Bucket and Side Press Wringer (35 gallons), and the matching Red Dirty Water Bucket (18 qt. capacity). It's a great set-up for use in my basement, or anywhere. But this mop handle is just too thin. The worst is not the flex, but that your hands get fatigued after a short time using it.I do not have very large hands, and I'd imagine the problem would be even worse for those who do. It is a lot like trying to turn screws with a screwdriver handle that is too thin. Mopping is a fairly vigorous activity. You need more grip to have proper control, and this handle does not afford it. The 0.94\" (15/16\") thickness is just too little.I replaced it with a proper mop handle from the local family-owned hardware store. It is the standard 1.25\" thick (actually 1-3/16\"). That extra quarter inch of diameter makes all the difference. It's also made of a nicely varnished Indonesian hardwood and gives that sturdy feel and ease of use that you need. And it cost less than a dollar more than this item. The head is also made of thicker steel, is 1\" longer, and all around sturdier.I prefer buying online, especially with the Covid pandemic raging. At the hardware store checkout counter, a fool was standing less than 3 feet behind me. When I looked closely, I saw his mask was pulled down so it did not cover his nose. I avoid challenging such people, because it can so easily lead to violence, but I did ask him to give me a little more space at the counter. He backed up about 6 inches. This is why I buy online whenever I can. But avoid this mop handle.",
