I have several other brands made from different materials, and some of them are just so heavy for me to lift it up out of the bucket. They clean up/rinse good. And most importantly, they mop up good. I use these with a commercial Rubbermaid handle, think it's the Invader one. Definitely recommend these.",

They have to pick up a lot of dirt and oil, and they have not deteriorated nor frayed any loose strings. They are thick but still allow for squeezing all the water out when compressed in bucket vice. I couldn't ask for better especially at this good price.",
