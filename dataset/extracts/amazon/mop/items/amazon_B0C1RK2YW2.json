                "reviewText": "This is a really nice product that I wasn\u2019t sure I really needed until I bought it. The power mop works wonders and really does a much better job than a regular wet jet. The bigger size pads are great, and takes less time to get the job done. The texture of the pads really seem to work great on both hardwood floors and tile flooring. The amount of dirt that it removes is wonderful. A great price for a 10 pack.",
