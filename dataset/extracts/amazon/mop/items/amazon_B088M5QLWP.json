                "reviewText": "Since my arthritic hands are getting more painful, I could not longer mop our mostly tile house with a mop and bucket. I tried the Rubbermaid mop first which was good, but the trigger was hard to pull and after two months, it stopped spraying. I bought another one, and again after two months, it stopped spraying. I then tried another brand, and the trigger was so stiff, it really hurt my hands to do my whole house. Then after asking the question about the trigger being hard to pull on this one and getting answers it was easy, I purchased this one. It was easy to assemble--took me all of a few minutes by myself. The trigger is thankfully, very easy to spray. The spray is wide making it a quick job. The mop is very lightweight. The only downside for me is that the refill bottle does not have a flat bottom. This makes it impossible to remove from the mop when you are finished and store it separately. I don't like to store the bottle of solution left in the mop, but there is no other way to take it out and store it separately. The pads that came with it seem better suited to just dusting. For mopping, I use the same size microfiber pads from my other mops. This mop was half the cost of the rubbermaid reveal, so if it lasts longer than two months, it will be awesome.",

                "reviewText": "It didn\u2019t take us long to get it out of the box once it arrived. We were pretty excited. All the complaints I read had me fearing the worst but I thought to myself, yes it\u2019s only 20.00 and that can sometimes mean bad news but let\u2019s be honest here\u2026 have you priced out the wet pads for flooring? If this broke and if I had to replace this in 3 months, I would STILL save money than having to buy the pads! The tracks the dogs bring in from outside is overwhelming and we needed something more cost effective. (Let alone using the microfiber dry helped move all the Golden hair from hard to reach places so it could be swept up and discarded first)We made a mixture that lasted through the dining room and the kitchen that might have cost .20 cents.I am EXTREMELY impressed with the washable pads and it comes with 3! Don\u2019t look any further! WE LOVE IT!",

It\u2019s soooooo easy to use I nearly cried the first time I used it - seriously. I used to have a Vileda mop and while it worked fine, it was such a chore to do the floors - yeah yeah, I know, cleaning the house is literally called \u201cchores\u201d - but this new mop made it so easy. It cleans them well, I can use whatever cleaning solution I want, and there\u2019s no electrical cord to trip over. First world problems I know - and I ain\u2019t complaining about having those problems, but seriously buy this mop. It seems sturdy enough and hopefully that lasts - but for the price and ease of use, you can\u2019t go wrong with this choice.",
