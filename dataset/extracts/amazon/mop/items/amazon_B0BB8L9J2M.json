I couldn't find one like the one I broke, I got this one because it was the closest. I like it better than my older one. I've saw some reviews complain about it not spinning sturdy, it does, of course it's gotta be placed in properly, I just mean straight, that's it. Put it in straight it spins fine. I've got a lot to mop, I want a mop I like, I guess if you know, you know lol The bucket on this one is bigger than my older one, that's definitely a plus for me. I almost didn't buy, because of some of the reviews. It's made fine, not cheaply made. I wanted to wait to do this review, but if it happens to break, which I doubt, I'll update my review. And it shipped really fast. That's always good. I saw a review about it breaking easily, the only reason I could see that is user error. Like, maybe being to rough with it. It works, it's good. If your looking for a good, clean, mop, buy it. You won't regret it and can't go wrong. And you can buy extra refills when you want them. My older one, I had problems finding proper refills for it. My old mop, when id spin it, it would spin water every where, this one does not do that. I was used to it, never really thought much about it. Until I used this one.",

Performance wise, this mop makes cleaning a breeze with its efficient spinning action that wrings out excess water, leaving my floors spotless and nearly dry. The microfiber mop head is large in size while also being highly effective at trapping dirt and grime, and it's machine washable, which is a bonus. The sturdy build and easy maneuverability of this mop are impressive. It has made floor cleaning less of a chore and more of a joy. The value commensurates with the cost.

                "reviewText": "My first thoughts were why was this plastic mopping kit packages with minimal cardboard? My first package came broken. The return process is easy of course and I received a replacement before I had a chance to drop the original return.All that aside, the mop is efficient, comes with a replacement head and doesn\u2019t let anything truly stick to the cleaning head while still managing to clean and remove stains. This is also in conjunction with a good cleaning solution.Removing the dirty water is easy without having to flip it over. It comes with a hole at the top that just requires you to tilt it over.My biggest pet peeve come with \u201cbreaking it in.\u201d The mop has a swirl handle that allows you to squeeze water out without touching the mop. The problem is that in the beginning, you have to touch the top portion of the mop to get the mechanism working. After mopping my house twice, it finally works as it should.I wish Amazon packaged some packages better but for the price and ease of returns, I\u2019m not mad. I used to have a different, similar system, but I prefer this one.",
