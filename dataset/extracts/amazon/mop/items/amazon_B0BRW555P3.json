Then I decided to try it wet and it worked well It\u2019s comes with two Mop heads so I was able to try it on glass. The apt has lots of glass three rooms with one wall entirely made of glass which I was happy to be able to clean with this mop. As for the Mopping it is not heavy which is great cause when cleaning the glass wall it doesn\u2019t make my arms hurt from doing the physical work. I must say I purchased this for the floor but I will be using it for the glass walls and doors. It does a great job on glass and made my job easier. Another thing I like is that there\u2019s no waste the mop heads Can be cleaned and washed. I use to buy the ones that I had to buy packages of sheets to put in the mop and it was so much waste and I spent much more money. Overall I really like this and I recommend getting this instead of the ones that you need to purchase refills for.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I have given this another star. I used it tonight to dry mop my floor and it did a good job of sweeping cat hair. I also used my stand up dustpan with it. That went really well as the dust and hair went right into it. I found out it is easy to clean by running hot water over it. The reasons I won't give it 5 stars are because, as I said before, there are no instructions, the buttons are extremely hard to push in to take it apart and it is hard to get it to stand up by itself. Unless you sit it away from a surface, the handle falls to one side or the other.It took me over an hr. to get the extending poles on correctly. The picture, on the box, shows a grey whatchamathingy on it. It presents to be on the second pole. After spending a humongous amount of time, readjusting to, what I thought, was the correct setting, it turned out I had it right the first time.I didn't realize the whatchamathingy comes off. I call it that because I see no purpose for it. It's grey with poky looking nubs on it. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what it's for.The buttons, once entered into the pole, are almost impossible to push in to retract one. So once you get it in, be sure you have it right because you don't want to end up trying numerous items to get it undone again.If you have arthritis or any other debilitating hand issues, I do NOT recommend buying this. It is very difficult to put together and take apart.I used the dry mop feature and was, relatively, happy with the results. On the other hand, it kept trying to unscrew making it difficult to get between items. I used it in my kitchen.I made the mistake of trying to mop with the pad I'd dusted my floor with. The results were disastrous. My whole floor looks like it has a white powder on it. You receive two pads. My suggestion is to use one for dry and one for wet.This is where the positive comes in. I was impressed with how easy it is to apply the pads. There is a Velcro effect when you press the pad on the plate. The pads do not come off, on their own, whether wet or dry. It is a clever design.My experience was not favorable, but I do like the fact it is light, the pads do a good job of dry mopping. It was my error to use the same pad for dry and wet. Once I use the clean one to mop my floor, I will update my results and, possibly, upgrade the star rating.",
