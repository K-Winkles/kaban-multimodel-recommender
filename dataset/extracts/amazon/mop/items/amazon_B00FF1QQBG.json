I chose these specifically for what looked like a rougher textured scrubbing surface, only to receive them with smooth surfaces like others I intentionally passed up. I don't know if the pictures they use for this product are from an older model, but they should update them if that is the case, because it feels a little like a bait and switch situation. I'm not returning them because I need them and they'll probably be adequate for the job.",
