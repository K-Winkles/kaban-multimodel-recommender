Putting up the rack may have been easier! Which it actually was. I did not need any help and I certainly would not consider myself a \"handy-woman\" by all means.What I like: It's durable. I've been using it for a while now and so far, it's held up exceptionally well. It's adjustable horizontally which I like, so before you hang, you can determine how wide you would like it. I do like the lever style latches which hold my Oxo poles and handles quite well. And, there are enough hooks to hang my dusters and whatever else that needs hanging. The rack keeps everything neatly stored in one place, and when you live in a smaller home, this type of organization means less clutter and less mess.What I don't like: There isn't anything I don't like.I'm happy with my purchase and I would recommend this product to others.",

                "reviewText": "I have only used those broom handles that can hold one broom at a time using a circle that flips up. I needed an option that would hold multiple items (broom, dust bin, mop, etc) in my mud room, but I also didn't want something that looked horribly cheap since people do sometimes walk through there when the weather is bad to have a quicker way into the house.I like this much more I expected to. It holds your items up using either one of four hooks (perfect for a fly swatter or umbrellas) or a teardrop shaped that will flip up and back down to hold your heavier items snuggly. At first I was using one hand to flip the nob up but that isn't necessary, you can just push the broom handle into place. This is adjustable from 15 inches to a full 24, which is what I opted for, and the hooks and nobs can be slid for spacing that works well for you. It comes with a small level that is handy for your junk drawer, I actually used my own longer level since I feel they're more accurate. It was easy for me to hang it by myself, and I was careful to locate it on studs just incase we ever put anything to heavy on it.I am not crazy about the orange accents and would have liked to see something \"tamer\" that would fit in more decors, but for use in a closet, mudroom or garage the color isn't a huge deterrent.",
