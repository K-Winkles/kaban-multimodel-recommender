I ended up poking holes in my sheetrock from the ridiculously sharp and pointy edges of the mop holder and the lint sloughed off making me have to vacuum AFTER i mopped lol. A bit counterintuitive if you ask me. This mop is 500% better!!!! There\u2019s no lint, it\u2019s fluffy, it doesn\u2019t tear up my walls and it works brilliantly!!! 5* purchase all day everyday!!!",
