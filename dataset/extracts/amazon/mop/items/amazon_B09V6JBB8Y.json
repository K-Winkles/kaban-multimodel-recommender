                "reviewText": "These reusable mop pads for my Swiffer have been great in my cleaning routine. The compatibility with the PowerMop and other spray mops is fantastic, and the size fits perfectly, making them a cost-effective alternative to disposable pads.The microfiber power of these pads is impressive \u2013 they delve into every nook and cranny, leaving no spot untouched. The super water absorption and decontamination ability make cleaning a breeze, especially in high-traffic areas where spills and messes are a regular occurrence.The concept of reusable and machine-washable pads is excellent for both the environment and my wallet. I appreciate the effort to reduce waste by eliminating the need for disposable mop cloths. The fact that they can be washed up to 100 times is a major plus and speaks to the durability of the product.However, I did notice that these pads tend to get dirty fairly quickly, especially in high-traffic areas or when dealing with stubborn stains. While they clean effectively, the need to wash them frequently can be a bit inconvenient.I followed the recommended pre-use soaking to restore thickness and stickiness, and it worked well. They adhered perfectly to my PowerMop, providing a secure and effective clean. The safe use on finished wood floors is a relief, as I was initially concerned about potential damage.The package includes a generous 6-pack, ensuring I have plenty of pads on hand for various cleaning needs. The customer support is also commendable \u2013 their responsiveness to inquiries is reassuring.In conclusion, these reusable mop pads are a solid investment for anyone looking to reduce their environmental impact and save money in the long run. While they could stay cleaner a bit longer, their cleaning efficiency and compatibility with various spray mops make them a worthwhile addition to my cleaning arsenal.",

                "reviewText": "I prefer a washable pad because I hate to add to the amount of trash I generate each day. These work just as well as mop pads made for Swiffer and do seem to fit extremely well. Because you get six at once, you can replace a pad once the one you're using gets gross and immediately start again with a clean pad. When done, I throw them all in the washing machine and clean/sanitize by using the hottest setting, then dry them. That gives me a clean set to use the next time I want to take care of my floors. It doesn't require a lot of effort to get the grime off possibly due to the texture of these. They seem to scrub as long as the grime has been loosened by spraying with the Swiffer cleaning solution. I will also go over the floors with a spare pad that is soaked in hot water, then wrung out so they are damp but not dripping wet. I don't feel as if the floor is actually clean when there is still a layer of cleaning solution on the floor, even if it's dried. Now that I've discovered these, I don't think I'll be returning to the name brand pads.",

                "reviewText": "These 6 pack reusable mop pads refills for Swiffer Powermop are very effective at picking up the dry and wet dirt and messes.They come shrink wrapped in plastic packaging and before initial use need to be soaked in water for 5-10 minutes as suggested and then dry them to bring to their original thickness. They have a well constructed seams and quality is great. The velcro is also very strong and easily attaches to the Swiffer Powermop head and stay there while in use. No issues of getting loose in the middle of cleaning or any damage to the floors.There are 6 in a pack and that is very handy. You can keep using one by one and when done with last one, throw them in the washer. They come out super clean, like new. You can dry them in dryer if you wish, but I prefer to air dry them.Price is affordable for these reusable mop pads and also a environmentally friendly option.",
