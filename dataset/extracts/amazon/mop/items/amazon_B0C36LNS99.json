While my employer provides a heavy duty mop and bucket, it's just too big for me to pick up and empty, not to mention hauling around a sopping wet mop that gains 30 pounds when wet.This dust mop just changed the game. It's good for spot mopping as well as regular mopping. It has a little comb that lets you scrape off hair and dirt, but also lets the nap stand back up. Turning is easy and it lets me reach under furniture without bending over too far. It works great damp or dry and I can just throw the rug like cloth in the washer to clean.It comes with 2 of those rug type rags, so no need to rip up towels. The comb seems weird until you use it and see that it comes in handy, so don't throw it away.",

                "reviewText": "Before I got this mop, I was cleaning up the floor around the potter's wheel (it always gets splattered with wet mud when I'm making pots) on my hands and knees with a wet sponge. With this mop and a spray bottle of plain water, it's easy to clean up my splatters in just a few minutes. Then the fiber pad detaches easily and can be rinsed in the sink and hung to dry between sessions at the wheel. It could also be washed in the washing machine but I haven't needed to do this yet as it rinses out so well.",
