        "description": "QIPENG Commercial Mop Heads Wet Saddle Mop Head Refill BlueIn traditional string mop construction, coarse strings of cotton yarn are banded at the head for connection to a handle, and the strings hang loose at the tail. This method is now referred to as \"cut-end,\" to contrast with the improved method of looping the strings back to the head, leaving no loose ends to fray. Laundering is not recommended for cut-end mops. Other improvements include tailbanding, which ties the strings together close to the tail to reduce tangling and improve floor coverage.Product featuresWet mop head can be used to mop floors or apply floor finishesMop head weighs approximately 24 oz.4-ply loose twists yarn, made from cotton rayon and synthetic blend fibers, provides the ideal balance of performance, price, and appearance, by combining the advantages of several different fibers, high strength, excellent water absorption & retention, for effective floor drying.
