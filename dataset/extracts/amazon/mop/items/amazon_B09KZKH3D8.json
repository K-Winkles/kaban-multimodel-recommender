                "reviewText": "I bought this mop because it was highly rated, but it's frustrating to use. Issue#1) It's *really* difficult to take the mop head off the handle. You have to stand on the @#$% mop head. It's also hard to snap the mop head on, especially the first few times. Women who don't have much strength in their hands should not buy this mop. Issue#2) SPIN BASKET DOES NOT REMOVE ENOUGH WATER FROM THE MOP!!! It takes more than an hour for the floor to dry after mopping with this system; when using my previous spin mop, the floor was dry in 15 minutes. Yesterday I spun out the mop and hung the mop to dry. 24 hours later, the mop is still quite wet. Issue#3) The spin basket opening is quite small, so water tends to go over the side of the bucket and puddle on the floor. If the mop isn't inserted perfectly into the spin basket, the mop can hang up and be difficult to remove from the basket. Issue#4) Having to constantly set and release the lock on the handle is hard on the thumb. After using the mop a few days, I have stopped using the lock, except to remove the mop head (you have to lock the rod and stand on the mop head to remove it). Issue#5) You *must* put the handle down in order to use the bucket with the mop. Issue#6) Bucket is not very stable if there isn't much water in it, e.g., if you're using the mop to get flood water off the floor.",
