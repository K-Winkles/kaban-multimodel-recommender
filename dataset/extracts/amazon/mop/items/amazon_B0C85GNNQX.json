                "reviewText": "I bought one of these mops about 2 years ago and it started leaking but I couldn't fix it so bought another one because it is so handy. I love that you can use your own cleaning fluid and the mop heads are machine washable. It is not recommended to use thick floor cleaners as I am sure that would clog up the sprayer, but any other liquid cleaner will work. Such a time saver and no batteries to replace as well. Saves cost! Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I used to have the swiffer mop for years but after buying a new one for the third time, because the sprayer stopped working, I got a Libman on sale. But had to buy the pad. Liked that I wasted less money on pads and buying the cleaning solution. But that stopped working after 2 or 3 years. Now I got this blue mop. Got it a couple of month now. Love that it comes with 5 microfiber pads. So I can wash one and still be able to use the next. The dark blue is perfect, the pads are thick, well made. I was worried, using microfiber pads that they dont clean proper, that they would smear. But not at all. Nice and clean moping. See the video. I use Pine disinfectant cleaner. Just a little mixed with with lots of water does the magic. When I want to be picky, I would tell the company, to design the bottle so it stand on its own. That would be a nice touch. Other then that; so far so good, I love this mop, it works great. For the money it's a great deal. I hope it will last me a very long time, but even when it would die in a year, I would buy it again, and give it another try. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I was happy to discover this product! I have an Air BNB beach condo with luxury vinyl plank flooring. The manufacturer recommended routine cleaning of the floor with dish soap and warm water. Not wanting to have to use a mop and bucket to comply with the cleaning instructions, we used a Swiffer. But with frequent rentals, we were tearing through lots of the cleaning solution and the pads. This unit allows you to create your own cleaning solution, or to use whatever flooring cleaner you like, and comes with 5 pads that can be washed in the laundry, and they capture everything from hair, to dust, to dirt and sand. The unit is simple to assemble and use and has great maneuverability under and around furniture. We use this on the LVP as well as our bathroom tile. It is a much more cost-effective alternative to the Swiffer products.",

It\u2019s easy to wash the pads in the machine and so much more economical and environmentally friendly than throw away swifter pads (which I\u2019m not convinced really get your floor clean anyway)I also love that you can use your own natural floor cleaner with this (I use vinegar and water)However after about a month the mop started having issues spraying water. It works sometimes and sometimes I have to mash the button a bunch of times to spray. I just dump some water vinegar on the floor to mop most days.It still works for that purpose so I didn\u2019t return it as it was so reasonably priced I didn\u2019t think it was that big of a deal. If this bothers you you may want to get a more expensive option.",
