                "reviewText": "I have a Libman Freedom mop but I wasn't using it much because the mop pads were not that good at picking up the dirt. They just seemed to push around the pet hair and didn't work very well at scrubbing off sticky spots. Also, they didn't stay on the mop. Consequently, my floor often stayed dirty until I could get around to the traditional messy mop and bucket routine. (See photo with side by side comparison.) These replacement pads are great! They adhere to the mop very well and are thick and plush so they clean all the dirt with one swipe. They are a good deal wider than the mop but this gives them \"flaps\" that work well at wiping off the woodwork as you run the edge along a wall. So that's a bonus! They seem to clean up easily with some detergent in the sink but probably would get cleaner if tossed in the washing machine. I just got them so I haven't tried that yet. I probably wouldn't put them in the dryer though because they appear to contain a layer of foam inside which might dry out and get brittle. They came with a hand written thank you note from the seller which is always a nice touch. I would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to use on our expensive mop that was given to us with only one pad. We recently got rid of most of the carpet in our house. I needed something to use on the floor and only having 1 pad to dry mop and wet mop the floors. I didn't want to spend the $ on the expensive brand refills. These work great for it! When I am done dry mopping, I use a sweeper to get all the dog hair off and then just put in the washer. I have used them several times and washed them several times and then line dry. They are holding up very well. When the time comes, I will buy more but I don't see that happening for a while.! Great replacement! Easy to clean! I am really happy with these!",

The pads have a thin layer of foam inside (I cut them in half because they were substantially wider than my mop head) so they make good contact with the floor. The pads have stripes that are different depths to make a good scrubing surface. I will purchase these again.",
