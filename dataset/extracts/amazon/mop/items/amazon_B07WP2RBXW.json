                "reviewText": "Believe it or not I spent quite a bit of time researching mops on Amazon before choosing this one. My motivation? Really grew to dislike buying mops at the grocery store that seem to last only a year or so before the plastic sponge holder breaks. I have been using sponge-head mops for years and was about to buy one of the newer pad-style mops when I came across this one. I was glad because I'm not really sure I'm on board with the pad-style mops. I've been using this for almost six months now.This mop fits the bill for many of the features I wanted:Quality materials - I'm a guy and this mop doesn't disappoint here. Feels quite sturdy and well-made. HINT - one thing I've learned is to change my use of bleach. I used to use a weak bleach solution on my linoleum floor because I found bleach allowed me to get a lot more mileage out of my sponges (I'm guessing because bleach killed bacteria that would otherwise grow in the damp sponge and break it down). What I forgot to consider is that dunking a mop into a bleach solution would eventually cause corrosion where the steel handle met the plastic sponge holder. At some point if the plastic holder didn't give out first, the handle would eventually break at that corroded point. This company rightly warns to avoid using bleach, but what I've done is switch to dish soap for the linoleum floor and I still hit the sponge with a weak bleach solution after each mopping session to extend the life of the sponge. I make sure to rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove the bleach residue from the sponge and plastic rollers that serve to squeeze excess water from the sponge. This way I kind of get the best of both worlds.Height-adjustable - I'm 6' 2\" and it's really nice to be able to extend this thing out to the max so I'm not bent over at all during use. The grocery store mops (at least in my area) NEVER have this feature.Wringing mechanism - Again, quality materials here. Very easy to wring and no worries I'm going to break the plastic sponge holder using brute force like with the clamshell-style sponge mops I've used for years. Also, the handle for the wringer is located higher up on the mop handle so it's less awkward wringing the mop.Squeegee/brush attachment - I haven't used it much in practice and I actually keep it off the mop because I hang the it on a wall in a high traffic area and it sticks out too much with the attachment (but I would keep it on otherwise). For me, the squeegee in particular is a nice option to have.I had no problem assembling this and the instructions were fairly clear as I recall, but I'm also pretty handy and I could see some people having some trouble with assembly. Overall, I am really happy with this mop. I bought with 3 sponges and don't foresee needing any more for quite some time even with weekly use. The only thing I like a bit less about this mop is the sponges themselves are a more open-celled type than I typically used in the past. I have to wring the sponge more than once or it applies more water than I prefer. I think this is necessary because the roller-style wringing mechanism likely would not work as well with a denser sponge. My only other concern is how long I'll be able to get sponge refills because I think this mop is going to last for some years. That's a good problem to have in my book.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this mop 4 times, at first it was great, but now I can't get the extension pole to come out so my mop is permanently stuck in the shortest setting. When I go to try and unscrew to pull the extension pole out, it just turns and turns and turns, but won't let me pull the pole out any further. So basically this mop is useless because I can't mop my floors when the mop only comes up to my hips. Of course I am out of the return window, and I don't see an option to contact the seller. I've looked. I was really excited to buy this mop, but there goes $20 down the drain. Extremely disappointed!**** After I posted my review, the company reached out to me and sent me another mop, I am updating my review to five stars because of the great customer service. I really respect a business that strives to make their customers happy and go that extra mile!",

Non che avessi grandi aspettative, alla fine \u00e8 una specie di mocio, ma rispetto a quest'ultimo porta in giro molti meno Peretti e sporcizia. In pochi minuti ho pulito i pavimenti e sono rimasta soddisfatta. Bisogna solo usare detersivi non tanto schiumosi perch\u00e9 la spugna strizzandola tende a fare schiuma.",
