                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a wonderful little cleaner and can effectively clean dirt, dust and even some deeper cleaning. What is wonderful about this kit is the fact that you can effectively clean at different angles with the pads. You can easily remove dust and dirt from the corners of your windows and effectively clean the inside frame of the window with this unit with its 360-degree rotating design of the head. You can effectively clean under those kitchen cabinets and above them with this unit. This is why this unit can give a deeper cleaning for your home. It can effectively clean all the dirt and dust around the door frames and can remove all the dirt from the corners of the walls and corners of the floors with its 90 percent panel folding of the head. Effectively clean the walls and with its adjustable poles that can be adjusted at several lengths it makes it easy to remove dirt and dust from tables, chairs, and other furniture. The unit has a secure strong fit to the head that screws in, so you do not have to worry about it falling off while dusting like other units I\u2019ve delt with. Also, the pads have a strong secure hold to the head of the unit. The poles are strong and connect to each other with a strong secure hold. With this unit you can effectively clean under the beds, under tables and sofas. Its triangular design makes it easier for cleaning all corners effectively. The head also comes with a squeegee on the head of the unit to remove water from shower doors and walls. You get three microfiber superior pads which are durable these do not need to be replaced often as regular pads and they can effectively get rid of bacteria three times as much as regular pads. These pads can be used over and over because they are plush and durable, and they will not scratch or scuff any furniture because of their incredible softness. You get three Chenille pads that are soft and luxurious feel and will maintain its quality for a long time These are great for pets' hair, dirt, dust and other small and large particles and effectively clean floors, walls, ceilings, windows and baseboards and other surfaces with little effort with a significant impact. They can effectively allow you to reach tight spaces and corners with ease. Microfiber pads can withstand a lot of washing in the wash machine, but it is not recommended to wash with other fabrics as this could damage the fibers and leave lint on them. but for Chenille pads I would recommend hand washing them. The fiber might be destroyed in washing machines.",

                "reviewText": "I had recently been looking at my walls and ceilings. I was horrified. I have an African Grey parrot and he produces a lot of feather dust. White feather dust that floats through the air and covers everything. I was remembering how my Mom would frequently clean the walls and ceilings. It was depressing to look at my walls and ceilings. It wasn't only the feather dust., it was also the dust everyone has to deal with. I knew I had to do something and even considered hiring someone to do it for me. Then I saw this.Oh how much I love this! I have serious back and shoulder issues so I can't do everything I need or want to do anymore. This is like a godsend. I just recently received this so I haven't been able to do but a few rooms but I've done enough to show me how valuable this tool is and what a difference it is going to make for me. With the permanent back and shoulder injuries I sustained I can't reach high up but for a short time. Some days not at all. With this wonder tool I can reach areas that I could never have reached before. The pole extends up to 82\" and is lightweight even for me.I remember when I use to bend over or get on my hands and knees and wipe down the baseboards. I can no longer do that. Now I can finally clean these areas. I can get behind pieces of furniture that I couldn't before. I had actually recently checked into getting a maid service. Got prices and everything. No way could I afford that on Social Security.This is going to be one of my favorite cleaning tools that I own, that I have ever owned. I've only used the chenille pads so far. I love that I can wash them. The microfiber pads as well as the length of the pole will be so useful cleaning the tiled floor under his cage. Wish when I bought the cage 20 years ago I thought to get one with wheels. This is like it was designed with people like me in mind, old (68) and physically disabled. It's offered at an amazing low price. You will not regret ordering one.",

The combination worked wonders, and the mop type thing was very affective at cleaning any spots the uv light showed",
