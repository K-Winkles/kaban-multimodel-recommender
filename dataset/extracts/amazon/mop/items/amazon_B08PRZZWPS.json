It\u2019s super easy to put together and take apart. The bottle is a good size. I like that there was extra mop pads and that they can be washed. The mop pads cleaned my floor very well. I have children who of course make messes and it was no trouble at all to clean up. Even the kids can use it to help out. Definitely recommend this mop!",

Cleans very well. Covers a large area at one time which cuts cleaning time down. Spray bottle is much bigger than others I have bought. Feels very sturdy. Super easy to use. Nice long handle so back doesn't break. JUST DO IT! Oh, and the price is GREAT!Update: Been using daily for a week and STILL IN LOVE! My fave mop I have ever had so far. Have washed the pads and they came out of the wash perfectly.",

When you put it together, you must be sure to line up the inner rod perfectly and lock it in place. That\u2019s what makes it work correctly.Very easy to put together, love the quality of the pads and the fact that they are washable, large capacity water bottle that is very easy access. I use hot water and vinegar on my floors and bottle retained hot for a long time.Do not hesitate to buy this mop for quick cleanups and maintenance. Well worth the $20 all day!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As a cleaning fanatic, I absolutely love this product. I got this as something quick, since I usually use the big mops, and I got tired lugging it up the stairs to clean one room. I have used Swifters before, but didn't like the cleaning products used and preferred using my own. After researching all the types, I decided to go with this one and I'm glad I did. I am 5'5\" and it's a perfect size for me, although taller people might have a problem. I like the various pads it comes with, and the hair removal piece. It doesn't streak for me, and is great at cleaning my floors caked with mud from my dogs. I wash the pads after using it twice. The size of the holder is a bit small, but it typically lasts me two uses on my downstairs (3 rooms) and the upstairs bathroom. My only complaint is that the washable heads aren't the best quality and after one wash, the material started to frey at the ends.Pros:-Great price-Can use your own cleaning product-Skinny to get under tables and couches easily-Doesn't streak on my floors-Great size pads for quick mopping-Washable mop pads-Tall enough for me (I am 5'5\")-Lightweight, but powerful enough to clean up mud on floorsCons:-Need to vaccuum beforehand or else the mops will leave behind dust/hair on floor-Mop pads not best quality and after one wash started to frey at the ends-Larger areas may need to fill up the container a few times...I only needed to wash 3 tiny rooms and one container lasts me",
