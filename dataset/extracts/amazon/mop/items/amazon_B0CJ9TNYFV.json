It did not come with any sort of instructions or information on how to assemble it so there's a bit of guess work and hoping for the best involved. The picture and description gave the impression that the dirty water and the \"clean-ish\" start separate but they don't. At all. So you end up just kinda smearing dirt back all over your floor unless you're gonna make multiple trips to your water source. And speaking of the picture, if all this isn't enough, the item I received is not the same item in the picture. It's similar but not the same. Terribly misleading.",

                "reviewText": "This mop/bucket set looked appealing for its compact size and the idea of being able to squeegee the dirty water from the mop pad directly into the bucket.The idea is still a good one, but there are design flaws that make it quite awkward to use.The mop itself is a swiffer-type design. It comes with two reusable pads that attach with a slide-on then Velcro attachment. It won\u2019t scrub, but it is fine for quick, light mopping.The problem arises when you try to use the bucket. The mop head must fold completely flat to be inserted into the bucket, and that only works in one direction. If you insert it without folding it in the right direction (almost flat but not quite) the mop head catches on the inside and gets stuck. You then have to remove the lid, turn the mop, fold it the other way, and then you can remove it from the lid of the bucket.Sound confusing and awkward. Yeah. It really is.I don\u2019t think they should give up on this idea, but as it is- it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.",

Significantly smaller than you\u2019d imagine, and does not look like the one pictured by any means. I\u2019m waiting to use this since I now need a replacement. Hoping I\u2019m not waiting for no reason and this doesn\u2019t even work.",
