The mopheads are very sturdy and wash very well. I use one mop head to dust all my doors in my house, use another one to mop my kitchen and dining room floor, use another one to dust high, hard-to-reach places, And one mop head to wash walls with. The price for all of these mop heads and the base is an incredible deal! I will order them again when I need replacement heads. Id post a phito, but Amazon wants access to all my photos in order to post a photo and i wont do that.",
