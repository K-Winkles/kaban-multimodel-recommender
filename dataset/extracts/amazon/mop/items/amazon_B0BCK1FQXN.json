This replacement handle setup fits perfectly, of course, and even allows several different length options...I prefer the full length. I highly recommend this extension handle replacement for the spin mop!",

The picture doesn\u2019t really show much but I can tell you that they are different sizes and when I tried replacing it, the handle just spins and spins and never catches the thread so I have to return it. What a disappointment.",
