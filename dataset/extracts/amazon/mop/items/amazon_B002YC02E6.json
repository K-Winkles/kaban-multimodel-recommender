As a consequence, there was some crush damage. I am not returning it because I was able to replace the damaged part withone salvaged from the old mop. Amazon does not seem to have a quick and easy to way just complain but not actually request a newone or a refund. So I am writing a review instead.",

Because the sponge is so firm it\u2019s easier to get into corners to clean The mop it is designed for has a holder for the scrubber which other mops won\u2019t have. I\u2019m so pleased with it I bought two extra refills.",
