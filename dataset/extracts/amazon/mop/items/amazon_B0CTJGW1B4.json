I saw a girl on TikTok use this and immediately bought it! It\u2019s amazing! I love giving my floors a good scrubbing once a month to really get the filth and dirt off. This brush does such a great job at getting everything up. If you look close enough you can see the darkness of the originally white suds.Definitely worth it, and the price just made it that much better! It\u2019s so nice to have everything all in one and not have to switch it between tools.",
