Also I hate touching the dirty mop head. This mop set is amazing. I just received my set today. I have a big house with both dark cherry color hard wood floors and tile floor in the kitchen. I moped the first floor in no time. After you are done there is a valve you just pull it and the water just pours easily. It has vacuum suction underneath it so it doesn\u2019t flip. And it is very slim. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of space when you don\u2019t using it. It was an amazing experience. I already recommended it my friends.",

I think it's a bit overpriced as far as quality.My two main negative issues is that this mop was sent to someone else, returned, and repackaged. The small box inside the big box has someone else's name and address on it, so I wasn't the first person to buy this mop. I paid $50 for a mop that is a return item when it should have been new.The other issue was the lack of assembly instructions. I had to watch videos about how to put this thing together. There is a trick to putting the mop head on the mop properly so it will work, and without knowing that, this product would be useless.This mop is lightweight and easy to use otherwise.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a mop that will reduce pushing dirt around and just using dirty water to clean. I was sold on this after watching the review videos and them showing using one side for dirty water and one side for soapy water.It was very easy to assemble and even though instructions weren\u2019t included. I filled one side with hot water (to clean the mop which would be the dirty side) and one side with hot soapy water. I also placed the combo scrubber on the dirty water side to help clean the mopping pad.It is a very large pad but not too large you can\u2019t control the scrub. The dual sides worked perfectly. My dirty water and the scrubber kept all the dirt out of the soapy water.The drain plug on the back was sturdy and stayed in place. I did the paper towel test after cleaning in a very high traffic area and there was still some dirt however the floors look clean and I have 3 dogs and 2 kids so a little dirt is part of life but this mop bucket combo I think will help me keep up with cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "I like another person did not use right away, bucket to heavy after filled in laundry room sink to lift, 1st fail. The mop bucket and squeegees does not work properly, 2nd fail. The bucket does not suction well to my tile as it has a texture and not like glass surface, 3rd fail. Without and directions or diagrams I did not know mop pads have to be attached on both ends not just on the Velcro, 4th fail. This product is a waste of time an money, it lands in my pile of stuff to throw away\u2026...I do not know why the seller reading these negative reviews does not respond to them here",

                "reviewText": "This would have been the perfect mop for me as my house if not the biggest. I had the perfect spot in my bathroom between my sink and toilet for it to go. I wanted to keep at least the clean water in the bucket at all times, while only draining the dirty water after each use. Well that was short lived as I noticed one day there wasn't ANY water in the clean side and I had a huge mess now on the floor. I was confused...Wasn't no way that it leaked. It's BRAND NEW. So I tried it again, left the clean water side half full. An hour later, water started pooling on the floor again. The leak isn't THAT bad, but you sure can't leave it in the bucket after use. I started placing the bucket in the tub from now on to prevent any future leaks while it's drying after use. Overall, I love the mop. Just wish I could get a new bucket...",

                "reviewText": "This works just as well as a swifer without needing to constantly change the cloth! It doesn\u2019t have instructions but it\u2019s so easy to set up that it doesn\u2019t need it, took me less than 3 minutes to set up. Been using it close to a month now and there are no signs of it breaking. Also super easy to clean once you\u2019re done. (Fyi, when pulling the plug to empty the water, the current will be strong)",
