YES.. air dry on a dollar tree, flimsy, over the door, \u201changing thingy.\u201dBit of advice, don\u2019t clean your mop heads with bleach.. it will give them ( and any mop) a mildew smell.. if I need to soak mine, I use boiling water from my electric kettle IN my CLEAN mop bucket with oxi-clean! Works like a charm!Also, these mop heads are for the ORIGINAL O\u2019Cedar mop head. The new style has a smaller mop head than the original ( in case you were wondering this difference)Hope my review helps!Disclaimer: No, I wasn\u2019t paid, bribed, or given anything FREE for my honest review AND helpful tips!",
