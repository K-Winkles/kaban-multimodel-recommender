                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Swiffer alternative! Also - solution to a common complaint",
                "reviewText": "Before I get to my review I have a solution to one of the complaints I saw in the reviews. Some people say that the bottle leaks when stored. I haven't experienced that however when I'm done mopping, I simply remove the bottle (which is super easy) and store it upright next to the mop on a shelf. No opportunity for leaks that way!I never thought I would actually like a mop/floor cleaner so much. Here's what I love about it:* Environmentally friendly - no plastic bottles or pads to end up in the garbage. Also there's no battery (none needed!). You can use an environmentally-safe cleaning solution of your choice.* Cost-effective - costs about the same as a Swiffer, but no need to purchase expensive bottles of cleaner or single-use pads.* Easy to clean - simply remove the microfiber pad and rinse; or you can toss it in the washer (though I would air-dry it)* Pet-friendly, kid-friendly, non-allergenic - because you can use whatever cleaning solution you like - vinegar & water or any commercially-available pet-friendly/non-allergenic retail cleaning solution. I personally love Mrs. Meyers' Lavender cleaner.* Easy to use - Same basic concept as Swiffer, but the handle is more ergonomic. It's kind of like a regular spray bottle's sprayer, and there's no need for a motor or batteries. The spray comes out fully and evenly. This mop is also much lighter than Swiffer and glides across the floor easily.*It's also very easy to store, takes up about the same room as Swiffer would, but you don't need to also store extra bottles of cleaner or boxes of pads.I have a small apartment and one pad is plenty for me, but if you have a larger home and/or pets/kids that dirty the floor a lot then I'd recommend getting an extra 1-2 pads so you can switch them out. However you could always just rinse the pad to clean, and then reuse it midway through as well.So if you haven't made your mind up yet, what are you waiting for? Get this mop now! It's amazing!",

                "reviewText": "Nice product. Well-built with one significant exception: the cleaning solution bottle. The mop cleans well and it\u2019s pretty easy to clean the mop head.We got this to clean our hardwood floors. The thinking was we didn\u2019t want to carry around a big bucket and didn\u2019t want to soak the floors with dirty water. This offered us the ability to add our special (probably overpriced) wood cleaning solution to the water.Mopping our 1,300(ish) sq ft downstairs with this is a breeze. It won\u2019t make mopping fun, but it\u2019s easy.There is one not-so-small nit, which I referenced above. The water bottle that feeds the sprayer is really leaky. Fortunately, it\u2019s easy to clean the leaks. . .because this is a mop. But it\u2019s a design flaw and a pain. It makes using the product more difficult than it should be.Pro tip: add the cleaning solution after you add the water to the bottle and mix very gently. If you can avoid a lot of bubbles (and therefore, pressure) it reduces\u2014but certainly does not eliminate\u2014the leaks.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mop! My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner! I had been using the old style sponge squeeze mob on our semi-gloss porcelain tiles for years, that left a horrible looking dull residue and pushed dirty water into the light colored grout. This OXO mop is so light-weight, quick and easy to use...just spray and wipe and my tiles look great! No more hauling around icky buckets of dirty water, back aches or dull residue on our tiles! So far I've been hand washing the removable cleaning cloth with dish detergent but will probably throw it in the washer one of these days to give it a more thorough cleaning. The only thing I need to be careful of is to watch where the spray goes so I don't spray it on our wood furniture but I'm sure I'll eventually get used to that and compensate accordingly. I also like that they provided a recipe for a cleaning fluid that you can mix up yourself using just water along with a bit of dish detergent and vinegar since our tile manufacturer advised against using strong chemical cleaners on our tile. I would definitely recommend this spray mop, even though it is a bit more expensive than the others, since when I was doing my research I noticed it got the best reviews and now they can add mine to them!",

The second purchase was for my daughter in her dorm room. It's not a deep cleaning mop, but a great everyday mop. I also like the fact that you can use any product in the spray bottle.",

                "reviewText": "What a cleverly and carefully designed mop. Best on the market. They must have patents on this as don't think its been copied.DID NOT BEND BACK ONCE IN USING THIS GEM ON A FILTHY FLOOR WITH ENCRUSTED DRIED ON DIRT. PROS:1. The mop heads are sturdy and either padded or foam filled, but not too thick so can fit under tight spaces. Also are a little smaller than base so can give good softer clean along edges.2. Mop heads fix to base by simply throwing head on floor with cleaning side on floor, then place base onto mop head.3. Light plastic liquid container is easily removed, filled, returned. How great to avoid those noxious prefilled pads.4. Floor needed some dried on sticky stuff removed. With gentle foot tap of a lever scrubbing pad slipped out. Sprayed are with cleaning liquid and scrubbed. After use scrubber is easily slipped back into its housing and hidden away.5. Mopped floor, spraying areas with cleaning liquid when needed. Peeled off mop head and attached clean one, mopping up with clean water as desired. Mop heads I thow in washing machine. They cost about same as about a dozen disposal wipe. sSeems most friends don't bother with the pure water mop but I'm lazy and think the water clean off of any residual detergent results in extension of time between mops. I go days without mopping... Well more than days sometimes, dirty me.I am so happy to have found this gem that does away with both the need for those wipes that all give off sents that irritate my lungs a nd also the need for a bucket and mop.. Even a bucket with wringing/centrifuging action is a lot of work/storage. And spray mops with the water in their poles are not as well weighted.CONS: None I can see or think of., I'll amend here if any come upI paid full price for mop and spare head and scrubber. Now I've used can see the spares are not necessary.I have no connection with this company. JUST LOVE TO SEE GOOD THINKING DESIGN. THANKS OXO.",
