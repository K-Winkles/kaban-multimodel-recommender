The colors are bright and fun. We only used them on dry floors and they definitely worked to pick up dust, etc. This is not a sturdy, long term item as they start falling apart after wearing a few times. Also, they\u2019re not big enough for men.At less than $4 a pair, I recommend for light cleaning to wear around house & as a fun item for house guests, stocking stuffer,etc.",

Didn't happen.HOWEVER, today in a fit of inspiration, I sprayed some cleaner on my tile floor, then had a mini dance party on it. It looks better than it has in years!! I had to change pairs a few times, because my floor was so dirty I started leaving muddy streaks (don't judge, I've got 3 dogs and a cat...), but it looks fantastic now, and the slippers are ready to be popped in the washing machine for Round 2 in a couple weeks.My arms don't ache from mopping, and I don't have any obnoxiously heavy buckets to drag around. Even better, the nubbins on the slippers dig into all those minutely textured sections of the tile, while my mop does not.I now feel thoroughly pleased with this ostensibly silly purchase, and will buy more (maybe higher quality ones) when these pairs inevitably fall apart. They aren't necessarily great craftsmanship, but they do their job and do it well. Worth it!!",
