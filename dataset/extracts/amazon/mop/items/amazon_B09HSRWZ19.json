There are hundreds (or more) of different generic brands of this type of mop\u2026some with round heads and some with square (like this one). The best feature of these mops is having the dirty and clean water separate \u2026 I\u2019ve always used 2 buckets \ud83e\udea3 to mop because I just can\u2019t stand the thought of mopping with dirty water \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udd22 (I\u2019m a tad OCD). I feel as though I have to be a bit careful with this mop/mop head..it feels like it could easily break (but hasn\u2019t so far). The outlet for the dirty water is small and hard at first to pull out\u2026the more you do it the easier it gets as it loosens just a tad. The hole where you add the clean water is small\u2026really small, so that\u2019s kind of a pain \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Since I feel like I have to be a bit careful with it, I haven\u2019t really been able to put some elbow grease in it, but since the mop head is flat and soft with almost no texture, you\u2019ll want to be sure to use a good cleaning solution and really warm (or hot) water for it to be effective at getting up dried on or sticky stuff. It does work really well for walls, too\u2026which sounds funny, but you\u2019d be amazed at how much cleaner and fresher smelling a room is just by \u2018mopping\u2019 the walls, especially when you\u2019re using a cleaner that smells good.I\u2019ve tried several versions of this type of mop, and this is the only one I actually kept. You get one extra pad\u2026wish it was more, but they\u2019re washable.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

It's light even when full of water, which is great for me because I have chronic back pain & other physical issues. Even mopping, my back didn't hurt, which it usually did because of how heavy other mops would be with water.VERY easy to use, and it all stores inside the bucket when the handle is disassembled, which saves a ton of room!Floors dry so much faster, and get so much cleaner with LESS effort. You don't have to buy special cleaners, which is another plus. It came with 2 mop pads, which are machine washable, and are good for up to 100 washes in the laundry according to the box.I've already recommended this mop system to my parents, and friends. I won't ever buy another sponge mop again! I actually enjoy cleaning my floors now.",

                "reviewText": "So like everyone else I was super curious about this mop because of TikTok. It\u2019s a good mop but there is some room for improvements.1. I like that it\u2019s a pad instead of a mop head. It doesn\u2019t get hair all tangled in it. It also has a brush that when you spin to clean the mop and get water the brush will take off any hair or dust trapped on the mop pad. I like that feature a lot.2. To drain it not as easy as it should be. There is this small hole with a plastic plug that you need to pull and pull hard in order to take it out. If you\u2019re clumsy like me this might end up getting you to spill some of the dirty mop water. Where the dirty water goes to is separated in one corner because of the mechanism of where you put the water into. This lead to have to continuously swivel the bucket around trying to get the water back to the side where the drain plug is.3. The hole to put water into is pretty small. That leaves room for spilling the water and cleaning products as you\u2019re loading it into there. Good thing is you\u2019re moping anyways so it\u2019s a quick mess to clean up.",

It's so easy to use, uses very little water, the floors dry so quickly. It solves so many of the problems that I've had with other mops. I have ADHD, so the executive functioning required for most other mops is so high. This one I squirt a bit of cleaner in the hole, take it to the sink to put in some water, dampen the pad, give it a few spins to get cleaner on it, and then I'm off! I even used it without sweeping or vacuuming last time, and I had to be careful not to leave cat fur behind, but it picks up the fur very well! Then at the end, a few rinses, dump and rinse the bucket, and I've been washing the pads by hand to extend the life, but love that they are machine washable!",

                "reviewText": "A week ago I would have given this mop 5 stars\u2026 my floors have never been cleaner and it\u2019s so easy to use and I love the two filter system with the brush to get off the dirt you missed while sweeping. I\u2019ve only used it a handful amount of times, and the latest time a part on the handle randomly broke off. I contacted the manufacturer (True and Tidy) under warranty and they said they had a marketing program happening where they would replace the broken part and send me an extra mop head if I gave them a five star review. I thought why not might as well get an extra mop head so I did as much they then contacted me to say that I had to pay the shipping and duty fees on the replacement part and it was gonna be $25 but they would split it with me. After paying $100 a month ago for this mop, brand new and only used a handful amount of times, I thought that was ridiculous to bribe someone into thinking that if they gave this product a good review they would replace it (which is required under warranty) but also give them a bonus. I said I am not paying $12 for something that should be covered fully under warranty and now they won\u2019t respond to my emails. I am now returning the entire mop to Amazon and getting a whole new one but I was trying to help the environment by just getting their replacement part and saving the company money because it is a good product. Now my old mop is going in a land fill when they could have just sent me a tiny replacement part. Lesson learned, next time I\u2019ll just go straight to Amazon. The mop works great but the quality of it sucks. I\u2019m hoping this one lasts longer than a month.",
