                "reviewText": "Great mop head. Rinses fast and rings out easily, it's really light weight and dries fast. It takes fewer strokes to get the job done and hugs the floor picking up dirt and debris along the way. I use it with a commercial dual mop bucket from Rubbermaid and it fits into the ringer perfectly (less ringing too). The head band is pretty thick so it's a bit of a chore getting it into the 'side gate' type Rubbermaid mop handle. I'm a petite person and I hate struggling with a dirty, wet mop head so I ordered a 'gripper' mop handle and I think that will make changing out these heads much easier for me than it was with the side gate type. The tube design is perfect, it doesn't hang up on furniture legs, roller feet on office chairs or shelving, like the string mops do. It is washer machine friendly and comes out looking like new. This is a medium mop and it preforms well in average size areas, like for household use. If you need to cover a lot of space you may want to get the larger size.",
