                "reviewText": "This is the mop of all mops! First, it was incredibly easy to assemble. Simply twist the poles together and the handle is complete. The mop head binds in the middle on the padding, and you place into the red piece at the end of the mop then twist the red handle to tighten. Crazy easy! The mop heads are super thick and high quality. Easy to wring out. They cover a good size area while mopping. I love that they are washable, and you get two so you can rotate while washing/drying. The handle is super long, but if you don't want it quite so long it's easy to remove one piece to shorten it. I personally LOVE the length. It makes it very easy to mop under things. I highly recommend this mop.",
