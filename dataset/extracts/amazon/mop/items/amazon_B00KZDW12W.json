They are perfect for washing delicate glassware or glasses that your hand will not fit into. I can't understand why these are not more available in the US. They would be perfect for bartenders or anyone needing to wash a lot of glassware fast, when they can't be put into a dishwasher. Maybe because of sanitary issues? Just put it in a small glass of vodka when not in use. Very happy to have found these here. Thank you.",
