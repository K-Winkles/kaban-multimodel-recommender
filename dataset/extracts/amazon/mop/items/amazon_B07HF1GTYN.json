Perfect to wear while you clean - but I wear my all the time in the house. Throw them in the wash with the towels - good as new! They stay on easily and are not too tight.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to wear as shoe covers on my new laminate floor. Transitioning from carpet to hard surface floors has been hard on my feet ;) so I like to wear my athletic shoes when I\u2019m on feet a lot or cleaning. I thought it would be great to pick up a little dust at the same time. Here\u2019s my thoughts:1. These don\u2019t really pick up dirt with normal walking on a dry floor. They do keep you from tracking it around with your shoes.2. They are Amazing when wet mopping because they help dry the floor if you kinda shuffle while mopping. Laminate floors are sensitive to water so this is great!!! They end up dirty on the bottom by the time I\u2019m done, so they must be picking up any dirt the microfiber mop left behind.3. They\u2019re kinda small but stretchy. I wear an 8.5 and these barely fit over my shoes. I\u2019ve worn them with bare feet but they put pressure on my big toe kinda like pantyhose do with dress shoes. Also the nubs feel a little weird to walk on.If you have women\u2019s size 8.5 or smaller these should work for you! I will try to update my review to include their durability once they\u2019ve been through the wash a few times :)",

Still, since they come in a pack of 5 pairs, thats convenient and they're easy to wash. Im glad i bought them. I just think there should be a better deaigned version out there.",

I saw these and thought they\u2019d be a perfect gag gift for Mother\u2019s Day, and I was right. She absolutely loves them. They are too small to fit on my large feet, but they fit her perfectly. They really do collect a lot of dust when just walking around in them as well. They are the highest quality, but they get the job done and in a bunch of fun colors. Worth the money!",
