                "reviewText": "We got these mop pad replacements to supplement the pads with our Bona hard wood floor mop. They work very similarly to those microfiber pads. We spray the floor with Bona wood cleaning solution, then mop over it.The pads stick to the hook and loop underside of the mop head with no issues. The only difference other than the color (purple versus blue) to the Bona brand pads that we have on hand is that these are slightly smaller than those pads by an inch or so lengthwise. It doesn't affect how it attaches to the mop head and doesn't really affect performance, other than it covers a slightly smaller surface area when mopping the floor. It's not significant enough for us to make a difference though.If you like the price, go for it. It's worked well for us so far. I can't comment on longevity though, but I would guess that these will last as long as the name brand pads.",

The pads are slightly larger than the Swiffer itself but I am not complaining. Removing is as easy as just pulling it off. I found that mopping, I use two of the pads so I can do two rounds of mopping and then I can pre rinse them before I throw them in the wash. They're perfect and for the price, I really enjoyed the quality. Highly recommend!",
