                "reviewText": "Let us start with the facts. This thing is tiny. It is so small it looks like something that should come as part of a Barbie toy set. But that's the brilliant part about this. It is not intended to wipe the floor. It is for counters and walls or anywhere that is above waste height that needs cleaning and you don't want your hands touching a messy cloth. Think about it, people. You can wipe the counter where somebody just spilled food grease on without getting your hands greasy! For me, that alone is a major plus for me because I hate food grease on my hands! If you consider this as a hand cloth with a handle you will immediately see a lot of use for this. The fact that the pads are reusable and machine washable make it even more convenient. The squeegee will leave a little liquid behind when it is squeezed, but it's not a deal breaker. I mean, how often do you get all the liquid out of a sponge or a wash cloth when you squeeze or twist it to dry it? I think something like this is something that you could keep in any area where quick cleanups are needed. The Verdict: Definite recommendation. Will it hold up with time? We don't know yet and that will depend on how many large spills, what the spill actually is, and how deeply you want that area cleaned with this thing. But based on my own realistic expectations I believe it will last a fair amount of time.",

                "reviewText": "This mini-mop is pretty nifty!This is a very versatile cleaning tool! You can use it on windows, shower doors, mirrors, countertops, tables, you name it. Oh and of course you could also use it on the floor like an actual mop if you really wanted, but you'd probably need to be crouched down or on your hands and knees in order to use this little guy on the floor, so I'd probably only recommend using this for spot cleaning on the floor, if anything.This has a feature where it can essentially wring the water (or whatever fluid) out of itself, which can come in especially handy if you use this to clean up a spill or something.This lil' mop also even comes with a small cleaning brush that's tucked right inside the handle which is pretty slick, if you ask me. I took a picture of the mop and the cleaning brush together if you'd like to see what either of them looks like.I love that this comes with a couple of washable/reusable microfiber pads. Not only are reusable pads more environmentally friendly than disposable ones, they can also save you money over time.I haven't really found anything that I don't like about this mini-mop so far. I woulddefinitely recommend this product! But just make sure that you're aware of what the is before ordering it.I took a photo of the mop right beside an (empty) 16.9 FL OZ standard sized plastic water bottle to hopefully help people get some perspective for the size of this item.P.S. Ignore the review that's hating, they obviously didn't pay attention to what they were ordering. YES, this is much smaller than a regular mop, but that's kind of the dang point, duh!! I mean, right there in the product's name it literally says that this is a MINI-mop \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I also love this for a quick cleansing of my countertop. My island is pretty big, so this allows me to cut down on energy cleaning, since the arm is nice, and long. Such a great item to keep around for quick cleaning.",

This thing feels like a child's toy. At this ridiculous size, I can't think of anything I could clean/mop with this. I'd rather just use a sponge.Definitely would NOT recommend. It's going right into the recycle bin.",
