Heavy buckets of water sloshed all over your just cleaned floors. And you kept those dirty tools in a closet where no one would see them. It was the turn of the millennium, and we saw an opportunity for change. In 1999, Swiffer pioneered achieving an amazing clean with little effort. It all started with our Trap & Lock Technology. You can see this technology in our Sweeper cloths that attract dirt, dust and hair off the floors. The dirt is trapped on the cloth, eliminating the use of brooms and dustpans.",

I hope they do something about that or the customers will switch to mops of other brands, inspite of this being such great quality.Definitely buy and stock them up if you are looking for these refills and were able to find it here.",
