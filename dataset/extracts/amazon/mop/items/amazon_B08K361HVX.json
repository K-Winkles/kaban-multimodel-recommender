This mop allows me to use whatever cleaning solution I want, and I can leave fluid in the bottle so it\u2019s always ready to go. This is important if you use it often. I was surprised at the quality of the pads. They\u2019re thick and absorbent, easy to place on and remove, and never move no matter how hard you scrub. They also wash out easily even if you wash them by hand. I highly recommend this mop over any of the other replaceable pad type of mops on the market.",

I dont like that the product doesnt snap tightly together. But convient yes this is. Quick clean up yes it is. Easy to clean the pads yes.",

                "reviewText": "It was so easy to put together that my 12 year old boy did it. The pads are thick!!! I did my whole house (we have a ranch that had all wood floors) and I could still use the same pad. The spray is strong when you squeeze the handle. My floors look awesome. Best thing I have ever bought off of Amazon, hands down! It costs prob less than a swifter wet jet. A new Wet jet will run you about 25-28 bucks, PLUS cost for pads, PLUS cost for solution, PLUS cost of batteries. SO...this is a steal...and a GEM!!! LOVE IT!!!!",

Compr\u00e9 esta mopa pensando justo en eso y la verdad qued\u00e9 s\u00faper complacida porque el movimiento que tengo que hacer es \u00fanicamente hacia adelante y hacia atr\u00e1s y eso es genial. Adem\u00e1s, no tengo que estar yendo y viniendo a cambiar el agua para secar. Como la cantidad de agua que sale por el rociador es mucho menor a la que deja un mop tradicional de hebras, pues se seca muy r\u00e1pido. La almohadilla de microfibra es muy ancha as\u00ed que puedes limpiar un \u00e1rea mucho m\u00e1s grande. Pude terminar de limpiar la casa como en un cuarto del tiempo que hubiera necesitado con la mopa tradicional. \u00a1S\u00faper recomendable!",
