But most importantly the mop because of how many little bar pieces it has to extend or shorten it (and honestly it's still so short my 16 year old, under 5' daughter complains that she has to bend over half way to accomplish anything.) Because of how the handle goes together the pieces pinch when you're mopping, they pinched so bad that the first time I used it it made me bleed. This was with my hand on the \"handle\" portion of the mop. Definitely do not recommend.",

                "reviewText": "When I got the mop and bucket package it didn't appeared to be sealed properly though it was sealed. Before I even opened it, it appeared I might have received a previous purchased item? It appeared that way. As I opened it the way it was packaged it again appeared like it was sealed like a brand new item? It had smudges on the bucket like it had been handled and the plastic packaging was all cut open? I find it hard to believe it would have came from the factory packed as it was. I took it out but I didn't assemble the mop or anything because I was shocked how cheap thin plastic the buck device was and so many complicated moving parts. The mop handle was suck skinny think piping, not sturdy at all, that I didn't even bother to assemble the mop. The instructions were picture like diagrams with very little word instructions to go along with it. I just couldn't accept this merchandise. The only thing that looked good about it was the 4 pads and even they weren't in a sealed bag, just thrown in there. I repackaged everything and I sealed the plastic bags and I really sealed off the box opening, where it wasn't done like it should have been coming from a manufacture. I didn't feel I was getting a new product, never touched by a purchasers hands before me. I refuse to pay that much money for items that aren't brand new from the manufacturer and what manufacturer would ship their merchandise so unprotected including the box openings? Somebody had opened this box and examined the merchandise before I got it and it was lucky things hadn't fallen out of the box before I got it. Based on how cheaply the bucket and mop were made it wasn't worth my money or time to see if it worked. I felt it better to return it not using any of it at all. The problem with online purchasing is that you don't know what you are getting before you get it. This is why there are so many returned items to online stores. Amazon is nice because they have never failed me for returned items. This is why I have a Prime membership and have the confidence I can return items that aren't up to expectations. This product has good reviews. It might have been good for me but I just couldn't deal with how the boxing and item appeared after I got it. It looked too fragile and might break after the 30 days? I just couldn't deal with it. It might be a really good mop and bucket system? I will never know. If I had seen it in a brick&mortar store I wouldn't have bought it, especially for the price. It just looked like and felt like cheap merchandise made in China.",

                "reviewText": "The idea of this mop is very good. It has the same issue that all the other mops like this have. It has three little plastic tabs that fit into pockets on the pad. Over time these plastic tabs bend and the pads do not stay in place. This causes the pad not to slide into the bucket, making the whole mop useless. If you could buy replacement head or even the red plastic part that the pad's connect to it would be an easy fix to make the mop usable again. I was hoping this version was better but it is not.",
