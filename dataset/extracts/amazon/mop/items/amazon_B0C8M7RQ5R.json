                "reviewText": "We had a family member at one time who smoked cigarettes on the porch attached to house. Smoke crept into the house turning white ceiling & walls light brown. We needed something that did not require a ladder. This worked so perfectly in corners, along top edges of cabinets. We are beyond thrilled. Also took around and dusted some walls & got corner cobwebs we could not reach. The extra length provided is great, along with the pads. We are seniors and this was a gem of a product. We sprayed some cleaner on one of the pads & just kept spraying on without even using any water. Very, very happy with this product.",
