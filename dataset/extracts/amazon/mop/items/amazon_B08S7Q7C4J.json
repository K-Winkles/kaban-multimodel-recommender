                "reviewText": "This mop was very easy to use and it does the trick. I have hardwood and tile floors and two small dogs who track a lot of stuff into the house. I like that it came with three mop heads so I can use them in different rooms (kitchen, foyer and baths) and then toss them into the washer and air dry them. The spin mechanism works well and spins most of the moisture out of the mop after using. The mop heads wash up well and are easily reusable. The mop also works well in the tub and tile of the shower and at the base of toilet to clean those areas without stretching or bending down. I also used it to wipe down the baseboards which tend to collect dust and fur in my house. This just whisks it away and leaves everything clean and almost sry. Highly recommend. I actually bought more mop heads on Amazon to use so I\u2019ve always got clean spares in case I need them! Highly recommend this item for anyone!",
