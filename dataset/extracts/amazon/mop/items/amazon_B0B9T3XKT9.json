                "reviewText": "I love this mop! The pads are velcroed to the mop for easy removal and reapplication. And since the pads are machine washable, I just throw them all in the washer. No messy wringing. I love that SIX pads are included, because it takes 2-3 pads to clean my floors. I throw those in the washer and still have a few to use if I don't wash them right away. I'm a weirdo and choose not to use the spray option (I mix my own cleaner and sprinkle it around on the floor before I mop). I do this because the spray options on all mops don't put out enough in one spray. Just my opinion. Overall, though, I'm super happy with this mop.",

After getting it home and filling it with some Murphy\u2019s oil soap and hot water I sprayed and mopped and it was great, my floor got clean and it wasn\u2019t soaked, and it dried fairly quickly. This is very easy to use. I like the idea the microfiber mop heads are easy to apply and washable. I have wood floors in my kitchen and dining room and this is so easy to just grab and fill, I don\u2019t have to go around using towels to dry the floor like I did with my old mop. I would highly recommend. I\u2019ve already told several people about this spray mop because I was so happy with it.",

It's great that it comes with 4 pads, but I wish they were white so that I could tell when they're dirty. Not difficult to assemble even though there were no instructions. It has a very small water container, but it was enough to mop a couple rooms. There's a little gadget included that you use to clean the hair and debris off the pad, and to my surprise, it works very well.",
