This is very practical and works great for its intended use. My only critique is that it can be a bit stiff at times when you try to squeeze out the water but it does what it needs to do!",

The build quality itself isn't anything amazing, but it doesn't feel particularly cheap either.

There is constantly the need to wipe of the bar top while at work, and this squeegee makes everything easier. It eliminates the need for another rag to dry off the bar, plus it fit inside my apron pocket. This mini mop is worth every cent.",

There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, but probably expected a bit more from it.",
