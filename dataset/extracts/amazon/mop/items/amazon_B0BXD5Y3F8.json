It snaps together easily and no batteries. It came with 2 bottles and you add your own cleaning product and water and pop it in. No drips or leaks. The reusable microfiber pads (4) are far better and thicker than the flimsy WetJet pads and leave no streaking. I rinsed off the pad in the sink and DONE. Amazing product especially for the price",

Use 1 container for bleach/dawn/water mix- good for bathroom and kitchen floors. Use the 2nd container for water/Murphy's oil soap mix- great for hardwood floors and laminates. By having 2 different colored pads, they're easily switched out, according to which mixture I'm using.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted the option to use two different solutions, water with a little vinegar for laminate flooring and a disinfectant for tile. This product seemed perfect, and two different colored pads was a real bonus. Unfortunately, the spray mechanism is just garbage. It's easy to put together, and the first 20 or 30 times you use the spray trigger, it seems to work well. I stored it upright in a closet when not in use, and I didn't put harsh chemicals in it. The sprayer just doesn't work. Sometimes, if it's been sitting for a long time, it will give one normal spray. Then it's just leaky dribbles. It's completely unfit for its purpose. I even returned the first one they sent because of this issue and received a replacement. Same issue with the second. I had hoped it was just that I got a lemon. Maybe some of them work, but the quality control must be pretty poor for me to get two such lemons.I'm sorry I chose this product. Waste of money and time. I should have heeded the reviews that identified this problem. Now it's just a dust mop with a weird plastic receptacle, because it can't serve as a spray mop.",

The spray mechanism covers a quite a decent area of the floor, so you don't need to spray many times in order to clean just a small spot.3. One of the most impressive aspects is the durability of the replaceable Microfiber pads. They attach securely to the holder, ensuring they won't fall off like other mops I've used. Plus, the fact that they're machine washable adds to the convenience and saves money on disposable pads.All in all, love it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ordered this mop, as loved that you got spare pads with them, 5 in total which was handy for when they\u2019re becoming a little worn or if your wanting to use different ones for different rooms, or simply just to have spares whilst washing the other. These were great quality nice and thick, and almost cushioned. Simple hook and loop system attaches to the bottom base of the mop. After having major brand spray mops it\u2019s always annoying having to buy the replacement pads which can cost a fortune!Item arrived with very minimal assembly, simply click the parts into position, fill the bottle, attach a pad and away you go! The spray function worked really well and had good coverage with a super fine mist. Tried to show this on the video. The poles that are supplied are also quite thick meaning when your applying pressure it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to snap at any given moment, unlike some other branded mops I\u2019ve tried in the past \u26a1\ufe0f.These mops are also easy to disassemble as well if needed for storage meaning that it\u2019s super convenient to store! The mops come in a range of accent colours and different coloured cleaning pads meaning you\u2019re bound to find one that\u2019s suitable for you and your colour taste!For the current price of \u00a318.99 I think this is a great price to pay for the mop + 5 cleaning pads, and would recommend. \u2705",
