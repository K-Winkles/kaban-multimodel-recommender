                "reviewText": "I am just finishing a condo reno and my contractor recommended LVP. I tried multiple cleaning products with a regular wet mop and everything left streaks. I stumbled across this unit and read ALL of the positive and negative reviews. I finally took the risk and am so glad I did! I've been using it for a week now and can say it does not leave a sticky residue, the spray nosel does not get clogged UF rinsed with warm water after each use, it does not break easily and it is not heavy compared to a bucket of water!A few tips...1) Do not force the handle parts together. If the pieces don't easily snap together, turn the around. I had the backwards at first and couldn't get them to snap together but as soon as I turned them around, easy peasy!2) Rinse that nosel after each use. Just hold the mop end over the.sink and give it a light rinse.3) Make sure the bottle of liquid cleaner is completely locked in or it will leak. I tested over the sink by giving the bottle a light squeeze. If liquid leaked out, I adjusted the bottle tighter until no liquid came out4) Be sure to adjust the spray nosel so it sprays in the right direction. After a week of mopping every day (I have pets), I have not had to re-adjust. Do tip the handle back if you want it to spray further forward. Other than that, you don't have to do much to get the spray where you want it to go.Lastly, the light sheen this product gives is exactly what I was hoping for!",

He pushed the the cleaner bottle in a little more and the trigger finally worked and the mop head sprayed. But it leaked out in my trunk . What little was left I itself for one mopping.I did not see any remarkable change in the hardwood floor after applying the rejuv. Cleaner.",

After being quoted anywhere from $1000 to $2100 to have the floor refinished (apparently it was the only way to remove the scratches) I stumbled across this product. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad I did! It not only removed the scratches but gave the whole floor a gorgeous luster. Great buy!",

                "reviewText": "First, the Rejuvenate product floor cleaner itself is excellent. Not so much on the applicator. It is not very structurally stable. Flexes a lot even when just pushing on the floor with no attempt to apply force to clean. Also, unless you have pretty grip strength this will be difficult to use, especially when trying to do even a modest floor size. The resistance on the trigger is a little excessive.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered the mop bundle because it was cheaper than ordering the individual replacement pieces of pad, adapters etc. The mop broke the first time I used it. The adapter came off the bottle and is stuck in the mop. My original post had photos btw. The mop is unusable. I called Rejuvenate customer service and was told they'd refund me in 4 to 6 weeks(!) once I'd submitted my proof of purchace/receipt and UPC via email. The automated message also states that I'll have to send the items back but doesn't say that they will provide packaging or pay for postage.The best part is: the only reason I ordered this mop bundle is because the previous owner of our new house left her mop behind and I used it and the little bit of cleaner left to clean the wood floor in my bedroom. After my new one broke I figured I'd just use the old one here so the big refill cleaner O also bought wouldn't go to waste. But alas, that one broke as well. The spray nozzle stopped working. I flushed and soaked the mop with warm water as per the instructions but it still doesn't work.In conclusion: 2 mops broken. Don't buy this one.",
