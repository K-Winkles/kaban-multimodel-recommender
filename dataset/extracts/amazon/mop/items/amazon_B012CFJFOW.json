                "reviewText": "In spite of double, heavy cardboard boxing and each unit individually wrapped in plastic and each one sealed with a foil like cover with a hard plastic lid on top of that, they leaked, damaging both boxes, causing one end to cave and weaken and loosen the sealing tape. End result, a mess and without the additional solution, these will dry out quickly and not clean effectively. This negates the savings of buying a multipack on line. Safer to buy these in person at a brick and mortar store. Bought them several times here without a problem but it's hit and miss with delivery. They're a great convenient product for quick clean ups otherwise, especially with the scrubbing strip. Just beware, if you spill water on the floor, after it dries, it will be sticky. It builds up with regular use so you need to occasionally spray with a mix of water and vinegar or hydrogen peroxide and rinse mop with plain water to remove soapy build up. I use reusable mop heads to do this. There's many types available here that fit swifter mops.",
