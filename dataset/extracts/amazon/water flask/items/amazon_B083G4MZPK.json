                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love the large grip loops on lids!",
                "reviewText": "This is a great value, even better if you catch it on sale. Thermoflask has about the best straw lid out there, the reason is that it has the wide loop for carrying the bottle comfortably. These fit the various sizes of Thermoflask and Takeya except maybe not the half gallon size. The Takeya Actives straw lid, in comparison, has a tiny loop and one can fit one or two fingers through it. This set came with two straw lids and two spout lids. Decided to switch the color and trim the straw and use it on my other 24 oz Takeya flask.My husband wanted a black lid for replacement for his, he\u2019s notorious for dropping his flask while working outdoors. I wasn\u2019t willing to fork over more than $12 for a black Takeya straw lid! This was slightly more and got two flasks, two straw lids, two spout lids! Awesome deal, hope they never increase the cost as it was just affordable. Now the spout lid will stay on these for water when traveling. It\u2019s also good to fill them up for water when power is going to be out possibly. the colors were not my favorite pick but they were out of the ones I wanted and some were more expensive. I think they were lower to reduce the stock of the less popular colors.Thermoflask are great quality and keep beverages cold 24 hours, or longer! Ice doesn\u2019t fully melt. It also keeps hot drinks hot if one wanted to take a flask of coffee to work on a cold day! I think 12 hours for hot beverages. We have tested them out good before with this brand.IMPORTANT it says you can put in dish washer but don\u2019t do it. It messes up the flask\u2019s insulation. Also, it makes the color coating deteriorate quicker. Just get a bottle brush and some warm soapy water, it\u2019s worth it to maintain the life of these and keep them looking great and lasting great!Now, if they\u2019d just offer the 24 oz ones in sets like these! One year I got some for family for a gift for my nephews and nieces and they all loved them. It was right around 2020 and the straw lids came in handy in public, don\u2019t have to touch the straw or tilt head back, just flip straw up, very sanitary. We haven\u2019t had much issue with them leaking, just see the gaskets are in it. One time one 24 oz one was leaking and the lid didn\u2019t look damaged. So I replaced the straw. That did the trick! So always try that first, they come with more than one straw. Oh get a straw brush too so it\u2019s all sanitary; it\u2019s not included but they aren\u2019t expensive.10/26/23 UPDATE: One straw lid failed; when it is folded down it doesn\u2019t sit flat. Cup has not been dropped nor bumped. Seller paper says limited lifetime warranty so I will likely reach out to them.",

Keeps cold drinks cold for a long time, holds lots of liquid, easy to clean, lots of room for me to personalize with stickers, a handle on the lid that easily fits in my hand when I cary it. I like to attach a carabiner clip to the handle to attach to other things if I need to.",
