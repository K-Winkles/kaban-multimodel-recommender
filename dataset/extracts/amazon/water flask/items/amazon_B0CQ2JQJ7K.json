It holds 64oz, is truly leakproof, and comes with all of the accessories needed for a hiking or camping trip. It has two lids that screw on tight. One has two straws and the other has a fruit infuser. There is a sleeve that fits snug around the entire bottle that has a zippered pocket large enough for a cell phone. Encasing the bottom of the water bottle is a thick silicon ring that keeps it from slipping or from scratching anything. Woven into the paracord is a small compass that actually worked well for me and flint starter as well as a whistle. There is a handle attached to the lid and a carabiner attached to the neck of the stainless bottle. This insulated water bottle works well for both hot and cold liquids. This stainless steel water bottle with all of the accessories is well made, durable, and would make a great gift.",

Two straws are included for the flip top with it as well as a brush to clean them. The sleeve has pockets on it for your essentials - phone, wallet, keys etc. The plastic ring for the paracord handle is tough to take on and off but other than that i can't find any flaws with all that you get with this bottle.",
