                "reviewText": "Wow I really like this thing it's awesome! I love that it's almost all glass, except for the drinking top, which I understand not everything can be glass lol but so far I'm really enjoying this it's leak proof, it has a silicone nipple inside for where you insert the straw, which I thought was really smart because you can change the straw to a metal one if the plastic bothers you which it does for me, because the plastic straws retain the soap flavor for me so I'm going to get a Glass straw to replace the plastic one, and the silicone nipple helps in the sense you can go a little bigger or smaller in diameter and I think it still holds well I will update that as soon as I get my glass straws I ordered I'm so excited this thing is also very beautiful and quality made I'm really enjoying this thing it's 32 oz which is a good measurement, just under two standard water bottles basically, so that's a pretty good amount and it makes it a lot easier to drink out of something like this, rather than a water bottle for me it seems \ud83d\ude02 if it's pretty and has a straw it's better for water consumption in my mind lol I'm really enjoying this bottle and I would recommend it!Cheers \u2764\ufe0f*Edit*Just got my glass straws and they fit great they were a little bit bigger in diameter than the plastic ones but like I thought the silicone stretches and I'm even more in love with this thing now! no more icky soap taste. I'm so happy and also it mitigates how much plastic actually touches your water, now it's just the mouthpiece and that means it's not just soaking in your water, it only comes in contact with the mouthpiece briefly when you're actually drinking, so happy I will be getting more of these and some for gifts as well!!Only thing I wish was that they had an option for a glass or stainless steel straw, but if having to source my own straw is the only thing I have to do, I'm more than happy to do that to have this great quality bottle I'm impressed.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the overall size of this 32 oz bottle, and the fact that it has a straw feature that folds down to avoid leaks and spillage. Also love the carabiner clip built into the handle - that's great to attach it easily to a purse or backpack. The silicone sleeve is nice to keep it protected from minor bumps and dings that might break it, but \"temperature retention\" is a myth - if you have ice in it, it sweats just like a regular glass (see pic), and the silicone sleeve does absolutely nothing to retain a hot or cold temperature. I added an entire tray of ice to my drink, and the ice was melted within 3 hours. You'd need a neoprene sleeve for better insulation, I believe, but I couldn't easily find a neoprene sleeve accessory (that would be sold separately) that would fit this bottle. It's about 3.5 inches across the base, which is wider than most standard tumbler bases, and the Nalgene bottles are even wider than that, so those don't fit either. Iron Flask brand itself doesn't even seem to offer any accessories like that. The base width also means it does not easily fit into most car cupholders. I like that it came with a second straw for replacement in case the first one gets damaged. The bottle (and I assume the straw too) are NOT dishwasher safe - the listing appears to be wrong. The box, and the literature inside the box, clearly states it should always be hand-washed. The wide opening at the top means you can at least fit many different types of cleaning tools down in there. You could *probably* remove the sleeve for cleaning, but it's really tight to the bottle, so not sure if it would go back on easily. There is a circle cut out in the bottom of the sleeve to help with that, if you decide to try. I don't see a real need for it yet. The straw fits into a rubber piece under the lid, which I feel probably helps with being leak-proof. It really does seem to keep everything inside as long as the \"straw\" part of the lid is \"closed.\" I even shook it upside down and it was fine. Nothing came out. There is a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects, which is nice, but I doubt there is much going to fall into that category other than perhaps that rubber part under the lid wearing out. The tag says it's 100% BPA-free, but that stands to reason being that it's glass and silicone, so not sure what good that claim does. I suppose maybe that qualifies for the plastic lid since your mouth goes on the straw part? Overall, I like the bottle to use around the house if I'm not drinking something cold. I did not try putting anything hot in it, but it should be able to withstand that, being borosilicate glass. Unfortunately, I don't see myself taking it with me too many places since it won't fit in the car's cup holder, but if I were the type to go to a gym, this might work really well because it wouldn't leak inside the bag on the way there.",

                "reviewText": "I tried different water bottles and cups over the years and it seems like it's very hard to find the perfect bottle, unless you design it yourself. I don't drink enough water, unfortunately, so I don't normally carry around such a big bottle. But at some point, I had to get a CT scan and they told me to drink 32 oz of water so I brought my 24 oz water bottle with me and an additional plastic bottle. So I thought a 32 oz water bottle sounded like a good size to order. I've looked at different bottles and some did not have a very good silicone sleeve. Why would you cover most of the bottle but leave the sides uncovered? It made no sense to me. This was one of the few designs that had a sleeve that covered pretty much the entire bottle. Will it actually protect the bottle if dropped on concrete? I hope I never find out, but it does give me some peace of mind.It has a large mouth, which makes it easy to wash. It is easy to drink from it and it does not leak. It does fit in the car's cup holder, but it probably won't fit in all cars. The color (Rose) is what I expected.If I could change anything about this bottle, I would pick 2 things from my other glass bottle: the carrying loop is flexible rather than sticking to the side. It's not a big deal, but I am just used to that design and I guess I will get used to this one as well. And my other bottle has an opening to drink from, along with the straw. It is nice to have both options, if possible.",
