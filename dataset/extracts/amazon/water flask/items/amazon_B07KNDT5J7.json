Take a little more.FLASK500 (17oz): used as a stand-alone soft flask or with tubing (included). Note that FLASK500 comes with FITLY Sub90 and is too big for FITLY Sub45. IMPORTANT: Soft Flasks are NOT MADE for viscous substances like a gel (typically self-serving anyways) but flowing liquids. Many runners use a mixture of water and gel.

                "reviewText": "Pros: 1) I wanted something small that my husband and I could carry in our pockets during our daily 5 mile walks. This is perfect. As you can see in the pic, it is slim enough to put in your back pocket.2) We freeze them with the water inside (leaving room for expansion), so it is extra nice on a hot day to have what is basically an ice pack. The pic shows the water frozen inside. I like holding my bottle against the back of my neck to cool me off, and it speeds up the melting process so that I have some water to drink fairly quickly. My husband keeps his in his back pocket for most of our walk, so his remains partially frozen the entire time, but he still has water to drink.Cons: 1) I can\u2019t get the spout to work. I know you\u2019re supposed to bite the soft part gently but even when I do that, squeezing the bottle gently, barely anything dribbles out. So I just remove the cap and drink it that way. No big deal \u2014 I like getting a bigger swig of water. It doesn\u2019t drip out of the spout, so that\u2019s good. My husband can drink out of the spout with no problem.2) There is a slight rubber taste. Like drinking out of a rubber ball. I washed the bottles with baking soda and water, and it helped a bit. My husband doesn\u2019t notice it as much as I do. But if you add some powdered, flavored Pedialyte to the water, then it tastes great and it gives you more electrolytes too!These bottles were perfect for our needs despite the cons.",

                "reviewText": "Expert skier who previously used water bladders with tube fed through the backpack for hydration while skiing. On cold days, the tube would freeze to my dismay. Nothing I could do to fix this issue worked. I tried insulated tubing without success. I then started carrying a 500 mL bottle of water each day in my thigh bib pocket which worked in terms of not freezing, although I found the shape of the bottle uncomfortable. I ordered this soft flask at the 400 mL size as I thought it would fit in my pocket and yes, it does. I fill it when I go in for a brief break and it is fine for resort use. Would this work for backcountry? Well, personally 400 mL isn't enough water for me for more than a few hours so I think this will have to stay for resort use. But for what I need, it works perfectly. The reason I gave it 3 rather than 5 stars is the taste of the water... despite filling it initially with hot, soapy water to clean, I still taste would I would best describe as the inside rubber/plastic taste/smell of a pool toy. If you have ever blown up a pool toy, you know what I mean. With time it has been getting better but the taste remains. On the product it is clearly advertised that the product is safe for use with claims of product safety by FDA, but who knows...",

What I did was filling in dark tea, leave it for 8-10 hrs, and then leave it uncapped for 8-10 hrs. Repeat it. Now I don\u2019t smell the plastic anymore.",

Lo mejor de todo es que el agua NI SABE a pl\u00e1stico, como si me pasaba con las anteriores compradas. Muy recomendable. Tambi\u00e9n he vomitado la de 500 ml.",
