                "reviewText": "You can get 64oz canteens for less, but the different tops and the handle make it worth it. I was worried about the handle being flimsy or fragile, but it's rock solid. The green is a little darker than olive drab, but not significantly so. The flip-spout top comes with an extra straw and a brush for cleaning it out. The quality build and the extras make this a good buy IMO.",

                "reviewText": "The bottle is a good size. It holds a lot while still being easy to carry, which is nice. The handle on the twisting mouthpiece top is pleasant to hold, as well as the one on the side. The biggest con is the lids. There can be some leakage unless the lid is screwed very tightly, which makes it hard to drink from. My husband doesn't like the black lid or the lid with the straw because they're stiff and hard to use; he favors the one with a mouthpiece, despite needing to twist it hard to open and close. Overall, though, it's a great water bottle if you're looking for one this size.",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite water bottle of all time. I have decided to stop lying to myself and pretending 32 oz or 40 oz water bottles are big enough. They simply are not. I\u2019m tall, I power lift, I hike, so if I\u2019m not getting at least a gallon of water per day I feel like hot garbage. A bottle this size makes it way easier to increase my intake but this bottle stands apart as the GOAT because of the HANDLE!!! This thing is beyond grippable. I\u2019ve had other half gallon bottles before and they\u2019ve fallen out of my hands and smashed on the floor, becoming dented and scary. I don\u2019t think this will ever happen with this bottle. It is perfection. PLUS it comes with different lids and whatnot but the one that came with it is perfect for me. A+, no notes, this bottle is everything.",
