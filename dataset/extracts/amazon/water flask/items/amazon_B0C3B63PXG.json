This is simple, effective for what I need it for and has been a part of my daily routine every day since. This keeps my water cool for pretty much the whole day. It is easy to clean and definitely made of good material. I can say that it is leak proof and once tightened, I have had no issues with leaking. This is a must have for anyone who needs their liquid at their desired temperature.",

To me, cold water from a metal bottle is much more refreshing than room temperature water from a plastic bottle. I wouldn\u2019t use it with a hiking pack due to the extra weight of the insulation, but it\u2019s perfect for a sports pack. Plus, it fits in my car\u2019s drink holder, so if I\u2019m driving, I can take along a hot bottle of coffee or a cold beverage. Because it has a larger pour top than the standard plastic water bottle, it\u2019s a little more difficult to sip from it while driving, but that hasn\u2019t been an issue for me so far.",
