                "reviewText": "Bought 2 of these. I picked these because of the \"extras\" with them. Two different type lids, straw, straw cleaner plus the sturdy handle. I love the stainless steele interior. Keeps ice for a long time. I especially love the case and the handle. It makes it easy to throw over your shoulders so you can carry other things as well. Plus the case has a place where you can store a card - license/key card/credit card. Also has a clip to hang your keys if needed.My only issue is that my husband knocked it off the counter by accident. It cracked the lid to where it essentially started to come apart in pieces. I know the lid is plastic and it probably would happen with any type bottle but it just shocked me how much it broke apart. Fortunately we were able to buy another lid but I'm super paranoid about it now. Overall I'd still recommend it. It's great. You won't be disappointed.We have both the all black and the multi colored one.",

                "reviewText": "I was wanting a bigger water bottle than my 40 oz hydro flask, and I stumbled upon this. After using this for a couple months I am very happy with the purchase. I can fill it about halfway with ice and it\u2019ll still be in there the next morning even after a couple refills. The straw lid is very durable and as long as the straw is closed it doesn\u2019t seem to leak. The para cord handle makes carrying it around very easy and is more comfortable to hold. I have not used the sleeve in day to day use, but it is easy to put on and remove and I appreciate the storage space. Overall I would highly recommend this water bottle if you need something with more capacity and keeps cold for a long time",

                "reviewText": "I bought three of these to take camping in the Big Bend National Park for me and my two sons. It kept our water cool all day. It has a great carrying handle and belt. However, if you fill the water bottle 100% full it is somewhat heavy. I put the water bottle in my backpack which made it easier to carry. It is well insulated and also have a compass and whistle and other cool things for hiking. I highly recommend this product.",

The color is cool and a little textured without the bag. The bottom rubber protector seems a little bit loose but it hasn't just fallen off randomly eother. The paracord band goes on and off easily and the whistle and firestarter in the buckle is a nice touch. It's perfect for times you thirsty people fear you may not be able to refill frequently like camping or hiking or probably even amusement parks.",

Very sturdy. The black Carrie bag you put it in it's pretty convenient if you just want to pop in your ID and your CC and go if you're out on the beach or something like that as well or for hiking so it serves the purpose well",
