Her old one began to leak from being dropped so many times, but still kept her beverages very cold. We purchased the new one and the new size/shape is perfect. The straw/sipper is updated so it totally comes apart to be washed. I was very happy with this new update. You can either attach the straw to suck on the top or you can detach the straw to tip it back and let the water flow out. Nice that their is an option. Color is beautiful and bottle has the quality I have come to expect from hydroflask.",

This one has double wall vacuum insulation which keeps the temperature good and I would try to drink at least a bottle of this per day. If I go to gym and exercise I would drink more. It is leak proof, and the straw cap at the top makes it easy to sip.",

The ONLY downside is that I'll need to purchase the smaller 20 ounce size due to the fact that I have smaller hands. It sounds funny, but as a petite female, I have to hold the bottle with both hands, since the Hydro Flask is so well constructed, it adds quite a bit of weight when then filling with 32 ounces of water. Keep that in mind when trying to decide between sizes, especially for a smaller person, or child's hands. No complaints though. I will now have 2 sizes for the gym!! \ud83d\udc97",

Last year I was tempted and decided to try a yeti of similar build however, it lost its insulation within six months and then began leaking all over the place. The time came to make another water bottle purchase and I knew I would be going with Hydro flask again. The only downside in searching for my new water bottle is the fact that I really wanted the olive green Hydro flask and 40 ounce, however, that proved impossible to find I went with my classic long time preference of the navy blue color and immediately replaced the straw lid for a spout lid, and Paracord handle, then plastered the bottle with some of my favorite stickers. Highly recommend these water bottles. 10/10. Will purchase again in the future when needed.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned two Hydro Flasks, and I've generally been pleased with the product. It does a good job keeping the internal liquid cool, even when exposed to high temperatures due to direct sunlight or even in a sauna (hey, a person gets thirsty in there!). I love the new flex straw lid design with handle, as I drink water all day and like to be able to take a large container of said water on the go.But these darn things just can't take a fall from any reasonable heights. After an epic, three foot high plummet from a table in my garage to the floor, the bottom of my flask is dented and unable to reliably stand up straight. This occurred even though the bottom of the flask was covered with a protective boot. Another small fall, this time from my hands to my driveway, resulted in a golf ball sized dent in the rim. And woe to those who accidentally let their hydro flask roll sideways on asphalt. My bottle was accidentally kicked during an outdoor basketball game, and the resulting scratches make it seem as if a cat were scratching at it, having mistaken it for a scratching post.Now, I am admittedly a klutz who does stupid things that routinely result in minor damages. That said, I would expect a product that is this pricey, not to mention designed to be travelled with, would be more durable when exposed to the above instances of klutziness.",
