                "reviewText": "this is a very slick, odorless 12oz. flask, that stows easily in a coat pocket or cargo pant pocket, with all the qualities of the Nalgene line.even with a sub half full flask of h20 left in the vehicle or your pack/rucksack for a long period, there is still no odor. ... also, if you place something other than h20 in the flask, there is no lingering taste or odor of that item.it is made of Eastman Tritan coplyester, since 2007, when Nalgene switched to it, from HDPE, as a superior material for the Nalgene line. it is heat & chemical resistant, as well as BPA-free, clear, strong, and durable. this is our 2nd purchase of this bottle, after 2 years of excellent, odorless performance, only because it fell out of the vehicle and was run over by the wheel, before it was rescued \ud83e\udd15 ...... the following are our observations from 2 years with this flask;| pros |\u2022 no odor\u2022 impact-resistant (very durable\u2026i dare say, unbreakable!, aside from under a 2-ton vehicle)\u2022 stain-resistant\u2022 clarity - lang lasting clearness\u2022 BPA-Free\u2022 lightweight\u2022 leak-free top with no rubber seal required ... seals 100%, with a good threaded fit, by threading it down firmly\u2022 fits nicely in a coat pocket or cargo pant pocket\u2022 ideal size for minimalist, solo, short hikes or a handy vehicle h2o bottle| cons |\u2022 nonethis is a superb 12 oz. flask.below are links to the 32 oz. (1 qt.) Oasis Canteens, which replicate the same volume and shape of the standard military canteen, with the same Nalgene standard of odor-free performance and durability... these Nalgene 1qt canteens also fit perfectly into military canteen covers and military canteen cup, should you happen to have these items on hand and just need a new odor-free canteen or two! :-) (i am former Navy & Army, with lots of 1qt canteen experience... i updated all my kits to Nalgene and sure would have loved a Nalgene over the stinky, od green plastic, when i served!) Nalgene BPA Free Tritan Oasis Canteen 32 Oz Narrow Mouth Bottle, Red Nalgene Oasis 1qt Canteen Bottle - 2 Pack (Coyote) very pleased, Thank you! :-)",

                "reviewText": "I read all the reviews on this flask and was hesitant about ordering it, but did so any way. Yes the sleeve can slide off easily, but in my case that's a good thing. I use this as a water bottle in my tablet sized messenger bag and it fits inside it very well! In fact when I take hold of just the top of the flask it easily slips from it's sleeve like a knife from it's sheath, leaving the sleeve in place in my little bag to keep anything from sliding in its way of returning! It is easy to slip it back into it's sleeve/sheath where it enjoys the extra protection. The shot glass, well that's just a bonus conversation starter.For my use, as a small EDC canteen this flask works very well!Update; 8 Dec. 2018 I still love this flask! The water never gets any bad flavors in it. I use it for water only. The blue sleeve still works great as a holder for it in my tablet case. I see a lot of people fuss about that outer sleeve and honestly don't see why. I've not used the shot glass yet, but I like having it, just in case.",

                "reviewText": "This flask is so cool! First off, it's typical Nalgene quality: durable, leakproof, stylish, etc... The neat thing about this flask (which I didn't realize at the time of purchase) is that the colored bottom part slides off as well as the colored cap. This really reduces the size of the overall product and makes it really compact for use as a traditional flask. The larger colored cap doubles as both a positive gripping surface for opening and also a shot glass for precise drink making or measuring. The colored bottom \"sheath\" is made up of more rigid plastic than the flask itself and offers extra protection from puncturing. You could also probably use the sheath itself as an odd cup for drinking out of if you really needed to...I've read some reviews saying that it is hard to clean. I don't know what they were putting in their flasks, but if you fill it up with hot water and soap and shake it up, then do a good job of rinsing it, I find that it does a good job of cleaning it. I guess in extreme cases, you might have to get a bottle brush, but I haven't needed one yet.Overall, it doesn't have the durability of a metal flask, but it does have a wider mouth opening for easier filling (you shouldn't need a funnel if you're careful), as well as being easier to clean than metal flasks. It also has the built in shot glass which metal flasks don't.I would definitely recommend this cool little flask!",

                "reviewText": "The red sleeve is so loose that it won't even stay on the flask when the flask is lifted by the cap. By design, there is a detent grove in the flask to receive the 2 bumps on the inside of the flask cover, but they're mis-aligned by a significant amount. Would not buy again... & such a small dollar item, no worth my energy to return.",

Very tight, almost feel like you will break something when you try to remove it.",
