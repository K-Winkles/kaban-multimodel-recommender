                "reviewText": "This 128oz insulated water bottle has quickly become an essential companion on my daily adventures. Whether I'm hiking or going to the gym. One of my main concerns with water bottles is how well they stand up to the daily grind. I've used a lot of bottles that chip or scratch easily, but this one has stood the test. Its surface is tough and successfully withstands the occasional bump or drop. Best of all, it has a rubber bumper to protect the bottle! So for those of you who are clumsy (like me), this water bottle could be your new best friend. I like that it's not too big or too small. It gives you enough liquid to carry you through the day. Unless you drink like a buffalo. I wanted one that was easy to clean and would keep my drinks hot or cold. This one meets my requirements. I am very happy with my purchase. I give it five stars.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- I put ice in at about 8am and it was still cold at about 4pm the next day after being in a room that was about 70\u00ba the whole time.- easy to carry and the holder you put it into has two pockets which are handy. I put the silicone ring that you use on the jug when it's outside the holder in one pocket. There are two straws included with a pipe cleaner and I can fit the extra straw with the cleaner inside the holder with the jug.- You need small ice cubes to fit in. The cubes I use are big cubes, maybe 1\"x1\"x1\" and I have to melt the down a little bit to fit.Cons:- The straw attaches to the inside of the lid but doesn't go to the bottom of the container- The flip up portion that you drink out of needs a bigger hole. You get liquid out but feel like you're struggling to get a really good flow.- The jug case isn\u2019t waterproof so don\u2019t keep anything you don\u2019t want wet in the pockets.",

                "reviewText": "There area few things I really like about this bottle set. The color combination is nice, with a teal color blending down to black.This comes with a color-coordinated Paracord strap, and a silicone boot.It also comes with a bottle pouch. The pouch is great for me because this is a large bottle, and having the option to carry it crossbody or over my shoulder definitely encourages me to carry it more often. Without the pouch I would probably not want to bring it with me all the time because a 64oz bottle is a little unruly to carry on your hand for a long time, or if you have other things to carry. The pouch has pockets if you want to carry your keys or ID, and some money. I put some drink mix packets in mine.All of the accessories that came with it make it a great value compared to buying each thing individually.But my very favorite thing about this bottle is the lid. This lid has both a straw AND a pour spout. I prefer to drink out of the larger bottles with a straw. If I'm driving, I can't drink out of the pour spout because I can't lift the bottle with one hand safely while still keeping my eyes on the road. And not having to lift the bottle also prevents me from spilling water on myself.Since this is a 64oz bottle I sometimes bring it to provide water for multiple people, so having the pour spout is good. I can fill people's cups without anyone having to drink directly out of the bottle.This was a great purchase for me, and I'm very pleased I found this bottle with all the accessories. I use it for different things and it offers a lot of options.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. REVIEW UPDATE!!! It was time to replace my water bottle. I got all of my money out of the last one. I was looking for something a little flashier than my previous water bottle so I can spot it quickly. This company came with some pretty swagged out water bottles!! It comes with two straws (that don't reach the bottom of the water bottle), a straw cleaner, three way cap (fully open wide mouth lid, open screw-top lid or flip-up straw), carabiner clip, braided matching handle w/ compass, and a silicon boot to protect the bottom of the bottle in case of drops which is worthless. The silicon boot is the worst accessory. The boot does not stay on the bottom of the water bottle like you want it to and while it may look fabulous, the functionality of it is terrible. After using this water bottle the past few days, I found out that it leaks from the top screw cap, not the main lid that connects to the water bottle itself. There is nothing that you can do about it either other than replacing the entire lid system to the water bottle which defeats the point of buying a new water bottle. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!",
