                "reviewText": "The bottle doesn\u2019t come with any paperwork so refer back to the item page for info. There were a lot of things I loved about this bottle. The bottle is sleek, beautiful and easy to grip. It keeps beverages ice cold and even kept ice over night. I did not test it with hot liquids. It\u2019s leakproof too. I drink tea occasionally so the strainer is a nice feature. However\u2026One thing the page mentions is that it features a \u201cNon-slip wear-resistant cup bottom\u201d. It does not. The bottom is smooth plastic and feels thin. When I tap on it it sounds hollow.. You can see the seam at the bottom where they glued it to the bottle. A piece of the plastic came off after I unboxed it leaving a gap that will probably continue to grow or crack when dropped. For these reasons I don\u2019t think it will last.",
