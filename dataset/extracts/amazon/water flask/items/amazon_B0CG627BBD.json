                "reviewText": "The carry pouch will not only make the water bottle easier to carry, but it will also insulate and protect the bottle. This is a neat addition to the packaging but what I really like is the inclusion of a brush and straw cleaner. Those two are very useful and will save anyone the hassle of having to buy a new one. Having a spare straw is nice too.The first thing I did when I got the bottle was wash it with soap and the included brush. After a good rinse and wash, I filled it with water and I am happy to announce that the water didn\u2019t taste like metal or soap. There are no crevices for the soap to hide in, and the bottle doesn't flavor the water.There is a ring (they call it the safety ring) that goes around the bottle which has a carabiner and the paracord attached to it, I find the extra bulk a bit annoying, so I removed it from the bottle. I normally use the handle lid so to me the paracord was not needed. On the topic of the lid, the handle lid takes quite a bit of effort to close which is a real shame since the spout and straw lid both screw on smoothly. I appreciate that 3 different types of lids are included because I wouldn\u2019t have considered this water bottle if not for the handle lid, I\u2019m just not a big fan of other lid types.64 oz is enough for the whole day, some days I end up going through two 24oz bottles plus a disposable water bottle. Hopefully, this guy will allow me to only have 1 water bottle.If you like what you see nothing is keeping me from recommending this water bottle or recommending something instead of this water bottle. Its a solid product and it has more than you\u2019ll need.",

There are also 3 different lids that can be interchanged for the best drinking experience you're looking for (straw, small sip mouth, large sip mouth). Also, it comes with everything you need to clean the bottle and the straw. The cherry on top is that it comes with a sleeve that is easy to remove to clean.",

                "reviewText": "This half-gallon metal flask is awesome and comes with everything you need. The flask itself is metal and keeps drinks cold all day even in outside in the heat. It comes with three lids for your choice of drinking style - with a straw, a smaller opening, or a fully open bottle. It comes with two straws for that drinking style as well as a straw cleaner and a foam bottle \"brush\". The cover is awesome to provide extra insulation and easy carrying. It's super easy to put on thanks to the zippered bottom of the cover, just unzip, cull over the top of the bottle, and zip it up. There is a shoulder strap as well as a paracord handle that includes a compass and whistle. It also has a carabiner in case you want to attach it to a hiking bag or hang it from something. The paracord and other things could come in handy in an emergency situation while hiking or camping. However, I got this for my husband to use for work as he works outside and needs lots of water to stay hydrated while working. This bottle is perfect for that.",
