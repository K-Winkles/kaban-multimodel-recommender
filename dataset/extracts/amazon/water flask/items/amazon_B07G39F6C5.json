Now, I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t buy a new one sooner as it so much easier to place in the dishwasher instead of washing and drying by hand. Plus, I love that my dish washer will disinfect (total germaphobe here) the bottle which might mot happen by hand washing. Since purchasing this 16 Oz bottle, I\u2019ve bought a new 32 Oz to use at home and will either give away or donate my other bottles that aren\u2019t dishwasher safe. My bottle in the color \u201cindigo\u201d and is a beautiful dark blue which is not a navy blue but close. It\u2019s held up so far during a daily trip through the dishwasher.I use this bottle (plus the neoprene sleeve I purchased to fit over it to prevent scratches and light dents) in a backpack or other bags. It\u2019s light weight to carry when full and fits easily into bags, purses and backpacks compared to a 32 Oz . It provides enough water to get you through work (which is what I use it for, we have water dispensers for refills) or I imagine classes for school until you can refill it again. It keeps my water cold and fresh and has no leaks or defects as of now. I can\u2019t recommend it enough but will update if anything changes.",

I don\u2019t understand it and they aren\u2019t even practical or cute looking.

But that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do and I\u2019d much rather that than it get cold too soon. Never had an issue with spilling and I love the flex handle at the top because it\u2019s easier to transport with full hands. Not bulky or awkward to carry at all.

                "reviewText": "When one manages to get the parts of the lid properly assembled after cleaning, this thing is truly the most leak-proof leak-proof thermal drink container with a \"drink-through\" lid that I've ever used. The problem is that to all visual inspection, it can look like the lid is perfectly reassembled . . . but then it will leak between the two main sections. Then you have to disassemble if someplace where you can do so and try it again. I'm thinking the rubber gasket is not always seated securely even though it appears to be so.The thermal construction of the metal part is excellent - I have fixed hot tea, then gotten distracted and forgotten to put the lid on and come back an hour later to find the tea still quite hot. I don't get the 12 hours of truly hot beverage, but I've gotten too rushed to do what one is supposed to for best effectiveness - preheat with hot or boiling water and empty right before adding hot beverage. That said, my tea is still piping hot two hours later when I first start drinking and acceptably warm and drinkable more than six hours later. Like it enough that I've gotten two of them.",
