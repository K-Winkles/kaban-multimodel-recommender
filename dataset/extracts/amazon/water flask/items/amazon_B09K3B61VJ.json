Now after 5 months of almost daily use, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I use this as a refill means for my water bottle that I take into job sites with me and it resides on the rear floorboard of the car. It has been super durable and completely leak free, even with several tumbles over while driving or going across bumpy unpaved roads/lots to access job sites. I will typically put a couple of handfuls of ice in it when leaving in the morning ( 3:30-4:00am) and it has not once completely melted the ice while in the car while I am working. I have often gotten home nearly 12 hours later and most of the ice is still in it. That cover that it comes with works fantastic at insulating it, protecting it and coupled with the carry strap it came with, is just great! Phenomenal purchase!",

I don\u2019t know why everyone keeps complaining about the lids popping off, I\u2019ve not had one problem with the three lids. Great value for the price. One thing is, it does not stay cold for 48hrs but it does stay cold for about 8 hours. Not a big deal for me but could be for others. The travel bag is great and overall glad I got this. The color is also beautiful and feels like nice quality. Good dupe for hydro flask besides the temperature false advertising. Highly recommend.",

The bottle came with a protective sleeve and mine came ripped/cut so i contacted them and they sent me a new one right away! I was so happy and then it came and they sent me a brand new bottle! So i kept the sleeve and give the new one to my boyfriend. Genuinely nice brand wich is SO RARE these days. Also the bottle is equivalent to any popular brands out there (stanley, hydroflash...) and i prefer this one since its powder coated the paint will stay ou way longer. GET THESE NOW!",

                "reviewText": "When I say this bottle I figured I'd give it a try figuring it might be a cheaper version of the Yeti. What I learned is the difference between the two and why the Yeti's are more expensive. Firstly Let's talk about the good things, this is a durable, nice water bottle, it has a good seal, it won't leak all over your stuff if you put it in your bag, and it didn't seem to mind or care that I left it outside in -30C overnight with water in it.So why did I go and buy another Yeti if this water bottle is so good? Well, the answer is in how well-insulated this bottle is. If you fill this bottle with ice and cold water, in the morning there will be barely any ice left in the bottle at night (12 hours ~) later. If you do the same thing with the Yeti you won't need to add ice for 4 days. I have done this multiple times with this water bottle and my Yeti bottles are the same size, they are getting the same amount of ice put in them they are being filled from the same faucet with an inline water filter/chiller on it at work. So the difference has to be the insulation, and the insulation matters when you put a warm/ hot drink in it and you work in the cold, and that's why this one factor caused me to get another Yeti for winter use.Now, if that doesn't matter to you, this is a great water bottle hell for the price buy 2 of them. I know I am still going to use this water bottle in the summertime while we work/play outside.",
