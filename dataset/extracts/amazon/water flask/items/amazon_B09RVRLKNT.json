A little difficult to get the shrink wrap off of the top and then figure out how the top works. There is a large hook that can be lifted to carry the bottle. And, there is a lower latch that prevents the bottle from accidentally opening. You must release the lower latch to use the bottle. Once the lower latch is released everything works perfectly. One press of a button and the top flips up. The spout is easy to drink from with an additional air hole that keeps the water flowing smoothly. Very well designed and easy to use. It keeps my water cold. And despite its 20 oz. size the bottle fits in my car's cup holder.",

Here's the thing: I bought it to hold soda pop - and it can handle the fizz without leaking or exploding or doing anything weird. Also to give an idea of the size, it holds 3 standard size cans of Diet Coke at a time. Wow. I'd buy it again if I ever needed another one, but I have a feeling this one will stand the test of time.
