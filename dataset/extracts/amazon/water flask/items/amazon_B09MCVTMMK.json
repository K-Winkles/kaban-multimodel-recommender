                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5)I am thrilled with my purchase of the Half Gallon Water Bottle, and it has quickly become my go-to companion for staying hydrated throughout the day. This water bottle's thoughtful design and included accessories have made it an indispensable part of my daily routine. Here's why I believe it deserves a glowing review:1. Ample Capacity: The half-gallon capacity of this water bottle is perfect for keeping me hydrated all day long. I no longer have to worry about constantly refilling smaller bottles or cups. With just one fill in the morning, I have more than enough water to last me through my busy day.2. Extra Straw: The inclusion of an extra straw is a thoughtful touch. It ensures that I always have a spare straw available, allowing for easy replacement in case one becomes damaged or worn over time.3. Interchangeable Tops: The multiple interchangeable tops that come with this water bottle make it incredibly versatile. Whether I want to sip from the straw, use the flip-top for quick access, or remove the top entirely to pour water into a glass, this bottle accommodates all my preferences effortlessly.4. Cleaning Brush: The addition of a cleaning brush has been a game-changer. It allows me to thoroughly clean every nook and cranny of the bottle, including the straw and hard-to-reach areas. Keeping the bottle clean and free from any residues has been a breeze, thanks to this handy accessory.5. Sturdy and Durable: This water bottle's sturdy design is worth noting. It feels robust and durable, able to withstand daily use without any issues. I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and to my relief, it remained unscathed. The quality of the materials used is evident, making it a reliable long-term investment.6. Leak-Proof Performance: I appreciate that this water bottle is leak-proof, even when carrying it in my bag or backpack. The secure seals on all the interchangeable tops ensure that I don't have to worry about any unwanted spills or messes.7. Easy to Carry: Despite its larger capacity, the sleek design of this half-gallon water bottle makes it easy to carry around. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to hold, and the bottle fits perfectly in my car's cup holder, making it convenient for on-the-go hydration.8. Insulation: I bring this bottle with me to work where there is no AC and on a hot 90 degree day I can expect my water to remain cold and the ice to last all day long. I\u2019m very impressed with the amount of time the ice can last, I\u2019ve left it on my counter for several days and return to the ice still being intact.In conclusion, I am thoroughly impressed with the Half Gallon Water Bottle and its thoughtful design. The extra straw, multiple interchangeable tops, cleaning brush, and sturdy construction have made it an absolute pleasure to use. Staying hydrated has never been easier or more enjoyable. If you're in search of a reliable, spacious, and well-designed water bottle, look no further \u2013 this one ticks all the boxes and more! I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a top-tier hydration solution.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this bottle from Trebo for about a month now. I like it so much, I'm planning to purchase another in a smaller size.I was looking for a large insulated water bottle that was pretty rugged. And I didn't want another plastic water bottle. Yes those are cheaper, but they also get warm very quickly, and I'm trying to get away from plastic products.As far as the 48 hours cold claim goes, I agree with it absolutely. I live in Florida, and it's July right now. I left it for at least half a day in a closed car at 95\u00b0F (outside) temp, so the car was even hotter inside. When I filled it, it had no ice, just somewhat cool water, and it was close to the same temp all those hours later.I'm able to leave the bottle in my house unrefrigerated, and it keeps the water the same temperature for a significant amount of time.I've been using this everyday for work. It's not as heavy as I was worried about when filled, and the Paracord handle helps tremendously.The black neoprene cover with the strap works great too, especially if you're having to travel around with it. The only downside to using that accessory is that it covers the color of the bottle, and since I'm refilling the water from a soda fountain machine at work, the strap gets in the way a little bit.The bottle is not much taller than a standard 1 l bottle, so you can you still refill it fairly easily, so that's a plus.I love the color, and it looks just as vivid as in the picture. The logo is also engraved, and not painted on. And all the pieces/accessories feel very sturdy and well made. Not of cheap quality.I really like having the option of different lids, so that I can switch between them when one needs to be washed.Cons: the lid with the straw is slightly finicky. You have to make sure it's opened completely, or doesn't function as well.The bottle is not dishwasher safe, though the lids are. That's to be expected for any similar bottle though.The bottle is fairly wide too, which was stated and as expected. So don't plan on putting it in a car cup holder.As far as negatives go, those are all I can think of. And that's being really nitpicky about it.As I said earlier, I will definitely be buying another bottle in another pretty color.You could probably get a cheaper bottle somewhere else, but if you want any of these accessories (which I did) you can't beat this deal for the quality!",

Even when I refilled it with cold water after getting back home, I was amazed to find it still pleasantly cool the next morning.Its versatility really stood out to me at the gym. I could easily hang it on various machines, and carrying it with me was a breeze. While it might be considered overkill for a gym in Canada, I can envision its incredible potential for outdoor activities like hiking and camping. Personally, I acquired it with a specific purpose in mind \u2013 a vacation in a southern destination where temperatures often soar above 30 degrees Celsius. I needed a generously sized, well-insulated water bottle to endure an entire workout, and this product exceeded my expectations.Kudos to Trebo for delivering a product of exceptional quality. Thank you for providing a solution that perfectly met my needs.",
