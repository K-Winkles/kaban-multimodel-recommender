                "reviewText": "I've bought many water bottles, but this one takes the cake! It has a soft cover to put the container in, with a sturdy braided handle on the top, and a \"cord\" handle to attach to the metal hoops so you can carry around like a purse or like a crossbody. Totally functional and I like the two different lid options whether you like to drink from a \"straw\" or with a big opening. I haven't had the chance to put water or ice in it, but I imagine it would stay cold for a long time! Perfect for travel, hiking or wherever you need to carry a water bottle!",

Impressive. but the catch is that you must feel it up full of ice to capacity and then any liquids you add in afterwards must be colder than room temperature. If you feel the container up 75 %, you will get 2 days of ice retention. The liquids must be cold. The ice retention was without the protective sleeve.The components are cheap, obviously overseas made. The compass is not accurate. But there is a whistle to blow that is fairly loud.I would think they need cooler colors. The logo was fine, but the name on the bottle has to go.",

                "reviewText": "Bought the 64-ouncer a few months back and I literally have used it every day since receiving it. The bottle itself is extremely sturdy without weighing too much, has an opening large enough to put fairly large ice cubes through, and with the addition of about 10 or so ice cubes I'm able to keep water cold for roughly 24 hours.The bottle comes with plenty of additions making it well worth the price. Two different screw-on lids are provided, one that uses a large plastic straw for sipping (an extra straw is also provided), and another lid with a small screw on/off top. The bottle itself comes with a sturdy fabric cover, an attached carabiner, and a large fabric handle with a small compass attached. Cleaning tools are also provided to help clean the bottle as well as the plastic straws.As an additional note, I recently had separate issues with both lids. I somehow lost a small plastic plug for the sipping top, and one of the pegs on the other top broke off. I messaged the company first thing in the morning (an ungodly hour of like 5 or 6am PST) offering to pay for replacement lids if they sold them, and they responded to me within the hour offering to send me replacements for both lids free of charge. There are quite a few companies I've attempted to contact in the past for various issues or questions through the hundreds of items I've purchased through the years, many times never hearing back from them, or with a message stating sorry but you're SOL, so I was very impressed with the magnitude of the help I was provided.Looking back, $25 or so was a steal for the amount of use I've gotten from this bottle, and the customer service is unquestionably top-notch. Of all the purchases I've made off Amazon, I would rank the 'use-to-cost' ratio of this as one of my top 5 purchases of all-time, and I would rate their customer service as second to none. Solid company. Solid Products.",
