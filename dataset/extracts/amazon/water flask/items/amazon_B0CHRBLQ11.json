                "reviewText": "I found the perfect size for my primary or secondary tumbler. I have a tumbler with me at all times, it has coffee in the winter and water in summer. Well sometimes it has a mixed drink as I'm relaxing on the patio. The tumbler I've been using for sometime now is only 20 oz. Don't get me wrong, it works great but is limited in functionality. This two pack of 27 oz tumblers is a great replacement or addition to it. Although I like the smaller size of my 20 oz tumbler, I find so often 20 oz is just not enough. With the BJPKPK I get 7 more ounces. For shorter trips that's enough but for longer trips I'll take my 20 oz and have this 27 oz as a refill unit. Or maybe take both 27 oz units. My reasoning is I still like my 20 oz tumbler because it fits in the cup holder, I don't have oversized cup holders. And I have 27 oz tumblers that are tapered on the bottom, but I feel they are too tall and not comfortable to use. So I like the design of these tumblers because the circumference is wide but still easy to grip and the height is similar to my 20 oz tumbler. The paint on the tumblers feels good and is not slippery when wet. I love the handles and now I have a choice of tops to use for my purpose. 1 top is solid (Flex) to store whatever I want and when needed I can either pour it out or take a drink. The 2nd top is a spout and my favorite to drink from. The spout has a hinged screw cover that takes only a couple of twist to open. The larger hole works great for everything to include iced drinks. Lastly the 3rd lid is the straw lid. It has a mouth spout that flips up when needed and a straw below. The flip motion is smooth and does not leak when closed. In fact none of the lids leaked. Every lid screws on securely and has a handy handle. I've tested with coffee and hours later my coffee was still hot. I've also left ice in the tumbler for over 24 hours and there was still some ice left. I had to do the ice test to compare to my expensive tumbler and I'm pleased these tumblers worked just as well. I really don't see myself using the straw lid, I'm not a straw using guy but the other 2 lids will get tons of use. For those who like the straws, this kit does come with 4 straws and 2 cleaning brushes. These tumblers are a very important addition to my collection and will replace a couple of my older tumblers permanently. I've spent more on 1 tumbler that does half of what these do. Great price for some very nice tumblers.",

                "reviewText": "Since I am very concerned that I stay hydrated, I have for at least 20 years been buying and accumulating water bottles to carry with me to work, use in the car on trips and have around the house, next to my computer and bedside. They all are either 750 ML or one L transparent plastic and start off with a bite valve or similar straw because I like to not have to elevate the liquid; prefer sucking through a straw. And since I use just water and not coffee or tea or any other hot or cold beverage I just rinse them out and refill with water. The water out of my tap is usually room temperature or colder after running a few seconds.The problem has been that due to aging the silicone bite valve becomes loose and leaks air or loses its water seal and begins to leak if I tip it over or just gets lost since it is just held on by friction. And the flexible plastic carrying handle on top breaks so I end up having to replace a lot of parts and make new handles out of webbing and a worm clamp; not a professional look. Furthermore if I wanted to use the water vessel to carry soup or stew I don't have a suitable closure for the top. And the stainless steel vacuum insulated tumblers I have, some from Amazon, are tapered and therefore must be tall to accommodate the 750 ML to 1 L of water I want to carry with me and they don't have a handle and if they have a screw on or press on cap the straw does not seal 100 percent so tends to leak if tipped. And I can wash the bottom in the dishwasher but not the top.Now this tumbler solves all these problems and is dishwasher safe. Each of the two tumblers in this kit came with three different screw on leakproof caps, each with a handle, two straws and a straw cleaning brush. So you get two bottoms, six tops, four straws and two straw cleaning brushes. The inside diameter of the top, 2 inches (5 cm), is the same as my other tumblers. Of the three tops for each tumbler, one is solid and seals perfectly so you could carry soup or stew, the second has a 7/8 inch (22 mm) outside diameter chug type mouthpiece 3/4 inch (19 mm) high to drink out of if you want to invert the tumbler. This mouthpiece, which is smooth on the outside (is threaded on the inside), is tightly sealed by a captive screw cap attached with a hinge; very nice design. The third, Which is the one I use, has a built-in hinged straw mouthpiece with air compensation valve that lowers and seals perfectly with no leaking at all when inverted and shaken. The colors are fully acceptable in professional gatherings.This tumbler fits perfectly in my car's large cupholder, having a uniform cylindrical shape (no taper) with the same 3.5 inch (9 cm) outside diameter as my other 1 L water bottles. And holds 32 ounces (950 ML). The screw caps, besides having strong nonflexible hinged handles also has a nicely textured, easily gripped surface.In conclusion: my new go-to water bottle. Very highly recommend.",
