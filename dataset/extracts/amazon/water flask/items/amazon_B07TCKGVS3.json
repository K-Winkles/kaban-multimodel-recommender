                "reviewText": "Great bottle, high quality. I found that the opening was a bit small to drink out of, so I ordered the straw cap. I'm very satisfied. By the way, the rubber bottom is great for reducing the clanking noise metal bottles tend to make. However, it didn't fit in my vehicle's cupholder with the rubber bottom on. Thankfully, it slips on and off without any worry of falling off or sticking, if that's a concern. If you're looking for a quality bottle that isn't flashy or complicated, has thoughtful features like tabs on the rubber seals to make it easier to remove them for cleaning, and keeps liquid hot or cold as needed without leaking, this is the bottle to buy. 5/5",

My family has been using them daily for a while now, and I can confidently say it's become an essential part of our routine.First and foremost, the insulation is remarkable. It keeps drinks cold for hours, even on scorching Texas summer days. The spout lid is a game-changer - it's incredibly convenient and prevents any leaks or spills. I can toss it in my bag without worrying about a mess.The design is sleek and modern, and I appreciate the various color options available.This water bottle is not only functional but also environmentally friendly. It has significantly reduced my need for single-use plastic bottles, which is a win for both my wallet and the planet.If you're looking for a top-quality, insulated water bottle with a user-friendly design, the Takeya Actives is the way to go. It's worth every penny, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Definitely a 5-star product!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love how durable this bottle is! The large opening allows me to easily to be cleaned inside and once the lid is on, it is on tight without any signs of leaking! On top of that, it has exceeded my expectations for how long drinks stay cold. While on the beach, it keeps ice cold for more than the whole day!Comparing to other bottles that claim to \"keep cold,\" Takeya easily beats the competition. The price is just the right price to pay since 32oz that stays ice cold for more than 24 hours is amazing and does not compare to any other bottles that I have.Keep in mind, for so much liquid the bottle can hold, it is pretty large. The loop near the spout makes it easy to carry with your fingers, but most bags and cupholders will not have room for it. This isn't a negative, just something to keep in mind.If you need a a lot of cold drink to be kept cold for all 32oz, then this is easily the best bottle for you!",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Takeya bottle---I recently lost my first bottle when traveling. I didn't even look at other bottles when I replaced the one that I lost--I just bought the same bottle but in the Midnight Blue 40 oz bottle; the blue is GEORGOUS...much prettier than the grey one I originally purchased.I take this bottle with me everywhere (even in the house) because it helps me to drink more water. The wide mouth allows me to easily add ice directly from the dispenser on my fridge and makes it really easy to clean. The lid is also easy to clean and the liner comes out so you can be confident you are sanitizing the entire bottle. I fill it up half the way with ice and the rest with water and it stays cold all day. If I didn't drink any water or add more ice, it would still be cold with ice cubes 24+ hours later. Even when I am sitting out in the heat, the bottle keeps my ice solid and my water cold. The handle is very sturdy. The bottle is solid and can take a lot of abuse without scratching and denting. I kind of abuse my first bottle and it still stayed in top shape.The 40 oz is perfect size for me, even filled, it is not too heavy and as an extra benefit, it could be used as a self-defense weapon when walking if it is filled, lol... I have accidently hit my knee with it walking and it did not feel good! I love that they have added the silicone removable bottom...it definitely quiets the noise made when setting the bottle down. I fill silly being so excited about a water bottle, but I really love my Takeya bottle.You will not regret purchasing this bottle. If I hadn't lost mine, I would expect it to last for many years.",

                "reviewText": "I am always looking for ways to stay hydrated on the go, especially during those hot summer days. That's why I was excited to try out the Takeya Actives Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed!First off, the design of this bottle is sleek and modern. The onyx color gives it a professional and stylish look that can be used anywhere, whether you're hitting the gym, hiking in the mountains, or just running errands around town. The 40-ounce capacity is perfect for those long hikes or workout sessions when you need to stay hydrated.But the real standout feature of this water bottle is its insulation. The double-wall vacuum insulation technology keeps your drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours, making it the perfect companion for any outdoor adventure. And unlike some other insulated bottles, the Takeya Actives bottle doesn't sweat, so you can toss it in your bag without worrying about it getting everything else wet.The spout lid is another great feature of this bottle. It's easy to use and doesn't require any twisting or turning to open or close. The lid is also leak-proof, so you can toss it in your bag or backpack without worrying about spills or leaks.The stainless steel construction is not only durable but also easy to clean. The bottle is dishwasher safe, so you can quickly and easily clean it after a long day of outdoor activities.Overall, I highly recommend the Takeya Actives Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish hydration companion. It's perfect for active lifestyles, whether you're hitting the gym or exploring the great outdoors. So stay hydrated and cool with the Takeya Actives water bottle!",
