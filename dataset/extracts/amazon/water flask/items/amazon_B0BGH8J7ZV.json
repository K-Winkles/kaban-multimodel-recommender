From the price point it sells I can easily say it\u2019s one of the cheapest available on an Amazon with the build quality it offers. I also liked the quality of the plastic components like the bottle spout and cap. One more thing to note is, since it\u2019s insulated, if you like to drink lukewarm water instead of cold water, the water stays lukewarm for hours! This has been the favorite part for me especially in winter season.Things I didn\u2019t like: Though the build quality of the cap and straw is good, the locking mechanism is a bit flimsy. It gives me a feeling that it might leak when kept flat on bed, this has not happened yet though so it could just be my perception.Overall, it\u2019s a nice bottle with decent storage, helps me keep hydrated this winter!",

Also appreciate the locking mechanism for when I don\u2019t want to accidentally flip the sipper open when I\u2019m refilling or carrying it around. It\u2019s perfect!!",

Love the larger volume, color, and the way the straw screws in and never falls out(great design).My cons:1) the lock feature is finicky and needs some work. Despite being locked it will leak from the top on occasion.2) wish it was tapers at the bottom to fit in a cup holder so it didn\u2019t roll all over the car.Having the option to buy replacement lids would be a plus too.Overall great purchase for the price. The straw/sip top is a plus to getting me to keep drinking throughout the day. I\u2019ve tripled my water consumption since getting this bottle.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 4 different colors (one for each kid and me). I really loved all the color choices, so my kids wouldn't fight over whose bottle is who's.For the most part, I love this water bottle. When I fill my bottle with water and ice and the water will stay cold and the ice can last for 2 days with repeat refilling of water. Each bottle came with two (2) lids (one with a straw and the other not) and each lid has a handle. I have used both lids depending on my activity for the day. The straw lid has a lock mechanism, which works well and stays locked when wanted. It also has a push button to pop up the straw. The bottle also fits in my cup holders in my car. I love that.What I don't like is the threading on the lid to the bottle. Multiple times, while I was holding onto the handle of the lid, the bottom has just dropped out and fell to the ground. I was not running, walking hard, or any other super physical activity. It has even happened just when standing or pulling the bottle out from my cup holder in the car. It has happened on both lids too. Because of the threads, the bottle leaks as well, though not a hard fast leak. It seems to only happen when the bottle is laying down (with either lid). It does not leak when drinking from it (again with either lid).It also seems to dent fairly easily. All my kids have dropped theirs and now have dents. I have dropped mine too (as noted above) but still don't have any dents.",
