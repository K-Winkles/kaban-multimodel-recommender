                "reviewText": "Nice wide body: easy to clean. No condensation on the bottle and it doesn't leak. We don't like straw bottles, so very much appreciate the spout. The spout cover twists on, but is attached to the carrier loop and can't get lost. It's really nice to have that handle/carrier for walking around. The water stays cold for hours even if it's been in a hot car. It's also a nice size to hold and 22 oz is not too heavy to carry around. Very nice - will probably buy more.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first steel/insulated water bottle, so I can't compare it to others. It gets four stars because it arrived with a dent in it. The packaging was not damaged, so this dent appears to have occurred before shipping. The dent is at the bottom, so it has a slight effect on the bottle's ability to stay flat on a surface. Since it's small, I decided not to exchange it.The capacity is as advertised. No condensation, no leaks. It does a great job keeping drinks cold. Last night I had some ice water before I went to bed. 10 hours later, the ice was still about 50% frozen. I like that it includes both chug and straw lids. I wish that the opening for drinking on the chug lid was a little quicker to open. It requires several turns to get it off.",
