The flasks I have just have the sport valve and I literally got a crick in my neck drinking from them so I thought the taller straw might be better :) well it is! I figured out a couple of miles in that I could tuck the straw into a pocket on the shoulder of my vest to keep it from poking me in the jaw (yeah it took me that long to figure out\u2026) and while I do wish I could get water quicker out of the straw, it will definitely do! The flask is taller and thinner than my old ones which I actually don\u2019t like because the flask gets floppy quick and you have to shove it down into the pockets further and cinch them up to keep it from moving around but again, it will definitely do. All-in-all I love them and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t spend more! That might change down the road but for now they don\u2019t leak and they keep me hydrated!",

Pricey especially when I got the vest at Sierra for only $50. My next search was on Amazon where I found these. Sorry to say, but they are awful. I can\u2019t even get water out of them. I had to unscrew the top just to drink. I should have gone with the name brand replacement ones.",

Werde im Wettkampf f\u00fcr den Lauf fl\u00fcssige Kohlenhydrate verwenden und das ist mit der faltbaren Flasche perfekt. Flasche ist sehr leicht und hat keinen Geschmack. Klare Empfehlung!",
