All I can say is, for the price, wow! I filled the bottle half way with ice and then put water in it around 1:30PM. The ice stayed in it for the rest of the day and I filled it up with just water before I went to bed at around 9:30PM because there was still ice in it. I woke up at 6AM with a headache, went down stairs to fill it again, THE ICE WAS STILL IN IT FROM 1:30PM. I know this happens with most bottles but, for the price, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. It exceeded my expectations and my sister is happy! Would highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for a good quality bottle without breaking the bank with a Stanley or Yeti.",
