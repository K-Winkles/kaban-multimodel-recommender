                "reviewText": "This is a really nice \"mini water bladder\". It's construction is typical Camelbak. The bladder material seems thick enough and welded well to prevent leaks. With the shut off valve in the closed position, the silicon bite valve won't leak. I've been keeping it in a small sling bag and use it as a cooling cushion between my back and a chair while sitting outside in 90\u00b0F heat. Of course I also drink water from it as well. Holds just enough water to keep me from feeling dehydrated while I'm walking about. I haven't strictly measured it's volume but I strongly feel that it only holds about 10 oz. of water, not the advertised 12 oz. I'm not deducting a star for that because the build quality, choice of materials, design, and the Camelbak lifetime warranty all combine to bake this a very worthwhile purchase for me and my needs. A few more things I feel I should mention...the inside of the flask is coated with an antimicrobial treatment (some kind of silver impregnation). I've just let my flask air dry and do far there's been no problems with gunk or funny tastes. The silicon bite valve can be pulled off for a more thorough cleaning or for attaching a drinking hose. And finally, there's a semi-stiff collar at the top of the flask to home on to while you tighten the cap. I've read reviews on the chill version of this flask that say that the chill version doesn't have this collar, which makes it very difficult to screw on the cap. The only difference between this and the QuickStow chill flask is that there's a thin layer of closed cell foam between the inner and outer layer of the chill flask. It's only supposed to keep liquids cool twice as long as this flask. Not enough to convince to buy it instead of this one. All in all I'm glad that I bought this Camelbak QuickStow flask. Matter of fact, I bought two!",

The first two times I used this bottle, it leaked from where the top screws into the bottom. I tried switching the tops between my two bottles, and that fixed the leaking issue. The top and/or bottom must have been machined in a way that the threads didn't line up when one or both is too close to their machining tolerance. If I didn't have the ability to switch them, I would have been very disappointed with how much it leaked in my belt pouch.",

They hold more than a juice pouch holds (but if you want less, just don't pour as much in). They are easy to fill, easy for my kids to use, durable, and easy to wash! I'm ordering more now so that when we return to in-person school, I can have a spare set if the kids lose one or if I forget to wash them before the morning. These can also be used by adults to pack along whatever beverage you enjoy ;)",
