I was looking for a bottle that could keep my water cool in the 100+ degree weather, as well as handle potentially being tossed around while hiking and rock climbing. With the insulating sleeve on this bottle was able to keep ice for hours in 90-107 degree weather. Approximately 4-6 hours. The bottle itself is also pretty tough. After being tossed around, dropped, and smacking into rocks the bottle only has a few scuffs. The bottle also comes with 2 different lids, a straw/bottle cleaner, has multiple pockets on the insulation sleeve, and has a paracord handle with a compass/fire starter attached to it. (the compass is cheap and doesn't work well though.) Great bottle.",

                "reviewText": "We love our water bottles! They do just as advertised and look great. I drink a lot of water and like it chilled so I was hoping for a bottle that is big enough to hold the water I drink and keep it cold. This bottle does the job exceptionally well. It has kept ice water cold inside the bottle for 2+ days. The only reason the ice melts is from me adding more room temperature water after I drink it all and even then, I only need to refill the ice once every couple of days - depending on how much I drink.The bottle colors look really nice and it has plenty of handles and grabbing points to carry it whichever way is most comfortable for you. The outside cover is great too. I used to walk out of the house with my waterbottle and a separate bag (or just juggle) with my cellphone, keys, and wallet but now I keep my cellphone and wallet inside the waterbottle\u2019s outer cover and my keys attached to the included clasp, so all I have to do is grab my waterbottle and I\u2019m good to go.I would highly recommend to those who need a waterbottle to keep items hot or cold, hold enough liquid for your needs, and/or need a couple extra pockets to store things along with your waterbottle.This product is well made and does the job! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I am loving this bottle. It keeps my refrigerated water cool all day, with no ice! All the comments work well. Easy to clean. The case is pretty nice, I like having the option to cross body the water bottle if I need to use my hands for something else. I also like the sturdiness of the Paracord handle. It also comes with 2 straws and a cleaning brush, which is handy. The only complaint I initially had was that I couldn't see the water level. Turns out I drink MORE because I can't gage how much is left!I did have an issue. The pour spout was missing it's seal ring. After a quick conversation with the provider, it has been resolved. Quick and productive seller.Totally worth the money",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this bottle for a road trip that involved a lot of outdoors time and hiking. My water and ice stayed cold for days. I love the versatility of different lids. The holster was something that I didn\u2019t think was necessary, but bought this anyway because I liked the color, size, and lid options. After using it, I am so glad it came with the holster! For shorter walks, this was perfect because the zipper pouch was perfect for my keys, chapstick, and credit cards, allowing me to leave my backpack behind when I didn\u2019t need the other items. I have several Yeti\u2019s, Stanley\u2019s, and an IronFlask. This is just as good as any of those. The screw on lid was leakproof for me. Awesome product.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this water bottle for 2 months now and it's still going strong!Pros:It doesn't leak from what I've experienced, but I only ever use the wide mouth lid. (I haven't tried the straw lid yet.) It also does a good job at keeping your drinks cold. One time, I filled it up with cold water before going to bed, and it was still cold in the morning! I also specifically bought this one compared to the competitors, for the strap and sleeve. The sleeve is made of some type of neoprene material. The pockets are big enough to fit my phone, chapstick, cash, cards, etc. I've also forgone the sleeve a few times and attached the strap just to the paracord handle instead, which seems to work pretty well (shown in 3rd pic).Cons:That being said, the spring in the cap literally broke the first time I ever used it which was disappointing (shown in pics 1 and 2). Only one side broke, so the cap still functions fine for now. The 32 oz size is just barely too big to fit in my car's cup holder, but that's expected so not a big deal. Just keep that in mind if that's a feature you need. Also, the silicone boot doesn't stay on very well. I had to constantly slip it back on. While at work yesterday, it came off again and I never found it, so that sucks...I would've gave it a 5 star rating, but it's -1 star for the lid breaking the very first use :(Overall, I'm happy with the price for the quality and everything included. I can tell this bottle is gonna last me awhile, I would purchase again!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 1 Gallon (128 oz) size in Red & Purple. I LOVE it! I like the size as it'll keep me motivated to finish off drinking AT LEAST a gallon a day of water. This also comes with the cozy which you can carry your phone and keys attached to it into the gym. I love that feature because this will be great to carry along things I need with me at the gym. There's a compass and a whistle attached. I do go hiking in the mountains so those may come in handy when I'm in the outdoors. There's straws that come with this but the straws are the only draw back for me personally because they're not tall enough for this size of a water bottle. I was really hoping for a tall enough straw. Hopefully one day soon this brand will offer a taller reusable straw because that's all this needs to become a completely perfect product. Shipping was awesome, it came a day earlier than expected and it was all packed so nicely with care.",
