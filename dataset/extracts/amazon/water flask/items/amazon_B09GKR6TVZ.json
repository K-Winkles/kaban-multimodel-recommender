                "reviewText": "I bought this for the specific purpose of having a solid reusable water jug for work, and after using it for a couple weeks now, I can say this thing is as solid as can be. I keep it my truck while working and has proven to be leak proof and durable.The drawback of it is that it is pretty heavy (stainless steel and full of water) so if you're looking for a more mobile, easy to carry for regular use I'd go with maybe a half gallon size. Personally I don't mind the weight of this at all because it sits in the middle of my truck while working.The gallon jug come with the open mouth lid that you can unscrew and drink from as well as a lid fitted with a straw and an extra straw. I use the straw lid because it's easier to pick up and drink while sitting in the truck as I get back in after a stop. Note, the straw isn't the easiest to use compared to a typical straw with it being long and in a gallon jug, but again it's perfect for me I don't mind.This is a perfect gallon jug for work that keeps my water cold all day. Put enough ice in it and it will keep the ice just fine and keep the water ice cold. At first I didn't put enough ice and it just melted. After using it a bunch of times now I added more ice and by the end of the day now there's still a big ice chunk in the jug.",

                "reviewText": "I did extensive research to find the best gallon sold on Amazon and I haven\u2019t found anything better.Before getting into the details of this particular bottle, I will say having a gallon size bottle truly does make it easier for you to stay hydrated throughout the day. Convenience and having a more sturdy and permanent bottle (I was just using a plastic $1 gallon jug from Walmart at the time\u2026) to drink from were important factors for me when shopping.In terms of the bottle, a few things I noticed while using it for the last few months:1. You want the cap with a straw. I believe Ironflask sells one with and one without - make sure you get one with the straw cap.. I actually bought a different 1 gallon bottle and returned it for this one because of this very reason. The straw makes drinking out of this so much easier - with a pour lid, you have to constantly unscrew the cap and pick the heavy gallon jug up towards your mouth which can get messy/annoying. Some bottles will give you a long straw that you can just put into the bottle but I found that to be cumbersome and not very sanitary given you had to touch the straw all the time.2. As some reviewers have noted, it\u2019s best to open and close the lid by the base of the lid and not the handles. Using the handles may lead to the handles breaking. I have used mine everyday and have not found any wear3. Nothing to complain about regarding insulation. I\u2019ve taken this thing out to the field on a hot day and it has kept my water cold the entire time. But I have not done any particular experimentation on how long it stays cool.. check some of the other reviews4. Easy to clean - the wide mouth of the bottle makes it pretty easy to clean. It\u2019s important to be able to clean this thing often5. One downside is that it doesn\u2019t come with a rubber sleeve for the bottom of the bottle like some of the other brands. Not a deal breaker but given the size and weight of the bottle, it can get scratched and dinged up if are just putting it down carelessly.All in all a great bottle for the price. Some of the other name brands like yeti and hydro flask charge +$100 for something similar.. no way I\u2019d pay that much especially if I can get something like this with the same functionality at a fraction of the price.",

The 84 Oz bottle is a larger than usual bottle compared to the popular 64 oz flask.Its impressive and bigger size is equipped with a larger Lid of 2 types. A straw and open mouth to allow easy drinking of water. Personally I prefer the open mouth lid as you can drink more water faster.It keeps water cold for a long time, you could fill it up and drink it the next morning. It will still be cold and last for many hours after that.As a very active person, the 84 oz is the ideal amount of water for me to consume. Enough to support my lifestyle across personal and work and in the middle of my intense workout. As a person currently pursuing a body fat loss diet with results, drinking more water does help.The 84 oz bottle may be for you if you find yourself relating to any of my circumstances.",

There\u2019s so many plastic gallon bottles, but 1. Water taste way better from stainless steel and easier to clean 2. Plastic breaks down over time and can get in water 3. The wide mouth makes it SO easy to clean and add ice if you want. 4.

Do we will see over the long haul.It's a sturdy, nice looking, easy to drink out of with it's one button function to drink out of. Where you can use it with a straw or without one. I happen to like using this straw. They include two straws as well as including two tops. They give you a cleaning brush as well. I don't think people need it but that's great that they included. You should not put it in the freezer or microwave and I believe you should not put it in the dishwasher and there's really no need to especially if you just use water in it. Washing it with soap weekly will be just fine. The handle is well constructed and easy to grip. The bottom has a anti-slip material as well. definitely 5/5 and I have tried quite a few bottles as I'm picky. Well worth the money. At least so far.",
