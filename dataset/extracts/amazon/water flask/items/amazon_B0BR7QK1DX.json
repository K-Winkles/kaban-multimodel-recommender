                "reviewText": "This is the best cup I've ever purchased!!! I ordered the black sparkle and it's perfect!! I bought this because I'm currently taking medicine that is dehydrating me, and I was sick of going back and forth to the fridge constantly. This makes things so much easier and it's amazing how cold it keeps water! One day I had to leave it in the car for about 5 hours with it being 95\u00b0 and when I took a sip it was still ice cold (without ice)!! It's easy to clean, easy to carry, and I love the non-skid bottom! It's perfect for traveling, hiking, and just everyday use. I 100% recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 5 gallon water bottles trying to find the right one. I sent the other 5 back. Hard to find hot pink. It is really just shy of fluorescent. It is 2 very sturdy-feeling lids/handles. What I love most is the metal is slick. I can put decals or paint it. Most of these jugs have that rough powder coating on them. I\u2019m excited to give this as a gift. Have not used it yet, but will update if it isn\u2019t 5 stars once she starts using it.",
