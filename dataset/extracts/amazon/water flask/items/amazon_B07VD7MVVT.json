                "reviewText": "I've been through a lot of water bottles that I stop using pretty quickly. They don't keep temperature at all, and I get bored of the flavor of room temperature water too quickly. I figured it was time for a real water bottle that can keep my drinks cold and refreshing. I was skeptical when I found this product, because it's such an affordable price, but I bought it based on reviews. I'm so glad I did, because I finally found the only water bottle I'll ever need.Unlike most drinkware brands, this one actually DOES keep drinks cold, and for a long time, too! I'm a delivery driver, and kept it in my car with me this summer while working. Even after 10 hours of sitting in my car in the hot sun, my drink would still be just about as ice cold as when I'd left the house! The bottle itself would get pretty hot, and yet the drink inside still had ice and everything. I couldn't believe how well this thing works!I know there are some complaints about leaking in some reviews. I haven't experienced any leaks. I never have to screw the cap on tightly at all, and it seals great. If the bottle is lying down on my seat, I do notice there will be a little condensation around the closed spout on the lid, but it has never leaked. I think keeping this bottle just for cold drinks will help it last longer and prevent any issues (but if you like hot drinks, there are so many colors to choose from, why not buy one color for cold and one for hot?) Also, since it can get pretty heavy when filled, I try to avoid using the carrying handle. I suspect the strain of using it might weaken the seal inside the cap. It also seems like it might break over time if used too much. I would recommend buying a carrying strap instead to best protect your nice bottle.My sticker didn't adhere to the bottle at first, and kept trying to peel off, but once I left my bottle in the hot sun, the sticker stayed permanently. So if you have any issues decorating your bottle, just warm it up in the sun, first!I love the two straws, so you can swap them out for easy cleaning, and it even came with a straw brush! I'm so glad it came with the extra goodies, it makes it so easy to swap out for a fresh straw (especially at a time where we should be very cautious of germs). The mouthpiece is a hard plastic, but covered in a rubbery coating, so you won't bust your teeth on it, which is a cool detail. The flip-top straw works really well and has never given me issues, unlike past water bottles.This one fits inside the big cupholder of my Mustang, but it doesn't fit in my Mazda's cupholders. But with a large water bottle, it's gotta be expected. Like I said, I've never had any issues with it leaking while lying in the seat all day.",

I\u2019m trying to get rid of as much plastic storage for food and drinks as possible, and as someone who sips on ice water all day, this was a big one for me.I wish I\u2019d done this years ago! It stays cold enough that I still have a little ice left at 9pm, after starting to use it at 7am. I don\u2019t have an ice dispenser, so I just fill it 2/3 of the way with water and leave it in the freezer overnight. Works beautifully. Really pretty color, too!I\u2019ll be buying a second one at some point, just to be able to alternate. Highly recommend!",

It actually ruined one of my books :/ I'm not sure how it keeps happening because I do make sure it's closed tight- maybe from the straw opening? Otherwise, it is durable and very cute.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This water bottle is AMAZING! The colors are very vibrant and the design of the lid is both functional and sleek looking. The handle makes it easy to carry, though I did take one star off of the \u201ceasy to hold\u201d category because the 32oz bottle is too wide for my car\u2019s cup holders.As you can see from my video, if the spout is in the \u201cclosed\u201d position, the bottle doesn\u2019t leak at all. This was such a positive for me, since my previous water bottles have all leaked. I have also had issues with other bottles (*cough cough* Camelbak) shooting water out of the spout/straw when screwing the lid on or when the bottle has been sitting in a hot car for a little while. As you all know, getting splashed in the face when trying to take a sip of water is just...SO fun. So far I have not experienced that with this VMini bottle.In addition to being essentially leak proof, this bottle is extremely well insulated. Right now it\u2019s 11am and I\u2019m drinking ice water that I put in this bottle last night at 9pm. The ice has melted but the water is still EXTREMELY cold. I could easily see this bottle keeping ice water cold for 24 hours as it\u2019s been 14 hours so far and the temperature of the water hasn\u2019t changed much at all.As far as wear and tear, I can\u2019t attest to durability over time as I\u2019ve only had it a few days, but so far I have dropped it a few times and there\u2019s not so much as a ding or chip on the bottle. I\u2019m VERY clumsy so that\u2019s a huge plus for me!In summary, if you are looking for a new water bottle and are worried about spending more than 20 bucks on this one, I want to reassure you that it is WELL worth it. I\u2019m so glad I made this purchase!",

Nice thing is the outside coating - easy to hold even when you have sweaty hands. Love the Nectarine colour and got the Ice Floe for my husband. Well worth the money, and I got them on a timed deal - even better! No leaks, and I really like the handle which is nice and big for my arthritic hands.",
