                "reviewText": "I love the style, design, and color of this insulated water bottle, but it honestly doesn't keep my beverages cold for as long as I would have expected being from a company like Reebok. I figured with a huge name like Reebok, and for the price, that this would be a great product. Overall it is an awesome bottle, but I have a few no name brand insulated cups that pretty much keep my drinks cold without the ice melting for half a day if not longer. I did receive this bottle when there was a bad heat wave going through my area for two straight weeks, and it did pretty much stay around 85 up until this past week, but I would've still figured I could make it half a day without my ice melting. I almost feel like I should give this bottle a 3 out of 5 but I really love the color and overall design of it. I am hoping my first few uses of it were just a fluke considering the outside temperatures were 90+. Cleaning it isn't hard and I love the fact that it comes with a straw that attaches to the inside bottom of the mouth piece on the lid because it allows for drinking without having to tilt up which can sometimes be an issue with ice and these types of cups, and is also usually noisy. With the straw attached inside though and not having to tilt the bottle for a drink, there is no noise created by the ice clinking the sides of the steel which can be a major plus if you need to be quiet while drinking at work or something. Overall I would recommend this product because I love it, I just wish it would keep my drinks colder for at least half a day without the ice melting, but it still works well as long as you don't let it sit for 6 hours or so and you actually drink in a timely manner.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice quality water bottle that I think will be very durable as it's made of stainless steel. Because of the stainless steel, it is rather heavy when filled, but not so heavy that you can't lift it with one hand. The bottle is completely round, but the paint has a little grit to it to make it more grippable than if it had a completely smooth surface.The lid screws on easily and tightly to prevent leakage, and the spout folds down and lifts up to take a drink through the attached straw. It does make a whistling sound when sipping from it. I don't know if that's because I didn't get it attached tightly enough after washing it, or it just makes that noise. The straw was a little difficult to get pulled out so I could clean it thoroughly before use, and getting it back was also a struggle. But I wouldn't want to not take the straw off for cleaning as I don't think you can clean well enough without doing so.There is a carrying handle that is easy enough to carry with a couple of fingers, although given its weight when full, you might have to switch hands or have your fingers go numb.This bottle is a great one for my college aged son to carry to and from classes to keep hydrated while he's working, or to use during his workouts.",
