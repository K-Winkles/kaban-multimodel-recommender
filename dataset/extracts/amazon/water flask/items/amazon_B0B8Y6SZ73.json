                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the DIGJUPER 64 oz Insulated Water Bottle Stainless Steel for myself, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. This water bottle has seamlessly integrated into my daily routine, offering a combination of practicality and style that has exceeded my expectations.Living in a hot climate, it's crucial for me to stay hydrated wherever I go. The user-friendly design of this water bottle has made it a breeze to use, from its easy filling and cleaning to its exceptional portability.I opted for a vibrant pink/yellow combination that not only reflects my personal style but also stands out in a crowd. Beyond the aesthetic appeal, what truly sets this water bottle apart is its impressive ability to keep ice water refreshingly cold throughout the entire day. It has become my constant companion during outdoor activities, turning hydration into a delightful experience.The thoughtful inclusion of a silicone base caught my attention, providing not only protection for the bottle but also for surfaces wherever I place it. It's these small yet considerate details that make the DIGJUPER water bottle a standout choice.While the accessories like the whistle, compass, and flint weren't the primary selling point for me, I appreciate their inclusion. They add an extra layer of functionality that might come in handy for my outdoor adventures. The fact that they fit seamlessly into my backpack's side pouch is a convenient bonus.In summary, the DIGJUPER 64 oz Insulated Water Bottle Stainless Steel has become more than just a hydration tool for me; it's a stylish and reliable companion that enhances my daily experiences. If you're in search of a water bottle that seamlessly blends style with substance, I highly recommend giving this one a try.",

                "reviewText": "I love this bottle. It's a great alternative to the Bindle sip-and-stash (which was recalled). I'm a regular moderate hiker and need my hands free for my dog and general peace of mind. I really don't like water much but I need it to survive or whatever so figured I might as well invest in a good transportation method to get liquid from sink to mouth.Pros:- variety of sizes for preference (I got the 40oz). It's tall and thin and overall a comfortable size.- the sleeve is VERY easy to slide on and off and can hold my phone, keys, headphones, and a granola bar or two. Bindle had a screw-off compartment on the bottom, so the bottle was the size of a 32oz when it only had a ~20oz capacity. (Plus, the metal on metal base was an absolute menace.) Bindle's sleeve concept was more of a \"yoga\" sleeve (think water bottle leggings) that took so much effort to put on and take off and eventually wore out via use and stretching. This bottle's sleeve is light years better.- double handle (paracord) makes it so much easier to grab than the typical cap handle that I didn't think I'd like as much as I do but it's a game changer (AND it has a compass - OMG for the directionally challenged like myself)- plenty of clasps to attach extra stuff to (I attach dog waste bags and a collapsible water bowl on a caribeener).- silicone base is easy to pop on if you need to make sure to prevent the bottom of the bottle from scratching up surfaces when it does not have the sleeve (nice touch I won't use much personally)- came with one of each lid option (straw and non) and two straws with a pipe cleaner. Nothing was sold separately or considered an extra.- replacement lids available on their Amazon store when it gets too gross to clean anymore (wish these were a bit cheaper though).- super cute color combos and a great surface for stickers.Cons:- Literally none.- Buy it.- I love this bottle so much.Not sure how/why I went so long without it. I would've spent $50 on this bottle, but thankfully it's affordable and the quality is just spectacular. I'm not endorsed or anything I just seriously freaking love this bottle and I will shout it from the rooftops.Hopefully there's no lead, lol (goodbye forever Bindle).",

                "reviewText": "Good quality water bottle and stays cold for a full 2 days when filled halfway with ice. It has 2 easy ways to carry it, the paracord and a plastic loop attached to the top of the bottle. The different lids are cool in case you prefer one over the other, or want to switch them out. I haven't used the carrying case at all so I can't speak to that. Overall, very pleased with the quality.The one con is the compass doesn't work, or at least not consistently. It has an air bubble which makes it not work very well. I'm not particularly bothered, but it is something to keep in mind given other reviews report that as well. Also, something I didn't consider before: cleaning is a bit tricky given how big it is, but I just had to buy an extra long cup scrub brush and that works fine. The regular dish brush I had at home was not nearly long enough to reach the bottom.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought the 64 oz (1/2 gallon) yellow-orange-pink insulated bottle. I needed something large for my daughters cheer practice that was durable. I like that she can wear it as a bag. The material is nice quality. It comes with 2 different lids. My only critique with the straw lid is that the spout is exposed to germs. It does come with 2 straws and a brush. The jug type top is fully enclosed which is the one my daughter uses. I love the brightness of the colors and they look just like the photo. The rubber protector piece at the bottom prevents the metal from getting scuffed in the event you wanted to use it outside of the black bag. The black bag is fitted so does slide off easy. The compass is a cute detail. There is not even a drop that comes out when I shake the bottle upside down with water - so the seal is good. It keeps the drink cold and meets all my expectations. This was a good find. Thank you.",
