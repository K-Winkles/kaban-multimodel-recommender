                "reviewText": "I recently got this the 32oz Stainless Steel Tumbler, in the retro mint color. This is actually my first real large insulated tumbler and I\u2019m shocked by how much I love it! it has exceeded all my expectations. I now understand the hype about stainless steel tumblers because this is one of the best water bottles I have ever used. It literally changed the way I keep hydrated especially when I barley drank even a single cup of water yet alone now drinking 32oz and some days even more.Firstly, the 2-in-1 lid is awesome. The ability to switch between the chug lid and straw lid without the hassle of carrying extra parts is incredibly practical and convenient. I\u2019ll be honest, I prefer the straw lid rather that the chug. It seems like every time I use the chug side; I end up spilling water on myself. It is bulky but the handle makes It's perfect to carry around. Personally, I carry it around with me throughout my home or during my physical therapy sessions. Even when I go out to my appointments, it still fits in my tote bag and it really doesn\u2019t get in the way. Actually I do want to point out, the tumbler is so secure that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything spilling out.One of the reasons, I never really enjoyed water was because I like my water super cold. I literally fill up the entire tumbler with ice, to the top before filling it up with water. The description says It keeps drinks icy cold for 24 hours but for the past few weeks that I have been using it, this tumbler has even held up to over 48 hours. One thing I cannot confirm is if the tumbler actually keeps beverages hot for over 12 hours, but I\u2019m pretty confident if it is keeping my water cold for up to 2 days, I can\u2019t imagine why it wouldn\u2019t keep beverages hot. I'm really impressed with how it maintains the temperature of my water, which I think is one of the biggest reasons why I have started drinking more water because I\u2019m able to sip it throughout the day and each sip my water is still super cold.When I first got this tumbler, I thought the most challenging part would be the maintenance but I found it really easy to clean on a daily basis. I would really recommend to make sure you wash your lid daily, just to keep it from getting any bacteria. So far a sponge with dish soap and warm water, has worked really well. Sometime, I will take a small dish with water and soap, throw the lid in and let it soak for a few minutes, then rinse it off. Lastly, the aesthetic appeal of this tumbler can't be overlooked. It's stylish and comes with a silicone boot that I really thought it would only be needed if you are using the tumbler in your car, but actually it\u2019s great for other uses like keeps it from sliding on the table while also protecting the tumbler itself. It\u2019s almost as if it has its own personal coaster.Overall, I highly recommend this Stainless Steel Tumbler to anyone looking for a reliable, stylish, and functional bottle. Plus, it\u2019s great for anyone who is looking to increase their daily hydration needs. I really didn\u2019t realize how dehydrated I was and ever since I started using a tumbler I see a huge difference especially in my energy levels.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a lot of different water bottles of different sizes, materials, etc. This is the best one I've had; I'd even say it's surprisingly good.- It really does keep water cold for a long time. I mean a lonnnng time - way longer than you'd ever need it to! I like to put ice in my water, and the first time I used it, I left it on my desk overnight and then was stunned to pick it up the following morning and find that not only was the water still cold: the ice had not even melted away! Impressive, to say the least.- This is the first bottle I've had where the water didn't taste plastic or metallic, or just plain stale, especially after sitting for a couple of hours. Not so with this Gedux tumbler! Especially with the ice, the water just tastes clear and cold, even after many hours. As a matter of fact, I've never taken a drink out of this bottle and had that \"blech\" reaction.- The build feels super solid: not only the body, but also the handle, the \"straw\", and the flippy thing on the lid (I just realized that I have no idea what it's called) that you open to drink. These points usually seem flimsier than they should be, and you just know straight out of the box that they're going to be the first things to break; but I mostly use the straw because it's so convenient, and I don't see it breaking any time soon.- The size is right. I sit in front of my computer, working, for hours at a time. Some bottles I've had were too small, so that I'd drink the whole thing pretty quickly and then be parched by the time I managed to break away from my desk and refill the thing.- On the other end of the spectrum, I've had one of those big 2 liter behemoths: it was heavy and awkward to carry, and not insulated so that the water was stale before I'd gone 20% of the way through the bottle. Worst of all, it was so huge that I felt like a baby drinking from a milk bottle - not a good look on a Zoom call for work, if you ask me.- This one is 32 oz., or a little less than a liter. Big enough to last me a while, but small enough to fit in a cup holder. It's easy to carry, especially with the nice handle. The size isn't an issue because the water stays fresh and cold, so I can drink it at my own pace throughout the day.I have to admit that I don't really *love* water, after a lifetime of surviving mostly on coffee. But I feel so much better when I drink more of it! And all you have to do is read a couple of articles on what water does for your blood, your brain, your organs -- well, everything, really -- to make you realize you need to be drinking more of it.And with this bottle, I finally am. As a matter of fact, I'm drinking more water using this 1 liter-ish bottle than I ever did with the \"looks like it was made for Godzilla\" 2 liter bottle! I'm very happy to have found the Gedux bottle, and I recommend it fully.",

                "reviewText": "This water bottle was ordered in the color \"blush\" and it looks like the picture, except it is a bit darker. The product was advertised as keeping cold drinks cold for 24 hours and I found this to be true with ice water as the ice was present in the bottle for about that long. The lid screws on and off easily and the bottle does not leak. I found it easy to drink from. The spout has a cap over it which easily pops off when you release it with the button. The straw side also works well and I appreciate that you can put the drinking straw into a down position, so that it does not get dirty. Two plastic straws are included with the bottle. The convenient handle is made of a heavy plastic and there is a rubber cuff on the bottom of the bottle. Overall, this water bottle is very heavy duty as it is made of thick metal and solid plastic, and yet it is dishwasher safe. This is an amazing water bottle that I would order again!",
