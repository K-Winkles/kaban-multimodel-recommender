It doesn\u2019t stay hot past 8 hours I would say BUT I don\u2019t need it to stay hot for that long so if you\u2019re looking for a 4 hour heated drink this one is it! Aside from that I love it !",

It replaced a cheap bottle that couldn't keep cold/ hot liquids so for even 2 hours. I have not tested yet. Will update later. The lanyard (photo) was wrapped around with a glue layer and large thick band. Total overkill. I don't know if I can remove the glue without tearing the cloth. I'll get back to you on that as well.UPDATEThe vendor refunded my money and allowed me to keep. I can honestly state it keeps hot for almost 5 hours which is plenty of time.",
