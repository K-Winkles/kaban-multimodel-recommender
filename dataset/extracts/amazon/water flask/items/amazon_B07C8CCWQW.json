            "Dual Insulated Walls - Dual insulated, doubled layered walls ensure drinks stay at a constant temperature as to the same temperature of the original beverage. Two powerful walls facilitate keeping the perfect temperature while a vacuum seal helps prevent liquid seeping the outer wall.",
            "2 Special Lids - 2 special and unique lids that both optimize drinking beverages and eliminate spills and splashes. Keep beverages within an airtight seal to prevent any accidental leaks due to minor drops and falls. Worry less about spills and more about enjoying your beverage.",
            "Fully Hydrated 40 OZ. - Stay fully hydrated all-day-long with 40 oz. of liquid. Take it to the park, gym, office, or hike and ensure there is plenty of your liquid remaining. A sleek, jet black color scheme with a unique anti-sweat design provides less slipping when holding the tumbler.",
            "Eco-Friendly Design - Completely eliminate the poor decision of continually buying plastic bottles or materials for drinking. These plastics continue to damage and destroy our environment so by choosing Dione, our tumbler is BPA-Free and dishwasher available to wash, clean, and reuse again and again."

                "reviewText": "The actual bottle itself is great! It very easy to clean and keeps my water room temperature, even if sitting in the car. I dropped a star because the coloring is cheap. The white swirly design smudged and got ugly after a week of use. I figured it was just cheap white paint so I tried to remove it with nail polish remover. But then the black also came up as well! Beware that this is a silver bottle painted different colors. It\u2019s not a colored plastic outer coating. But it\u2019s cheaper than a hydro so you get what you pay for. I ordered some cute stickers to put on it.",

                "reviewText": "My family has mostly purchased Hydroflask insulated water bottles. I saw this on Amazon for less than half the price with good reviews and I caved in and bought it. The water bottle looks nice on the outside. However, on my first use, I noticed that all the ice had melted after about 4 hours, and the water started to get warm after about 6-7 hours. I have it another couple of tries, and the results were always the same. This \u201cinsulated bottle\u201d has nowhere near the same quality of insulation as our hydroflask water bottles. The two caps are a nice touch. However, one cap does not screw on completely, and it will sometimes fall off. The strap on that cap broke off the 3rd time I used it. Bottom line, I don\u2019t think this bottle is built well, and I would have returned it except that I didn\u2019t start the return during the 30 day window. Darn. Guess I have a large water bottle that doesn\u2019t insulate very well\u2026",

Having to remove that top many times to drink from it, ice melts much quicker than the times given. Sport flip to is useless. Carrying handle is way too small and you can\u2019t drink from it because your nose gets in the way. I have a small nose and it still doesn\u2019t work. That is the only bad thing otherwise great water bottle!",
