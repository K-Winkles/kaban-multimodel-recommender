Based on intermittent drink. Ice cube and cooling time will decrease as more water is consumed. To extend the time, add ice cubes while refill the water. Why the jug is leaking? Tighten the lid and cap to ensure the silicone gasket is airtight to leak proof. Lying down for long times will lead to water beading on lids from condensation phenomena. How to use the straw? One end of the straw is silicone. It is inserted down into the jug bottom. The other end of the straw connects the funnel for sip. The next time sip water and open the cap, the silicone will bounce and stick out of the mouth of the jug. Can straws be fixed on the lid? Compared fixed in the lid. Design of separate straws is easy to remove and clean. Tighten the lid and insert the straw effortlessly. It avoids the hard to tighten the lid after filling it with ice. When you don't need the straw, take it off. Which service coverage of the jug? Within 18 months, any fault caused by non-human reason we will provide replacement for the jug.

                "reviewText": "I drink a LOT of liquids throughout the day and this is the first thermos I've ever had that feels like it keeps up with me. It's gigantic and heavy (It's a full gallon, so - duh) but I don't travel with it, so It's my constant companion at my home office. It keeps my water ice cold throughout the day. The ultra-wide mouth makes it easy to get my orangutan hands in and clean it. I've knocked it over several times and it doesn't leak (unless the straw hole is open. Again, Duh) I love the inclusion of the extra-long silicone straw, and I especially love the green color. Highly recommended.",
