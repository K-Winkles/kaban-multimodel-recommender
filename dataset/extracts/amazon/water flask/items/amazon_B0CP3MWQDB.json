That's when something like this would come in handy for me, just on the off chance I need to use water from a questionable source. As such, this is a handy kit to have on hand. It's mostly easy to assemble, and comes with two different sizes of straws that should fit most standard water bottles.The filter does not change the taste of the water in any noticeable way. You do have to remember not to set the filter right at the bottom of your bottle, or it can't draw any water in. Then you can just fill your bottle and go with your clean water.The only problem I have with this system...and I think it's significant...is that the straws are made from a very stiff plastic and are hard to attach to your water bottle. Even though two of the straws are 8 mm, the same gauge as my water bottle, I was not able to get them on. Fortunately, the straw from my bottle was able to fit into the filter, so I could use it . It would be much better if the straws were made from a slightly more flexible plastic so they could be attached more easily.This one will be going into storage for now, against the day when I will actually need it. It will be helpful knowing it's there.",

I tend to favour coffee, juice, or flavoured water. Recently I noticed that mindlessly sipping from a straw cup while working from home at my computer desk is the best way for me to hydrate with plain water. Even then, even though I was drinking more than I used to, I was struggling to drink 1 large bottle/day.Last night, I got this to attach to my insulated tumbler that has an opening large enough for the widest straw that came with this kit. Setup was very quick and easy. I sipped away while watching TV with my family, and before I knew it, I had gone through 2 large bottles of water within 2 hours!The water tastes amazingly refreshing with this straw! It's designed to go in travel bottles, but it's so easy to transfer and use in any cup that you want to drink from with a straw.I did download the free WaterH app, thinking it would help me track my water consumption and filter life. However, unless you own one of their branded smart water bottles, it won't do much more than other generic water tracking apps.All in all, I am very happy to have found something so simple that will help me stay hydrated regularly.",

I haven\u2019t actually tried the water with it yet because it doesn\u2019t work in the shaker bottles I use. It sort of bobs in the water since it doesn\u2019t hold to any straw in the lid. I still want to try it but was trying to come up with a better solution/or a more suitable bottle.I can\u2019t attest to the water quality. It\u2019s a bit odd in their description they mention it will be good for 2 months or 40 gallons of tap water. I don\u2019t know how much water you all drink but 40 gallons is a lot! Not sure about their numbers for gallons, probably the 2 months is more accurate. We\u2019ll see.It comes with multiple straws you can adjust to the size of your bottle.Giving it provisional 4 stars pending testing!If it does what it says 27$ is a decent price for the convenience factor.",
