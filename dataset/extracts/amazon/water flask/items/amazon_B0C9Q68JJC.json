                "reviewText": "a very very trash cup!! I am utterly disappointed and angered by this purchase. The cup is an absolute disaster. Shortly after buying it, the lid started leaking, which is a clear indication of its poor quality. The drinking spout is uncomfortably hard, making it a pain to use. To make matters worse, there's an awful smell that becomes especially unbearable when the cup is filled with hot water. Drinking from it is a struggle, as the water hardly comes up through the spout.what a waste of money, jesus.. far inferior to even a random $5 cup from a store. It's an extremely poor-quality product and has resulted in a terrible shopping experience. I will never purchase from this brand again and am highly suspicious that the positive reviews are fabricated.",

We decided to browse online, and she chose this water bottle, which she absolutely loves. It comes in a lovely color, has a perfect seal, and conveniently fits into the outside pocket of her backpack.",

I can put ice in this cup and it will stay icy cold for hours- I mean HOURS! The bottle came in perfect condition- no dents or paint chipping. There is also no leakage! I am think about buying another one!",
