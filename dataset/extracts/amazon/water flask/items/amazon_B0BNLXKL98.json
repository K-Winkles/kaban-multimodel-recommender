I ran mine in the dishwasher many times already, and the bottle is still as beautiful as on the day I bought it.",

The cup is of great wuality and stores water cold (esp if you put some ice in there) for a very long time (about 20 hours w just a little bit of ice). 40 oz is a good size without making the container overly big. The loop on the top makes it easy to hold onto I like the smaller water spout part - perfect for my son to bring to the pool when he swims and quickly remove to take a sip during his swim team training. Can\u2019t complain when I saw this item during Amazon day",

It doesn't have a lot of complex hard to clean nozzles that get dirt and bacteria build up, or folded over sections that get the same. It doesn't leak, it's easy to carry, and looks great. Note: make sure to get the smaller size if you want one that'll fit in cupholders and the like.",

They are great at holding a lot of water and keeping stuff cold- maybe just better for not young kids using backpacks.",

One tip - when you fill it after passing through TSA, you only need to fill it about 1/4 full of ice (unless you want to have ice 6 or 8 hours later).Easy to carry, no spills, overall good item.",
