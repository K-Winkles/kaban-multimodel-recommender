                "reviewText": "This water bottle meets my needs. All my water bottles prior to this one are 32 oz. Nothing wrong with that but at times I found myself wishing they would be slightly smaller to fit a pocket, a hole, a bag or things of that nature. I decided to get a smaller bottle and 22 oz seems like a good idea (since anything smaller than that probably won't work for me).This bottle definitely fits more places than my 32 oz ones so I definitely got what I wanted in that aspect. Very easy to carry around.The power coating is the kind of surface/texture I like and it also helps with grip. There's no rubber /silicone ring underneath the bottle so it clangs if you slam it when you put it down.I appreciate the rotating handle. The mouth is wide enough for ice but not enough to stick your hand in there when washing. I use a sponge with a handle. The lid is a simple screw on. No straw, no accessories or anything. I don't really care much for those usually.I recently took it on a sports trip with me. It was in a pocket on my carry on bag which I put under a passenger seat (so the bottle was horizontal most of the time). There was no leak or anything.I'm not much of a light colored or pastel colored bottles. I personally prefer solid colors, leaning towards dark colors like navy, purple, wine red. The ombre is pretty, though. So I do wish and hope they will come out with darker colors with this product.The color preference doesn't take away that fact that I think this bottle is great. If you want a simple and fuss free water bottle, give this one some consideration.",

                "reviewText": "I am the mom and a family where we have about 50 of these expensive, high and water bottles. For myself, this is my favorite one.I don\u2019t like the big gulp mouthpieces and I also don\u2019t like the straws or the silicone sippy cup devices. I like that this one has just a small opening where you can gulp it kind of like a disposable water bottle that you purchase at the gas station. The screw is extremely strong on the part where you open to sip it. It has a handle, which is not soft silicone, but it\u2019s not hard either, kind of like a hard rubber, which is nice when you\u2019re carrying it with one or two fingers.I am completely obsessed with how beautiful the hombre coloring is. I chose the one that is lavender into baby blue, and it\u2019s just so freaking pretty!!! I can\u2019t tress that enough! It has a powder coating, so it doesn\u2019t slip out of your hand. I\u2019ve used it a lot, and it fits in every single cupholder in every single car, and I\u2019ve put it on the cement at parks, and at my sons tennis games, and it doesn\u2019t look scratched up at all, even though I\u2019ve not been very careful with it. Super durable!!!There\u2019s not too many silicone parts to remove and it\u2019s very easy and not time-consuming to clean, which is always a feature that you want and a water bottle like this.Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a stainless steel, double dash wall Water bottle, this is a great one to go with. Also, just gorgeous!Do not get a water bottle that will not fit in the cupholder of your car, because there\u2019s nothing more annoying than that!",

                "reviewText": "Vacuum bottles are great. This one comes in a decent little box with some bubble wrap. The paint looks good, the cap matches the paint very well, and it appears to be well made on the inside too. I like the 22 oz size for things like hot cocoa, wassail, or for a cold drink when its not super hot outside. For serious hydration during the summer you'll want a larger size, however. My only complaint with this bottle is the size of the drinking spout. As an adult male I like to consume my beverages at a decent rate, which is a bit difficult with the small spout. This will mostly get used by my girlfriend though (hence the blue/pink color) and she has a much lower consumption rate. Overall this is a nice bottle, especially considering the very reasonable asking price.",

                "reviewText": "This 22 oz tumbler is the best one yet.This is a really good size for a tumbler. Not too big, not too small.The colors are great.It fits in my car's cupholder.Hot liquids stay hot, cold liquids stay cold in this tumbler.The tumbler has a handle that can be used to carry the tumbler by hand or hook it on your backpackwith a carabiner.The lid is great. I've seen many types of lid closures that try to be too much, a straw and a sip and whatever. Trying to do too much ensures you don't do any of it well. The lid on this only does one thing, drink the liquid from what looks like a regular plastic bottle screw-on lid. It is simple, easy to clean, covers the opening, and is leak-free.I love it.",

                "reviewText": "I was immediately unsure of this because when I got it, it looked like the byproduct of graffiti or something. Still, it was a neat and interesting design, and then came the lid. It's different from any other water bottle I've ever used, and in a good way. It has a very secure closure, both at the spout and where the lid attaches. You can fill it up to the very top and it doesn't leak or splash out. I carry it every day when going to work, and despite the large capacity it fits in my backpack water bottle pouch, as well as my car cupholders. Love it!",
