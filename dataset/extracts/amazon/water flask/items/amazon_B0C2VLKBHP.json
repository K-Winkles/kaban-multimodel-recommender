                "reviewText": "This is my new favorite water bottle. It looks nice, holds 10-12 ounces, seals well (no leaks), and is sized such that I can slip it into my back pants pocket (most of the time, if they are somewhat roomy) or in a large coat or vest pocket. I take regular 1-2mile hikes, and was sick of carrying around water bottles holding twice as much water as I drink. This works perfectly, no excess weight and easy to pocket. I will also use backpacking for an easy access water bottle.One downside is that it looks like a flask, so people keep thinking I'm drinking alcohol, but not a big deal.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Sleek and stylish: The flat design definitely stands out and fits easily in bags or pockets. Plus, the oval shape feels comfortable to hold.Durable: The high-quality plastic feels sturdy and hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear yet.Leakproof: The lid seems to do a good job of keeping things sealed, no accidental spills in my backpack!Cons:Detachable lid: This was my biggest gripe. While I appreciate the easy cleaning, the separate lid feels like a potential disaster waiting to happen. I've already had a few close calls of losing it, and it adds an extra step every time I want to drink. A tethered lid or built-in straw would be a major improvement.Narrow mouth: The opening is a bit small for my taste, making it slow to drink from and hard to fit ice cubes in. A wider mouth would be more convenient.Overall:The ALLKELR is a decent bottle with a cool design, but the detachable lid and narrow mouth kept it from being a true winner for me. If you're looking for a stylish and leakproof option, it's worth a try, but I'd definitely recommend keeping an eye on that lid!3 out of 5 stars - Potential, but needs some work.",

                "reviewText": "We got 2 to fit in the pockets of our dog's backpack. No other water bottles would easily fit. These are tough and so far leak-proof. We have taken several hikes (5 miles+) and the amount of water 2 bottles hold provides enough for our dog. We pour from one bottle and then balance the remaining water between the 2 so the pack rides evenly on our dog's back. Only worry is potentially losing the cap because it isn't attached to the bottle. Very happy with our purchase.",
