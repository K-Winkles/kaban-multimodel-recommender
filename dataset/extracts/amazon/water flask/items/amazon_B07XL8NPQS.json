                "reviewText": "I bought this water bottle specifically to carry on an airplane. It's perfect for that because it rolls very small to store in a purse or carry on, then easily expands to fill at the water bottle filler on the other side of security. It holds plenty of water and seals tightly, plus the strap that holds it when rolled makes a nice handle when filled. It's great to put in backpack pockets AND seatback pockets on the plane because it's flexible even when full. The reason for only 4 stars is because the lid is completely unattached, and I forsee a time in the future when it will roll away from me across the concourse or down the plane aisle. If it were attached with a strap, chain, etc. it would be a full 5 stars. If they ever release a version with an attached lid, I'll buy a replacement immediately. I also recommend practicing drinking from it because if you hold it in the middle only, it's possible it will bend far enough to spill on yourself. It didn't actually happen, but it's an issue I didn't think about until I actually drank from it.",
