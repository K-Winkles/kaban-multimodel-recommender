Insulation is top-notch, I can brew piping hot coffee when I leave for work at 6 and it will still be warm hours later in the afternoon. Though usually the coffee is gone before lunch. I love the matte finish on the flask, it makes for a very striking and bold look. I also appreciate how narrow it is, and it fits in all of the cup holders in my car, work truck, and just about anywhere else.The lid is absolutely leak proof, have not had it spill one drop except for when I forget to snap it shut all the way. It closes very securely and I'm never worried about it opening in my bag or when being tossed into a backpack. The way that the drink spout opens, if I lean it too close, the underside of the actual spout cover is in the perfect place to deposit a tiny drop of coffee on my nose. Not the flask's fault, but it's funny nonetheless.Overall this is a wonderful device for keeping drinks hot or cold!",

It has made it through employment at a factory were is has been dropped on concrete, knocked over by robots, and splattered with machine oil. While I did manage to dent it, the finish is still perfect. It rolled down the gravel parking lot, the finish is still perfect. It has been hiking and kayaking in the summer and still had ice after 8 hours of 80\u00b0 weather. My husband had the larger version and swears if this brand ceases to exist he has no idea what he will do. I usually buy several insulated bottles a year due to my wear and tear, but haven\u2019t had to buy another since purchasing this bottle. I love that it came with the different lids, doesn\u2019t leak, and holds ice for well over 24 hours in an indoor environment.",

                "reviewText": "So I ordered 2 of the 24oz ones. See, I don't drink water unless it's cold, and I never get enough water because my family uses up the ice. I had taken to putting water bottles in my fridge and just refilling them with filtered tap water to save money, but eventually you still have to replace them. So, even if you're buying less bottles, you still have to buy them. Yetis are expensive, plus they are usually too big or heavy for me to carry around. The reviews were good on these and they looked good, so I took a chance and ordered two (for when one is being washed, I really don't drink enough water). These things are great. I keep 2 half gallon bottles in the fridge that I refill. Then i just use those to refill my cup. My water stays cold with no ice and I'm actually drinking more water than before. It takes no time to clean them, so I really only needed one, but hey, I'm good with two as well. I like the alternate lids, because I hate drinking out of the slot one. It's not too heavy and comes with a handy little dangly piece you can hold it by. Would not only recommend, but also buy them as gifts. It also comes in a rather attractive box, so just throw a bow on it and call it good!",
