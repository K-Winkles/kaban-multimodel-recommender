Let me tell you, I live in south Florida where it\u2019s very hot 24/7 and I took this water bottle to work at 6am and by the time it was night around 11pm there was still ice inside and it was very cold!!! This is amazing. I have not used something hot inside yet but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll keep things very hot. And I LOVE the way it can be held on your shoulder like a purse! Makes it very comfortable and convenient to carry all day. It comes with straw cleaners and you can switch between multiple different caps, whether you want a regular top or straw. It also DOES NOT LEAK. Also a big plus. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I work in the construction field in Texas and it gets HOT most of the year, so having cold water (and keeping it cold) is paramount. Since the advent of the double steel walled insulated \"drinking tech\" of the last few years, this problem has been solved. Unfortunately, your main name brands like to charge an exorbitant amount of money for basically the same thing other companies offer, such as this. This product works the same as the other high priced name brands, but for a fraction of the cost. Plus you get a few extras, noticeably the insulating neoprene cover/carrying case, straws and brush for the handled \"straw lid\".Couple cons though: Due to the straw lid, pouring water out of the spout is slow. You can't pour water out if the inner straw is attached and if the straw is removed, it's a dribble. Don't lose the lids inner o-ring or it will leak everywhere. I noticed a heavy chemical smell from the bottle halfway through the day of the bottle sitting in my truck. Seems heat and sun exposure to the LID creates this smell. I've washed it and kept it out of the sun and haven't noticed the smell coming back. Weird.Finally, while the cover works and is very cool, I don't think it'll last long term. While I do use it in a harsher work environment, I dont think the material is tough enough: The silver metal strap clasps, as well as the D rings they attach to are thin and flimsy. They have become unhooked on several occasions of normal walking with the strap over my shoulder and I would have dropped (and dented) the bottle if I didn't have a firm grip on the strap already. The pull tab on the zipper that's on the bottom of the cover is already missing after 2 weeks. There's also a secondary \"hand strap\" that is sewn to the outside of the cover, for what I'm assuming is to help with drinking but I don't trust the stitching...at all...not for neoprene anyways. I opted to buy a third party gallon carrying bag for my 87oz container and solved my problems. Just keep the old cover on the bottle, and it'll fit fine in the gallon bag.TL;DR: It's a good product for the price, but definitely could use some improvements.",
