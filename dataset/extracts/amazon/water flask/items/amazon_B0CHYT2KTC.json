                "reviewText": "I got this water bottle for a trip so I could have some water with me on the go without having to literally carry a big water bottle around. The strap and flat shape made carrying this bottle super convenient and comfortable. It never felt bulky or in the way and it looks pretty snazzy. The lid fits securely so I didn't have any leaks and there were no unpleasant tastes or odors even when brand new. The little pouch is perfect for carrying a little cash or card with you. The empty bottle packed easily in my suitcase.The bottle is only 18 ounces so this isn't going to be your best go-to for all day hikes, but for everyday walks, day trips, etc., it's pretty awesome. The only drawbacks for me are that it obviously doesn't fit in a cupholder and the small opening can make it little tricky at a water bottle refilling station. Those drawbacks do not come close to outweighing the positives. I definitely recommend this bottle!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Hydrte Travel Water Bottle in Nero Black, and I've been using it religiously for the past few weeks. Here's my honest take on this unique flat water bottle:Pros:Sleek and stylish design: The square, flat shape definitely stands out from the crowd. It's slim enough to fit in even the most crowded bag, and the Nero Black color looks sleek and sophisticated.Leakproof and convenient: I haven't experienced any leaks or spills, even when throwing the bottle into my bag. The screw-top lid is secure and easy to open and close with one hand.Comfortable to carry: The included carrying case and strap make it easy to tote around, whether you're on the go or just want to keep it handy at your desk.BPA-free and dishwasher safe: I appreciate the peace of mind knowing that the bottle is made from safe materials and is easy to clean.Cons:Limited capacity: At 18oz, the bottle isn't the biggest on the market. I found myself needing to refill it more often than I'm used to, especially on hot days or during workouts.Can be bulky when full: The flat design makes it a bit awkward to hold when full, especially with the carrying case attached. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not the most natural grip either.Cleaning the case can be tricky: The carrying case is great, but it can be a bit tough to clean thoroughly, especially the fabric strap.Overall:The Hydrte Travel Water Bottle is a stylish and convenient option for staying hydrated on the go. It's leakproof, easy to clean, and comes with a handy carrying case. However, the limited capacity and slightly bulky design might not be for everyone.Recommendation:If you're looking for a sleek and stylish water bottle that's easy to carry around, the Hydrte Travel Bottle is a great option. Just be aware of the smaller capacity and potential cleaning challenges with the carrying case.Rating: 4 out of 5 starsI hope this review helps you decide whether the Hydrte Travel Water Bottle is right for you!P.S. I noticed some reports of leaking issues with other Hydrte bottles online. While I haven't experienced this myself, it's something to keep in mind before you buy.",

                "reviewText": "Being in the middle of winter, I have not used this much yet and I don't know how it would turn out putting coffee in this. It is not insulated. The cover is ok but it is not going to keep beverages warm or cold for any real length of time. It has not leaked yet. I do not taste the plastic in the beverage. It is shaped like a flask so it tucks in just about anywhere. It is very easy to carry and it does not get in the way, with or without the cover. I would not take this for an all day hike because it is relatively uninsulated and it only holds 18-19 ounces. That would not work on a hot FL day. This is great for short outings around town or running errands. To hold so much, it is compact. I put water in it but adult beverages will work fine in this. I did not store it upside-down but under normal use, it has not leaked.",

                "reviewText": "I carry a sling bag almost daily but the standard, rounder canteen I tried was way too bulky and a larger platypus brand water bladder was too heavy.I've been using this pretty regularly for weeks now. I didn't necessarily need the neoprene sleeve but it's nice to have. Without the sleeve, this flask hits the sweet spot, where it's just flat enough to sit comfortably in my sling bag, and holds just enough water to quench my thirst when I need a sip (quick car rides, morning walk sure, but definitely not enough for a hike, etc.).Also, super easy to clean and there were zero plastic-like tastes or odors that I noticed. I also prefer this sturdier plastic over the floppy bladders in the sling bag pocket.Maybe worth mentioning, but my wife said when I was taking quick sips and drinking it from behind the wheel of my car it \"kind\" of looked like I was drinking a pint of vodka or something, because the flask looks like glass. Keeping the neoprene sleeve on would probably resolve that issue but use that cautionary observation however you might need to avoid any unwanted attention or misunderstandings.",
