As a family.) and thought, what the heck? The novelty is there and it seems practical enough.Love the classic hammertone green that I purchased for all of us - that classic Stanley vibe (that\u2019s what the kewl kids are saying, yeah?), build quality was fantastic, and really enjoy the widemouth option for filling, but that the kid has a screw top for drinking.I purchased a \u201ctactical canteen holder\u201d (because tactical is tacti-COOL! Amirght?) and it fits in so well and added some belt functionality that would allow for shorter hikes or walks to have this at the center and then the essentials easily available.All this to say, if you want to hydrate like your grandfathers and great grandfathers did when they were pushing back the nazis or liberating the Pacific? This is the way to go.If you prefer a more peaceful version of that - this is a quality product (not insulated) that will make you feel like an adventurer while providing plenty of water!",
