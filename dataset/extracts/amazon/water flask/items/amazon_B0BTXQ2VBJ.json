                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Hydro Flask Kids Wide Mouth Straw Cap And Boot for my two boys, aged 4 and 6, and I must say, these cups have exceeded our expectations. In my opinion, they are the best spill-proof cups on the market.One of the standout features is the stainless steel construction. It\u2019s a healthier alternative to plastic cups, eliminating the worry about potential additives. This feature alone gives me peace of mind knowing that my boys are drinking from a safe and non-toxic container.Cleaning these cups is a breeze, which is a huge plus for any parent. They hold up wonderfully, even with daily use, and still look as good as new. The variety of colors they come in is another bonus. My boys love their vibrant and fun cups!Despite being a bit pricey, these cups are a worthwhile investment. They are built to last, and considering their superior quality and functionality, I believe they offer good value for money.What\u2019s more, they keep the kids\u2019 water cold all day, which is perfect for those hot summer days or long school hours.In conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a durable, easy-to-clean, and safe drinking cup for your kids, I highly recommend the Hydro Flask Kids Wide Mouth Straw Cap And Boot. They might just be the last cups you\u2019ll ever need to buy!PS.. I have tried other brands.. Yeti and Corkcicle to name a few and these are my fav!",

Reason I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars for cleaning because 1) you will need a bottle cleaner to reach to the bottom of the flash 2) you do need a straw cleaner for the straw and the cap. Unfortunately they did not provide any of the cleaning tools so you will have to have one already.",

The boot is great and has already saved it from getting too banged up cause it\u2019s been dropped numerous times! And I like that he can put his name on the bottom! I just did his initials for safety reasons but it\u2019s great if a teammate has the same bottle till all his stickers come it at least \ud83d\ude05",
