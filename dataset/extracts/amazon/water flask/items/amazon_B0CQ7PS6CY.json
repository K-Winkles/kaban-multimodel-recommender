                "reviewText": "Finding a reliable water filtration solution has been a top priority for our household, as we live in an area with less-than-stellar tap water quality. Enter the WATERH PureSip Adapt Water Bottle Straw Replacement and Filters, and it's safe to say we've found our hydration helper. This set will be perfect for us as we save up for a large water filtration system, offering an economical solution to the pressing problem of poor water quality.This set of 5 straws and 3 filters is compatible with various stainless steel water tumblers, including WATERH Vita Bottle, Simple Modern, Stanley, Hydro Flask, and standard stainless steel water bottles with lids. The flexibility to cut the straws to fit different tumblers is a thoughtful touch, ensuring compatibility with different drinkware.This filter definitely reduces chlorine and particulates. The result? Water that not only tastes better but is cleaner and healthier for consumption. The filter ensures instant filtration as you sip through the bottle straw. One filter can last up to 2 months and filter up to 40 gallons of tap water. This means fewer replacements, less hassle, and more cost-effective hydration compared to constantly buying bottled water or frequently changing filters.One of the standout features is its contribution to reducing our carbon footprint. With each filter replacing up to 450 single-use plastic bottles, it's an eco-friendly choice that aligns with our commitment to sustainability. Not only are we enjoying clean water, but we're also making a positive impact on the environment. If you're tired of compromising on water quality, this product is a must-try!",

Even if it isn't a smart bottle, you can cut one of the straws to fit your specific bottle. Then, if need be, trim the bottom and pop the filter on and install the top on your setup and bing bag boom filtered water to go. The filters have a more than adequate lifetime between changes.

                "reviewText": "The WaterPh filter is easy to use and set up. The actual filter that goes into the water bottle is small and uncumbersome. The straws are made of a heavy duty plastic, which you can trim to fit the size of your water bottle. The straw is a bit smaller than a milkshake straw and its easier to drink out of than drinking a milkshake. There is a bit more effort to drink through the filter, but it was acceptable accounting for the the water going through the filter. If there was a lack of resistance I probably would have questioned the effectiveness of the filter, so I am pleased with this.",

                "reviewText": "Before using any filter on our tap water I always test it out first with water from our ZeroWater filter that is at 000 parts per million of total dissolved solids to see if the filter is putting anything into the water while it is theoretically taking stuff out. It was a bit more difficult than usual to test this out since it is a straw filter, but what I wound up doing was sipping the water halfway up the straw and putting my finger over the top and then flipping the straw and dropping the filtered water into a different cup. I did this a few times until there was enough water to test, and when there was it showed that the water had 32 ppm total dissolved solids in it.My photos show that the straw was in water with 000 ppm to start and the yellow cup is after being filtered through the straw.Nothing in the product photos or description says anything about adding anything to the water and the fact that there is something coming out of the filter into the water gives me enough pause to not want to drink from the straws.The straws are good quality plastic and were easy to assemble with the filters. The one that I assembled was easy to put in my water bottle and also fit in my 40oz tumbler nicely. They look and feel nice, but I just don't trust them.",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved to a place with VERY hard tap water and it smells strongly of chlorine. It's to the point where I typically do not drink it because it tastes off. This filter does make it taste drinkable. This straw filter is pretty easy to pull water from especially in comparison to other filter straws I've had. I do have a TDS reader and total dissolved solids were reduced dramatically it went from 188 to 56 which is pretty good for this little filter. I got tired of replacing expensive zero water filters really often, or buying bottled water. Hoping this helps!",
