I poured a kettle of boiling water in it, measured the temp, it was 203\u00b0F, 5 hours and 50 minutes later, it went down to 132\u00b0F. Not only that, a rust spot formed as well - see pic. It's not at the seam, but at the bottom inside of the jug. I ordered this to replace another 64oz jug that I have that rusted at the seam after a few years of use, so I thought this might be a good replacement, but it wasn't even 6 hours, it already rusted. Really regret getting this. What's worse is that this is a vine item, I'm not allowed to communicate with the seller to ask for a replacement. Total waste of money!",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my daughter for all-day softball tournaments. For that purpose, we end up filling it often from hotel ice machines, and this bottle is great for that - the mouth is very wide and it holds a lot of water. Its also very sturdily built - the handle is heavy aluminum that looks like it will take a lot of abuse. It does *not* have an ability to hook onto a fence like other bottles of this size I've seen - it just has the loop handle.The lid screws shut securely, and it comes with two straws. But the straws are weird; they just sort of sit in the opening. I guess that's so you can use the bottle by tipping it up and drink out of the spout? But i'm used to the straw being an integral part of flip up lid, and the straw attaching permanently. Here it just sort of flops around in the opening (see pic), and when you shut the lid it squishes it out of the way. I guess its fine, but i'm sure that given that the straw isn't attached it will get lost/bent/broken. Shrug.",
