As it states in the listing the bottle is made of 18/8 stainless steel that is rust-free and non-toxic, ensuring that your drinks stay clean and healthy.The double-wall vacuum insulation keeps your drinks cold for up to 24 hours.

But, otherwise, get this before you decide to spend a fortune on a hydroflask or anything like that. These are sturdy, good quality, and have decent quality mouthpieces. No reason to spend a fortune. Comes with several mouthpieces, two straws and some cleaners. My partner started using mine so often I gave him the link for this. We carry ours around everywhere lol",
