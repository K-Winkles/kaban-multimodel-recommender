It kept the ice fresh for 18 hours and then it finally started melting it slowly. My water was fresh and ice cold for over 24hrs.",

He's in a truck all day and I thought this would be very useful for him, as in the past, he has purchased several 2 liter bottles of pop during the day and that's not healthy. With this thermos, he can take his coffee with him in the winter and nice cool ice water or ice tea in the summer. Easy to clean and use. He was very excited to get this Zibtes 40 oz Insulated Water Bottle and I was happy that he liked it so much. Truly a win-win! 5 happy stars for this water bottle!",

I\u2019ve been looking for a water bottle with a \u201csippy cup\u201d lid for a while because it\u2019s easiest for me to drink out of. I found this one and it has that lid but also two others!! Not to mention all of the color choices!!!! And it actually is insulated. I\u2019ll put ice in it around 9am and there will still be some around 5pm! So because of all of this, I carry it around with me religiously! Which causes me to stay hydrated (which I tend to have a problem with). So I highly recommended it to anyone who needs an emotional support water bottle",

For the hotter months, I wanted a bottle that would not only hold a lot of water but keep it cool, with a handle and be leak proof. I\u2019ve had it about a month and have had it leak multiple times- only dropped it once and it has tons of scratches and dents, so I feel it\u2019s not very durable. I got this because of the great price point and loved that it came with three lid options for me to pick as I needed and have one while deep cleaning another. It\u2019s okay to carry around water, but personally I wouldn\u2019t trust it unless it\u2019s sitting upright.",
