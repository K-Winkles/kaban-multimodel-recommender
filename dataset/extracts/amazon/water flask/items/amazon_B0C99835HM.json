I like it so much I bought 2 so my wife and I don\u2019t have to fight over who gets to use it. 2 of these in a day will give me the appropriate amount of hydration I need. When it tips over it doesn\u2019t spill out. A few cubes of ice and my drink stays cold all day long. The quality is great and it holds up to a good bit of punishment and abuse. It\u2019s a solid piece of equipment. Try not to drop it on your toe. It likely wont affect the bottle, but your toe will hate you for a while.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic bottle!! It doesn't leak, I love the different lid options, the sturdy handle, it fits in my car cup holder, and has a very pretty look.There are a few minor downsides to it, however, it doesn't keep ice from melting as slowly as other insulated cups (maybe about 12 hours or so), it's got a skinny bottom so it's a little top heavy and rattles around in a cup holder if it's not a snug fit. Super minor on the issues, overall this is one of the most solid cups I've found and I would recommend it!!",

                "reviewText": "This bottle has it all, straw, insulation, perfect design, includes so many ways to grab hold, it has a solid handle like a mug, it has a braded rope with a carabiner and the lid even has its own loop all of the materials feel great good quality, fastened to the thing. the only thing that could break on this thin is a compass that is on the clip of the braid handle, and I dropped the bottle on that thing and its plastic so it shattered but really who needs a compass on the bottle??",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a water bottle that doesn't leak and will fit in my car cup holder. This does both. It fits and works better than other brands starting with a T that are supposed to be leak proof/resistant.This has a hook spring system that keeps the bottle closed. It also has a clasp to ensure it stays closed. This is well designed and worth the extra few $ to ensure it doesn't leak around the lid.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this water bottle, and while it serves its basic purpose, there are a few aspects that leave room for improvement.On the positive side, the design is simple and functional. The bottle is easy to carry, and the cap seals tightly, preventing leaks during transport. The material used is durable, and I appreciate that it's easy to clean, maintaining hygiene over time.However, there are a couple of drawbacks. First, the size of the bottle's opening is quite narrow, making it difficult to add ice cubes or clean thoroughly. A wider mouth would not only facilitate cleaning but also make it more versatile for different beverages.Lastly, while the bottle claims to keep beverages cold for an extended period, I found that it doesn't live up to this promise as effectively as I had hoped. It's decent for short outings, but for longer durations, the insulation could be improved.In summary, this water bottle is functional but falls short in a few key areas. With some refinements in design and insulation capabilities, it has the potential to be a more reliable and versatile hydration solution. I would give it a three-star rating as it meets basic expectations but has room for enhancement.",
