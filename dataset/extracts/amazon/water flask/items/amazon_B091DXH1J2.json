                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to purchase this after reading several reviews stating the lids don't fit or the drink doesn't stay cold. I bought this specifically to keep ice water cold during my workday. I won't fill it with anything else, so it should not need to be cleaned on the inside, really, ever. To avoid damaging a product that I might have to send back, I filled it halfway with ice and water and let it sit at home for the duration I was at work (9+ hours). When I got home, virtually all of the ice was still frozen, so I knew at that point I was likely to be keeping the bottle. I turned it on its side and up-side-down and it did not leak at all. Bonus. I filled it all the way up with ice and water and left it overnight. Started drinking my ice water in the morning, took the bottle to work, had only ice left after lunchtime so I used a bottle filler to refill it all the way. It laid down on my passenger seat at some point but the seat remained dry. Had ice water all the way to bed time and, when I finished the water, there was very little ice left in the bottle. 24 hours of ice meets my needs just fine. It is very sufficient towards my intended purpose and I am very pleased. The case that it comes in has a convenient handhold that allows for one handed drinking and the lid has a hinged handle that is convenient. It also came with a detachable shoulder strap that I do not need. I recommend this for someone who wants a large bottle that is functional to stay cold all day long. Totally worth paying half the price of the more popular brands. Do not let the poor reviews stifle your purchase. This thing is great!",

It is highly durable and well designed. You can choose from many different high quality mouth pieces.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the best thermos' I have ever gotten and it's not even for me! My adopted mommy is always outside doing yard work on her garden. It's her favorite past time. She has this giant plastic half gallon jug she lugs around with her that she is constantly having to refill with ice during the hot GA summers. I told her about a thermos I got with a screw on lid that keeps my drink cold all day. She mentioned she needed something with a straw, she couldn't just easily chug from a half gallon metal thermos. So I started hunting. There are just tons out there to choose from but I chose this one for a couple of reasons: 1) it's a half gallon. People like us actually go through that and then some throughout the day and it's obnoxious to have to refill these smaller thermos a bunch2) it has multiple lid options! Straw cleaners! The whole shabang! You could easily pay this amount for just a thermos.3) it also has a bag to help carry it. Game changer. Like the hook on the lid is a big deal to me because sometimes after hauling 3 kids worth of things on top of my stuff I literally only have a pinky left to grab my cup. If I had one of these (which I 100% plan on getting) it would make things much easier! Plus if your minimalist you could totally just shove some cash or your card in the zipper compartment that's for carring the cup. There's enough wiggle room, I checked for my own purposes.Now she has been using it everyday for about a month. She loves it! Keeps her water cold all day and she's not having to refill the ice because that's still there too! If you're hot natured or just always thirsty this is a great investment.",

                "reviewText": "The Coolflask 128 oz Insulated Water Bottle has been a great addition to our family's daily routine, especially for school and sports activities. The bottle's design is impressive, with its durable paint and overall robust construction. It's been able to withstand daily use quite well, although it is prone to dings, which thankfully doesn't affect its functionality.What I appreciate most is the bottle's excellent insulation capability. It keeps liquids cold for an extended period, which is perfect for long days out. The anti-sweat coating is a thoughtful feature, ensuring the bottle remains dry and easy to grip.The variety of lids is a plus, offering flexibility in how we use the bottle. However, the durability of the lids, particularly the flip-top style, has been somewhat disappointing. We own three of these bottles, and two of the flip-top lids have already broken. The screw-top lids, on the other hand, have proven to be more reliable and are easier to clean.Another aspect worth mentioning is the bottle's large capacity. It's ideal for reducing the need for refills, which is particularly convenient during outdoor activities like hiking or camping.In conclusion, the Coolflask 128 oz Water Bottle is a solid choice for anyone needing a large-capacity, well-insulated water bottle. While there are some issues with the durability of certain lids, its overall performance and design make it a worthwhile investment for active families.",

My only issue is with the plastic caps, you really have to thoroughly wash them often (I wash & air dry every night) or you get that mildew smell. But that might be the case for any of these bottles. I recommend carefully taking those silicone seals out too when washing/drying them. I don\u2019t really like the \u201csweat proof\u201d coating it feels awful, but the carrying case solved that problem for me! I just wish I could put stickers on it. Overall I love it",

                "reviewText": "So I accidentally purchased the wrong size - the 40 oz, it's huge. The bottle arrived the next day delivery. I returned it and received my money back immediately. I reordered the 32oz and it arrived the next day. I have to note that the 40oz bottle came better packaged than the 32oz. The 32oz only came in it's regular box and plastic bag. The 40 oz came in it's regular box and another box. So the box for the 32oz. bottle was a little tattered, luckily no damage to the contents. I have only used the straw lid but so far no leaking and a good amount comes out. I have used this bottle for hiking in very hot weather and am so pleased to say that the water has stayed cold. The bottle also was left in the hot car all day and was still cold that evening! I love the pouch, it seems to be made well enough. My only complaint is that the strap will not stay in place. So as you walk it gets lose and you have to keep adjusting it. I will have to find another strap to replace it. Otherwise so far so good, hopefully it will stand the test of time.",
