                "reviewText": "So, I really like this jug and the carrier as I was looking for something to make going to the gym more convenient when I have pants that don\u2019t have pockets (ladies, you know how much this suuuuccckkksss) and this definitely fit the bill. The price was right. It was simple black canteen with a simple black case. Sometimes these things get too flashy and I\u2019m flashy enough lol (I don\u2019t need bright patterns clashing with all my tattoos \ud83d\ude02) The sleeve seems really durable, honestly. And although a bit cumbersome to put on, once I got the hang of it it\u2019s easy peasy. My iPhone 13 Pro fits perfectly. 10/10.",

It's got good weight to it & feels solid. The finish and colors are really nice, and I love the handle. The compass & flint are cool, and the carry case feels durable & has good storage. It holds a lot of liquid, and there's still ice in my water 24 hours later. Perfect for road trips, camping, hiking, biking, sporting events. I even grab mine if I'm running errands & will be in my car for awhile. Love this!",
