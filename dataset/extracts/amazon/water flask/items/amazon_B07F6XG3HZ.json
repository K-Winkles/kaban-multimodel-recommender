                "reviewText": "I first bought the 64 oz. bottle a year ago, because I drink a lot of water at night and wanted a big bottle that would stay cold all night long and hold a significant amount of water. This bottle went above and beyond my expectations. I noticed the first time I put ice in it that when I went to fill it the following night, the ice still hadn't melted, after 24 hours. Amazing. That to me is the best thing about these, how long they can actually keep a drink cold, but it isn't the only great feature. The bottles are elegant and well designed. They're heavy duty and feel super sturdy. I dropped my 64 oz down the stairs trying to carry it with a laundry basket and it didn't dent or even really scratch. The bottles are super easy to clean, each piece of the lid comes off so you don't have to worry about scum forming around the straw. I loved it so much that a few months later I bought two more, the purple and black 32 oz bottles. My wife and I wanted to start making our own iced lattes during the summer, since they're like 8 dollars each now, and needed a good bottle with a straw that would keep our drinks cold throughout the day. I instantly thought to look up if they sold 32 oz bottles (size of a large Dunkin iced latte) and sure enough they did so I got them. They've been awesome! I work outside a lot and even In the summer my drink stays ice cold and the ice won't melt until long after I've finished it. Took advantage of the prime day sale and ordered another two (40 oz white and purple). They are extremely well priced compared to their competitors. It's just really refreshing to find a company that makes quality built to last products at a decent price. Can't recommend these enough.",

The stainless steel build not only makes it look clean and strong but also guarantees that you can use it every day without breaking. Adding two lids, one for drinking and the other for a bigger opening makes it very useful. The Capri color is bright and nice, making it a fashionable extra thing. I like the careful planning because the bottle is simple to get clean and locks well. This stops any leaks from happening. In general, the ThermoFlask is now my favorite water bottle because it works well, lasts long, and looks nice \ud83d\ude43. I suggest it to anyone looking for a good and useful way to stay hydrated.",

It\u2019s pretty cheap but definitely built heavy duty. I\u2019ve only dented it once when I accidentally dropped it from high up but it\u2019s such a small dent it\u2019s almost invisible. Definitely recommend! Comes with 2 extra straws, another lid for hot drinks, and the lid for straws! I will definitely buy another one after my first one!",

N\u00e3o testei tanto o isolamento t\u00e9rmico, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o posso falar sobre ele, s\u00f3 que me atende bem para a minha necessidade.Contras:- Eu n\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 normal, se \u00e9 alguma dificuldade do canudo ou se \u00e9 eu que n\u00e3o sugo direito, mas \u00e0s vezes sinto dificuldade em fazer a \u00e1gua subir por ele, fica como se n\u00e3o tivesse \u00e1gua na garrafa e fico sugando ar.- \u00c0s vezes sugando pelo canudo a \u00e1gua vem com velocidade, a\u00ed se tirar a boca enquanto suga, a \u00e1gua pode \"pular\" do canudo e molhar a tampa da garrafa. N\u00e3o molha muito, mas incomoda e eu acho que a solu\u00e7\u00e3o pra isso \u00e9 mais ter cuidado mesmo.",

Realmente ya llevo muchos meses us\u00e1ndola y no tengo absolutamente ninguna queja, me encanta. La he llevado de viaje conmigo y realmente la mantengo a mi lado todo el tiempo, incluso empec\u00e9 a personalizarla con stickers y no se han ca\u00eddo a\u00fan lav\u00e1ndola. La textura de la botella me encanta y no es de un tama\u00f1o excesivo (compr\u00e9 la de 24 Oz o 700 ml para tener un tama\u00f1o medio y me lleve una grata experiencia). Personalmente me encanta porque no es particularmente pesada y cabe en el portavasos de mi auto.Definitivamente mantiene las bebidas fr\u00edas durante casi todo el d\u00eda, me atrever\u00eda a decir que al menos unas 8 horas si no es que hasta 12 o m\u00e1s. Le he puesto hielo por la ma\u00f1ana ante de salir de casa y la he rellenado con agua ambiente durante el d\u00eda para siempre tener agua fr\u00eda conmigo y me ha funcionado incluso de viaje en entornos mucho m\u00e1s calientes y dejando la botella en el auto. No soy mucho de bebidas calientes, as\u00ed que no podr\u00eda decir mucho al respecto. Sin embargo, he llevado varias cosas y nunca queda un sabor diferente ni desagradable. Siempre se siente limpio (claro que lavo con regularidad todas las partes de la botella. No \u201ctranspira\u201d y nunca ha goteado para mi. Incluso se me ha ca\u00eddo en un par de ocasiones y si bien s\u00ed quedan marcas si se le observa con detenimiento, no tiene abolladuras realmente notables y la pintura no se ve maltratada a\u00fan despu\u00e9s de unos cuantos golpes, as\u00ed que la considero de s\u00faper alta calidad. Deber\u00eda durar cu\u00e1nto la cuides!La \u00fanica cuesti\u00f3n que es m\u00e1s consejo de queja: Al momento de lavar la tapa tipo popote, tengan cuidado, yo me quise pasar de limpieza y retire la boquilla, pero el sello no volvi\u00f3 a funcionar, por lo que esa tapa qued\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticamente inservible, as\u00ed que ev\u00edtenlo :(. Al haber sido esto mi culpa, mantengo la calificaci\u00f3n de 5 estrellas considerando que siento puedes comprarlo a un excelente precio!",
