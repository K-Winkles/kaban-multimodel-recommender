                "reviewText": "I bought the 24 oz 3 lid bottle and up to now I loved it. It kept my water cold, was easy to clean and overall I just liked it. However after about 8 months my spout lid wouldn't pop open when I pressed the button. I guess a spring must've broken. From the very beginning I only used the spout lid. I guess I threw away the other 2 lids or misplaced them somewhere. Anyway other than the broken lid I really liked this water bottle, to the point where I bought a replacement. Unfortunately it only came with a straw lid. I miss the pop up spout lid... If it wasn't for the broken lid on my 1st Gorpus bottle, I would have given this a 4 or 5 star rating.UPDATE: A day after I submitted this review I was contacted by Goppus. They apologized for the inconvenience of my water bottle and offered me a full refund!!! In view of their generous offer I've changed my rating from 2 to 5 stars. Thanks, Goppus! Great water bottle!UPDATE #2: Soon after I received the refund I was offered a replacement spout lid. Since the 2nd water bottle came with a straw lid I happily accepted the replacement spout lid (my preference). BTW, technically, the seller, HOMEKITCH, was the one offering me the refund and replacement lid. Lisa, representing HOMEKITCH was very helpful, friendly and kind in connection with resolving my water bottle problem.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the 40oz, stainless steel, one-lid, version. With that you get ONLY the 'spout' lid.If you buy the 3-lid version, you also get a lid with a straw built-in and also a lid that has a carry handle.) A built-in straw seems as though 'overkill' and \"over-complicated' since you've already got the spout lid. The handle lid sounds handy, but you won't really be able to drink from it on-the-go because when you take that lid off, the entire mouth of the bottle is open, like a traditional Thermos bottle for keeping soup or whatever. So my call is just go with the spout lid.Btw, somewhere, maybe it is over on the Goppus website, it says they offer a free 5-year replacement on these lids!Again, this is a well-thought-out product. For example the part of the lid that pops-up/open (so you can drink) even has a built-in little plug to stopper-up the airhole when it is shut. So nothing is going to spill, period. Also the button you push to pop-up/open to drink has a little swiveling U-shaped piece of plastic around it. If you swivel it up, it locks the pop button so that it cannot be accidently popped. Thoughful.Over at the Goppus website, they no longer list this 40oz version of the bottle. The sizes currently listed there are 12oz, 20oz & 32oz \u2026 then 50oz and 60oz versions that are shaped more like a Coke bottle with a narrowed top (than these that are cylinder-shaped).So, point-being, if 40oz is the 'Goldilocks' size for you (as it was for me), better get one now, because when this Amazon stock runs out, that's likely the end of the availability of the 40-ouncers.",
