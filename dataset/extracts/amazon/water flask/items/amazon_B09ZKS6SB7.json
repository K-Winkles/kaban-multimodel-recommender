I have used it several times and taken it to the garden where I volunteer and even in the cold weather it has stayed hot the whole time. Have already put it through the dishwasher a few times and it's still working wonderfully. Great product. Will definitely get a couple more for myself and give some as a gift.",

                "reviewText": "Ah, BJPKPK. I used to say the name out loud jokingly, but now I say it out of affection.I bought the 64oz with handle to replace my non-dishwasher-safe Coleman 1-gallon jug. The BJPKPk blows it out of the water. Better insulation, and way easier to clean. I liked it so much that I also bought the 64oz slim. The designs between slim and handle version are very different. Some notes:Slim Version:-Great in the dishwasher, no pooling water.-Simple cap that isn't likely to break.-Better form factor.-VERY difficult to get the lid off due to bottle circumference and small lid with no leverage. The only design flaw for this model. Would render the bottle unusable for many (most?) people without jamming a wooden spoon or similar in the handle for leverage.-No quick access, must take off entire lid to drink.Handle Version:-Worse in the dishwasher. Water pools in concave bottom and collects in the cap. Not a deal breaker, just need to put it on the drying rack.-Much wider body, more annoying in gym bag.-Lid has more moving parts, feels like it will eventually be the part that fails (but ok so far).-MUCH easier to remove lid. It is wider, goes over the outside of the bottle instead of screwing in, and has a bigger handle for leverage.-Has a small screw-off cap for quick access.Overall would definitely recommend. But DO NOT buy the slim if you struggle getting lids off of jars.",

That is about it for the good.The bad: the lid just plain sucks. takes far to long to get the threads lined up just perfectly so the damn thing will screw on. I hate straws on water bottles but this lid makes me wish it had a straw or a spout. Every time you take a drink having to screw the lid back on makes me want to throw the thing against the wall.Insulation, I honestly don't think this water bottle has any. cold water turns to luke warm water in a couple of hours. Maybe because of all the time it takes to screw the lid on, letting in warm air. I added ice trying to keep the water cold for longer. I maybe got an extra couple of hours that way.For me the aggravation from the lid means the water bottle will end up at the back of the shelf with all the other forgotten mugs and glasses.Do yourself a favor and just pony up the cash for a Stanley. Your blood pressure will thank you.",
