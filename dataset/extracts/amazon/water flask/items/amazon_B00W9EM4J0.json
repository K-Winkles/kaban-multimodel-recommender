                "reviewText": "The main reason I bought this thermos was the pour spout. It's much handier than unscrewing the lid. It does leak a little, maybe it comes out through the spout? Not sure, but I don't travel with the thermos, I just use it to store hot water for later use throughout the day, so I don't have to fire up the tea kettle again.The product description says that it keeps the contents \"hot\" for 24 hours with no heat transfer. Not sure what temperature is being used to define hot, but I conducted readings over several days using a Pyrex digital meat thermometer. The first measurements I took were from first filling the thermos with boiling water, screwing on the lid and cap, and taking readings every two hours. I was going to take the readings by inserting the probe through the pour spout, but it's not a straight passage through, so I had to unscrew the lid each time.For the first six hours, the temperature would drop by about 10 degrees every two hours (5 degrees per hour). And it was apparent that heat was transferring out through the top (maybe because the lid isn't as insulated as the rest of the body?) because the cap cup was warm to the touch. So after six hours, the temperature dropped to about 174\u00b0 F. Still hot enough to brew some tea, or coffee from grounds.After the first six hours, the temperature drop seemed to taper off to about 5 degrees every two hours. So at about the 12 hour mark, the temperature was around 156\u00b0F. At the 24 hour mark, the temperature was 131\u00b0F. I'm guessing that if you use the thermos to store a beverage, like coffee, this should be hot enough (although fast food places serve coffee around 170\u00b0F).In case the process of opening the lid to take measurements lets a lot of the heat escape, I also conducted a survey where I took readings at only the 12 and 24 hour mark. In this survey, the 12 hour temp was 159\u00b0F and the 24 hour reading was 136\u00b0F, so slightly warmer, but not significantly.I guess 131\u00b0F after 24 hours would be technically hot. That is, if you put a hot beverage like coffee in there, it would still be pretty hot. But if you use it to store hot water for later use (like I do), you could probably make a cup of hot chocolate or instant coffee. But it seems to be too cold for brewing tea, or brewing coffee from grounds.",

Big disappointment.It might be OK with dishwasher cleaning only, but I don't have one so not an option. Otherwise looks nice, the cloth case is a good feature too. But REALLY clean comes first for my priorities so this is headed back for a refund.\ud83d\ude15",
