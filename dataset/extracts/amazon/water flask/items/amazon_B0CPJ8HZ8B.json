                "reviewText": "I recently switched to this glass water bottle, and I\u2019m thrilled with my purchase. The sleek design and durable glass make it a stylish accessory for any occasion. I appreciate the eco-friendly aspect of using glass, reducing my reliance on plastic.The silicone sleeve provides a comfortable grip and adds an extra layer of protection. The wide mouth makes it easy to clean and fill, and the leak-proof cap gives me peace of mind, especially when tossing it into my bag on the go.Overall, this glass water bottle has become my go-to for staying hydrated in a sustainable and chic way. If you\u2019re looking for a reliable and environmentally conscious hydration companion, I highly recommend giving this bottle a try!",

But really can't beat it for $17Pros:- Light weight- easy to clean- no leaks- comes with cleaning tools- comes with 2 different caps, 1 to use with straw. I really like that it gives you the option to drink without the straw- nice protective silicone sleeveCons:- because it is light. The glass is very thin. I kind of have to baby it because I don't want to break it- although it comes with the silicone sleeve, the sleeve is very thin- the handle seem to be cheap and can break easily. But time will tell.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the CIVAGO 64 oz Glass Water Bottle, attracted by its large capacity and the motivational time marker. However, my experience has been far from satisfactory.Firstly, the bottle's durability is questionable. Within a week of gentle use, I noticed small cracks developing near the base. This makes me question the quality of the glass used.The usability is another concern. The bottle is quite bulky and heavy, especially when full. Carrying it around during my gym sessions is more of a workout than a convenience. Additionally, the straw provided is flimsy and bends easily, making it difficult to drink from.The design, while initially appealing, has its flaws too. The silicone sleeve, meant to provide grip, keeps slipping off, and the two lids option is more confusing than helpful. I've had instances where the lid wasn't secure enough, leading to leaks in my gym bag.Lastly, for its price, I expected better quality and functionality. There are cheaper bottles in the market that offer better durability and practicality.Overall, I regret this purchase and cannot recommend the CIVAGO 64 oz Water Bottle. It's a classic case of style over substance, failing to deliver on its basic promise of durability and convenience.",
