They are light weight and keep water cold for over 8 hours in 110\u00b0 They took a drop onto sharp rocks with just a little scratch in the paint. Easy enough for kids to fill and drink. Colors look just like the pictures, and is not slippery when wet.But the real reason I'm writing this review is the customer service. I'm not sure how, but after 3 months the lid got messed up. It didn't sit flat when closed, and was almost impossible to open. I messaged the seller, hoping to buy a new lid. They asked for my shipping info, and less than 2 weeks later I had a brand new free lid delivered. Super easy.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased the 32oz for my step-thru E-bike and fits perfectly in the water bottle holder that we mounted (I was skeptical that it would fit; however the bottle is a bit on the tall side as it's narrow, but no complaints on this end. Plenty of water or hydration drink with ice for the ride, so no need for an additional water bottle which I was doing in the past. This bottle also fits in my car cup holder; a bit snug but doesn't wobble and again, really tall so it takes a bit getting used to the height while drinking and driving (water or juice only; no cocktails :-). Love the blended color (black/white); so much that I purchased another, same size but with the light pastel; lilac and seafoam green; I think they call it blush? The lid has a lock latch and a pop top to reveal the spout. Anyway, I would recommend as it kept the liquid cold, overnight on the counter and I had the heater on; ice was still plentiful. I've already dropped it and can't find a dent or scratch which is surprising compared to my high end cups. I'll probably buy a silicone boot for the bottom for protective measures but for now, no complaints. The husband even purchased one to be used in his Jeep; these were too tall for his style of E-Bike unfortunately. Now that I have all the positives; here's the one negative and it doesn't affect the bottle in anyway. The product was to come with two additional straws and a straw cleaner. Well, in my case, the bag was opened and contained that straw cleaner and a straw that was clearly meant for a small bottle; not for the 32oz I purchased. So, it was missing the other straw as well. I emailed the company and waiting to hear back as the additional straws are nice to have on hand when you're washing one and still want to use your bottle and not have to clean the only one available. I do recommend the product overall.",
