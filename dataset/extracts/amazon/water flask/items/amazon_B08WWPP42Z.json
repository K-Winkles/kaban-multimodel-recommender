It\u2019s also only 21 ounces so it\u2019s a little bit lighter than the 24 ounce because it holds a bit less water as well. It\u2019s beautifully machined and smooth and appealing usually. Great addition to my collection of water bottles and the one I always will bring with me if I have to carry it in a string pack.",

The advertised capacity is a bit misleading; it doesn't hold as much as expected. Additionally, the lid design is flawed, making it difficult to drink from without spilling. To make matters worse, the flask does not maintain the temperature as promised for the duration; my drinks either end up lukewarm at times. Considering the high price I paid for this product, I expected much better quality and performance. I regret this purchase and would not recommend it.",
