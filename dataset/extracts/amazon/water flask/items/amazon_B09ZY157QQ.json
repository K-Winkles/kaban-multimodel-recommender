From kids to learning to speak , you accompany your child to grow up and experience every moment of the child\u2019s growth. I know that you have paid a great sacrifice and patience. Just want to say, how great you are! Our products are designed for kids. I have a 5-year-old daughter, and I know that for parents, children are more important than anything in the world. So we will never cut corners on security. Kid in the early childhood stage are curious about the world, and the colorful colors will attract their attention. But for children who are in school, this will distract them from a lot of attention during class. So, when designing the appearance color of the water bottle, we have reduced the use of gaudy color. As a professional water bottle manufacturer (and also a mother), I know what your child needs. Whether you are browsing or choosing to order a set of cups, we appreciate your willingness to try.",

It's a lovely bottle, but the vacuum/thermos part makes it heavier than I would prefer. When I add water to it, I'm afraid it will be heavier than I want. I'm going to keep it, though, as I can use it when I'm not trekking! I gave it four stars because of the weight. It's about as heavy without liquid as my small stainless steel bottle that I've owned for years is with water. Also, the cord around the neck is actual fabric which pretty much makes it impossible to wash and dry. The ring around the neck is plastic with a small loop. I cut off the fabric cord and attached a round metal key ring on the loop to make it easier to carry. A nice feature is that the lid covers the entire lip of the bottle, keeping it clean.",
