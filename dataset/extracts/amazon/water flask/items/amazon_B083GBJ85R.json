                "reviewText": "I am a water bottle aficionado. If I see a water bottle that is cute or in a color or saw that I particularly like that I have to buy it. Someone say that I\u2019m obsessed or that I buy too many bottles but I just can\u2019t help myself. Unfortunately, it took me years and several cupboards worth to find the right bottle. That is until I find the Hydro flask. My search is over. Now I am obsessed with the Hydro flask and I just keep buying them. I feel that everybody in my home has to have one. And then I buy another just so that I can decorate it with more cute stickers. Or so that I can take a different one to work with different stickers on it because it matches my mood for the day. I also like to gift them to people who don\u2019t drink enough water or who complain about the bottle if they have. Yes, I know that these are expensive and people wonder why you would spend so much on a water bottle but they just don\u2019t understand. these water bottles will keep your water cold. Like as cold as when you put the water in there at first on 115\u00b0 day and you left the water in the car. You\u2019re not getting all those dang chemicals from plastic water bottles that everybody warns you about. You\u2019re not putting a whole bunch of trash in the landfills. If you have to have bottled water buy a gallon and poured into here. At least this way you\u2019re only putting one giant jug in instead of 25 bottles a week or more. Even better buy a Britta filter, your water and then put it in here. Oh, and if you like drink, hot stuff, you can do that too and it\u2019ll keep your hot stuff hot You just need a different top. Don\u2019t drink through a straw with it you\u2019ll burn your mouth. I learn my lesson there too. I was dumb and thought that my hot coffee would cool down a little bit with a couple of ice cubes in it not thinking of the ice cubes would Melt and that the coffee would cool down but unfortunately the ice cubes melted and the coffee didn\u2019t cool down so when I drink through the straw I burnt my mouth. OK, so bad joke but I\u2019m naturally blonde like I really am. That\u2019s my secret. I dye my hair red , this is a product that I list on my blog ceejaythorne.com every year. And when you look at my listing my reviews, you will find that I buy too many of these. Amazon take my money because I buy too many and they always end up on every list every list wishlist that I have . Someday I hope to have one in every color which is kind of pointless because I cover them and cool stickers. It\u2019s kind of ironic because my kids still do mine and then they find that I decorate them better than they do. I think it\u2019s because their kids comment on my water bottles more than theirs . You can get some really cute stickers on Amazon for the record for these and I have reviews on the stickers too. And you can also get stickers when you go traveling to different places which you can reflect on your water bottles. Anyways, this is my longest review because I\u2019m obsessed with these things and just do it. It\u2019s kind of like Nike I guess , when it comes to Hydro flask, just do it. Also, the shipping was super fast and working with the seller was amazing",

It is also great for chronic clumsy people like myself who constantly drop everything; yeah the paint is scratched and theres some tiny dents, but still in tact even after dropping it down the stairs and in the parking lot almost everyday. I do wish the opening to the bottle was actually big enough to fit your hands when washing, but hey, nothing a bottle brush cant solve.",
