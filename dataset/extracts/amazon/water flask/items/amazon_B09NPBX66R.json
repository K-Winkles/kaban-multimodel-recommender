                "reviewText": "This is an awesome water bottle. I really like the available camouflage patterns, and the extra little storage pouches. Great for a cell phone, magazine and wallet of course. But you can also put a protein bar or other stuff in there. The construction of the sleeves seems pretty solid and I love the paracord handle. I tend to carry a lot of junk as I'm going out the door with a backpack and a lunch box etc.I was able to fasten a couple of small carabiners to the MOLLE attachment and throw on a short shoulder strap. So it makes it easy to sling the bottle when you're carrying a bunch of other stuff.The 64 oz is perfect. You're not lugging around a ridiculous oversized gallon, but you're easily getting more than your daily requirement of water. If you bring it for an individual work out or range session it'll definitely go the distance and keep you hydrated. It keeps water cool for a decent amount of time as well, and the spout and lid seems pretty sturdy. The spout is a bit on the smaller side so if you're used to the big mouth openings you won't get as much of a flow from this one, but it works well enough.",

It has a handle so you can carry it like a bag. This is a GREAT gym water bottle as you can carry a lot on it. Definitely worth the money. Keeps water cold for a long time.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Absolutely love this water bottle. It\u2019s 64 ounces comes with the stylish sleeve. I chose military green because I\u2019m military. It has plenty of pockets one for my Chapstick, money, or ID etc. and the longer pocket fits my iPhone plus with plenty of room to spare. It also has a lanyard where I can attach my keys. You can carry two ways. I prefer the parachute cord It has a wide mouth for those like me who prefer their water ice cold & is large enough to fill with large ice cubes (easy to clean) and a drinking spout. I\u2019ve read complaints that the spout is much too small but personally I think it\u2019s just fine. No complaints here definitely buy this. Also its insulated so it keeps your water cold plus the sleeve make a it extra cold & easy to carry.",
