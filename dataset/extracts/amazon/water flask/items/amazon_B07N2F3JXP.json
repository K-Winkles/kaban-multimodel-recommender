Tops screw on effortlessly and seat tight resulting in absolute zero leakage.Each of the tops are all functional and well made. Good rubber on them and straw is perfect size. The solid top with the retainer ring/collar is perfect with the forethought and design so it\u2019s attached to the body and can\u2019t be misplaced or lost. Thick plastic as well. Durable and easy to take on the go. Fits perfectly in my Toyota FJ cup holder minus the rubber insert.Performance is absolutely wonderful. Keeps warm things warm and most importantly for me it keeps your cold drinks cold for hours and hours. Outperforming a few name brand over priced other containers I own. Has held ice for well over 24 hours for me. Easy to clean as well.The finish is flawless and the product brand logo and information on the bottom are lasers perfectly and cleanly. I absolutely know you will not find a more functional and better performing product for the price. Absolutely worth every penny for what they send you. Will be buying more from them immediately. For camping and hiking you will not find a better container to take along. Won\u2019t let you down.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Iron Flask Sports Water Bottle - 22 Oz and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This water bottle is not just a water bottle; it's a hydration game-changer! I recently heard someone say that staying hydrated is all about being happy with your drinking vessel. Man, were they right. I had a Kleen Kanteen for years. Despite it always being at my side, I still felt like I wasn't drinking enough. Now, with the Iron Flask, I find myself crushing it. The straw lid is by far my favorite and makes it so easy to drink.First and foremost, the double wall insulation is excellent. I no longer have to worry about condensation or my drink getting warm too quickly. It keeps my drinks icy cold for up to 24 hours and my hot beverages stay warm for an impressive 12 hours. Whether I'm on a walk, in the workshop, or just running errands, my Iron Flask has got my hydration needs covered.What truly sets this bottle apart is the inclusion of three different lids, each of them 100% leak-proof. The Carabiner Straw Lid with two straws is perfect for sipping on the go, the Flip Lid is convenient for one-handed use, and the Stainless Steel Lid adds a touch of class while ensuring no plastic touches your drink. It's versatility at its finest.I also love the fact that it's made from 18/8 premium stainless steel, which is not only incredibly durable but also 100% BPA-free and non-toxic. This means I can enjoy my beverages without any lingering metal taste or worries about rust.The 22 Oz size fits perfectly in my car's cup holder, making it super convenient for travel and perfect for every day use. I love this one so much that I'm definitely going to buy a larger size to bring with me for longer outings.This Iron Flask is not only a fantastic personal investment, but it also makes for a thoughtful gift. I've already recommended it to friends and family, and they love it just as much as I do.In summary, the Iron Flask Sports Water Bottle is a top-notch product that exceeded my expectations. It's sleek, versatile, and keeps your beverages at the perfect temperature. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast or just someone who wants to stay hydrated throughout the day, this water bottle is the perfect choice. I can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 22 ml, glad i picked that one because it\u2019s the perfect size for me. I like that it\u2019s long and skinny so it\u2019s easier to fit into my backpack water bottle holders lol. The extra things are at the bottom of the box that it comes in so make sure to check it, I almost threw mines out lmao till I realized it\u2019s pretty heavy to not have something else. It comes with 3 lids in total, one to chug, one to sip and last ones just to keep it secure and tight. It comes with two straws. Pretty easy to remove the straw and replace it. My favorite part is on the lid (only on the lid with the straw), you can attach it to your bags so it\u2019s easier to carry. I don\u2019t like holding things so that\u2019s been pretty helpful. For the most part, it don\u2019t leak much at all. Keeps your drinks cold or hot for very long. Great color too. Only thing is trying to figure out how to clean it considering how tall it is and the opening isn\u2019t too big.",

One thing to be aware of its that it's quite wide and doesn't really fits in the bottle holder in my SUV's front seat so would probably have gone for a more thinner width had i known this before.",
