It comes with its own scrubber, which is nice, but I'm not sure what I'll do when the scrubber is no longer usable, but at least they sent it in the box. This bottle is durable, and I have tipped it over and it doesn't leak and didn't break. It keeps all my drinks cool. It would've been nice to receive a scrubber for the straws as well, but oh well. I like this bottle overall 4 out of 5 stars.",
