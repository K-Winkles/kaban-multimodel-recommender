I really like that it came with a brush for cleaning the straw because that's next to impossible to do without one. The stickers didn't stay on for very long but that was okay, we just replaced them with different one. I'm just happy to not have to be constantly getting up to get him a drink. It keeps his water cold all day and that makes him happy.",

                "reviewText": "The handle broke off my daughters last water bottle so it was time for a new one. I don't know how we go through so many water bottles around here! This was a great price for a stainless steel water bottle, although a little smaller than her last, but she can refill it as many times as she needs to at school so that is fine. She loved decorating it with the stickers it came with. She did try to stick on some of the other stickers she has at home but they didn't adhere as well and kept coming off. We do mabel's labels and those do stick fine to thise. I love that it came with a straw cleaner and has a wide mouth for easy cleaning with a bottle brush. Overall, nice water bottle at a good price.",
