                "reviewText": "Update: After a full year of daily use and abuse by a 9 year old this water bottle is still amazing! There are a few dings/dents on the bottom of the bottle that in no way effect it\u2019s performance and since my son didn\u2019t want to use the silicone boot that Iron Flask offers I totally expected some damage would occur to the base. This bottle has been tossed around, carried in the outside backpack pocket (then the backpack gets tossed to the floor), dropped, knocked off of school desks and lunch tables, etc. and is still in perfectly usable condition. I am honestly amazed at how well it\u2019s held up and the length of time it keeps drinks cold. 4th grade has started now and we had 100 degree weather all week with no air conditioning in the classroom. I put a few ice cubes in the Iron Flask and sent him to school. I forgot to wash it when he got home and the next morning when I opened the bottle there were still ice cubes in it! Still no leakage, the straw and lid are in perfect condition (although I did order a backup lid and straw just for convenience so I always have a clean one if we are rushing in the morning but that\u2019s definitely not a necessity. Last year we used what was provided and were just fine. It comes with 2 straws anyway but we never needed to switch to the second one. My son still loves the color, performance and ease of use of the iron flask. When I asked if he wanted a new water bottle for the new school year he said he absolutely did not! He is as happy with the iron flask as I am.I bought this water bottle for my 3rd grader at the start of the school year. He wanted a blue ombr\u00e9 water bottle in stainless steel with a straw. I must have read 100 reviews before I chose this one and I\u2019m so glad I picked it. It came nicely packaged with multiple straws, various lids (chug/straw depending on preference, and some cute sticker labels that can be placed on the bottle if you choose) as well as a warranty code. I did register the warranty on the Iron Flask website just to be safe. He\u2019s been using it for about 3 months and it still looks brand new. Considering he\u2019s an 8 year old boy and lugs it around in a backpack that gets tossed on the ground, drops the bottle on the floor, etc. I expected some damage by this point (from previous experience even with more expensive high end brand water bottles) but it\u2019s still in perfect condition. I didn\u2019t purchase the extra silicone boot for the bottom or a neoprene cover or any extra protection so it would easily fit in his lunchbox pocket or backpack side pocket and I\u2019m glad because it wasn\u2019t necessary. No dents, dings or paint chipping. I do hand wash it. The most impressive feature is how cold it keeps the water. It was a week of 90 degree days and I had filled the bottle with cold water and just a few ice cubes around 7am on a Friday. After a 4 day weekend I realized I had forgotten to wash his water bottle for the upcoming school week and when I opened it the ice cubes were still frozen! I couldn\u2019t believe it. Especially since his backpack spent all day Saturday in our garage (which doesn\u2019t have air conditioning or any kind of climate control). I will definitely purchasing Iron Flask products in the future! I paid full price for this item (no discount, no free trial/sample, etc. and no request from the company for a review). This is my honest opinion as a consumer who relies on reviews to purchase good quality products. If you\u2019re on the fence, buy it!!",

My favorite top is the straw since it\u2019s easy to carry and easier to drink out of. Keep my water super cold and I like how much it holds. My husband has dropped it quite a few times so it\u2019s pretty beat up now but still very sturdy! I ended up buying him one too and he loved his! Weirdly enough, mine \u201cdeveloped\u201d some weird stains on the outside but never figured out how that even happened. It\u2019s not as nice looking from when I first bought it but still my favorite flask! I use it every day! And its dishwasher safe, extra nice.",

                "reviewText": "The first one I bought was a 64oz jug because I was going through a transition from drinking things bad for my body to drinking water. I was first sold on the color but then after I still had ice in the jug after a full shift I had to buy one for my dad who works long hours outside. I bought him a 32-34oz and he absolutely loved it, it has a cool design (chose the black marble for him) it holds the same as his knock off yetis and it keeps his drinks cold! I bought my third one when I swapped jobs when I couldn't lug my jug around. It couldn't fit anywhere at my current job without being in the way so I bought a 24oz that could fit into the designated drink shelf. They're all great value for good insulation both hot and cold. I don't use some of the lids, I tend to prefer the straw on the jug cause it gets heavy and awkward to drink from the opening but the regular screw on lid for the 24oz cause it's easier to drink from the mouth of the cup.They're mostly leak proof unless you put carbonated drinks inside with the lip or straw attachment. But that's because it's a pressurized container at that point.The durability is great, I've dropped my 64oz a few times and it's still pristine. I haven't dropped my 24oz or anything so I'm sure it'd be alright too. I've seen some people's reviews where some of the attachments break but I haven't had that issue.",

I love this water bottle - it\u2019s a perfect size - not too big and not too small. I love that it\u2019s thin and long, goes nicely in my bag\u2019s side pocket. Keeps water very cold. Comes with 3 different lids - I personally prefer this one with the straw - easy to use during workout or driving. Only bad thing is it bruises pretty easily when it falls, and once it falls and dents on its base, it tends to lose stability and fall again. But if your not a klutz shouldn\u2019t be a problem, and still it holds up for a good couple of years on a daily use. I absolutely recommend.",

Muchas veces creo que est\u00e1 bien cerrada y no. Me ha pasado en varias ocasiones que la dejo a mi lado ya sea en el asiento de copiloto de mi auto o en el sill\u00f3n de mi sala y en cuanto la agarro para tomar, se siente muy ligera de peso y es cuando me doy cuenta que se ha tirado todo el agua dejando todo mojado d\u00f3nde estaba. Es cuesti\u00f3n de fijar muy bien de que est\u00e9 bien bien cerrada. Suena l\u00f3gico ya se pero esto no me pasaba con el mismo tipo de tapa con otras modelos de botellas de la misma marca",
