                "reviewText": "Seriously, I don't know why anyone would buy a Hydro Flask at $60 when this product exists for around $30. (I also bought the rubber boot for about $10). I've used this water bottle 2-3 times a week for the past 6 months. I've cleaned it in the dishwasher many times (even though the bottom of the bottle says not to), and it basically looks brand new. It comes with 3 different lids, although I only ever use the spout lid. One of the biggest selling points for me when choosing this water bottle was the fact it does not need an internal straw. Straws are a pain in the butt to clean properly, and go missing all the time. The spout lid works just fine without one. It's well insulated (there is some condensations around the plastic lid area, but that's all). And, its never leaked. What more can you ask? Great product. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The product details from the manufacturer were a bit confusing. First I read \"no straw lids\" but then I saw video clips with it included, even vaguely mentioned it in one of the descriptions....and what the hecks a \"Spout\" lid? My sons flip top \"spout\" thingy lid came with straw capabilities but no such luck with mine. \ud83e\udee4 Fortunately, my husbands willing to swap his straw capable lid for my strap handle lid. Him and all his co-workers swear by this product btw. His boss bought all his employees one about 2 months ago, the record breaking heat here in DFW was really taking its toll on them, got Super high Praises from 'em all I heard. I've tried out his before and I gotta say I was impressed too. Curiosity got the better of me so I ordered one for me and my son. I got the pearl one, its beautiful. My son got the Hombre yellow and Orange one....he got TWO straws with his?? \ud83d\ude15 Haven't tested mine yet personally but as I mentioned earlier, my husband has one and it definitely keeps his stuff cool for hours....even outside in the heat. \"Best so far of all the ones he has\" he says. I really like that my Cirkul cap and filter can be used with this also, another customer brought that to my attention and it was a major selling point for me. No complaints yet, does what its supposed to, its economical, looks great, its well built, Cirkul product adaptable and fits the bill for my health needs. So, other than the slightly misleading and somewhat confusing manufacturer details, I would highly recommend it. Hope this review helps.",
