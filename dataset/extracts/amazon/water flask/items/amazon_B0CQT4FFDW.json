I was looking for a water bottle that had a large enough opening to fill with ice water as most water bottles you cant fill with ice. Surprisingly filled with ice will last approx 18 hours if not in direct sun. Love the color. East to fill and clean with supplied brushes if you use the supplied straws. At this price, should of bought a second one as I use it very often.",

                "reviewText": "I had a different thermos that I really disliked. This thermos is fabulous. It comes with two different caps -- one is for pouring and the other is for drinking. It comes with two long straws as well as a little brush to clean the drinking apparatus and the straws. Definitely GREAT for the money. The only reason it gets 4 stars is that it doesn't keep things as warm for as long as it touts it does. I'd say the contents (which are usually tea or coffee) stay warm for about 3 - 4 hours (and I do preheat the thermos first) and after that it's lukewarm. I don't know about how long things stay cold because I don't use it for cold beverages. Would I buy it again? Yes. I've been looking for a good thermos for a long time (and need the wider mouth to mix everything up) and this one really does fit the bill.",
