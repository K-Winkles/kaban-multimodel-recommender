Well, we\u2019re a motley crew of dreamers and designers who live by a simple creed: \u201cDo more of what you love.\u201d\u200b And we love designing things that make life a little bit easier and a heckuva a lot more enjoyable. We asked ourselves, with so many different kinds of water bottles out there, why do 3 out of 4 people still suffer from chronic dehydration? So we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. We created what we believe to be the finest water bottles in all the land. Water bottles designed to help you do more of what you love. So, what are you waiting for?

                "reviewText": "Yes, this bottle prevents leaks and spills. Yes, this bottle keeps beverages cold. Yes, it has a great carrying handle and complimentary colors. But what really stands out about this one is how great it is to drink from. When I was a teacher, I had students who called their water bottle their comfort blanket. Never understood it until now. I don't like drinking out of a straw, but the opening for the straw is so perfect and convenient, I use it over the large opening. I'm drinking 3 bottles (32 oz bottle) a day now, way more than I ever have before. The water somehow tastes better (maybe how cold it is?) too making me more likely to drink. I've had other water bottles. Hated them all. But I LOVE this one and bring it everywhere",

                "reviewText": "This water bottle is so unique like no other. Aside from keeping my drink cold for a long time, aside from the very colorful top that attracted me foremost ever since the first time I laid my eyes on it, I love so much the sip and swig features - big spout opening and the unique sip hole that looks like a contour of a pursed lip. The big straw inside that is connected to it gives me the right size amount of drink, water in this case, when I have to take in a sip to drink some medication. Proven for its quality, last night, I placed a couple of lemon slices to my water inside and let it seep through overnight. This morning, when I took a sip, some of the lemon parts got stuck at the bottom end of the straw, preventing me to drink a good amount of my usual sip. It was no problem at all. That\u2019s where the swig features comes in handy. I tilted my head and got a good gulp amount of water. Boy I just love this Owala. I love parading it at work, swinging and swaying it around with the easy lift and secure handle. No spill at all. 32 oz is the most perfect size for me. (Oh my, first time a wrote a long review. Sorry, can\u2019t control myself, I just love this Owala)",

I usually sip mindlessly while working or driving, and not having to crane my neck for every gulp is a game-changer. But when it's time to guzzle after a Beat Saber sweat-fest, the wide mouth delivers like a champ.This bottle also takes \"hydration hero\" seriously. My water stays refreshingly chilly for hours, even on scorching days. No more lukewarm disappointments \u2013 just consistent, cool sips of satisfaction. I haven't scientifically measured its chill power, but trust me, you'll never utter the dreaded \"Huh, lukewarm?\" again.Owala's color game is on point. I love the unique and vibrant combinations, and these bottles are conversation starters for sure. I get constant compliments and \"where'd you get that?\" questions.Two thumbs up (and maybe two sips for good measure).",

                "reviewText": "I came across an article called \"Stanley's are overrated. Get this water bottle instead\". That link brought me to the Owala water bottle. I love how there is a chug spout plus an internal straw. There's no grabbing at a mouth piece with your hands. The internal straw is my favourite thing about this water bottle. The shape of the bottle is also comfortable to hold in your hand, even for people with petite hands. What I really appreciated about this water bottle was that there were little stickers (easy to remove and didn't leave sticky residue) on the parts of the lid to guide you how the cap works! I thought the stickers were cute and totally genius! Bottle and lid are easy to clean. I did order their specific cleaning brush but it hasn't arrived yet. My kids even are intrigued by this water bottle after purchasing their own Stanley's (\"it's trending right now\" was the answer to why they wanted Stanley's haha). Extremely happy with this Owala purchase. It's helped me drink more water throughout the day as it keeps it nice and cold. It's also an adequate size. Not too big or small. Because it's leak proof when closed, you can throw it in your purse or bag without worrying about it spilling - can't do that with a Stanley! If you're looking for a reasonably priced water bottle with great function, absolutely get this one. Everyone in the family will be getting these as gifts this year!",

Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy bien pensado el bloqueo para que no se abra la tapa ni salga agua cuando traes la botella guardada. La tapa adem\u00e1s trae un resorte para que si inclinas la botella para tomar no se te venga encima la tapa (ver video incluido). Es f\u00e1cil de limpiar, mantiene el agua a buena temperatura, y aunque aguanta mucha agua la botella est\u00e1 de muy buen tama\u00f1o para no sentir que traes algo enorme como las de pl\u00e1stico que parecen mancuerna de gimnasio.
