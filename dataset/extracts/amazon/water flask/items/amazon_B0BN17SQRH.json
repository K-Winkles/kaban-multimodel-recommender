                "reviewText": "I bought this for my kid for school. It's ginormous. Which is great if you need to meet water goals. And the corded handle is awesome for packing it around because it's HEAVY when it's full. I just have a little feedback.Pros: definitely the size and the price. It holds a lot of water for this price point and is comparable to a Contigo in many ways. Water stays cold all day in this. We love the straw and cap which makes it easier to keep the germs away and off of your straw. It also hasn't leaked or spilled in my kid's backpack. Great seal. The lid locks. Carrying handle.Cons: we've used it twice now and there's already rust in the bottom. Which is unbelievably difficult to scrub off since my hand won't fit inside and the bottle is so tall. It's only been used twice though and we only use it for one day at a time before washing so I was surprised. The corded handle is awesome but the white stayed white for about \u00bd of a school day. The lid locks. The straw is super thin.The lid ships to you in the locked position. It took me way too long to figure that out. On the button that you push to open the lid there's a little plastic ring that needs to be moved down before it will open. Which is great if you need it to stay shut. You just have to know how to get it open for its 1st cleaning. I tossed the instructions and box before I went to clean it so I thought I'd share in case you don't keep boxes either.We're still on the hunt for the perfect water bottle but if I can get the rust out of this one it will definitely work in the meantime.",
