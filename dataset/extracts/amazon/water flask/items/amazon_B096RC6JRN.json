One can make powdered drinks in them because you can get a teaspoon in that opening, which is very convenient also. And there is this rope handle that attaches beautifully to the lid that makes this bottle imminently packable and carriable. And it keeps stuff cold or hot for a very long time. I have bought three so far and will be buying more.",

                "reviewText": "Really like the 12 oz size it fits into smaller purse. The opening is wide enough to put small ice cubes. Cold water with ice has remained cold for 8 hours. I have tried a hot beverage in order to test temperature for hot beverages. The only reason it was given a 4 is because of the material around b the top supposedly for caring. Well it get wet when washing the the top. So I cut it off. That has not affected the performance of the bottle. I am pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I really love these water bottles, just be sure to get the one that's insulated for hot and cold beverages. They have two different types. The only complaint I have, which may just be me, is the lid breaks easily if you drop it on a hard surface. But their customer service is awesome. I sent an email explaining I needed replacement lids if they have them, they did and shipped them to me same day I asked. That's 5 stars IMO.",

After a few months I noticed that it lost it coating (revealing the metal below), but didn't had a problem with it because it was just esthetics; however, a few months later it started to rust, especially around the nozzle so I was looking for a replacement. Still used it for a while until I lost it.",
