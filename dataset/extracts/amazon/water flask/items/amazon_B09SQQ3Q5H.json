                "reviewText": "I bought this cup to replace my 17-month-old\u2019s Tommy Tippy straw cup for water. I hate the taste imparted by silicone straws. My friend recommended this Hydroflask because of how easy it is to clean, and I 100% agree. If you have any basic brush set for cleaning bottle parts, you can easily get to every crevice in this cup\u2019s lid. No hidden traps for water to collect and mold to grow. Very simple design.This cup definitely tastes better too. No soapy taste after washing (unlike silicone or flimsier plastic), and a decent flow through the straw because there\u2019s no check valve forcing the toddler to sip really hard to get the water out. My child actually drinks a lot more water now that she has this cup.To address the leaking issues, yes it leaks, but not as bad as the \u201cleak proof\u201d straw cups with check valves, where the liquid just bubbles up and pools everywhere while it\u2019s sitting completely upright. This cup leaks at a very specific angle. I bought the pink cup first, and it leaked only at 45 degrees or so, and only for a second before it stopped. I was so impressed that I bought another one\u2014the green cup\u2014and this one only leaks when my child has it lying flat on the floor, and only occasionally. And when it does leak, it doesn\u2019t stop\u2014just creates a huge puddle until it\u2019s empty. My partner and I have tried to recreate the scenario in which that happens, but the cup behaves perfectly when we\u2019re trying it\u2014no leaking. It\u2019s frustrating to figure it out, but here\u2019s the bottom line: I don\u2019t really leave this cup alone with my toddler anyway because if she dropped it on her foot, she\u2019d probably break a toe it\u2019s so heavy. So it doesn\u2019t have too many opportunities to leak all over the house, and when she\u2019s older and can be trusted carrying it around, she\u2019ll set it down upright anyway. So the leaking isn\u2019t a deal breaker, and the cup is a huge improvement over anything else we\u2019ve used.",
