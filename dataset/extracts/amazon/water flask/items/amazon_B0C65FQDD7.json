The fact that it comes with the two types of lid is a nice plus since I tend to switch depending on what I have in the bottle, but I mostly use the screw on cap for cold water. Water lasts all day cold with ice not melting and sweat free bottle. I also tested with hot coffee, just to try it since I don't really plan on using it for that, but it kept it hot for the few hours I tested for so everything seems to work as advertised . Bottle is a bit on the heavy side but I was expecting that for 40oz insulated bottle. The materials for bottle and caps feel like good quality and I'm expecting it will last for a good long while. It also includes cleaning tools for straw and bottle which is nice.",
