                "reviewText": "It's true that the bite valve gives you a sip not a gulp, but for me this is perfect because I don't want to stop to drink or choke on a gush of water. I use this for longer runs when I want to have my electrolyte drink to hydrate and avoid cramps. I'll carry it full for several miles before I start taking sips. The handy thumb hole makes it natural to hold without exerting a lot of grip effort. You can cinch down the adjustable strap to make it hug your hand as it empties. Once empty you can tuck it in a pocket or waist band easily. I bought a couple more of these to have them handy wherever I am and to have an extra or two for a marathon.I'm not sure what other people are expecting form this water bottle. I detected no bad taste. Lots of things come with that \"do not eat\" packet -- if you are dumb enough to eat it you should not be shopping unsupervised. It probably does taste terrible -- I couldn't tell you. I have used the three of these I bought for many miles, in training and races and no leaks, no problems.",

                "reviewText": "There are comments about the smell. If you soak it about 1/2 hour in salted water, it will take that away. I used probably a tablespoon of salt, soaked it in a bowl so it was fully submerged. I've used it a few times and no weird taste at all.SIze: It really only holds 16 ounces, but in the holder it's just 15 ounces. It's a little off balance and still too big for my small hands, but I do think it's a good product because it really doesn't leak at all and the spout works well.Spout: mixed reviews about the oddball spout. It seems like you can't drink well from it, but if you just pinch the very top edge, it does spout out really well. Took some getting used to.With the collapsable nature, I was able to fit it into my Lululemmon side pocket.I really love my \"Bottle Band\" which is a strap that can fit any water bottle, including a Polar bottle. But this one is also pretty good.",

I can deal with the difficulties of drinking from the nipples and lack of access to clean the interior or the lid, for the reusability of these items and the ability to carry so much water. But I cannot deal with how much the lid on one of the bottles leaks, it goes all over me and wherever I lay my pack down. I tried messaging the company over a defect in another item that I received from them and have yet to hear back from them, therefore I view this as a lost cause right now. I would not recommend buying products from this manufacturer/seller.",

I've had other brands last years without this issue. I can still use it, but constantly getting my pack wet.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect for cold weather runs, hot yoga, and sight seeing.I bought this bottle to have a light weight water bottle that could also double as a wallet so I can keep my car key and valuables with me during group exercise classes and sightseeing. I don\u2019t like to rely on lockers for anything that would be upsetting to lose.Straps and design. There is ample reflective strips on the hand strap and front of the bottle. The reflective material is sewn so that there are loops to attach a carabiner. The hand strap is one of the most comfortable I\u2019ve used. Soft lining to prevent chaffing and breathable mesh with a comfy thumb hole. The blue color with lime green accents is very attractive.Pocket. Can fit chapstick, car key, tissues, a few dollars, and ID. And I have room to spare.Material. The fabric is sturdy yet lightweight so it wouldn\u2019t add unnecessary weight to your hand. The sewing is solid.Water capacity. Water bladder style with bite mouth piece. To drink water, you bite down on the mouth piece and sip. Without the bite pressure, the bottle stays closed and no water leaks out even when the bottle is on it\u2019s side or upside down. Love that I can take a quick sip and toss the bottle back onto my mat without fussing with closing a lid and potentially disrupting yoga class. The bladder that came included fits about 12 ounces of water. I wouldn\u2019t use it on long hot weather runs where I need a lot of water, but it\u2019s perfect and lightweight for winter runs, gym, hot yoga, and general walking around.",
