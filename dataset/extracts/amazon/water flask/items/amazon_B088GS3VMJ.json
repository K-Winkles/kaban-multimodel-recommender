                "reviewText": "I have had this water bottle for over two years and I love it. I have carried this water bottle around with my EVERYWHERE. I like it so much that I bought one for my husband and best friend. You only want the best for those close to you, so you already know how good a product is if people are buying them for close ones. I was curious how there could be one star reviews on this, so when I looked, I saw it was mostly due to the non-steel lid and ice melting. I don't use the non-steel lid with the straw (I thoroughly enjoy having my lid strapped to my bottle, and being able to hold on to it, so I only use the steel lid with the rubber part that connects to my water bottle. Plus, I am thankful for the steel lid because I try not to drink out of plastic. Thus, I cannot speak to the other lid if that is something you are looking for.). Secondly, in terms of ice melting - yes, it does melt. HOWEVER, your water is kept cold for hours (I have never had it where I had ice/my water at a cool temperature and it EVER warming up.)!This is a great water bottle, and it is at a price point where you feel comfortable in investing in it. Having it for 2+ years, and filling it up 2-3 times a day (32 ounces), I have received AT LEAST 1,825 uses out of it (2 years X 2.5 fill-ups on average). There is great temperature control, it is sturdy (this is coming from someone who is clumsy), and it has a great design (I have purchased the teal 32 oz, black/white ombre 32 oz, and navy 40 oz for myself and others.)! I use the teal one, and I LOVE the color - it is so vibrant and a beautiful color). Also, my husband and I have both put stickers on ours and they work well. My husband has the black/white ombre one, and has a white sticker that overlaps both, and it looks so sleek! The only thing about my water bottle is that it is too wide for my cup holders in my car since I don't have large/adjustable cup holders. However, as long as the lid is screwed on tightly, I put it on the ground and it does not leak.I also want to give a shout out to the customer service team; if you have any questions or concerns about your water bottle, just go to their contact page on their website and send them an e-mail. They will get back to you within 24 hours and help you solve your issue if it falls under their lifetime warranty - how cool is that? You don't get that very often with companies, and that is something to really considering when buying any product you plan on using consistently. Most don't offer superior service, but you are lucky if you buy from Hydro Cell because you will receive awesome customer service that is responsive and respectful! Special shout out to Jordan at Hyrdo Cell for assisting me!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 5-star Product",
                "reviewText": "What designates a \"5-star\" product from a \"4-star\" product? For me, its when a product goes above and beyond. You think, what could a stinkin' water bottle do that is \"above and beyond\"? Well, I'm happy to say that this product is made in the USA, the water bottles are elegantly designed and have care and thought put into them: you can't imagine how difficult it is to pick out a large waterbottle that actually fits in a standard cupholder! It comes with two caps, to fit your usage. Their customer service is ultra fast, friendly, and helpful. The price is right, and above all else, can you believe the product actually works as advertised? Super cold or warm drinks for the whole day. To me, all that combined makes this a stellar product and one that I'm happy to use, and recommend wholeheartedly!When I first got the product I assumed it was just like any other waterbottle/cheap thing you buy on Amazon, it comes from some other country, and has no instructions and a bunch of cheap accessories they throw on to inflate the price and make it seem like a better value. I've been taught this from too many Amazon products. So, I was not surprised when I unboxed it filled it up and the next morning went to drink and ended up with water pouring out down my chin.Over the next few days I started drinking a LOT more water, because the bottle was attractive, it fit in my cupholders at work and in my car, it was convenient, and it kept the beverage enjoyable because it was ice cold- just the way I like it.But it leaked, every time I took a sip... Disappointed, I contacted customer service to initiate a return. I was really kind of sad. The customer service person was overtly polite and apologetic and wanted to ship out a return at no cost. They even wanted me, again, fully prepaid, to return the bottle to them so they could inspect it for manufacturing defects, which I was more than happy to do. What company does that? Not many that I've dealt with. Most just want the product back so they know you aren't scamming them. However, after I started talking about a return, I did some Youtube investigating because I wanted to see if perhaps the leak was specific to the 24oz bottle or something. As I went through reviews, nobody mentioned it. And finally I stumbled upon an unboxing video where they showed someone putting the water bottle together and that's where it hit me. There is 2 straw accessories included with the water bottle. These accessories I assumed had to do with the other bottle cap that came with the product. Or, I assumed it was for if you literally just didn't want to put a cap on at all so you could drink out of the bottle. I don't know what I was thinking. I clearly wasn't. But anyway, after looking at the video I realized that it was leaking, because the straw cap is meant to be used in conjunction with one of these straws on the inside of the bottle. That way, you aren't inverting the entire water bottle upside to drink out of an open hole. What an idiot!After I realized this, I tested it, and of course it worked. I went back to customer service and immediately told them my error. I'd like to call out Jordan who was the representative who was very helpful the whole way and may have chuckled to himself but never made me feel like an idiot.As I mentioned, the bottle looks great, and has made me drink more water each day. I think from a combination of it being nice and cold, and from the flashy bottle being in my peripheral vision to remind me to drink. In fact, each day, even though I know you should be drinking more than one 24oz bottle a day, I have to make baby steps. And each day I come home with a bottle that was full in the morning that has less and less each progressive day. I call that a win, and it is all due to this product.I would completely recommend this product to anyone. And plan to pick up some more bottle soon as gifts. My only negative would be that it should come with some basic instructions on how to care for it, and maybe a little idiot-proof diagram that shows if you use the straw cap, that there is an interior straw that needs to be added.",
