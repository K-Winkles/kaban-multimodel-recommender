This jug is not only the absolute perfect size but it'll hold ice for up to 2 days! It's big, but the braided lanyard is a great handle. I'm not sure what the carbineer is for but I'm sure I'll figure it out when I want to attach something to it. I also appreciate that it has 2 straws and a cleaning brush so I'll always have a spare when I need it. Cheers! Here's to a LOT of cold water!",

So I needed a larger container. I bought this bottle for the easy to drink option and the handle. I love that I can slip it over my arm and carry it with other items in my hands or go hands free. I can easily pour ice into the top and it stays cold all day long. I have tried to finish the full bottle in a day and so far I\u2019ve been unsuccessful, which I like because I know I\u2019m good for a full work day. I also love that this bottle is so big to add stickers to and stickers stick to it well. I have been complimented on the external look of the bottle with the gradual color change but I may still cover it in stickers. I would buy again.",

It kept broth hot for hours, in 20 degree temperatures. It is light and easy to carry, easy to pour into small cups without spilling and one third the price of the top brand. The one shortcoming is the lid gasket to prevent spills is a bit loose, not a tight fitting rubber. I needed to make sure it was exactly in place before tightening the lid, which did make it 100% leak proof. Not sure how long that will last. For the price it is a great product.",
