They are affordable and feel great in the hand, but they also fit into the pockets of my shorts, leggings, and running vest, which is super convenient. The size is just right and depending on the length of my run and the heat index I will bring one or both with me. They don\u2019t leak at all either, so they are convenient for travel. I took them on a long trip out of the country, and they took up very little space/weight and could be thrown into a bag or pocket for a hike or exploring around the city.They aren\u2019t super easy to clean. I\u2019ve left electrolytes in them for a couple days before cleaning (oops!) and have seen mold in the nooks and crannies, but as long as you rinse them out (and let dry) right away - or only use water in them - you shouldn\u2019t have this issue.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little water bottle. I really like the feel of the silicone, I use it nearly everyday and it is holding up fine. As much as I love it, there are three things to be aware of before buying it:#1: It is small. It is hard to tell from the pictures, and even in person it looks like it would hold more water than it does. This is both a good and bad thing, it makes it light and easy to travel with, but not a lot of water. I think it is about half the size of a standard plastic bottle. On the plus side, this means it easily fits in a bag or purse. It is actually small enough I could carry it in the side pockets of my leggings. Not sure how comfortable that would be, but it fits.#2: It does not stand up on its own. This is very clear from looking at the design of it (it does not have a flat bottom) but somehow I did not expect that. This is not a problem if you plan to take it in a bag, but I would not take it out with me and set it on a random table because it can be hard to keep the nozzle off the ground.#3: To drink water out of it, you use your teeth and put pressure on the top and bottom of the silicone part of the nozzle. (This was the weirdest one for me.) This breaks the seal and lets the water out. It was strange at first, but I really like that aspect now. I makes it almost impossible for the bottle to leak, at least through the nozzle. And you don't have to worry about any kind of cap. It also makes it easy to use with just one free hand. I was worried this would wear out, but I empty and refill this bottle multiple times every day, I have had it for months now, and it is shows no signs of wearing out.As long as you are okay with a little water bottle, I really recommend this one. I would not take this on a multi hour long hike, but when I go out for a walk, or run to the store, this one comes with me :)",

                "reviewText": "I do not like it when water swishes around in bottles when I run. This collapses as you drink, so no more swishing! The mouth piece takes a moment to get used to. You need to bite down gently and then squeeze the bottle or suck in the water. Not uncomfortable at all during running. No fussing with caps or tops that go up and down. Just drink and that\u2019s it. Also the top does not leak even if you squeeze the bladder. Just make sure to close tightly. When filling I recommend filling as much as possible to eliminate air so you don\u2019t get swishing. It\u2019s also very light and pliable for easy portability when not filled with water. You can put this in a pocket or hold it in your hand while running. Also works as a water bottle to carry around with you all day. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these and gave one to my sister during a backpacking trip. They worked great and fit nicely in my cargo pocket. A couple of weeks later, I filled my water bottle up for a long run, and put it into my shorts pocket. In both scenarios, the bottle never came into contact with any needles or sharp objects.Half way through my long run, I noticed my pocket was wet and that about 2/3 of the water had leaked out. I thought maybe it was a leaky valve or something at first or that I hadn't screwed the lid on right. But neither of those were the case. On closer inspection, it appeared that the leak had sprung from a hole in the side of the water bottle.The hole was small - almost like it had been punctured by a needle. When I squished the bottle, it would squirt a thin stream out the side. But, I'm the only one who had contact with it, and never put it in the same location as sharp objects. As near as I can tell, when I had folded the bottle empty in my pocket, a tiny creese appeared where the rubber bottle was bent and caused a leak. In other words, the leak appeared where the bottle had been bent. The Running Water Bottle Handheld 8.5oz- Flexible Water Bottle was about three weeks old total.Very odd. And it was dangerous to trail-run a half marathon on my own in 98-degree f temperatures, and find I only had about 2.5 ounces of water when I was already traveling light with 8 ounces. I count myself fortunate to have prayed, and had that prayer answered via timing. All of the sprinklers in the city park and neighborhood turned on along my last few miles back towards home. It kept me cool enough to make it back without heat or dehydration injury.My suggestion would be to buy a more expensive bottle made out of higher-quality materials if you're going to count on it with your safety and possibly your life. But, if it's just for passive or occasional use, and if it springs a leak in three weeks, you're ok with it, then this is a great shape, has a good nipple on it, and is a perfect size.",
