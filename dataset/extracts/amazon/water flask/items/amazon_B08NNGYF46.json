Take a little more.FLASK500 (17oz): used as a stand-alone soft flask or with tubing (included). Note that FLASK500 comes with FITLY Sub90 and is too big for FITLY Sub45. IMPORTANT: Soft Flasks are NOT MADE for viscous substances like a gel (typically self-serving anyways) but flowing liquids. Many runners use a mixture of water and gel. Not as thick and transits better through the mouthpiece. The flasks are all sealed by hands. Expect volume variations up to 1 oz (up or down).",
