The build and design is as pictured and the individual metal protrusions stick out in a reliable way for supporting the bottles. The product comes with some very minor assembly required. The metal parts for example need to be popped into place. assembly was super quick and seems pretty solid. I've been debating if the connections where things pop together are solid enough to let me disassemble for more compact storage. They seem like it would hold up but might wear it out so for now I just place it up on a shelf when not in use.",

                "reviewText": "Obviously not just for Hydro Flask bottles, this is great for helping to air dry any bottles that fit (which I've found to be all the dozen or so I've tried so far). In fact, the only part of this that hasn't been well fitting is the straw holes, which don't fit the larger format straws used in other larger, popular water bottles.The drying rack is as good looking as such a functional item can be. It's sturdy, and won't easily tip over if, for instance, a cat hops up on the counter and brushes against some bottles drying on it. The rubber feet on the bottom do a great job keeping this where it's supposed to be, and when not in use the removable center piece helps the whole thing fit nicely away in a cupbord.",

                "reviewText": "I got this rack in order to both dry and corral our many water bottles on the counter separately from our actual drying rack. So far it is working fine for this purpose.The rack was easy to put together, as it just has the metal bottle holder that clicks into the base and a removable lid/straw holder. On the bottom are a few very small grips on each corner. I wouldn't necessarily call this collapsible, but you can take the parts apart as easily as it was put together. I would also not call this something that frees up counter space, since it still takes up a decent amount, but it is more for organization and a place to dry out the bottles that most people probably use on a daily basis.It holds 6 bottles, and it is not just for Hydro Flask; it can be used with any wide mouth bottle. My husband has also discovered it to be useful for drying wine glasses, though you might want to be more careful about that.The bottom tray does not slope nor contain any draining functionality. I understand that some people may want that, but for our purpose this works fine because we have a regular dishrack that drains into the sink and this sits next to it on the counter, so I don't actually want/need it to have a spout.I think this is a great option to organize the bottles that you use daily without taking up valuable dishrack space, although it's a little pricey for what it is.",

Problem solved with this product. It fully supports both bottles plus the grand kid's water bottles (holds up to 6) when they visit. The white and light gray is an attractive color and the rack is made very well. The only con is that the bottom tray is not sloped so the accumulated water can drain into the sink. Definitely not a deal breaker. It is lightweight enough that you can easily lift it and drain into the sink. A great addition to my kitchen.",

The pieces interlock easily and stay in place during use.I\u2019ve used it with a wide selection of bottle shapes and materials, and they all dried fully in the same amount of time they do in my regular rack. I like the separate area for lids and other small parts as it keeps them contained and easy to find.The straw section might be useful for small straws, but they don\u2019t work well for the straws we typically use (Yeti, etc.). I assume they work for Hydroflask straws well, but we don\u2019t own any of their bottles, so I can\u2019t confirm that.My only complaint is that the description lists this rack as collapsible, but there\u2019s no way I can see for it to collapse or fold down in any way. At best, the company might be making this claim because the basket and rack are removable, but it\u2019s a hassle to take those out, and few people would define that as collapsing. For small kitchens like mine, making this rack truly collapsible would\u2019ve been a huge benefit. As it stands, it works fine, but it\u2019s a little troublesome to store.Overall, it\u2019s a decent rack. I don\u2019t love it, but I do like it, and it will be good to use for bottles when my primary rack gets full.",
