Bottle itself is lightweight so even after I fill it up with water, it still is light enough to carry in my tote bag and water does not leak which is amazing. I wasn't sure about spending $40-60 for the brand name bottle and I am glad I didn't. This bottle looks and feels luxurious and goes very well with my weekend tote bag and office backpack. I am really enjoying having cold water by my side wherever I go. Also, I already dropped it 3 times by accident but I didn't find any scratches or dents. I am very happy with this bottle. I plan to buy few more as holiday gifts for my best friends.",

The slim design helps to put it in the backpack when you go on a hike or picnic or work. It stores both cold and/or hot water and lasts the whole day! One down side is it doesn't hold in the cup holder of older cars too well. Because of its height, it may tip over in different directions when you drive. But I've been using this thermos since last fall and enjoying it very much. It's very easy to clean, too!",
