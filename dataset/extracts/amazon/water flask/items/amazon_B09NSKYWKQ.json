It's a bit big but it's really nice for carring around with me all day since sometimes it can be hard to find somewhere to refill a smaller bottle. I put some ice in it, fill the rest with water, and sip from the straw all day. By the end of the night the ice is STILL FROZEN! This is easily the best, most efficient water bottle I've owned! Plus I can just chuck it in the dish washer and bam! The wide mouth also let's me clean it by hand with stick scrubber if I need to! Super happy with my purchase!",

I knew when i dropped it that i did something to it! So...... i jumped on Amazon and bought another! Also got one for my 8 yr old going back to school!!",
