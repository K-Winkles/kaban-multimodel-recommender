                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love my thermal JoyJolt water bottle! My personal opinion, it beats Hydro Flask. My other Hydro Flask couldn\u2019t keep my drinks cold anymore. No matter how many ice cubes I put inside, it will melt quickly. This water bottle has exceeded all my expectations and deserves a solid five stars. It did leak a little bit initially, but it stopped leaking. I haven't had any issues with this water bottle whatsoever. It indeed keeps my drinks ice-cold for hours, and it's also incredibly durable. I love the gray/black sleek design. It\u2019s a bonus. Another thing I really like about this water bottle is that the handle is on the top. Not like Hydro Flask it's placed at an odd angle. I say give them a try! Oh, the last thing, this water bottle comes with a lifetime warranty! If anything breaks, they\u2019ll replace it and send you a new piece.",

My one complaint is that I've only had it a few months and one end of the handle broke. They make the handle so that you can snap it on and off as needed, however the connector piece on one end broke off so it no longer snaps on one side. The handle feels like pretty flimsy plastic and it really didn't last very long.",

                "reviewText": "This thermos is as close to perfect as I think you could get. I\u2019ve had it for a few months now and it\u2019s never let me down. First of all, the color is so so cute. But more importantly: 1. It keeps ice for over 24 hours. I\u2019ve forgotten it in my hot car for a few hours, and my water was still cold. 2. It\u2019s pretty much spill proof. As long as the straw lid is tucked down, you could probably take it on a dang rollercoaster and you wouldn\u2019t have a drop of water leaking. I am very clumsy and have dropped this many times. No leaks! 3. It\u2019s a great size- it holds lots of water without being big or clunky AND still fits in pretty much all cup holders, which is an absolute must. It\u2019s also easy to clean! Just don\u2019t put it in the dishwasher or use crazy hot water on the lid as that will ruin the seal. It\u2019s quick and easy to just wash by hand when needed.The customer service is great too! I accidentally broke the lid (tip: don\u2019t try to unscrew the lid by twisting by the pop up handle lol) and they sent me a replacement lid and straw within a couple of days! Note on that: the lid can be hard to open sometimes, but that\u2019s just the way it goes when you have an airtight/leakproof container. If it\u2019s especially difficult or when I just have noodle arms I hold it between my thighs for tension and the lid twists right off lol.Tl;Dr: I love this thing and highly recommend it!",

It keeps leaks water and the handle was too tight to open it up. Very disappointed and I should look at the one star review before making this decision to buy it. No way to keep using it and it has to be returned as soon as possible .",
