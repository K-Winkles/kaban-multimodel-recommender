And the lid options cover multiple use cases and preferences.When I accidentally dropped my bottle, the handle snapped of my lid. That was totally my fault, the lid itself does seem to be very sturdy and well made. I contacted Civago and they helped me get a hold of a replacement lid.This is a great bottle, and Civago seems to stand by their product with fast responses and good communication.",
