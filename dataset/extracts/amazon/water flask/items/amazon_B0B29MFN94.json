And I was also having trouble with sticking in my straw cap with the yeti bottle crushing through the ice. With this bottle, I for some reason don\u2019t have that problem at all. Saves me so much time and energy. I do wish the bottle was a little wider to fit ice in quicker but it\u2019s not a big deal. It says 18 oz but is a bit smaller than the yeti 18 oz water bottle for comparison. But all this means nothing to me since it\u2019s so much better and doesn\u2019t break my arm trying to push the straw in and opening it! It keeps water cool for long and ice stays frozen for a good time! It is leak proof as long as the straw part is closed of course. Unless you overfill it. Very easy and simple to clean, easy to hold and carry around. Not too heavy.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve never loved something so utilitarian, so much. This water bottle is amazing. It\u2019s super cute, keeps water cold, and has caused me to drink more water than I have in literal years.The design is so thoughtful. The little cap stays back when you flip it (no dangling!), it locks on when you twist it but it\u2019s easy to twist on and off, and the spout has a little dip for easy drinking. The only thing I would change is making the spout a bit wider for really chugging. HOWEVER, if I drink anymore water I\u2019d probably be over-hydrated at this point. Since getting this, I\u2019ve increased my water intake from probably 48oz a day to like over 100oz.I originally got the camelback but the magnetic closure drove me crazy immediately so I returned it. That one was more expensive too! I was going to break down and get a hydro flask, until I stumbled upon this. So glad I did!I really can\u2019t believe this water bottle is such fantastic quality and so intentional with design, and offered at this price point. I\u2019m going to buy another just to have a backup and yes I am telling everyone about it.Last thing I will say is that the color is better in person. I got the sage color and it\u2019s far less blue and more true sage/mint in person. I love it.",

I gave it 4 stars not for that, but because sometimes when it's been rolling around in my car and I go to pop open the spout, it shoots water out and gets all over the place.
