I felt like I was trusting the reviews about how long this keeps ice cold. The reviews were dead accurate. This keeps ice in a hot parked car in 100+ degree heat for DAYS! If only they could make ice chests like this. This has a wide mouth that makes cleaning easy and getting large ice cubes in a cinch. The mouth could possibly fit other similar size lids if you want one with a straw, although I'm happy with the twist open spout. You would have to trim the straw to fit properly, but who cares? This is hands down the best value, best quality, best product on Amazon. If you need to stay hydrated on hot summer days, BUY THIS ONE!",

With 50 oz of cold water available at all times my kidneys have grown to superhuman capacity as they filter every toxin from my body. My blood is now able to reverse the aging process in others. While this unit is able to keep water cold for hours or even days, the availability will drive you to consume more that you believed possible. I am immune to hangovers and sunburn. The handle will fit 3 fingers to aid in carrying the tremendous mass of water comfortable. The girth of this unit is truly imposing, and when set down on a conference table will exert dominance over all others.",

So, I asked for warranty and because I bought it in Canada and live in Canada they will not support any warranty outside of the U.S. I was completely baffled as to why but they said they only support their products in the US. I could purchase a new straw for almost $25 cad to replace the straw that was with a hairline crack. I said I'm not stupid, why would I ever buy anymore of their products if they won't honor any warranty. I rather find another product that is supported and is sold in Canada as well as parts too. I don't recommend them and only give them one star because of their policy on warranty. They will sell us all the parts and products we want but won't support them at all. Buyer beware!...they are a quality product and it's a shame they won't support them but in the end, why waste your money, buy another product that sells parts and accessories in Canada with warranty! Cheers!",
