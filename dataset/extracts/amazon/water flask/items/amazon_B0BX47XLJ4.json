The ice lasts about a couple hours just because it's sitting in the sun, but keeps the water near ice cold for a LONG TIME. The case is faux leather so I'm not sure how long it will last, but it's doing good so far. In one review someone said the clips left marks on the waterbottle, and they do, but it doesn't matter much to me. So cute and an amazing deal for such a great product.",

It holds enough water for me to drink throughout the day when I\u2019m not home. I don\u2019t really like the taste of filtered water from public spaces so I\u2019m glad to be able to carry around my home filtered water.",

It\u2019s big which is what I was looking for and the little sleeve and strap make it so easy to carry around. If you grab the bottle from the top it will slide out of the sleeve but that\u2019s not a big deal since I only use the sleeve to carry it from point a to b. I highly Recommend purchasing this water bottle. I am no longer dehydrated! Also it\u2019s stood up to being left in my car in 90 degree weather\u2026 ice cubes didn\u2019t even melt!! 5 stars!",
