                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift. The color is super pretty. The design is slim, making it easy to hold single handed. It's not too heavy, but you can tell it provides good insulation. It fits the driver side cup holders in our small Honda Fit, but it's too tall for the center console cup holders, so it's a bit inconvenient in that aspect. Perhaps the cup holders in larger cars have the needed space. Even with it's height, it fits in a standard lunch bag or backpack with no issues.Haven't experienced any leaks with it. It's easy to take apart and clean. It keeps water cold all day and is easy to carry around with the little top handle. It's a great water bottle an I think makes an awesome gift.",
