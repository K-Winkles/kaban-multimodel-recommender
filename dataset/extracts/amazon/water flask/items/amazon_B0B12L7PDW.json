I bought this one because it is lighter and more narrow, and because the color looked fantastic. The weight difference is notable between the standard and the lightweight. The lightweight bottle is smaller and more narrow than I anticipated, it doesn\u2019t quite fit in my car holder, but it fits in my back pack side pockets much better than the other bottle. The color is bright with a little shine to it. I will probably purchase my next bottle from the trail series.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve owned many hydro flasks over the years and like them all. This model (I have the bigger version and the smaller size now) I love. They are so light compared to others of similar size. I use these as a EDC for work and home, I\u2019m not a hiker but the weight difference is significant. I\u2019ve not had long enough to comment on durability of the finish but thus far it\u2019s nice. The brownish color is really nice. The silver is silver but more titanium in color. One dislike is that it doesn\u2019t have a sip lid. I don\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t use a sip lid. I had to buy my lid separately which to an already expensive item kinda stings. Nevertheless overall very much like this item. Would recommend.",

While indeed very lightweight, that bottle proved completely unusable in the harsh summer where I live (almost 100 degrees on a daily basis).The Hydro Flask, on the other hand, seems to not care about the weather at all. I carry it regularly when cycling in this blazing heat and get very cold water even after hours in the sun. It's an amazing piece of technology that really saves the day.",
