The square design makes it easy to fit in my bag without taking up too much space, and it's perfect for the gym.

It's a little difficult to clean, but what I did was put some dry rice inside the bottle, a tiny bit of water and dish soap, then put the lid on and shook it a lot. It's super cute and I get a lot of compliments from it!",

                "reviewText": "I haven't dropped this bottle yet, so I cannot personally speak to its ability to withstand impact. However, it appears to be very well designed, with thought given to providing a surface around the edges, which can absorb impact and thereby protect the harder plastic that holds the liquid. The screw-off lid is also designed differently than most lids and it, too, reflects an attention to detail to prevent breakage and spillage. The workmanship is excellent. The box shape of this water bottle makes it fit perfectly into my rolling office bag as well as my small \"purse backpack\". My only complaint is the volume capacity, which is only 13 ounces. I wish they would make a version that's at least 16 ounces, preferably 24 ounces, so I could get one for my larger backpack that I use for day hikes.",
