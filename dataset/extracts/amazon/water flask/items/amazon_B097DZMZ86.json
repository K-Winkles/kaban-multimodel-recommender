                "reviewText": "It can be hit or miss with these, as it seems new brands pop up all the time with questionable quality. Bought this for the annual beach trip, and it was great. The bottle held ice VERY long times, the carry case worked well, the multiple lids all seem good (and no leaks during our usage), and the misc cleaning things were fine. The only thing I noticed is the very bottom feels \u2018soft,\u2019 like it would ding very, very easily if not covered by the case or a silicone bottom (the case offers some padding protection, but to be clear a serious drop with the case will likely cause an issue). I just leave ours in the case so no issue at the moment. I wouldn\u2019t want to drop it without some protection though. But honestly that varies by user/usage, so YMMV. Overall, very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I started to stop using plastic water bottles, it is not environmentally friendly and not good for our health, so I bought this stainless steel insulated water bottle. It surprised me that I got this bottle at a very cheap price, and also got 3 different types of lids, and even more 5 other accessories(2 brushes, 2 straws, carryable pouch). When I received it, I cleaned the inner tank and it smelled no odor!I read the product description and they said that this insulated water bottle can be kept cold for 48 hours, so I made a test. I filled the whole bottle with ice cubes, after 24 hours, they were still full of ice cubes; two days later, the ice cubes only melted halfway! Even on the third day, the water was still cold, and there were a little ice cubes floating on it. AMAZING! You can freeze all your drinks into ice cubes, and it can keep cold longer.And I don\u2019t need to buy extra cleaning brushes. They are equipped with straws brushes and cleaning brushes, and there is also an extra carryable pouch so that I don\u2019t wear out this beautiful body, I can carry him on my back or take it in my hand. Very convenient!I highly recommended it to my friends, they also like this insulated water bottle very much, we look forward to going out together next time!",

                "reviewText": "I love the water bottle, it's big and insulated, keeps my water cold throughout the day, but I bought this for the convenience of the strap so I wouldn't have to hold it to carry it around because it's so chunky. it seemed to be the perfect solution, untilonly days after using this water bottle I noticed that one side of the strap hardware would come undone for no apparent reason. it was always random and I never was touching it when it would happen, often times it was when I would just pick it up to put it on, but sometimes it would happen when I was already wearing it. it would come undone on this one side and I'd have to re-eclip it. it really began to concern me because I never knew when it would come undone and possibly hurt me when it fell.but I put up with it until today, when the hardware actually broke in half while I was wearing it. I mean I'm lucky it didn't land on my foot, because it was full of water and that could really do damage.I dont want to get rid of this bottle I just want a replacement strap !!!!",
