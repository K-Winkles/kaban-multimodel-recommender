                "reviewText": "I stumbled upon this bottle during a search on Amazon. I just purchased an amazing matte black E bike and needed a larger water bottle size for longer trips. This is very close to the perfect bottle! Its Triple insulated and comes with 3 caps for your choosing. There are other colors but I chose matte black like the E bike! Again, this appears to be really well made. I've tried 6 or more and this one is the best for functionality, simplicity and good looks. The bottle would, however, be useless if it didn't deliver on hot and cold temps as advertised of maximum 12 hours! Im thrilled to report that It's definitely all there. This company actually provides a water bottle that matches its stated specs! I love it!!! Lastly, you will probably need to purchase an inexpensive rubber bike bottle strap accessory that acts as a mounting device to attach the bottle to the bike. that is intuitive, fast release and strong. Easy $10 bottle attachment that holds any type of water bott You will love it too!",

I have a bunch of 32 oz which are great but the 25 oz fits in my cars cup holder so it goes on road trips. It keeps drinks cold for a remarkably long time. Hot drinks stay hot all day. The soft straw lid is my favorite. The flip sip coffee lid is great for when I have hot drinks. The bottle has a great feel to it and is easy to hold and carry. I love my bigger 32 oz bottles but this 25 oz is great for when you do t want something quite that big. Again, I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one.",

                "reviewText": "Product is excellent. Good size and great thermal insulation. The bottle itself feels high quality.I removed 1 star as my only issues have been with the 3 plastic lids provided. They all seal very well, but the straw lid is difficult to drink out of and needs a lot of suction, the flip lid gets easily blocked by anything solid (ice in my case), and the twist-off lid melted in the dishwasher as you can see from the attached image. The part that melted was the part in contact with the rack. It still functions, but I expect the giant hole in the outer layer will make it lose a lot more heat. Which is unfortunate as it's my preferred lid of the 3. Beyond that a very good product.",
