                "reviewText": "Apparently I didn\u2019t read the full description, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received a bag to carry the bottle in - not only the bottle with 3 lids, two straws, and a straw cleaning brush. The bag is necessary because I got the 64oz (half gallon) size, so it\u2019s hard to find an easy way to carry it. This size is also too large to fit in any cup holders - if you want that, get the 32oz size.I tested it with iced water. It stayed ice cold for 3 days, cool for two more days, & then it was room temp.I haven\u2019t had the chance to test it with hot, but I anticipate that it will keep it piping hot for 1.5-2 days, warm for the following 1-1.5 days, & room temp after that.The three lids allow you to have (1) a straw to drink from, (2) a canteen type spout, & (3) an insulated top [great for soups, stews, chowders, etc.].The outside finish is matte & textured. If you want smooth, Starry Indigo is not for you. I, personally, LOVE it!! It\u2019s beautiful &, because of that, I enjoy drinking my water - which is new for me as water and I don\u2019t usually get along.As long as the lids are closed, it will be water tight (leak proof). The only one you have to be careful of is the straw lid. If it\u2019s not fully closed (mouth piece folded down), it will leak.",

These things are sturdy and keep cold drinks cold for a very long time. They wash very easily thanks to a wide opening and it is very nice to have 3 different lids to choose between. I also like that the paint is textured, so it is easier to grip and doesn't slip from my hands as easily. I am very happy with this purchase!",

I prepare it the night before with ice and water to have it ready in the morning for my son to take to school and the ice is intact. We\u2019ve literally left it out on the kitchen counter for a few days to test how the insulation works and the ice has kept perfectly along with keeping the water cold. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for airplane travel. I love the insulated carry pouch. I can fill the bottle once I\u2019m past security, and throw it over my shoulder or across my chest to get it onto the plane. No awkward juggling as I pull my carry on with one hand and use my phone with the other to get onboard. It keeps liquid cold. I love that it included the three different lids. I use the lid with the straw on the plane, then switch to the cap top once I arrive at my destination. It takes 40 oz of water, which is a generous amount.Drawbacks: it\u2019s heavy. Twice as heavy as the 50 oz bottle (which is also insulated stainless steel) I use at home. Also, the top with the flip top and the straw attached inside the bottle doesn\u2019t work very well. The opening is so skinny it\u2019s hard to get enough water through.",
