                "reviewText": "I carry this 64oz jug, plus a 32oz, plus a 40oz blenderbottle. The carry handle let's me do all that with 1 hand thanks to a carabiner clip. You might want to upgrade your carabiner.The ferro rod shoots monster sparks. Compass works. Whistle works. And paracord seems strong (unsure if 550 or not). If you wanted to buy these things separate, you'd spend more than you did on the bottle. So it's cool you can get them included with a metal insulated jug like this. Very convenient for campouts.No leaks with the straw lid and Spout Lid. Both are more sturdy than my previous ones (stays closed, won't over tighten and skip a thread). And the 64oz lids fit my wide mouth 32oz hydroflasks perfectly.Cheaper to buy a new bottle with 3 lids+accessories instead of just buying a replacement lid set. 10/10 recommend.Keeps that drink COLD. I use this 64oz as a water Buffalo for my easier to carry 32oz. Refill with the pour Spout Lid and enjoy the cold bev. My hydroflask has dents and can't keep anything cold. This 64oz refills ICY cold drinks all day long.Customer service is excellent too. Quick response and great solution. Will be coming back!",

                "reviewText": "Large capacity, keeps drinks cold, looks good but has a purple tint that doesn't come through on the product images which you may or maynot like. If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed. Part of the reason I purchased this particular bottle was because of the included extra lids, I was hoping they'd fit an Amazon Basics bottle whose lid broke, sadly they do not. I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it. On a solid color it may be more obvious. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the black 64oz bottle and have been using this bottle daily for about two months now. It has great and has met all my expectations. I\u2019m currently living in a tropical climate which means it\u2019s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I\u2019ve gotten this bottle I\u2019ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I\u2019m at home I set it down a lot and so I\u2019m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that\u2019s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It\u2019s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn\u2019t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it\u2019s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I\u2019ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I\u2019ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can\u2019t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I\u2019m drinking I\u2019m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn\u2019t something I\u2019m doing. The longest I\u2019ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I\u2019ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it\u2019s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I\u2019d recommend it to family and friends.",
