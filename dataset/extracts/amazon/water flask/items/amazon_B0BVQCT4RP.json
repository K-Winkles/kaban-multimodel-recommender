                "reviewText": "This is the best water bottle I have ever had. It\u2019s beautiful on the outside, insulated stainless steel on the inside. The ice stays solid and water stays cold all day long. It comes with three different lids. The first one has an attached straw so you don\u2019t have to tip the bottle over to sip. It also has a hanging strap for easy carrying. The second lid is the kind you sip from the bottle and comes with a fruit filter if you want to put fruit in your water. The filter prevents the fruits from coming through the sip hole. It has an optional carrying handle on the top that flips up if you want to use it. Very convenient! The third lid is a solid screw on cap for when you are using it for hot liquids. You can also use it for cold liquids. It has a handle that you can strap onto your belt buckle or pant strap or even a bicycle. It also comes with a long straw brush. I can\u2019t say enough about this bottle. It is very durable and easy to clean. Oh, and did I mention that there is no condensation on the outside of the bottle when you are using it with cold liquids. That is what I absolutely hated about all my other bottles was the condensation dripping down and the water ruining my table surface. This bottle does not do that! They also have excellent customer service!",

The stickers it came with are cute as well but my kid wanted some bunny stickers on it.",

First the steel bottle gets hot when exposed to the sun or in the steamroom (!), too hot to comfortably handle. I put a small neoprene beer can wrap on it and problem solved. The other hack was needed when it was hard to suck water. I trimmed about 1/4 inch off the end of the straw and it solved the problem.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this water bottle via recommendation from Mamavation (if you have never heard of her and care about lowering your toxiv exposure, I highly recommend you check her out). I have been using this water bottle less than a month. The outside edge is already rusting....this makes me wonder what it is actually made of. I wouldn't suspect stainless steel to rust so rapidly.I really liked the multiple lid options. I really like the capacity. I really like the color. I really like it fits in regular cup holders. But I don't know if it will last long. I can technically still return it, so I think I will attempt an exchange.Update 1: I did exchange and my second one did the same thing, but due to vacations I missed the return window.I bought 5 of the 20 oz bottles for my kids at the same time I purchased my 1st 30 oz and NONE of those have rusted at all. Same type of use. Same type of water. I am going to see if I can contact the manufacturer.Update 2: I contacted the manufacturer and they got Amazon to issue a refund AND the sent me a new water bottle. So customer service is 5 start quality! They sent me a different color and I'm hoping this time I don't see any rust. My kid's 20 oz are still going strong so I know that the majority of their bottles are good quality usually.",
