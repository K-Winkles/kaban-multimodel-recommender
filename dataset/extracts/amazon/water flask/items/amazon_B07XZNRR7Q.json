They don\u2019t leak hardly at all (after a lot of use I found one leaking a little bit but my newer one is still totally leak proof). They keep my water cold for hours but don\u2019t have any condensation on the outside of the bottle. The mouthpiece is good and you can use it with or without the straw. It is also really easy to clean with a straw cleaner, and the straw is clear so I can be sure there isn\u2019t anything gross growing in there. I will never buy another water bottle. I\u2019ve dropped mine several time and don\u2019t have any dents at all!Also: oh the ello website you can buy replacement lids if needed :)",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried a ton of insulated bottles and mugs over the years and this one is by far my favorite, both because it\u2019s a straw (you don\u2019t have to tilt the mug to drink out of it you just hold it up to your mouth vertically - this is a real plus if you have ice in it, because tilting with ice sometimes means either a gush or the opening blocked by ice), and also because of the flip-cap that covers the whole top (if you\u2019re moving through a crowd that keeps your sippy-hole nice and clean from other people\u2019s germs, or if you\u2019re on the beach or trail it keeps dirt and sand off the entire top - I love that). Not to mention it does stay very cold (as cold as any other brands I\u2019ve tried, longer than most), and I really like having the carabiner option (in the gym you can clip your keys to it, or on the go you can clip it to your bag or pack). The powder coating is NOT indestructible, I did manage to put a scratch on one while rock climbing - cup still works fine, it\u2019s just a cosmetic blemish, but if you know you\u2019re going to be banging it around on rocks or metal, you might consider using a sleeve of some sort to try to protect it. It\u2019s nice they come in such a variety of pleasant colors, too, if you have multiple people using them or if you use them for different kinds of drinks it\u2019s nice having them color coded (like one of mine I ONLY ever use for water, then I have others I will use for other beverages). These things are a MUST on a cruise or flight, and great if you\u2019re on any kind of international travel when you\u2019re active and thirsty and the last thing you need is to be sick from drinking unclean ice or water.",

                "reviewText": "I really like these water bottles. They are quite durable. Mine has been subjected to a few harsh falls and other than one tiny and insignificant dent, it's still perfectly fine. I think the lid on the 40 ounce bottle is more durable than the smaller size. The lid threads inside of the bottle instead of screwing onto the top. It keeps water very cold for a very long time. The only downside is it does not fit in a cup holder, and it's size (40 oz) makes it kinda awkward to hold onto. There is a tiny \"handle\" on the lid, but that's it. I'm fond of the mouthpiece, it's comfortable to drink from and easy to clean, and I like that I can lock the cap that goes over it so it does not spill when tipped over. I think that's especially important when it does not fit into a cupholder.So yeah, very durable, 10 out of 10 on keeping water cold, and worth purchasing IMO. If Ello designs a water bottle with a large capacity that narrows down at the bottom to fit into a cupholder I would be super stoked, but this one is pretty good.",

                "reviewText": "I've had an issue lately where most water bottles have a little rubber grommet that inserts into the top of the bottle that doesn't allow enough air to get decent suction through the straw, and will occasionally get stuck to the straw, gets pulled out, and gets lost when you flip up the straw (first picture)This bottle has a built in grommet that seems to be partially blocked by the sealing o-ring on the inside (second picture) but does NOT have any issues with suction. There IS a little bit of a swooshing sound whenever you drink from it due to the o-ring, but I don't personally consider it an issue.Otherwise the bottle itself seems like a decent quality metal, comes with a locking lid, and the straw tip is very unique but shockingly pleasant to use.Would definitely buy again; considering getting some additional colors!",

This water bottle is the best one I've found for that - the soft spout never bangs me in the lip and has enough of a seal that it won't leak, but you don't need to use a lot of suction. Hence, \"grown up sippy cup.\" The 22 oz size fits in a standard cup holder and the loop handle is easy to hang on a bag, on a hook, etc. All of the pieces come apart easily for washing and replacement pieces are easily available when needed. The only criticism is that the teeth on the top of the lid which keep it locked into the bottom can break off if you're not careful. Once they do, you have to replace the whole lid. But, not enough of a problem to keep me from buying 10+ of these now!",
