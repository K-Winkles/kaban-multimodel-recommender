First day I had it, it fell off my bike and I ran it over. The front tire actually didn't make it over, so the full weight of the bike just pushed it into the asphalt and dragged it for about 10 feet before the bike and I came to a stop.It's pretty heavily scratched and dented but it still maintained its vacuum insulation and still keeps the coffee hot.",
