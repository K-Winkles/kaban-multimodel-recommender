Not the best-sounding ones for music experience but good enough for needs. Overall it has a decent capability & we (My wife & I) are satisfied with it for the price factor. I would recommend it.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Sound is decent & clear enough- The microphone works great in calls & no one has complained yet who listens to me on those calls- Comfortable to wear & use even for long periods- The controls on the headphones are easy to get used to- Design is classy & professional- Build quality is very good overall & feels durable- Reasonably priced when compared to the competitive options availableCons:- It is not the best-sounding headphones for music listening experiences and it's not fair to compare it with those high-end headphones too",

The extended playback time means I never have to worry about running out of juice, making them perfect for my busy middle school schedule.I like the way they snugly fit into my ears, creating a cozy cocoon of sound. The balanced armature drivers deliver a rich and clear audio experience, whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes or catching up on podcasts. I can wear them during intense workouts, and even when I'm caught in unexpected rain, they continue to perform flawlessly. The neckband ensures they stay securely around my neck, preventing them from getting lost or tangled.I just learned the importance of a good set of earbuds when I started using these. They help me stay focused during homework sessions and make my walks to school much more enjoyable. The durability of these earbuds is impressive, surviving accidental drops and daily wear and tear. Plus, the simple controls make it easy for me to adjust the volume or change tracks.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Cheap- Lightweight/comfortable. Barely notice they are on your collar after a few uses.- Super-long battery. The 80-100 hours claim is not an exaggeration, I play rock and hip-hop at near full volume, and have reached at least 60 hrs on a full charge.- Although not especially rugged, I've dropped them a few times without damage.- default bud tips are not bad in terms of fit, a little fatigue after long usage. I replaced mine with better isolation tips after a few weeks.Cons:- Sound quality is not great, even with a phone EQ app, I struggle to get true quality. However, as a former audio engineer, I'm a bit snobbish in this department. For the price, it's decent quality.- Button ergonomics not great, especially when using light-weight gloves.- magnets could be a bit stronger, they barely hold together.This is my first foray into collar style headsets. I work in an industrial environment, and I hate using my high-end buds, they just get ruined or lost, and I hate having to charge every day. These are a great, cheap bluetooth set that I can quickly pop in and out, not worry about where I put them or have to hold on to them, the battery lasts for weeks, and cheap enough to replace when I do something stupid to them. Quality and isolation is marginal, but fine for a loud work shop. Buttons could be better, but usable with some focus. Calls seem to be ok for send and receive.Great cheap set with long battery life, and mostly hands free, for work environments. Inexpensive enough not to be a problem if they get damaged in a rough work environment.*** 6 month Update: Still have them, still use them almost daily at a wood shop, or when I'm out shoveling snow, or long walks. Still maintain above review.Love them for the long battery life, and exceptional price value. A must have for anyone looking for a cost-effective long-life bluetooth bud set, particularly in a light-medium noise level work environment. The metallic red makes them easy to find in sawdust when I do something stupid. I've gone through maybe 20 different models of cheap bluetooth sets...wired, tethered, and buds....these are the most practical and longest surviving of them all so far.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased these headphones mainly for use at the gym. Ive battled countless pairs of bluetooth earbuds and usually they break or the battery life sucks. These earbuds promised 120 hours of playback. Of course I was skeptical but intrigued at the same time.So as it turns out these earbuds are battery life champions. A single charge takes me through a week of commutes, and gym sessions with juice still to spare. The 10 minute charge for 10 hour playback feature is a lifesaver for those inevitable almost dead moments. Its such a relief not to worry about daily charging.In terms of sound the i35s deliver a clear balanced sound across all different music genres. The custom tuned balanced armature drivers and 10mm neodymium diaphragms punch out clean highs, rich mids, and decently powerful bass. I have not been disappointed so far when using them regardless of the audio played.These earbuds have a durable build. The are lightweight and have a ergonomic design that kinda disappears in your ear.There are multiple ear tip sizes included so I was able to adjust them to ensure a snug, secure fit. I have never experienced any discomfort after wearing them even for long periods of time.I am happy with my purchase overall. These earbuds deliver long lasting and high quality audio. The 120 hour battery life alone makes them a good value for the money!",
