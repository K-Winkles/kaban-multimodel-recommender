I was a little concerned when I unboxed it and felt how light the case was with the earbuds in them but when charged it they charged EXTREMELY fast, far faster than I would have expected. The sound quality is pretty good if you're not expecting top of the line sound but they will get you through work or whatever you're trying to do. You can hear things around you pretty well, that might either be a pro or a con depending on your use case but I don't mind it honestly. Finally they don't fall out easily, pretty much when I first put them in my ears I shook my head around to test them and they didn't even budge, you might have a different experience depending on which covers you use. 6.5/10 I would try them out if you just need something to listen to music or watch videos on casually.",

                "reviewText": "I got these earbuds originally to replace my old galaxy buds, ufortunately my new kitten decided to drag them off to the cat demension. I didn't want to get another expensive pair just for them to fall to the same fate so, after reading reviews for several buds below $50 dollars, I settled on these.First of all the fit on them is fairly good, I have rather small ears so finding earbuds that fit them, especially wireless ones, is pretty difficult. The sound quality is ok. For the price it is pretty good, the sound can just be a little quiet sometimes and the tones aren't very rich. Over all pretty good if you want to watch YouTube or Netflix with them, but they might not be the best for music.The battery life is amazing, I use them for at least 3 hours a day and sometimes overnight and I can go around 2 weeks between charges. Granted, I don't use both at the same time, which does save battery life, but my galaxy buds had to be charged every other day with the same amount of use. However, the Bluetooth connection can be a little finicky at times. They'll sometimes take a pretty long while to connect. Even after putting both buds in the case and closing the lid, the earbuds will stay connected to your phone, therefore you have to completely turn the Bluetooth off if you want to use your phone's speaker/mic.Now to the best part of all, these things are practically indestructible. I tend to bring my buds with me every day at work. I usually use them when I'm on break or lunch, but since I work at a hardware store, you can imagine some of the abuse they go through. Day to day constantly getting dropped or falling out of my pocket, being knocked around while I lift boxes, lumber, and plywood, and other such abuses. But the worst thing I ever put them through was in my own home. Seeing as how I put important things in my pockets all the time, such as my earbuds, keys, phone etc, you'd think I'd be better at checking them before throwing my clothes in the wash. Unfortunately however, I am not. I managed to put these buds through an entire 70 minute wash cycle, and they came out fine, case and all. I separated the buds from the case and left everything open and spread out to dry for about a day. After that, good as new.If you need a cheap and sturdy pair of earbuds just for the sake of watching videos or to use while working, I don't think you'd find a better deal. Not that I'd recommend putting them in the washer, but at least you know it can survive it just in case.",

They're easy to charge on my phone charger, and charge very quickly. Love them, and am considering getting a back up pair if my current ones ever die.",

                "reviewText": "These earbuds are styled somewhat like Apple Airpods, but much cheaper and with a few flaws to match. Connecting them to an iPhone was super easy, and the case charges via USB-C. All of the controls are done by tapping the bud while it's in your ear, and all the ones I tested seemed to work just as described. They don't stay in your ear very well though, so they would be better suited for wearing around the house or while shopping, but I doubt they'd be too great for jogging or other physical activities. The sound quality is alright, but not great. The sound response is pretty flat, without enough oomph/emphasis on either bass or treble. Mediocre sound, but hey, you get what you pay for. The battery life is good. All in all, these are good earbuds for the price. The main thing that irks me a bit is the shape, but I prefer the soft earbuds anyway that conform to your ear shape. If you like the Apple-style hard plastic earbuds, these might just be your jam.",
