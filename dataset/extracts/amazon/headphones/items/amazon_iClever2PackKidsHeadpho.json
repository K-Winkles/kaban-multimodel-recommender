We've had multiple sets of these and fit our youngest even when she was 2 or 3 (not that she would leave them on long, but they fit!). My kids have managed to break a few pairs here or there, but they out last the others 10x as long at least.",

He likes to listen to his tablet on car rides and unfortunately it's rather distracting when I'm trying to concentrate on my driving. I got these to have 1 set in the car and 1 set for the house. When he put them on he smiled and noted how soft they are. That was important to me because he won't keep them on if they get uncomfortable. He also complained with not being able to hear other headsets we tried. He didn't have that problem with this set. He could hear clearly. They are well made with no obvious signs of weak points which would shorten the life span. After a month so far, these are a winner in our book. I'll update if we have any problem down the road. For my peace of mind while driving I'd say these are priceless.",

Demnach sogar f\u00fcr Erwachsene mit kleineren Ohren oder f\u00fcr gelegentliches H\u00f6ren.- Tonqualit\u00e4t: einwandfrei f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke, der Anspruch h\u00e4ngt ja schon von der Qualit\u00e4t der Tonquelle ab. Und hier werden in erster Linie H\u00f6rspiele von Onlineportalen geh\u00f6rt.- Lautst\u00e4rkebegrenzung: ist beruhigend, da Kinder immer mal gern an der Lautst\u00e4rke herumspielen.- Multifunktionsknopf: Der kleine Knopf am Kabel ist ein Mulitfunktionsknopf, mit dem man Tracks vorw\u00e4rts/r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts schalten kann und nochwas, wird hier nicht verwendet. Bzw. wenn sie draufdr\u00fccken, bewirkt es beim H\u00f6ren am Laptop nichts.- Split-Klinkenstecker der gleich dabei war ist auch super.- Optik und Haptik sind sch\u00f6n und wirken nicht billig. Ohrmuscheln sind kreisrund, oval w\u00e4re noch besser. Der gepolsterte Rand isoliert gut vor Umgebungsger\u00e4uschen!Fazit: Haben die Kopfh\u00f6rer jetzt einen Monat im Gebrauch und sind rundum zufrieden bis jetzt.",
