These feel like they can be worn without the worry they might break or get damaged with basic use.The fit:I have a big head and my children have child sized heads and they fit us well. That's a plus if you have multiple children/family members, or school students of various ages and sizes and you are on a budget.The sound:it's good, highs come across crystal clear, mids aren't muffled, the base and lows are decent, thick and present. These are good for music, instruction videos, in class computer learning, and tv/talk radio (podcasts).The price:Unbelievable! They were on sale, Less that $20.00 as of this posting 11/23.My one and only regret: Not buying a second pair exclusively for myself and one for my significant other.Long term: Ill fill this area in if I experience positive or negative long term metrics.",

After years of using cheap Sony headphones which always broke in the very same place, I opted for these. They are so comfy to wear. The sound is great and I was surprised it blocked out the sounds around me. I didn't realize that was even a feature. I'm so happy with these. They were very inexpensive.

                "reviewText": "I do a lot of transcription at work and wanted a new pair of headphones, but needed a moderately long cable to reach the plug into my work computer. The cord was long enough, and the headphones seem reasonably well constructed. The audio quality was fine for what I needed, but I also didn't really test them with music.I like that my ears can fit pretty much entirely within the cups, without the padded parts pressing on them them, but the padded parts are soft enough that it probably wouldn't be a big deal if they did. However, I find they're a little bit tight on my head so they're uncomfortable to wear with my glasses. I also am not a fan of where they press on the joint of my jaw. It's not painful, just unpleasant.Since I need to wear the headphones for long period of time, I need to be really comfortable, so I'm planning on returning it because I don't need another big pair of headphones hanging around. (I already have a pair for home use, but the cable isn't long enough to reach my work computer.)",

They aren't the loudest thing out there but definitely louder than the cheap ones for kids with a volume limiter by far which is great for in the car and in noisier environments. Good quality, have held up to abuse and use from a 4 year old and 9 year old quite well. Would definitely recommend!",

The first ones lasted about 10 months before giving out on vocal audio- the music still plays, but you can't hear vocals. The second pair only lasted 5 months before cracking. I suppose for the cost it should be expected, but it's a bummer to have to throw away a big piece of equipment that only doesn't work bc of poor production. Alas.",
