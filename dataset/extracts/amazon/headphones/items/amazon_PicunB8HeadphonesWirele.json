Reasonably comfortable (any headphone stuffed with a battery, receiver, etc... will never be really light) and unreasonably low priced. A great bargan.Cons? well...the control buttons are black just like the surrounding headphone making it extremely hard (really, really hard) to see in the normally somewhat dim lighting of a TV room. Fix? just paint the on/off button (its the middle one of three) with white nail polish or something similar. In sum - highly recommended.",

I definitely have been happy with the comfort of the fit. The controls on the side took me a moment and once I got the feel it makes it a lot easier to enjoy the sound of whatever I'm connected with. Looking forward to this set of headphones having longevity and maintaining this level of performance.",

The control on the side is very useful and easy to use. Bluetooth connection is quick and easy. The volumes could've been higher, but i understand that it was limited to prevent listeners from blowing out their eardrums. The value and price is a DEAL. Overall, i would recommend this Picun headphones.",

                "reviewText": "I got these headphones on Nov 11. Today is 12/29. I charged these headphones fully when I got them and I use them for about 4hours at a time 3 times and week. I have not had to recharge them yet! I still have 40% battery left and I use them at full volume and and very generous with using the touch control to skipand pause etc on the ear. I will say that the tradeoff for the super long lasting battery is the sound strength.The volume isn't as loud as other comparable headphones with less battery life. But because of the nice fit that seals out other noise it's not a huge issue. The sound is nice deep rich bass. Overall the sound is nice but could stand to be a little more robust. Those are minor issues for me. They are worth the price and I would definitely buy them again.PS I am a loyal Picun customer. This is my 4th pair of Picun Headphones. The very first pair I got were the P60. The pair before I purchased these are the B27. And they are both still goinf strong. The B27 still hold their charge for 80+ hours and still sound great. The only reason I got another pair is that I have worn off all of the leather like coveringon the ear pads and the headband. So I just use them for home use, I don't want to use them in public LOL",
