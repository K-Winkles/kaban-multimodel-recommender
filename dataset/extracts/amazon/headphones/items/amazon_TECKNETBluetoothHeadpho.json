I wanted them cheap, wireless and over-the-ear to limit the noise from my power tools (it's getting that time of year I'll be running the blower for hours to clear out my yard).At any rate, as others have also said, these sound way better than they have a right to at this price point. Are they a pair of Grado equivalents? No, not even close. Would I rate them audiophile quality, or even semi-audiophile quality? NO WAY. But again, these were SIXTEEN DOLLARS.I am old enough to remember a time when cheap sound equipment was tinny and distorted. The overwhelming adjective I would use to describe the sound on these is \"muddy.\" They are NOT tinny or distorted, and are missing a lot of brightness, but again, they sound way better than they have a right to for the price!",

They fit over my ears nicely (and I wear earrings) and don't move around while I am working out. The material is really nice and I haven't had any issues with the battery life yet. I also like that they charge with a USB-C charger, which I feel is a lot more common today vs the old android chargers.The ONLY thing I could complain about would be the volume. The music itself doesn't get very loud. It's probably a great idea to prevent ear injuries, but sometimes (especially if I'm listening to a slow song) I wish it could be louder (this is the only reason this product didn't get 5 stars from me).",

The battery lasts a long time, I charge them probably every 3 days if I'm using them regularly.",

I will be getting a few more for gifts and my wife needs one, she is always taking mine. comes with a patch cable so you can use on stuff that is not Bluetooth. Over all i am very happy with them .

It has been windy this week with Ciara and Dennis but I am still able to be heard in the wind. They isolate noise well, so the caller is as clear as if I were in a quiet office on a landline.They look like a nice pair of cans and have no \u201cBritney mic\u201d. I look decidedly odd walking down the road wearing them and talking to myself.Comfort:They are light and fit my head perfectly and without the lead, I can forget they are on.Music:They paired twice to my PC with a music (headphone) mode and a phone (headset) mode and both seem right for the purpose. The music mode gives great bass.Battery:I have not recharged them in the week I have had the headphones and they still have some juice.I would highly recommend these...",

                "reviewText": "I'm not one for the earbud / in ear type headphones, they usually annoy me by either falling out or causing pain after using them for a short while, so I was in the market for a not too expensive pair of wireless on the ear or over the ear headphones. I know of Tecknet as a trustworthy brand after buying several items in the past from them, but was surprised to see they also make headphones! The price was right and they looked the business so placed the order!Firstly I was pleasantly suprised at the perfectly formed small box these come in, headphones in the past always seem to come in a massive space wasting box. I guess the fact that these are foldable saves so much space and is partly why I bought them. Everything is included in the box, including instructions, charging cable and a handy plug in 3.5mm cable for when bluetooth is not an option!Pairing with my iPhone was easy, and although I'm mainly using these to listen to podcasts, listening to music on Spotify was pleasant. These are not the most bass driven of headphones, but sound is clear and precise, and easily as good as others costing triple the price. My son has apple earpods and my wife has Bose headphones, I think these are equally as good as the earpods, and although you can't really compare with the \u00a3200+ Bose headphones, for the price these are a bargain, especially for my needs.Spot on purchase, don't hesitate if thinking about purchasing!",

                "reviewText": "I got these with confidence as I have a few Tecknet items now, and they are always excellent. Not had a bad product from them.They arrived in a smaller box than I was expecting, but this is because they fold down twice- once on the headband, and again into themselves. Very impressive, and I love the compact nature of this- makes it easy to throw in a bag without using major space.Soundwise, they are excellent at passively reducing outside noise, so be aware you won't hear your environment. Great if you're somewhere noise, not so great if you're in bed next to your partner who ends up having to poke you to get your attention! Bass is nice without being overpowering, and honestly, everything sounds crisp.They are comfortable to wear for long periods too, not found them too hot or uncomfortable, although I don't wear glasses so your mileage may vary with those.Bluetooth connects nice and fast, and you have the backup of using a cable (supplied), should you run out of batteries or use it on a device that doesn't have BT.All in all, very happy for the price, and would definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I received these as a Christmas present and am pleased to say they are amazing. I have been using them for several hours since and for different uses including lifting weights at the gym, running and lounging around at home.Wireless: this feature works flawlessly. It was very easy to pair via Bluetooth: a long hold of the power button puts it into pairing mode when used for the first time. Thereafter, my phone automatically connects when I turn them on. I am pleased to say I've had no drops in connection in over 20 hours of use so far, which is impressive as I have used Bluetooth 5.0 devices in the past that lose connection! The wired feature works, I tried it just to see if it works but for me, wireless is the reason you should buy these as it is the ultimate freedom, specially at the gym with no chords faffing about.Comfort: They are very comfortable indeed, the pads around the ears are very soft and the headphones themselves are very light, meaning you don't even notice them when they are on your head after a while! They also fit very well in the sense that they do not move if you are running or something. I prefer to over ear design and these do not touch my ears when on them.Sound: the sound is great. I've used more expensive Bose wireless models before and honestly the sound is somewhat comparable, certainly has more depth and bass. They do not have active noise cancellation, but due to the good foam padding and overall fit, only a bit of outside residual noise can be heard, which is very impressive.I have only used the mic once and the feedback was that the microphone is clear and adequate. They are very easy to carry around too since they can lay flat and fold, see pictures. I can't comment on durability as I've only owned for a few days but I have no doubt they will last for a while :)Overall, I would highly recommend this reliable wireless headphone!",

They're also rather light without feeling cheap. They have a nice weight to them despite being plastic, the material seems really solid and I'm not worried they're going to break.- Noise cancellationThe closed design does a good job of cancelling outside noise (not great if you're crossing the road though).Cons:- Noise leakIf the volume is on full the music is heard quite clearly, but at about 75% it's not that bad and at that level, it is perfectly fine.- Cups fold outwardWhen you place the headphones on your neck the cups can only fold outwards which to me is rather bizarre.Overall:These are solid wireless headphones and with 40mm drivers, I'm really impressed with the sound quality and its design. The cons really aren't that serious in my opinion and I'm really pleased with my purchase.",
