Sometimes only one connects, but a quick reset in the case fixes it.Sound Quality: Impressive audio output for an earbud.Battery Life: Great, can use them all day without having to chargeMicrophone: Works really well during calls, offering clear communication.Customization: With an iPhone it allows you to customize the function of \"double tapping on the airpod\" allowing you to play next track, use siri, play/pause etc.Overall, they're a fantastic choice over other brands, providing excellent sound, reliable connection, and comfortable wear for daily use.",

My only issue was my first pair the left pod after like a few months was very low I could barely hear out of them so I was just left with the right pod. Then I lost that one so I had to have another pair. In my opinion these fit comfortably in your ear the battery life is great I went days without charging case. Very convenient sound is great they\u2019re just really good quality earpods. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use any of the other ones because I love these so much.",

                "reviewText": "Family of four, and I was the last to get some, figuring wired Apple earbuds were just fine since I don\u2019t use them nearly as much as the rest of the crew. Yes, I\u2019m glad I bit the bullet and bought some during Black Friday sales. I\u2019m a convert, I LoVe them. No more phone calls where I can\u2019t move around because I\u2019ve got wet or dirty hands and I\u2019m attached to my phone that\u2019s on the counter; I can listen to music and go room to room since they have a good range; and no more tangled wires getting stuck on a drawer knob and clotheslining me while I\u2019m working in the kitchen or laundry room.This is the sixth pair purchased by my family over a long period of time. One pair was lost; one of them had a sound failure of the left ear after about a year of constant daily use (my son listens to music while he\u2019s working or is chatting with friends, and I don\u2019t know how well he treated them) his second set has lasted him about 2 years so far. We are all very happy with the sound quality and they\u2019re easy to use and pair to a cell phone. I did look up a quick YouTube how-to but it was painless and simple. So far so good and I honestly wish now I hadn\u2019t waited so long!",
