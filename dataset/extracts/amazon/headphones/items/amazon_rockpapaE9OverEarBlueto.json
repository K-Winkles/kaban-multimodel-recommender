These Rockpapa E8 headphones are a great alternative, for a way cheaper price. The noise cancellation is pretty good from my experience, most noises are blocked out when using a regular volume. They are also pretty comfortable, but when used for hours on end they can cause irritation to the ears. Another thing I was impressed with was the battery life, I can use these throughout my day for multiple days without having to charge! One thing I can say is that when the battery is low, there will be a pretty annoying interruption around every 2 minutes stating; 'BATTERY LOW'. All in all, these headphones are comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and have great battery life, I'd definitely recommend! (I also love the cute rockpapa logo, it kinda looks like Bob Ross)",

I think that's the noise cancellation, though. But I highly recommend for the price and look.EDIT: another i have about these guys is how the plastic joints of the headphones can easily break if you're not careful enough when taking them off, But either way,its still a good pair of headphones.",

                "reviewText": "While I have been very loyal to the RockPapa brand, my most recent purchase did not seem to be up to the product standards I expected. When the product arrived it was neatly packaged and all parts were in the box. Upon first inspection I noticed that the ear cushion for the left ear had a deep indentation in it from being folded, and even after days of being unfolded the indention is still present. While I typically could overlook this defect I was thrown aback by the fact that (almost instantly) the headphones seemed to tightly squeeze my ears to the point of discomfort. I would recommend that these headphones only be used by those with a small head or really small ears.",

These headphones honestly feel very up to par with big name brands. From the included case, down to the sound of the headphones and their everyday functionality, these headphones are nearly perfect. They\u2019re light, loud, and have great bass on the right settings and volume. They sound amazing, and paired with their comfortable ear muffs, they have amazing noice cancellation. They are also great for travel, they fold small and the case makes them easy to carry around. In terms of aesthetics, they look especially good as someone who has struggled in the past finding an over ear headphone that doesn\u2019t bend and warp, they look great on my head! Would 1000% recommend to anyone consider.",
