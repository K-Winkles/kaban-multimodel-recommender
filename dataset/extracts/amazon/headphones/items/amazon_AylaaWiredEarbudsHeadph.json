They do not seal properly because of their shape, particularly if you have wider ears, there for you won't hear bass notes. However, they are good for small ears.Great for listening to a speech, podcasts, or video tutorials. Also for running they're OK since they are very light, you won't even feel you have them on. The length of the cable is a bit short and tends to tangle because of the material. The control and mic work just as specified. Not the best but affordable. \"",
