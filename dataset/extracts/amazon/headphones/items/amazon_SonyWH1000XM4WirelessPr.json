                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Better Than XM5",
                "reviewText": "**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!",
                "reviewText": "Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.",

                "reviewText": "Review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo est\u00e1s perdiendo.Ahora si para los que dudan de Dios:Hace 3 a\u00f1os adquir\u00ed los MDR-XB950N1, mejor conocidos como los Sony Extra Bass. Sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pas\u00e9 de unos Skullcandy Hesh 2 a los Extra Bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.Ahora, 3 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s decid\u00ed hacer un \"upgrade\", yo me dedico a la m\u00fasica, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis aud\u00edfonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. Encontr\u00e9 estos despu\u00e9s de hacer un par de b\u00fasquedas en internet, los compar\u00e9 con varias opciones y al final me decid\u00ed por comprarlos.En primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnolog\u00eda que traen estos aud\u00edfonos. Puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, as\u00ed es, a la forma de tu oreja, Sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida hab\u00eda visto algo as\u00ed.Desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por \u00e9l, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.La experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicaci\u00f3n que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas m\u00e1quinas. De adelanto estos aud\u00edfonos ya vienen con carga m\u00e1xima, o al menos as\u00ed fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. Son extremadamente c\u00f3modos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos aud\u00edfonos no te van a incomodar en ning\u00fan momento.No es que quiera advertir, sino m\u00e1s bien dar aviso de que por defecto los aud\u00edfonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido est\u00e1 un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar m\u00fasica como el Heavy Metal o m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los Extra Bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. Estos no, pero entiendo por qu\u00e9 lo hacen, ya que como mencion\u00e9, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicaci\u00f3n que tiene como mil opciones de configuraci\u00f3n y optimizaci\u00f3n de sonido, as\u00ed que prep\u00e1rate para estar ah\u00ed unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.Una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuraci\u00f3n 400: 1 1K: 3 2.5K: 7 6.3K: 8 16K: 5 Clear Bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar Heavy Metal y m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco m\u00e1s, pero como dije, esto es libre y Sony te prev\u00e9 todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.Ya con todo listo, toca escuchar m\u00fasica, y ah\u00ed es cuando te da el golpe. Sab\u00eda que habr\u00eda una diferencia entre los Extra Bass que tengo y los M4 que son estos, pero no sab\u00eda que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. Estos no son aud\u00edfonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, adem\u00e1s, Sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio Sony Audio 3D, yo escog\u00ed Tidal, pero tambi\u00e9n puedes escoger otros 3 m\u00e1s, ah\u00ed aparece la opci\u00f3n.De verdad que escuchar m\u00fasica en formato de alta calidad como es el FLAC que te ofrece Tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive despu\u00e9s de varios a\u00f1os escuchando lo mismo, logr\u00e9 notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sab\u00eda que exist\u00edan en la canci\u00f3n, ah\u00ed es cuando te vas para atr\u00e1s, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. Tambi\u00e9n recomiendo el formato \"Loss-less\" de Apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iPhone o solo para que tengan una tercera opci\u00f3n. Sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye incre\u00edble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresi\u00f3n esto se vuelve m\u00edstico.Claro que esto no es tan plano como unos aud\u00edfonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.En conclusi\u00f3n, estos aud\u00edfonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnol\u00f3gica muy innovadora, adem\u00e1s vienen con su porta audi\u00f3fonos y cables correspondientes, son muy c\u00f3modos y portables. Los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.",

                "reviewTitle": "Amazing Noise Cancellation & Great out of the box sound.",
                "reviewText": "Sound Quality (5/5)These are the first headphones I've owned that when first listening to them I didn't immediately flinch and look for the nearest EQ. I'm no sound engineer, but definitely it has great bass and great quality for mids & highs.Noise cancelation (5/5)Although this is my first set of headphones that support this feature. I'm really blown away by it. I have an air purifier in my office, and even at medium setting. The fan is pretty noisy. But with these things on, I can barely hear it, and that's with no music/movie playing. But as soon as I turn on a movie or song, I seriously can't tell it's on.I read some people say they could hear a waterfall or something in the background. I can't hear anything other than silence, or what I'm listening to.Wireless/Wired (4/5)Being able to use the headphones with them powereoff with a wire, or have them connect wireless via bluetooth is an amazing feature. And it works really well!I was really surprised however that I don't seem to be able to use this headset with the bluetooth of my main PC. It has a really think glass panel, so I'm wondering if it's not because of that. If you own a case with a glass panel, maybe double check with another set of bluetooth headse/earbuds to see how the conenction goes.Audio Delay/lag on Bluetooth (5/5)I own a mini laptop and it only has bluetooth 4.1. But for some reason when I watch videos or movies, I'm virtually unable to tell whether there is lag. Unlike any other bluetooth earbuds I've owned. The delay is amazing. Obviously your mileage may vary, but it's something that drove me insane with my previous wireless earbuds. Don't have this problem here!Gestures (4/5)I wasn't really looking forward to the gestures pad. But it turns out to be working really well. Once in a while an action won't register. But it's really rare for me.Play/Pause on a PC can be a little weird though. One day I was listening to spotify while working, and then with the tab still opened I started watching youtube after work. And after pausing said video and unpausing it, using the headset. It ended up starting the playback of both my spotify tab, and my youtube tab.Comfort (4/5)First day I wore them I was a little concerned since, even though I have a small head. I felt like the headphones were pretty tight on my head. But after even just 2 days of use. It's already leagues better. Either I got used to it, or it's 'breaking in'.The cups are pretty comfortable. Wish they would be just a tad larger, not sure if I have big ears. But I can tell that part of my right ear touches the pad. And I'm wondering if I ever end up pulling a really long work, or gaming session if it'll end making my ear feel pinched. One of my older headsets did that.One thing that I was happily surprised was the weight of the headset. With such an impressive battery life and suite of features. I was expecting this thing to be rather heavy. Compared to a Corsair Void (probably a bad example) it's light as a feather.Pairing Headphones with 2 Devices (3/5)First thing, this feature is only possible via the headphone's native app. Meaning you can't perform this type of sync with the physical sync button. Once you have the devices regisered on the app, then you can enable a setting and select which 2 devices you want.On the topic of \"2 devices\", I guess Is should have read more on this feature. But I use 2 PCs at home, a media and a work/gaming PC. And I really would have liked to be able to on the fly, switch between audio of both. But it turns out that you can only connect to 1 phone, and something else. It can be 2 phones, but not 2 PCs.Included Accessories (3/5)The case it comes with is great. Hard-shell clam design, with some neat nook where you can shove the USB C charging cable, audio cable and airplane adapter thing. But as much as I like the quality and how it snuggly holds on to and protects the headphones. Not sure if mine is a fluike, but whoever decided to sew the elastic mesh bag on the 'bottom' part of the clam. Kind of silly.The audio cable is 'OK' if you use it for your phone. But if you want to use it for a PC you'll for sure either need an extension or a longer cable period. But at least it's a usesable lenght albeit a little conservative.But the USB type c charging cable. I hope you have a USB hub available. Depending on the case/setup you have. I'm pretty sure a lot of people wouldn't be able to use that cable to connect the headphones to their PC's back USB ports. Well you could do it, but depending on your case or setup. The headphones won't be able to rest on either the top of your case, or the desk/floor it's own. They'll end up dangling. (Which I think would be a bad idea.)",
