These will break easily in the process of young kids folding the headphones \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d About seven of them are broken in a matter of 2 months because the kids are breaking them when they bend them. Teach the kids how to handle them gently OR make it a class job and designate a few trustworthy students to collect them, fold them, and put them away.Update: They didn\u2019t make it to the end of the year. Like another person mentioned, there\u2019s a design flaw that causes them to break at the area that you fold them. All of them were broken this way.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Value pack of 10 comfortable headphones for under $100 is a great investment. Currently when I had ordered these, the price point was around $5 per headphone. My family works from home and goes to school from home and though we may have designated areas in our space to work from, we appreciated the headphones giving us a tuned in and focused listening. It helps to reduce the background sounds while giving the listener the ability to have fine crisp audio. They are comfortable for my family members from age 7 to adult. I like that these are foldable as well to place in my desk. I also appreciate that they are color coded so that the family members or if you have students will not get their headphones mixed up. We even suggested placing a vinyl sticker or using a sharpie to draw on the side of the headphone to identify their very own. These do not have a microphone capability this is for listening purposes only. I also use this for meditation purposes and to watch my shows by not interrupting the people beside me. I'm very pleased with the function, comfort, and price point. Great for remote work or listening to your favorite audio without disturbing others.",
