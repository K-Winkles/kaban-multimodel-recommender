It's comfortable to wear for longer periods of time because it's lightweight, the battery seems to last a very long time after its first charge and can walk a short distance from whatever it's Bluetooth connected to and still hear great quality sound. No one would know you bought this for an affordable price because it provides comfort and quality in comparison to other high ticketed pair of Bluetooth headphones. So far, so good, I even mentioned for my siblings to look into getting these in their desired colors. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using it just over a month now.Connectivity/Sound:~My main purpose in buying these was the multipoint connectivity. I need to quickly switch between my phone and computer, and these make it very convenient since it can connect to two devices at the same time. If you start playing media on one device and then start playing media on a second device, playback on device 1 will automatically pause while device 2 plays. My only gripe here is that if you turn the headphones off and back on, it only auto-connects to one device, and you need to manually connect to the 2nd device again. It would be nice if it could reconnect to both devices when powered on so I'm ready to go. Overall, I'm really happy with this feature.~The range is really good; I've walked out to my car forgetting that I have them on and it surprisingly remained connected. None of my other headsets reach that far.~I'm no audio engineer, but the sound quality is great. There is a function to change the equalizer settings if you want. As you press the button, robot voice says where in the cycle you are.~The set comes with an 18 inch charging cable and a 47 inch 3.5mm audio cable. Of course, you can use the audio cable while the headphones are powered off. There is no noticeable difference in the sound quality vs using Bluetooth.Battery:This is definitely the 2nd best part about these. It is charged out of the box, but I charged it ~10 min to get it to full. They last FOREVER. I started using them on 11/21 at 10:45am on a full charge and used it nearly all day, every day after. I didn't get a \"battery low\" warning until 11/28 at 2:39pm. That's some serious juice. On that note, the only con is that said \"battery low\" warning does NOT mean your battery is that low. I wanted to see just how long I'd have before it died. That dayum robot continued to warn me every 3 minutes (literally--I tracked it) until after 1am the next day when I just couldn't take it anymore and needed to go to bed. Almost 12 hrs of \"battery low\"....really? I suppose it's going off some percentage of battery remaining, but it should have been set to a much more reasonable threshold, like 1-2 hours remaining (considering the very long battery life, as most devices would shut off within like 20 min of the warning). Every time it said the warning, my microphone/audit would cut out as I couldn't hear people on video calls and they couldn't hear me. This is a long time to deal with that. Thank you for reading my rant.Fit:I wear them for several hours a day, sometimes 10+, and have no complaints about comfort. If you wear them while doing heavy physical activity, they do trap heat, just a heads up.Misc.:~It takes unusually long to power off, enough time to make me wonder if something is wrong. Not a problem, just seems unintuitive to have to hold the power button for like 6 seconds (seriously, count that out and see how awkward it is just to shut a device off). It powers on more quickly.~I'm grateful that there is no obnoxiously loud chiming with the controls. Quick beep or robot voice, nothing crazy.~Press +/- button once to go to next/prev track. Press & hold for volume up/down. If anyone was wondering.~I need a mute function for these conference calls where I walk away until I'm needed. Mfr dropped the ball on that one.Conclusion:For about ~$16 on sale, these are absolutely worth the purchase. I bought a backup for if/when these ultimately break down as anything cheap will do eventually (some other reviews confirm this). You will need to get a case separately. Until this starts giving me problems, I'd recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't expect much from this pair of headphones. They were more or less bought to serve two purposes. The first was to check mixes of music I write and record with a less than optimal playback, to see if the mixes translated to other systems outside my regular way of listening. The second was to be able to do so and not annoy the neighbors.Pros: They served both of those needs well. The different EQ options were really helpful, too. What I was really impressed with was the battery lifespan. I'll put them down, forget to turn them off, and come back days later to 60-80% charge. They also charge very quickly. When I have used them for extended periods of time, despite them having not died, they'll charge back up from 30% to 100% in about an hour.Cons: The construction does feel a bit cheap. In the few months I've used them, it hasn't been an issue. But, I don't travel with them. I could easily see the hinges snapping if thrown into a backpack, purse, or luggage without care. That said, at this price point, if I broke the first, I would buy another set.TL;DR: Sound quality is actually decent. Play with the EQ if it's not right at first. They're a bit fragile. But, worth the cost of replacement, if necessary.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to get a set of Bluetooth headphones to listen to the TV and not disturb others in the room. I had some earbuds but wanted something a little more soundproof and with better fidelity. These were very inexpensive so I took a gamble on them. I was pleased to see that they look to be well-made with controls that are easy to find and use. After charging them up and pairing them with my TV I have watched several movies and series on it with them. The sound quality is very good, and I have no complaints about the bass coming through nicely. When wearing them and listening to something I really don't hear the ambient noise from the room. I've worn them for several hours and didn't have any discomfort from the headband or ear cushions. The battery life has been good and I've only had to charge them once since I started using them. For what I got these for they have done a fine job and were worth the money.",
