                "reviewText": "I received no special consideration in exchange for this review, unless you want to call the stellar customer service a special benefit.Without question, this is the MOST comfortable and functional set of headphone/earbuds I've purchased.1. The extended battery life is due to battery storage in the neckband, which is attached to the earbuds with a generous length of cable. I haven't EVER run the battery out.2. Said cables are PLENTY long, so that there isn't a constant stress of tension, pulling on the earbuds.3. The neckband is lightweight and flexible; you may have to touch it to reassure yourself it's there. It cannot possibly pinch your neck or head, unless you are an elephant; GREAT for humans.4. I'd guess the entire apparatus was designed with comfort in mind. The earbuds are quite soft, and thus comfortable; I had no issue with inserting them.5. As the picture shows, the control pack is a part of the neckband designated 'R'. Since one of my adult children is a lefty, I tried reversing by putting on the unit upside down, and had ZERO problems.6. Where I did have problems: a. The charging plug on my first purchase became defective during the 30 day Amazon terms, and a second unit was shipped immediately at no cost. b. The sound on the second unit became distorted AFTER the 30 day Amazon trial. However, when I contacted the company, they drop-shipped a third unit with no hassle, and again, no cost.7. I was shocked by the speed and courtesy that they responded to my out-of-date inquiry. I had expected that I was just going to have to absorb the cost of the second unit, but that was not the case at all.8. The packaging is excellent, without excess material beyond that necessary for safe shipping. In addition to the unit itself, a nice, LARGE and durable-appearing velvet drawstring bag is included.9. I suffer from insomnia, and have found that listening to semi-boring podcasts helps me get to sleep. Previously purchased headsets have interfered with my sleep, due to hard material, or slippage. These function almost invisibly, and I can have Johnny Dollar or Sam Spade lull me to sleep each night.10. During the day, I can listen to music, audible books, or podcasts while doing other things.I would HAPPILY recommend this to friends and family.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for the price, and great customer service!",
                "reviewText": "These are honestly excellent for the price. The sound quality is quite good (to a layman, anyway), and the battery life is fantastic. They're also very comfortable for sleeping, even on your side, because the whole earpiece is made of soft silicone. Unfortunately the \"battery low\" warning is quite loud and startling, but I typically charge them once they reach about 40% to avoid that. Even using them all night every night, I only have to charge them every 3-4 nights. I use them to listen to ASMR, white noise, etc. and to block out my partner's snoring (which they do well, despite not being actively noise cancelling), and I am extremely happy with them.The only real problem I have with these earbuds is that they do not seem to last very long. Since they are intended for sleeping, I had concerns about the wires kinking during the night and getting damaged, especially around the connections to the neck band. I had been using the wired version of the Hearprotek sleeping earbuds for several years, and I loved them, but they only lasted about 8 months before one of the buds would die. Not a big deal since those only cost something like $15 for two pairs, but these are obviously a bit more costly and have more failure points in the design. I hoped that, since they were specifically advertised as \"extra tough,\" they would survive for at least as long as the wired version. Unfortunately, after about 4 months of nightly use, the right earbud died. I messaged the seller, and not only did they send me a free replacement, they actually seemed interested in fixing the issue I had! They asked me in detail about the problem, as if they intend to actually use that information to improve the design, which made me feel much better about buying new products from them in the future.Overall I'm very pleased with my experience with this brand, and I highly recommend checking these out if you're looking for affordable, comfortable wireless earbuds.",

I purchase these a year ago and I accidentally pulled a wire out. Purchased them again and they\u2019ve UPGRADED the ear buds. Better sound, more sturdy wires and more sturdy volume and on off switch. Now how many earbud manufacturers can you say do that?Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "The earbuds are truly tiny, there's absolutely no issue wearing these while sleeping on my side for an entire night, so these earbuds hit that target 100%.Compared to high-end earbuds, these earbud's sound quality is medium, but as good or better than many 20$-30$ wired earbuds I've tried.Battery life is out of this world. I recharge them every morning and I've never gotten a single low-battery warning, so these easily last an entire night's sleep plus more.I did have some issues with the USB port. This is my second purchase of this headset, my first one broke on me about 1 1/2 months after purchase, the internal USB connector splintered internally so I couldn't plug and recharge it anymore. The seller didn't want to honour the warranty because he/she felt it was due to abuse (it wasn't), but in the same response the seller also offered a very strong rebate so I could buy another pair pretty cheaply, which I did. This new pair is lasting well, so I'm writing off the first failure to manufacturing defect. I would have much preferred the seller to honour the warranty, but for the price, it wasn't a bad proposition, and I'm happy to have a great headset I can wear while sleeping, whatever my position.",

Use for about 3 months and then the right side stops working altogether. So now I can only hear music and audiobooks on one side if it is perfectly positioned (not easy during sleep). I tried emailing the manufacturer for support but have receive no response.First time this happened, I thought it was just bad luck with a bad pair but when this happened for a second time, I can confirm it\u2019s a quality issue. If you read the other reviews, this is a common problem. I do not recommend.",
