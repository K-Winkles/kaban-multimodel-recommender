                "reviewText": "I bought like 3 of them lol. They're just so good and the price is not too bad. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is nice. The only thing is that the touch buttons could be a bit tricky because it doesn't take much to accidently touch it. There's a slight delay after touching the button, but maybe that's just a problem with my phone or simply because its Bluetooth. They fit nicely and don't come out easily, I guess running with them would be no problem. I don't use them too much outside since the noise cancellation is too much for me, but I think some people would enjoy that. These have lasted me a very long time, (like I said I bought 3, gave 2 away) I've had mine for a year, and in that long time I have never regretted getting them. As for battery life, they definitely last 5-6 hours and maybe more I just haven't tested that. Charging time for the case, for full battery, I would say around 2 hours, which isn't bad. For the people who like to sleep with them on, I wouldn't recommend. It was very uncomfortable when sleeping on my side as the bud would push into my ear. I wonder how long they will last because they have not deteriorated in anyway since the day I bought them. I would 100% recommend, especially when on sale.",

The fit my ears well and are so comfortable that I can sleep with them in, I like to fall asleep to music or programs. Alot of times I wake up and forget their still in till I reach for them. They have a long battery life, I can listen all night and they still have power. They take the same plug as my phone so I charge them during the day and with my long cord charge my phone at night. The case also acts as a charger so if your out you can put them in and charge them for awhile. Comes in several colors. I picked the same color as my fit bit.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these back in 2020 and the right ear bud just went out. For the price these work pretty great!The sound quality was good, fit well, had a good recharge time, played for a good amount of time, and lasted for years. Now, I'm not a headphone/earphone buff when it comes to sound, so take that with a grain of salt.I mainly used these at work at my office job or while cleaning around the house. I did not try to work out with these so I'm not sure how good for that they are.The only two things keeping these from being 5 star are the tap registration and the quality of the microphone.The tap registration can be really finicky. You pause and unpause by double tapping. There were many times where I would have to sit there and try multiple different tempos and strength of double taps to try to get it to register. Ironically, it would be super sensitive to touch when taking it out of your ear. I've accidentally hung up on so many people while taking these out or putting them in. Took me years to get the technic right.As for the microphone? Do not buy these if you are looking for something to use while on the phone. You can technically take a phone call on these, but litterelly everyone I've talked to while using these tells me they can't hear me very well or I'm super muffled. They've been like that since day one, so I know it's not just wear and tear.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent true wireless earbuds you get for the price",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using Apple\u2019s Airpods for the past 2 years until they recently broke and ever since then, I\u2019ve been on the search for a less expensive wireless earbud alternative. I decided to give these earbuds a try since the price was on point and there was a sale going on. I\u2019m glad I stumbled upon these earbuds and I\u2019ve outlined my thoughts below:[Fit]These earbuds are very comfortable and extremely secure. They come with an additional 2 set of soft, earbud tips which ensure a secure fit for everyone, however for me; they fit perfectly right out of the box. The earbuds created a nice seal which helped with the noise isolation so no outside noise interrupted my music. I also cycled and jogged with these earbuds and had no problems with them staying in.[Protection]The earbuds are supposedly waterproof, IPX6 rated, but I haven\u2019t had the courage to pour water on my earbuds. I do believe that they are waterproof since I sweat profusely when exercising and I haven\u2019t had any issues yet (been a month).[Size]The earbuds are small and compact. They are the size of a quarter (as seen in the posted image), pretty much the standard true wireless earbud size.[Sound Quality]Just wow! Honestly I can\u2019t tell the difference between these and my old Airpods. The sound is sharp, crispy and clear. The bass hits really deep and the highs are right on point.[Battery Life]As the product description states, the earbuds last roughly about 5-6 hours with a full charge and this is true. Whenever my earbuds are low on battery, I just stick them back into the portable charging case (which is amazing) and within 10-20 mins my earbuds last for another 2-3 hours. I love this quick charging feature since I\u2019m incredibly impatient and I need my music going on all the time.[Cost]At $29.99 ($19.99 with the promo), these are a no brainer. For what you get, I think they are a great bargain and compared to the AirPod at $200, they are definitely worth a look.[Verdict]I \u201cHIGHLY RECOMMEND\u201d these true wireless earbuds to anyone who\u2019s looking for a low cost alternative to the higher price point true wireless earbuds.",
