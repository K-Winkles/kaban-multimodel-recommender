                "reviewText": "These are a great product for the price. They work well and the sound quality is pretty good. I work at a concert venue, so I\u2019ve been developing an ear for good sound.They are competitive to my girlfriend\u2019s much more expensive wireless headphones. While one is not gunna get Bose quality sound, expecting it at this price point is just silly. These could have better bass and the \u201csurround sound\u201d is a little lacking, but I enjoy listening to audiobooks/dramas with them and can definitely notice a more theater like experience.If you youngsters need heavy bass for your hippity hoppity and that heavy drop on your electronic music, it will be average. Then again, one should just use regular speakers for that kind of bass heavy music.The battery life is good and the charging case is a good size for pocketing. I definitely like that It can hold multiple charges. Once the battery gets low, there is an audio message informing one of that. Just toss em into the charger on the first warning, as they will die very soon after and the repeated warning is annoying. Also one can see how much battery they have as an icon on ones phone (using IPhone SE gen 2).The headphones work as a pair or just in one ear. This is nice for being able to pay attention to my surroundings when I\u2019m in a busier area or at night. With both in, they do a pretty good job of blocking outside noise. That works well when I\u2019m wanting to tune out, but if one needs situational awareness it can be an issue.The touch sensitive \u201cbutton\u201d can be a little sensitive/finicky and I\u2019m still getting used to it. Will note that since it\u2019s spring here, there have been times when my hands have been wet or have gloves on, which may affect the experience. Even a light touch or brushing it by accident can pause your music.The microphone is good and my call quality has improved vs using my standard iPhone headphones. That\u2019s due to them being in the earbud, so they are closer to the head vs depending on what you\u2019re doing the wired headphones mic can be anywhere.Pro tip: make sure to put your earbud back into the case if you\u2019re gunna just use one. Easy to lose otherwise.The fit is snug, with different sized ear buds for customization. I like that there are a good amount of sizes and two styles.Overall:These Kurdene Wireless headphones are a quality product at a reasonable price. It can be easy to spend a lot on headphones, these compete with ones up to 50 bucks. As long as one has reasonable expectations, they will be more than happy with these.Since it\u2019s so easy to lose wireless headphones, I\u2019m not ready to spend a lot on Bose or other premium brands.For what one could get in stores around the same price, the quality of these are much better. Everything I\u2019ve seen for the price is significantly lower quality and one would need to spend closer to 35-50 to get a comparable product. These are made in China where costs are lower and therefore your money goes a little further. I do prefer to buy American made for high priced items, but when it comes to needing a solid entry level electronic item, one would be silly to not to get these. I spent a couple hours reading product reviews for wireless headphones, these were the best overall, especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "ive never used any other wireless earphones, so i cant really compare.these are pretty comfortable to wear, but if you scratch your ear you have to hold it in place or take it out first.there is a constant low hiss wether something is playing or not. once the volume is turned up you sort of forget about it until the media goes silent again.i like the touchpad style buttons.these arent marked right or left, instead the red ring is the right side, the blue ring is the left side. they come oriented in the small case, the case is marked right & left. this matters because the right side button turns up the volume & skips forward & left is vice versa.comes with spare silicon ear buds in different sizes, wish i could choose one size of spares because ill never use the giant or tiny buds.i really like that the case holds spare charge, but theres no way to tell the current status, youre just supposed to charge it every chance you get i guess.also no way to tell how much charge the earphones have left.i also like that the earphones are activated & ready to pair when theyre removed from the case, & deactivated when put back in the case.the bass effect is pretty good, they also get pretty loud as long as the source is a decent volume.im happy with them.edit: i had a problem with unsynced buds when pairing on pc, & it turns out that putting the buds in the charger doesnt reset the connection. in other words, they were still paired to my phone even after i turned my phones bluetooth off & had the buds charging. you need to tap both buds 4x quickly until the left but shows a purple led (just the red+blue led staying on together in the same hole). that will reset them. then you put them in the charger, then remove to pair to pc (or whatever else).",
