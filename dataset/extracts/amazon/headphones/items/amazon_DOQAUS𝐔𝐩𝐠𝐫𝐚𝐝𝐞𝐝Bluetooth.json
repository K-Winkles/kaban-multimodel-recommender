I only use them for about 5 hours daily, but they will do well on a road trip. I also like that when I wear them to exercise they don't fall off my head, as well as not making my temples hurt where my glasses rest. Overall the sound quality is good. I would give it a B+ rating not necessarily noise cancelling but can drown out a lot. For the price of these headphones they are definitely worth the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (3/08/2023) A couple of issues I've already discovered while I was waiting for this review to be published. I wanted to get these updates out ASAP.1. Although the earcup holes for these are bigger than the ones on some \"over ear\" headphones, they still smash the tops of my ears. Using my digital calipers, my ears are about 71 mm from top to bottom. The holes on these are barely 64 mm in the same direction. If you can't tell from the photos, the earcup holes are taller than they are wide (they're not round). If your ears are not smaller than 64mm from top to bottom, these will sit on your ears and not around them as advertised. If your ears are not smaller than about 46mm wide, these will sit on them rather than around them as advertised. I do not know if the dimensions are online anywhere but I just thought I'd put them here. The memory foam on the earcups is very soft but it still hurts if you wear glasses.Again, I don't think my ears are particularly large for an adult male. I'd say they're about average so I don't know why so many over ear earcups are not large enough for an average-sized adult male ear. It's not just a problem with these. It's a widespread problem with headphones and has been for many years. Seems many manufacturers don't even publish the dimensions of the earcups (or don't make it obvious if they do). Nothing more annoying than buying a set of headphones and putting them on and finding they don't fit. Now if you have relatively small ears, I imagine these would be extremely comfortable to wear.2. This isn't necessarily a big issue but I thought I'd mention it. The clamping force these exert is a bit on the tight side. It probably wouldn't matter too much if the earpads didn't smash my ears but since they do, I really feel the extra clamping force. And with the design of this headband, there's really nothing you can do about it. It's somewhat adjustable but it really doesn't reduce the clamping force much at all. And since it's all plastic, you can't really stretch it much without breaking it. It seems to get most of it's springiness from the shape of the plastic. Again, if you have small ears, this might not be much of an issue unless you have a pretty large head (since they wouldn't smash small ears much).3. The instruction sheet is relatively easy to understand (compared to some) but you can tell it's translated and it's a bit hard to understand in some places. However, the instruction sheet claims that your EQ selection will be saved so you don't have to change the EQ setting back to your liking every time you turn them on. I have not found this to be true. I found the \"Heavy Bass Mode\" to be the most appealing one but it seems to always revert to \"Equilibrium Mode\" every time I turn them off and back on. This isn't as much of an issue for me as the earcup size but it's a bit of a hassle.4. The sound quality (I find) still leaves a bit to be desired. I'm not nearly an audiophile but I find there's a certain harshness somewhere in there. I couldn't tell you what frequency it is but it seems especially noticeable on high vocals such as female vocals. You could probably EQ it out with an external equalizer but none of the internal EQ settings really does. I do find I kind of get used to it after I listen for a while so again, it might be something your ears will adjust to if you're not too picky. Overall, the sound quality is otherwise pretty decent and has very good volume.END Of FIRST UPDATESECOND UPDATE 3/13/2023 OK. I originally gave these a full five stars. And the reason for that was because I paid just a little over 20 dollars for a set of decent bluetooth headphones that sound pretty good and have most of the basic features someone might want in a set of bluetooth headphones. However, I am going to have to remove a star. But (and this is important) the removal of the star is because of an issue I am personally having with these and it might not apply to everyone who is considering these headphones. I have listed the dimensions of the inner ear holes (as measured by my digital calipers) elsewhere in this review (look for them). That is the reason I can't give these a full five stars. They are listed as over the ear headphones and they don't fit my average (for an adult male) ears. Over the ear means they swallow your ears. These sit partially on my ears. When I first got them, I didn't notice it right away. Because the foam pads are pretty soft, it takes a while for it to start to become uncomfortable (and later, painful). As I mentioned in my other update, they partially smash my ears and I don't like that.Anyway, enough about that. I've made my point. If I had smaller ears, these would still be a full five stars for me. If you have smaller ears than I do and your ears fit nicely inside the earcups, you'll probably love these for 20 bucks.The battery life - I have gone through one and a half cycles on the battery back and found that the specified battery life seems pretty close (I actually wouldn't be surprised if the battery lasts a little longer than claimed but it's almost impossible to test it accurately due to the huge number of hours involved). No complaints at all about the battery life. There is one other issue I'd like to address. Some of the reviews here mentioned the headphones being fragile and said they just broke. I'm not here to say they are wrong but I've had mine for over a week and have worn them pretty much all day every day. They do not seem extremely fragile to me. I certainly wouldn't throw them around but you wouldn't throw a pair of Bose headphones around either. Anyway, I think they should stand up to normal use if you are not rough with your electronics. They might not withstand being dropped or sat on. I'd hesitate to recommend them for kids but then again, the low price might make them perfect for kids and teens. I'd say the build quality is about the same as a similarly priced set of Jlab bluetooth headphones I've had for about a year and those didn't break.END OF SECOND UPDATEORIGINAL REVIEW -As the title of this review says, please keep in mind (while reading) that these are 20 dollar headphones (at least that's what they are as of this writing). I am giving them a high rating based on their price. If they were about 30 dollars more expensive than they are, they obviously would get a lower rating. As it is, my initial impressions of these (just got them today) is they're worth 20 dollars all day long every day. Especially if they last a couple of years. My top priority (other than not paying a fortune) was to get a set of bluetooth headphones with acceptable sound quality, good battery life. But the highest priority was comfort. Too many inexpensive headphones sit directly on the ears and I've spent too much of my life having my ears smashed flat against my head all day long because I bought cheap headphones without doing any digging to find comfortable ones. These actually are (on my ears) over the ear headphones. There's maybe a little touching on the tips of my ears but not bad. I wouldn't complain if the inner ear holes were just a tad larger though. And a little deeper. The cushions are very soft and they're obviously fake leather. Which is always a tradeoff. You know that stuff will start to fall apart after a couple of years and leave flakes all over you.I'm pleasantly surprised how good these are for budget headphones though. The sound quality leaves a little to be desired but again, I just got them today so I will probably get used to their \"sound signature\". I had the same reaction to the Jlab ones I bought a couple years ago and I got used to them quickly. My pros....1. Seem comfortable enough to me. I will definitely update if my opinion changes. And I will likely update even if my opinion doesn't change. Because I like to update my old reviews.2. They can be charged while they're in use. I'm not sure how uncommon this feature is but I have a set of bluetooth headphones that turn off when you start charging them. It's always nicer to be able to charge and listen than it is to take them off and wait for them to charge. I have a set that can charge and listen at the same time and I always appreciated that feature.3. Obviously, it's never a bad thing when you can use your headphones in wired mode if your device of choice happens to not be bluetooth capable or something (I realize that's pretty rare now but still).4. I haven't tested the battery life yet but they were charged to 80% when I got them so I assume that probably means they have a decent battery pack in them. Otherwise, self discharge would have had them much lower. That's always a good sign with any product that has a rechargeable battery pack. Anyway, if they do get 52 hours of playback between charges, I will be thrilled. My Jlab ones get 50+hours and I have gotten used to using them for days before charging. There's no substitute for long battery life with a product like this.5. Sound isolation is pretty decent. I can still hear things that are going on around me but I've had worse in this department.6. The buttons are actually pretty good in that they are laid out and shaped pretty logically so that once you know which ones do what, they are very easy to find. The Play/Pause button stands out far enough from the others to where you're not fumbling around looking for it every time you need to pause. And by extension of that, the + and - buttons are located on either side of the Play/Pause button so as soon as you find it, you know where they are. Some people complained the buttons are a bit too clicky but I like that.7. They seem to pair more easily than just about any other bluetooth audio devices I own. From time to time, most of my other headphones will refuse to pair and I have to fight with them to get them paired.. As soon as I turn these on, they connect. Again, impressive for the money.As I guess a bit of a bonus, I hardly ever use headphones for hands free calls but I tested the mic and it isn't nearly as bad as I expected. I do sometimes use it for Google searches so it's nice to know that it works reasonably well.Conclusion - You can spend a lot more and get worse headphones than these. Especially on the comfort end of things. They may or may not end up being very durable. I have my doubts on that but I'd honestly probably buy a pair of these every year if I had to",

Not too tight. Battery life said to be a whopping 90 hours. Much more than Bose. Only negative is common with Bluetooth headsets. Sometimes the sound will crackle a bit with loud complex sounds.

The fact that the sound of the game is not totally cancelled is something I actually like - as the game I'm usually playing has the best soundtrack ever.I hear people in the voice chat like if they were right next to me. I don't know how long they will last, but for this price I do not have very high hopes. Time will tell. I got cheap headphones for this exact job before and they amazed me by lasting over 3 years. These are much better quality.NOTE: it took about 3 hours for them to get fully charged. It also took about 4 minutes for the computer to actually see them when I activated the bluetooth app. But it did see them and I was able to do the sound setup I needed.EDIT: after using them for a while, they do have a bit issue. They are very tight. So tight that after using them for an hour my ears hurt. I mean, the cartilages hurt from having those earpieces pressed so tight against them. I have a very small head so I can only imagine how they feel on someone with a bigger head.",
