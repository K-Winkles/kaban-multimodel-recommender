                "reviewText": "Obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile. Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more. These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters, some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in. The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. (I've been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort.) If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up. These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor. They are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months. Considering their price, the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain. Overall, a good value as long as you don't demand or expect more than the product can deliver.Jerry",

                "reviewText": "I grew up using partial over the ear but this style is difficult to find these days. I use the headphones when exercising, during yard work, or fix-up projects around the house. I wear an extra large male hat size.My favorite is the Maxell SL-3, hp-200. I like the way they feel as they are the most comfortable of the group. The sound is well balanced throughout the frequency range. The over the ear component aligns with the middle of each earpiece so the angle feels good. One potential drawback is that the cord is a straight plug connector as opposed to the firm rubber right angle plugs that are more common. I remember having many of these straight connectors that eventually went bad at the connection.My second favorite is the Sonxtronic XDR-8000. These have ends that go into the ear. They are comfortable. These are lacking in the bass and low frequency range and require a higher volume setting to achieve the same sound as the padded Maxell and Panasonic headphones reviewed. The sound is a bit \u201ctinny\u201d. I am keeping these because while they don\u2019t sound the best, they don\u2019t have the foam pads and thus will hold up much better for those times when I am sweating heavily.My third favorite is the Panasonic RP=HT21. These headphones have the overall best sound and have a very full stereophonic sound. They have the best bass and low frequency sound. They have a very good 90 degree connector plug. The cord is a great length. The problem is that they are narrow and sized for a person with a smaller, narrower head than mine. Furthermore, the over the head portion attaches to the earpiece at its front section. This design causes the earpiece to flare away from the back of the ear and the sound suffers. If you hold the earpieces to your ears with your hands the sound improves significantly. In addition, this design results in a pinching effect that is very uncomfortable. If the headpiece connected to the mid point of the earpiece I believe the problems would be solved and this would jump to the #1 favorite position. At the price I am willing to keep them and see if they become more comfortable with time, but I am very doubtful.Totally unacceptable is the Sony MDR-A17G. Although they say Sony on the item, I doubt they are really made by Sony. The earpiece quality is terrible and had extra plastic that scratches the ear. The overall quality looks very cheap. The sound is terrible, with a very tinny sound and no bass. These will be returned",

                "reviewText": "2/13/2013 I use these headphones to listen to audiobooks. I use them continuously for 10 or more hours per day as while I work around the house. They are excellent quality for speaking sound range. For $6 I do not mind replacing them as needed. I buy 2 at a time so I have a back up when one ear goes dead . Fussing with wires will work to return sound but once they go out they stay unreliable. This is the 3rd time I have returned to this great value. Each set lasts me for about 2000 hours, so if you do not use them continuously like I do they may last quite a while.UPDATE 2/16/2013. Fast delivery! They have changed this product. It has a Better design. Same quality of sound. There is now only a single wire coming from one ear rather than having wires to both ears. Since this design will have less tangling issues I expect the lifespan will be longer. It is very unusual for a company to change a design and use the same model number but in this case I am sure glad they did!Update 10/16/2013 - As I am very hard on headphones I got 4 in Feb. Starting my final pair today. The new design is still fragile. I dropped my ipad while wearing them yesterday so the weight of the iPod dropping pulled on the cord, so I know exactly how I damaged it this time. Still, I am getting at least 1000 hours of use out of each set so at $6 each it is worth it to me because of quality and comfort. I am buying more today so I have a backup when I break the set I am starting to use today.Update 12/2014 Design changed back to having dual cords. Update 8/2015 this design is much more rugged - Current headset still going strong after 4 months.",

N\u00e3o tem como exigir alta performance de um fone que n\u00e3o tem um isolamento sonoro, feito os de plug ou tipo concha. Pra mim atendeu todas as expectativas e ainda me surpreendeu.",
