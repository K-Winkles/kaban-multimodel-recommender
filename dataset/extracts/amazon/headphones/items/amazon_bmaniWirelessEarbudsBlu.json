They synced to my galaxy 12 pro with hardly any effort. They do come charged so you can try them out right out the package. I have not tested the battery endurance longer than an hour in that time it went from 95% to 94% just using Spotify. So that's good they will definitely last through a 2 hour walk.Dislike \ud83d\udc4e there's a qr code to register them with the company for a lifetime warranty. I tried it but I was not able to. The code just takes you to company's homepage. I did reach out to them through their customer service, hope they reach out.Overall loving these headphones. My dog will be a happy camper, since longer walks will be in his near future due to these.Hope this helps.",

So all mine are on this kind of level. JLab earbuds i loved due to long battery life and abuse they took. Finally last pair gave out so tryed something new and these are it. I havnt had these long but immediate impression in sound is loud and really great, phone quality was great, battery life not sure yet, pairing with Samsung phone was instant just click on their link, also a lifetime warranty that took 2minutes to set up. For the $ just buy them n dont look back. I will say i laughed at reviews saying case is slippery, like how faqn slippery could it be ? Its slippery, they were right lol. But whatever. Inside shows l.e.d. display of power etc.",

                "reviewText": "These are great headphones for the price. I had a pair of AirPods that I used for years and they finally died and I didn't want to spend the money on new AirPods...so I bought these. I do a ton of Mtn Biking and trail running and I love them so far.Pros:-They pair immediatley on any bluetooth device. You don't need to do the whole \"press a button for 20 seconds\" thing to pair like other headphones.-They fit great. They come with 3 diff sizes of silicone ear buds. The default out of the box is installed with the medium buds and they fit great. Also, they are designed with an extension that wraps around the back of your ear which almost guarantees they will not fall out.-They are super light and the case is super light.-They charge fast and hold charge for a long time. I easily go over a week or so without having to charge.-The sound is great and the controls are simple and easy to use directly from either side.Cons: (Only 2 cons here but they both bother me which is why I am only giving 4 stars)-The charging case: As much as I love the lightweight and rapid charge...here is the problem: The shell of the case is SUPER slippery. Like \"trying to hold a rainbow trout\" slippery. I probably grab the case and it shoots out of my hands at least 5 times a day. I mean it when I say the case \"Shoots\" out of my grasp. They need to use some sort of silicone on the shell. As a result, I am looking for an aftermarket shell cover.-As much as I love the pairing...there is a downside: It automatically \"re\"-pairs to the last device you used with the headphones. If you want to use a different device next time, I find that I have to go into the previous device and \"unconnect\" the headphones in order to connect with new device. I use them overall with 5 devices- my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AppleTV and Firestick. It can get tedious...especially if you don't remember that last device you used. I know.... \"Champaign problems\" but still....Over all...I would 100% recommend these.",

Fazendo o inverso, guardando um fone, o outro n\u00e3o para de funcionar.- Som razo\u00e1vel pelo pre\u00e7o.Desvantagens:- Uso h\u00e1 uns 2 meses, e at\u00e9 hoje n\u00e3o entendi em qual idioma ele fala (avisando sobre o pareamento, ligando/desligando, etc), e n\u00e3o encontrei informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a possibilidade de configurar outra linguagem.- Esse \u00e9 o modelo T16. J\u00e1 tive um T17, e comparando os dois, o som do T17 \u00e9 muito melhor, principalmente nos graves.
