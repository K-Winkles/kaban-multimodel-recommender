                "reviewText": "These earphones are really great quality. In terms of sound, they last forever. Got these last summer I think and they\u2019ve all kept working. The reason why I took a star off is because the silicone tips seem to fall off very easily, and it\u2019s a pain to put them back on or the spares they come with. May be just me though because I have a disability that impairs my fine motor skills, and I clearly didn\u2019t put on one of the spares tightly enough because it just got stuck in my ear and I had to fish it out! Very scary! But other than that, I like these for a number of reasons: they came with multiple sets, they\u2019re comfortable, sound quality, and sound durability. So, I will be repurchasing and just try to be more careful with them to make sure silicone tips are secure.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. On Amazon, I evaluated a number of earbuds before deciding on them, and my decision proved to be correct. My requirements had to be met by the earbuds I chose. My earbuds are quite finicky. They needed outstanding sound quality and a clear mic function, but they also needed to be comfortable and dependable. I need them for daily calls and music listening, and they were previously just one brand that fit my requirements, and they were not inexpensive. Because I have cats and dogs, they destroy earbuds to a great extent. You can imagine how much money I have to spend on earplugs every year, which makes me feel ridiculous and powerless. It's excellent that I've found alternatives to ear plugs in the face of my dogs and cats battling against them. They match my needs, are inexpensive, and it doesn't matter if they are damaged. When I first looked at these headphones and saw the price, I turned them down. A 5-pack of headphones, separately packed, costs $12. This is far too low-cost. The price appears to be a headphone snare. I looked at other, more expensive headphones before deciding to give these a try. If I fail, I've only lost $12, so why not give them a shot? So I didn't have big expectations at first. When I opened my gift and saw these headphones, all I saw was a nice box with each of the 5 headphones inside separately wrapped in a white bag. I utilized one of them, and it worked out quite well. They were as comfortable to use as the pricey headphones I had previously purchased and had excellent sound quality. Most low-cost headphones aren't very good, as you may know. The manufacturer, on the other hand, did, which delighted and astonished me. I stuffed the other four headphones into a box and hid them until I needed them. I purchased good headphones for a good price, and they're definitely worth it, at least for the time being! So, what are you waiting for? Give them a shot.",

Y'know those edits of \"x song but you're outside the club\"? They sound like that - like someone's blasting the song from the other side of a wall. I'll keep them as backups, I suppose, since through-the-wall audio is better than no audio, but you'd be better off buying a set or two of $10 a piece earbuds.",

Not sure how well this bodes for the other 4 pairs...Update: shared the 5 earbuds amongst my family. Within a few weeks most were not working in some manor.Cheap crap.... Better to just buy something at the dollar store for the same cost per headphone.",
