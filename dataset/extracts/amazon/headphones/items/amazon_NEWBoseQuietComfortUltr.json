                "reviewText": "These are simply the best Bose headphones I have ever heard. Usually Bose has made headphones that are lacking in Bass and while that works for a lot of people, it never worked for me. Im happy to report that these headphones have really nice punchy bass and an EQ in the Bose Music App that you can tune these headphones to your exact liking.The app is good and all works well.- The Multi-Point connection takes a little time to understand how it works. You can have up to 2 devices connected at the same time, but you have to stop the audio on the first device before you can start the second device. Once you learn that it works great. *Within the \"Sources\" section of the Bose Music App you can mage all connected devices and I believe you can store up to 8 devices here. Each device will have an On/Off slider that you can choose to have active at the same time as your phone or main device.I like this because I have both of my TV's, My iMac, iPad and phone saved here and can choose which devices I want to listen to by turning on or off that specific slider.- The sound quality of these headphones is honestly what I have been looking for, for sometime.I listen to Dance and EDM a lot and these headphones sound amazing. Plenty of Bass that is clear and punchy. You can fine tune everything within the EQ section of the Bose Music App. This is something that I honestly love about using these headphones. ALL HEADPHONES should have an adjustable EQ that stays with the headphones not just in an app.- The battery life has also been very good no complaints here.- The weight of these headphones is simply awesome for carrying around in my backpack and wearing them. It's almost like you're not wearing anything at all! Very comfortable and lightweight. I use them on the train everyday and I am very happy.- The case is also amazing. The headphones fold down and pack very nicely into this really nicely constructed case. It's also one of my favorite things about these headphones. Having a nice custom case from the manufacturer is where it's at. Aftermarket cases for most things tend to not have perfect fitment or build quality and can be bulky.There\u2019s more but honestly I think I covered the most import things and I def recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "These headphones are the best I have ever owned. They have the most effective noise cancellation of any over-ear models I have tried, and they also have amazing sound quality. The immersive audio mode creates a realistic and spacious soundstage that makes me feel like I\u2019m in a live concert. The headphones are also very comfortable and lightweight, and they have a long battery life. They support the AptX Adaptive codec for high-quality streaming on compatible devices, and they also work as a Bluetooth speaker. The design is sleek and elegant, and the materials are premium and durable.I gave them 5 stars because they are worth every penny. They are easy to use and work flawlessly. They are the perfect headphones for anyone who wants to enjoy music and shows without any distractions. They are a huge upgrade over previous models and a strong competitor in the market. I would recommend them to anyone who loves sound and noise cancellation. \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying, I am an audiophile and I am constantly trying new headphones and new audio technology. In my opinion, Bose still stands far above the competetion in most catagories. The crisp sound, unmatched comfort, and superior noise cancelling set these QuietComfort Ultra headphones apart from everything I have used. I travel a lot for work and I am constantly grabbing this headset for the airport, loud flights, and just leisure music listening.Design:As you take the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones out of the case you will immediately note that it has the same sleek curves and overall clean appearance of a Bose product. The case fits the headphones perfectly with enough room for small accessories like a charging and auxiliary chord.Comfort:These are easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever used. The ear cushions are made of the distinct Bose memory foam and they are fully adjustable to any head size. I wore them on a 8-hour long-haul flight and my head didnt hurt or have suction/red marks from overuse. I was incredibly impressed.Intuitiveness:The controls and simplicity of the button layout is something that I really started to like. The volume is a simple swipe up or down on the side of the headset and the multi-function button is intuitive and does exactly what you would expect. I found that using the app for things like connecting bluetooth and adjusting sound modes worked better than pressing buttons on the headphones themselves.Battery Life:My only small complaint is that using Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) and playing louder music, the battery tends to drain somewhat faster than I expected. After a full charge I find that the headset will drop to 60-70% fairly fast. That being said, the battery has never run out on me, not even once.Noise Cancelling:This headset is far and away the best noise cancelling I have ever experienced with headphones, and I have tried all the major brands. I would say the ANC is slightly better than previous generation Bose headsets. Also, I did not notice fatigure or ANC induced headaches, which is a huge plus. I feel like you can literally enter your own quiet world in a busy space like an airport or aircraft, and for me that is everything.Overall:This headset is the marquee of excellent sound quality, unmatched comfort, and the best noise cancelling on the market. The headset looks great on your head and sounds even better than it looks. Bose does it again.",

                "reviewText": "Permetto che \u00e8 la prima volta che mi affido a modo un paio di cuffie wireless serie quindi la recensione sar\u00e0 inevitabilmente influenzata dal fatto che non ho molti termini di paragone! Detto questo per\u00f2 posso dire che il suono di queste Bose \u00e8 veramente bellissimo: caldo dettagliato e piacevolissimo su tutta la gamma delle frequenze.l\u2019isolamento da rumore non comporta quella sensazione di ascolto o ovattato che spesso si verifica con altre cuffie soprattutto in ear. si connettono immediatamente al telefono indicando con un messaggio la percentuale di batteria rimasta che peraltro pu\u00f2 essere visualizzata anche attraverso l\u2019apposita app. La modalit\u00e0 di ascolto immersi dal mio punto di vista non aggiunge niente di particolarmente interessante rispetto al suono naturale cos\u00ec come esce dal dispositivo. Sui padiglioni sono presenti dei tasti che consentono di mettere in pausa, passare al brano successivo o tornare a quello precedente oltre che una zona in cui scorrendo il dito \u00e8 possibile alzare o abbassare il volume. Un tasto inoltre permette il passaggio da una modalit\u00e0 all\u2019altra di ascolto: \u00e8 infatti possibile scegliere un maggiore o minore grado di dal mio punto di vista restituisce un ascolto pi\u00f9 naturale perch\u00e9 evita la necessit\u00e0 di comprimere le cuffie sulle orecchie. Anche l\u2019archetto cos\u00ec come i padiglioni stessi \u00e8 imbottito di materiale che rende estremamente confortevole tenere le cuffie addosso anche per un tempo prolungato sebbene io non abbia fatto mai sessioni di oltre un\u2019ora. Se devo proprio proprio trovare un aspetto migliorabile lo riscontro nell\u2019applicazione soprattutto per quanto riguarda la parte relativa alle equalizzazione che avrebbe potuto essere un pochino pi\u00f9 curata e capace di modificare un numero maggiore di parametri. Molto valida anche la possibilit\u00e0 di poter ripiegare sul loro stesse le cuffie riducendo di almeno 50% lo spazio occupato dalle stesse.buona, gradevole e al tatto e funzionale in termini di protezione la custodia che oltre ad ospitare le cuffie consente anche di riporre i due cavi in dotazione (cavo di ricarica e jack da 3,5 mm). In conclusione devo dire che da quando ho queste cuffie ho aumentato molto l\u2019ascolto consapevole di un gran numero di album (motivo per cui ho fatto questo acquisto).se pensate di utilizzarle immobilit\u00e0 e non volete rinunciare ad una qualit\u00e0 audio importante penso che malgrado il prezzo possano fare al caso vostro! se questa recensione vi \u00e8 stata utile vi chiedo la cortesia di IndyCar cliccando sulla apposito tasto qui sotto sotto sotto! Grazie!",

                "reviewText": "Andere (kabelgebundene) Kopfh\u00f6rer, die ich besitze, sind von h\u00f6herer audiophiler Qualit\u00e4t in Preisklassen von 800 Euro und mehr.Ich habe auch einige Erfahrung mit kabellosen Kopfh\u00f6rern wie dem bekannten WH-1000XM4 und auch kabellosen TWS-Ohrh\u00f6rern mit ANC von sehr bekannten Marken.Ich war nie wirklich ein Fan der Marke Bose, aber ich hatte viel Gutes \u00fcber diese QuietcComfort Ultra gelesen und es gibt jetzt auch viele Erfahrungen auf Reddit.Die h\u00e4ufigste Beschwerde ist, dass dieser Ultra fast 100 Euro mehr kostet als die anderen Modelle.Gl\u00fccklicherweise konnte ich ein gutes Amazon Black Friday Angebot nutzen.Ist der h\u00f6here Verkaufspreis gerechtfertigt? Ich denke schon.Zun\u00e4chst einmal ist das ANC \u00fcberirdisch gut, so gut habe ich es nicht einmal bei XM4 und XM5 geh\u00f6rt.B\u00e4sse und hohe T\u00f6ne sind bereits standardm\u00e4\u00dfig gro\u00dfartig, und wenn es einem nicht gef\u00e4llt, kann man mit der mitgelieferten App den Klang nach eigenem Geschmack einstellen.Auch die immersive Audiofunktion ist einfach gro\u00dfartig, neben zahlreichen anderen Erfindungen.Ein \"Nachteil\" ist nach Meinung vieler, dass der verwendete Kunststoff ein \"Magnet\" f\u00fcr Ohrenschmalz und Fingerabdr\u00fccke ist. Ich habe dieses Problem f\u00fcr mich selbst reduziert, indem ich den Kopfb\u00fcgel mit 3M-Folie beklebt habe, wodurch auch ein einzigartiges Aussehen und Gef\u00fchl entsteht.Au\u00dferdem verleihen die hochwertigen Metallb\u00fcgel und -scharniere diesem Kopfh\u00f6rer gl\u00fccklicherweise ein hochwertiges Aussehen, und im Gegensatz zum WH-1000XM5 l\u00e4sst er sich in der mitgelieferten Tasche gut zusammenfalten. Positiv ist, dass die Ohrmuscheln nicht knarren oder quietschen wie bei der Konkurrenz in dieser Preisklasse.Die Akkulaufzeit ist aufgrund der Standby-Funktion etwas k\u00fcrzer, aber daf\u00fcr bietet er den Luxus der automatischen Wiedergabe in Kombination mit der Ohrerkennung.Wenn man sich erst einmal daran gew\u00f6hnt hat, versteht man, warum alles so konstruiert ist und f\u00e4ngt an, sich damit anzufreunden. Gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig ist auch der Touch-Control-Lautst\u00e4rkeregler - entweder man mag es oder man mag es nicht. Ich finde, es ist eine nat\u00fcrliche Steuerung und sie funktioniert sehr gut.Alles in allem kann ich sagen, dass ich mit diesen Kopfh\u00f6rern sehr zufrieden bin.",
