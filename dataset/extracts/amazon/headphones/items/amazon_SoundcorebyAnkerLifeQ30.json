                "reviewText": "I got these on sale but I honestly think they\u2019re worth their full-price as well. I was in the market for a pair of over-ear headphones <$100 and specifically wanted light pink ones, which limited my options, but when I found these, I was pretty much instantly sold\u2014 and I\u2019m so glad I went for it bc they\u2019re perfect!As a disclaimer\u2014 I\u2019m not a sound engineer or expert by any means, and I\u2019ve never had over-ear or noise-cancelling headphones before, so my opinion on those aspects may be irrelevant but I do think these headphones sound great overall.I love that you have the option to use them wirelessly or with the AUX cable. Either way, the sound comes out crisp + clear. The Bluetooth connection is seamless + effortless; so far, I\u2019ve only used these with my iPhone 13 and my Nintendo Switch lite, but both always connect quickly + without issue.There are 3 sound modes: noise-cancelling, normal, and transparency. I love that you can quickly switch between them via a button on the side. Transparency is great for being in public / when I want to still be aware of my surroundings, or when I\u2019m at home but still want to hear what my partner is saying. Again, this is my first time using noise-cancelling headphones, so that was an odd feature for me to get used to, but it definitely works! I compared the sound options by listening to the city traffic outside my window\u2014 it was unreal how the noise-cancelling mode seemed to mute everything.They\u2019re the exact light, pale shade of pink I wanted\u2014 exactly like in the photos! They fit very comfortably as well. I have a big head + average-sized ears\u2014 these fit me perfectly + the ear pieces fully cover my ears. They\u2019re not bulky or heavy or anything either; I haven\u2019t had any discomfort in general, nor when leaning my head against a pillow in various positions, which is a huge plus. The design is sleek + stylish, but still pretty minimal. I think they\u2019re really cute.The carrying case is also cute + seems secure. I kept the foam insert to divide the ear pieces from one another when storing. As shown in my photos, my case has a few minor dents from being thrown around in my bag; it would\u2019ve been cool if it\u2019d been made of a sturdier external material that doesn\u2019t show surface nicks as easily, but it\u2019s not a big deal. Purely cosmetic, so far.Overall, I really love these headphones + have been obsessed with using them! They\u2019re so comfortable (I\u2019ve even admittedly fallen asleep with them!), sound great, are adorable, and are super easy to use!I definitely highly recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "Long story short, sound is great with added bonus of being tunable to any preference via EQ App, battery life is top notch, ANC is great for the price range.Build quality is all plastic but the good kind and should last a while if you treat it right but the biggest gripe is the latest update for the EQ App which disabled the ability to use EQ settings while using an AUX cable defaulting the sound to muddy undefined mess would recommend to use these exclusively as wireless headphones.Here's a breakdown of my cons, pros and thoughts.Pros-Price & Sound:Looked over and tested them out against my XM4s and if you're on a budget the Q30s, with a bit of tweaking, can often sound BETTER than those more expensive all thanks to the flexibility of the EQ customisation which I absolutely recommend anyone who plans to nab these cans to do.Battery life:The battery life of the Q30s trumps just about every pair of wireless cans I have in my possession.I've tested these cans for 2 weeks with both ANC on and off both at full charge and clocked in:ANC ON: 38-42 HoursANC OFF: 58-61 HoursANC:Works great, not the best mind you considering its price range but punches well above it's weight perfect for flights or blocking annoying people. Has 3 different modes too that you can toggle through but I never notice the difference between 2 of them being outdoors and indoors. Transparency is pretty average but does it's job.EQ App:The App is extremely easy to use and enables some really nice flexibility to enhance your listening experience and pushes these headphones far beyond what its price point shows, there are 20+ presets to choose from depending on genre but for me and alot of people, Piano sounds the clearest and from there you can tweak the preset and save it in one of many spare slots on top of this, whichever preset you used last it will save unto the headphones so even without your phone or app, the moment you connect with a device via Bluetooth, the Q30s will play audio with the custom preset.Neutral-Build:All plastic with a metal headband, not bad, but not great either.The plastic is thick and sturdy not the cheap creaky type so thats pretty good, ears fold in nicely and the fit is nice and snug good for medium and small sized head.Comfort:Pretty comfy plenty of space for ears in the cups you wont feel much pushing in due to the way the internals are actually tilted a bit, though, clamp force is kinda weak and they can slip off easy.Cons-EQ App:Strange how this is also a con, well, eveything works well WIRELESSLY until you connect using an AUX cable, you lose all access to the app and your presets and the headphones default to a muffled mess, it's not exactly terrible but the drop down going from sounding like 300 buckaroos to hot farts isnt exactly desirable, all this because of an intentional update from the company itself.Wired mode:Doesn't suck as bad as people make it out to be BUT when comparing wireless mode to Aux mode...?Yeah its a big drop, but you'll get use to it, until you jump back to wireless mode.Summary:Great headphones, seriously, the only real downside is the company's stupid decision to purposefully disable a feature a lot of people loved.Otherwise the Q30s are a strong pair of budget BT ANC headphones priced real nicely, buying these will gurantee satisfaction for a majority of listeners.",

                "reviewTitle": "Great Headphones and I love the Noise Cancellation!",
                "reviewText": "Well, I must say that finding the right pair of headphones these days is no easy task! There are dozens and dozens to choose from and the prices range from $30 to $500 and frankly, just because they're expensive, it doesn't mean they're fantastic headphones! I had 2 sets of Skull Candy over the ear headphones that were about $90 and both sets had problem with the Left speaker dying after about a year. I then decided to order something higher up the price scale and ordered a pair of Bose AE2 Soundlink over the ear headphones ($269). I do a ton of video editing and I need a quality set that provides accurate audio, noise cancelling is also a benefit. When I received the Bose headphones, I found the audio to be exceptionally flat sounding and had no depth to it. The headphones did not breath well and were very warm to wear. I was also disappointed to find out that they did not have any noise cancelling features, so I could still hear external sounds. In general, I would give them a 2 Star rating and were extremely disappointing, given that they were a Bose product and I always heard such high praise for it. I returned them and started my quest for headphones once again.I found the Soundcore by Anker Life Q30 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones (on sale for $89.99) and thought I would give them a try. These things are a massive improvement over the Bose and I love the noise cancelling they offer. Sound quality from the speakers is very solid and dynamic, not flat like the Bose. The headphones have a comfortable fit and are less warm to wear. They fold up nice and flat and have a hardshell case to store them in. I really like these headphones and hope they prove the test of time because they're great right out of the box. Additionally, the built in microphone works well for hands free calling on your cell phone and the call clarity is very good.If I were to have any negative comments, they would be pretty minor and would be relating to small details versus performance or quality. I think they could make the control buttons a little larger and more easily seen/read and less complicated. Also, headphone Manufacturers seem to be putting the L & R label inside the earpiece and in a dark room, it is pretty much impossible to see. Just paint it on the inside of the headband like they all used to do so we can see it without turning on a light.Battery life is decent, I would say I get approximately 20hrs of active wearing and another 10hrs of powered on and in standby mode. The good thing is, the battery charges up quite fast, so no major issues there.In general, I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for reasonably priced over the ear headphones that can be multi-purposed and the price is great!",
