Other than that, it sound clear and to get them in a multipack should last for my homeschool kiddos. Even if they do break, not to be upset. I spent $15 to $20 on headphones per kid that didn't last.

I tell my students to treat these expensive, cheap headphones kindly so they last a little longer.I'm satisfied with them and how much use my students get out of them. I do wish they were better quality but they are a pretty good price.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product because over the years of buying the wire earphones which broke and frayed all of the time, I thought a headset would not have this problem. However, I should have invested in a more expensive headset. This headset was not worth purchasing. The headset part is very hard and uncomfortable. The ear pods have very little padding (only foam). So they were uncomfortable also. The sound was low quality but acceptable, I only used for my small tablet. The lesson to myself will be to pay more to get a better product. You do get what you paid for, and in this case a cheaply made product.",

That\u2019s why I usually purchase cheaper ones, I am still on the very first set since I purchased them! ( over a month so far) the only downside of them are they are a bit big, even for my big head, I had to cut a piece of pool noodle to use as a spacer so they wouldn\u2019t keep falling off my grandson\u2019s head ( it works) Other than that, the sound is actually not bad at all,and they come in a wide variety of colours so everyone can pick their own colour, would definitely purchase again, but Iam guessing these will last the rest of MY LIFE!",
