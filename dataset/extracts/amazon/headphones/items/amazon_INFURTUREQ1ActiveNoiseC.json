                "reviewText": "I love these. So much. I can\u2019t believe they were as affordable as they are. Here\u2019s why I love these:1- Comfortable AF. Unmatched. I have to wear these all day for work and NEVER has the top of my head hurt after a long day and the earcups are like clouds. I wear glasses and these are the only pair that don\u2019t cause the arms to dig in and hurt me behind the ears. Seal is quite good too2- ANC is crazy good for over ear headphones. I had no idea how badly I needed these for things like going through airports, malls, etc. the ANC is enough that it quiets a significant amount of noise that it helps me feel less overwhelmed yet I\u2019m still able to hear people speaking at a regular volune (can\u2019t make out the words usually though) so I still feel I\u2019m aware enough of my surroundings that I\u2019m not unsafe3- Audio is good. I\u2019m not an expert but I have to listen to and transcribe dictations for work and our clients don\u2019t always have the best audio quality (a lot of the audio is pretty terrible tbh). these headphones were a game changer for me work wise. The noise cancellation really helped in this aspect too3- impressed with battery life. If you\u2019re not using mic these will go for days. I used to do video calls a lot tho and you\u2019ll get about 3h on battery if you\u2019re actively using the micBottom line: if you\u2019re on a budget but want quality headphones just buy these. Seriously. I\u2019m not often this impressed with products but these are truly so high quality and are at a very affordable price point. You won\u2019t regret it",

But for the price, they are adequate. I use them when working in the yard. The ANC is good enough to block the sound of the leaf blower, but not the riding lawnmower. Still, pretty good overall for the price.",

Hear the \"Power On\" announcement. See the Blue light flashing. Shortly after hear the \"Pairing\" announcement. No problems pairing with cellphone, device shows up as \"Q1\" with a headphone icon. After pairing is complete, volume can be adjusted with the headset buttons or with the audio source app (they track). The Blue light flashes once every several seconds.* Power Off *Push the Power button for ~3 seconds to power down. Hear the \"Power Off\" announcement.* Audio Jack Input *If the audio jack is connected the behavior is different. Plug in audio source and hear audio immediately. No need to push the Power button. If the Power button is pushed, hear the \"Power On\" announcement. But no lights come on. Pushing the button again repeats the announcement, never hear a \"Power Off\" announcement. The volume buttons have no effect, level can only be adjusted with the source. Noise cancel can be enabled with audio jack input: push the button and observe the green light. Noise cancel works well with audio jack input.* End of Review *",

                "reviewTitle": "Better battery life than more expensive headsets",
                "reviewText": "I have ordered what I consider to be expensive headsets and the only difference I can tell is the battery life on these is better plus I like that the ANC is separate and can be turned off and on regardless of whether you turn the audio portion on or not. I saw in some reviews that people were turning the ANC off thinking they had turned the headset off and they saw significant battery drain. The ANC off/on is at the front ( a little weird ) and the Audio is the bottom button at the back. You just press and listen for power on or power off.Build:They are light and comfortable and they don't creak at the clamps for the earpieces like some other more expensive ones did, and that made me send them back.I really like the design of the earpieces that totally envelope my ears and result in no pain, a big plus for me. The new chemical smell didn't take long to disappear either since they aren't packaged in a case.The only Negative is, that I'm not quite sure how long the swivel/fold joints will hold up so for this price I will tape them into a non-folding or swiveling position and use them like that.Sound:I consider these to be comparable to more expensive ones - I wouldn't use them for mixing music but for daily listening to music they are fine. Highs /mids/Lows are clear and well separated.ANC:I'd say these are comparable to again much more expensive brands I've bought here. There isn't anything that will completely take out all the lows or midrange in the lower price range. I find I have to have music playing very low to drown out the small amount of dog barking or lawnmowers it doesn't quite cover. This is very important for my sanity - I can't stand constant or loud internal/external noise.Volume:I don't like music blazingly loud so these are just fine. I see in the description they are for kids as well so hearing can be easily damaged at loud volume - these protect that.Pairing:Works easily with my iPhoneI saw these pop up in suggestions on sale and decided to take a chance on them since I hadn't found anything I liked in a price range I was willing to spend and these are quite a bit below that and IMO they are really good! I'm glad I did.",

                "reviewText": "I took a punt on this, based upon reviews, and wasn\u2019t too worried, as it was not an expensive buy. It does offer active noise cancellation, though, and that\u2019s what I was most interested in.I knew the headphones do look good, though, will fold well, are sturdy and sound good.All these points passed the test, straight out of the bat. I loved the depth of sound, which offers a great breadth of treble and bass, without hiss, pop, sputter, crackle or distortion.So I gave the ANC a test and it was weird - a slight pressure, almost as though I\u2019d lifted off at speed, in an airplane - but boy, it worked! Not entirely, but about whirring fan subsided to a faint hum. Voices were almost entirely indistinct (and my family can be loud, believe me).This pair of headphones are worth easily double, possibly treble, what they cost me. I have rarely been so impressed! And they look great! Soft padding, over the head and over both ears - which were entirely covered by the good-sized oval-shaped cups (another deliberate reason for my purchase) - nice, easy-to-use, well-placed controls, and a lot more solid than I expected, considering how light they are.I could not recommend these more. For the price, they are insanely undervalued, and an easy no-brainer.If you are looking for a good pair of headphones - no make that a great pair of budget headphones - which have genuine and affective (not perfect, but very good, nonetheless) Active Noise Cancellation AND have great sound across the board AND outrageously good battery life, these are the ones for you.I\u2019m going to be buying another pair for my son, next time he breaks the flimsy expensive and just as effective set of headphones I bought for him, last time (and they cost FIVE times as much as these!).One of my best Amazon buys in a long, long time.",
