                "reviewText": "Before I purchased these JVC HAS160A headphones, I had looked at an compared a large number of \"cheap\" headphones. These seemed like the best value hands down. I had considered price, lightness, comfort, looks, compactness, and apparent durability. And I was looking for fairly accurate sound quality and the ability keep my sounds to myself during audio/video computer labs at school.In actual use the phones exceeded my expectations - in all areas. Something I hadn't anticipated was their helpfulness in reducing the level of distracting ambient sounds. The ear pads are not so huge as to cover the ears entirely and their unobtrusive shape allowed them to be positioned comfortably either on or slightly off of the ear. That way I found that I could quickly and easily adjust how much outside sound to let in. I'd owned other cheap headphone units and they all broke fairly quickly under my ownership. Surprisingly, these JVCs were sturdy enough to last well over a year through a ritual of daily abuse (being crammed into and taken out of my heavily loaded backpack; with no protection for the phones whatsoever). The speakers swivel sideways to become somewhat compact so they've always acted like \"compliant citizens\" while in the pack. The point of failure was one of the black plastic pieces that rise above each speaker enclosures. That piece's function is to handle head-size adjustment by accommodating a sliding metal band into the top end, and also to hold a swivel on the bottom end where it meets the speaker enclosure. The piece is lightweight but sturdy plastic of some sort; but it eventually cracked under my abuse, the detented adjustment mechanism inside quit keeping the metal band in place. And eventually the plastic piece failed entirely & broke off completely. It would have needed some duct-tape/epoxy magic to keep it in service.As a recently graduated student of audio/video production, I do not anticipate these as being accurate & precise enough for the professional reference applications that I'll be growing into as a professional (like mixing music and video post-production); but I think they might make a serviceable backup. And for me, a lifetime music lover and recent student of audio/video production, they've done the job admirably. I've never found any aspect of the units sound to be an issue when listening to sound effects and/or music of all styles. I hear a consistently clear and balanced sound that seems to cover the entire range of human hearing. And from some of the better classical recordings, I even think I can hear subtle 3D placement of instruments within the sound stage. I also hear nice clear stereo separation and time-based effects on modern pop and rock recordings. And when used with either Mac or PC at higher volumes, I've never heard any evidence of these gems being over driven - my ear drums have always complained before ever getting that far...The JVC HAS160A Flat Headphones have found a place on my \"practical lifestyle list\" - for the price there's no reason not to always have a pair or two around. So I just purchased 2 more sets...",

                "reviewText": "Listening to music has always been a very satisfying source of entertainment throughout my entire life. I like listening to it through my BOSE speakers but I preferred using headphones because I could escape the outside world for awhile and just \"float away\" on the music. All that changed a few years ago when I developed a health condition called trigeminal neuralgia which is characterized by sudden severe bouts of facial pain. This pain can be triggered by even the slightest thing such as chewing or brushing your teeth. In my case, even a breeze moving across my face could bring on pain that could knock me to my knees. Fortunately, with doctor's guidance and medication, the condition went into remission. At this time, I do not have the daily pain but have developed a hypersensitivity to anything touching my left ear and jaw. I could no longer tolerate my favorite headphones. I have a small head so I thought it wouldn't be too much of a challenge to find a pair wide enough that they would not bother me. Well, you name it, I tried it. I tried all different types and all different price points. I even tried brands and types that were touted for their comfort. They all felt so tight and uncomfortable. I eventually came across these and I figured that these JVC over ear headphones were inexpensive enough for me to stretch/bend them to reduce the pressure on my ear and jaw but still keep them from falling off my head. If I broke them, well, that would be on me. I am so glad I ordered them! I was able to gently stretch/bend them so that within a few minutes I was able to find a comfortable width. Their light weight also made them more comfortable. To be honest, by this point I had put comfort way above sound quality on my list of priorities so I wasn't expecting great sound but was I wrong. These little gems sound great to me! Granted they are not going to sound like a $250 pair of headphones but are very impressive for their price. I've purchased an additional pair to put aside if for some reason I break or lose the first pair.",

                "reviewText": "Likes: low price, choice of colors, lightweight, clean clear sound, nice indents on the headband so you know what side is which without looking, a nice click when adjusting size, easy to pack in a bag.Dislikes: lacking somewhat in bass even with a headphone amp, can become uncomfortable after a few hours of use, no right angle 3.5mm jack(nice to have if you use a tablet, and a bluetooth keyboard with a tablet slot), no inline mic, not the most robust build.These are a decent option if you need a low cost, lightweight set of on ear no frills headphones for medium to small ear sizes(not for kids as they are not volume limited), but do know they have no inline mic.Also the build quality, comfort, and overall sound quality(a bit lacking in bass due to the smaller drivers) is not as good as compared to a pair of SONY MDR-ZX110( i own them with, and without mics), which are about at the same price point, and are only a bit more for the version with an inline mic.Lastly when it comes to JVC wired headphones, and earbuds, I'd say go for the Gumy Plus earbuds over these with an inline mic(I own several pairs with, and without the mic), and mod them with memory foam aka comply foam eartips for a tighter seal to block out more nose, and better sound quality while being more comfortable than the stock silicone tips.",
