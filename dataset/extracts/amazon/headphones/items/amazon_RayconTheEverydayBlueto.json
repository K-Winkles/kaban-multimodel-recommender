                "reviewText": "Outstanding value and they look sleek, not poking out ostentatiously. These don\u2019t hurt my ears like the AirPods Pro after a long wear time. The only thing the APP has over this is the full noise cancellation mode which can cancel out a power washer, these still muffle outside noise well enough (I\u2019m just using foam for anything needing ear protection for now until I get some money for the nicer raycon offerings) that they are noise canceling for me.These connected super fast, very easily, their sound comes across great. The different modes offer a nice little EQ switch if one of the few songs I want bass boosted comes on the shuffle.Switching between devices is much, much easier than the pods. It is such a hassle with my Apple airpods pro to get them connected to my phone if I am anywhere near my laptop. It\u2019s easier to walk outside and try to open and close the case than trying to do it via any menu or in-built options.With these Raycons I can literally just go to the thing I want them connected to, click the little \u201cconnect\u201d button and about 2 seconds later I have that thing connected to my earbuds without having to put them in the case and fumble with all of that.Connecting them to my TV has given me so much more freedom because I\u2019m a night owl and now I can leave off the subtitles to focus on whatever thing I\u2019m working on. I can walk away and not miss anything. I can also have something inputting to the tv and just use the buds for that sound as well, which is basically impossible to do with the Apple AirPodsThey are the perfect size to fit the opening of my ears, way more comfortable than the pods.Also, they haven\u2019t gotten out of sync yet. One in, take out the other and they\u2019re matched perfectly. Swap around, whatever you do they stay correct for stereo sound. Apple air pods pro will often get out of sync with each other or even worse go mono because they can\u2019t figure out how to communicate with whatever device they\u2019re trying to pair with. Really pathetic on apples part, Raycon blows them out of the water in that aspectBattery life is great, I get through so many episodes of things and I usually manage to get them charging again before I drain them fully lolAfter this most recent iPhone os update the AirPods are even more wonky: trying to connect to the phone while they\u2019re in the case and it\u2019s closed \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 I am so, so glad I got these Raycons and can\u2019t wait to get my next pair",

Loved them did great battery life, sound, comfort, sturdy case, I do construction so helps to know it can take a beating. Anywho, was getting something out of my pocket and some rhyme or reason ended slinging out my blue raycons, found the 1st bud ager searching, could not find the other one life of me with my wife helping me. So ordered a new pair because I enjoyed the blue ones so much. So fast forward 3 months, found the other ear bud today, 1/26/2024, on my wife's van on the tray below the windshield wipers that's on the outside, so 3 months outside on her van exposed to the elements, single digit numbers, rainstorms, snow, and highway speeds. Charged it up and they both still have the same sound quality and charge holding, in the words of billy bob from varsity blues, I give it a 10!!! A f***** 10!!!! Great product well worth the money, and the quality and reliability and durability. Can't ask for a better set of ear buds.",

                "reviewText": "I bought Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 and wasn't happy with them. I really tried to love them but the biggest drawback was when connected as a headset to my windows laptop the microphone went very very quiet and no one could hear me. Research revealed this is a common problem. To solve it I ordered Raycons for my \"work buds\".Wow! These are amazing! Great call quality when connected as headset to windows computer, simple pairing, physical buttons, intuitive controls, light weight, comfortable fit without having to buy additional foam covers, and so far great battery life. The Samsungs are getting kicked to lawn mowing duty.The only nit picking I can do so far on the Raycons is that the case is a little difficult to open with only a thin lid feature to catch with a nail, and given their light weight (a positive) they feel \"cheaper\" I hope they last. But at half the price of my other buds I could just replace twice as often.",

                "reviewText": "I'm giving it 4 stars because Amazon has good customer service. When I first ordered from here, my package came and my earbuds had been stolen from the packaging. All I got was an empty box, smh. Luckily I received a full refund and bought a pair from the actual Raycon website.The earbuds themselves are wonderful. Good audio quality. I like that it isn't touch screen and instead you click the buttons on each bud to lower volume, pause a video, etc. The battery lasts quite a while. I've fallen asleep listening to ASMR and woken up, and the battery has lasted a full day.The only feature that doesn't live up to its hype is the awareness mode. When it's on and at the lowest volume, I still have trouble hearing people and end up having to take an earbud out.Laying down can also be tricky, but with the right position they're perfectly fine.Other than that, I really don't have any complaints. I really like them overall and the vivid blue of the earbuds makes them stand out, though the size of them makes them easier to conceal.",
