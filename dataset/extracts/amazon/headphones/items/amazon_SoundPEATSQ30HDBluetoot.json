                "reviewText": "I think I've purchased 4+ of these headphones over the years. I love them, the way they fit, their length, the battery life, and design keeps me from losing them like I lose individual earbuds. The sound is definitely \"good enough\" or better.However, I don't think I've ever had a pair survive past the 2 year mark (always last at least a year I think). They either have too low battery, stop turning on, stop pairing, one headphone stops working, or just fall apart at the receiver. So maybe count them semi-disposable if you buy them.This time around I'm leaving this review and reconsidering another pair.",

                "reviewText": "Ok so you have found yourself looking for quality bluetooth headphones at an affordable price. By now you've probably run across every cheap Chinese knockoff and strange names product the world of Amazon has to offer. But guess what? Soundpeats is a quality company with excellent support and they even have a warranty on their items. If you would like to visit the official Soundpeats website then look for soundpeatsaudio.com. There you can sign up and get exclusive deals and offers on all their products and even extended warranties on the Soundpeats products you buy here on Amazon. But now for the product review.The Soundpeats Q12's are a lightweight pair of Bluetooth earbuds that are high quality without being insanely expensive. They are built with details learned from prior models. The control stick and microphone is so small that it doesn't drag the cable down to one side. The charging port has a little lip that allows you to open it easily without having to use something to pry it open. The microphone also sits at mouth level instead of being down by your collar bones. The earbuds come with 3 different size bud tips and 3 sizes of ear braces so unless you have itty-bitty mouse ears you should be able to find something to fit just right. They are also sweat resistant and have magnetic backs so you can wear them like a necklace. The cable is flat and soft and flexible and shorter than some of the other models which is nice because you don't have a lot of excess cable getting caught up on everything. Charging is quick. They usually fully charge in about an hour.Sound quality : First and foremost I have to explain a little something about sound quality to give you a better understanding of what these headphones have to offer. Sound quality to most people is relative. Some people value loud bass over everything else. Some people don't know that streaming apps like Pandora use compressed audio files that don't sound as good as the original music. With that being said here goes.This unit has an excellent audio processor in it that allows you to experience high quality audio. After reading a few other reviews where people complained about the bass not being as loud as they'd like I finally have an opinion on this. The sound coming out of these earbuds are very balanced. The key word is BALANCED. The bass is loud enough without drowning out the highs and mids. If you go to YouTube and look up HD music, 24 bit music or FLAC quality music you will be able to listen to high quality music with these headphones and hear details in the music you've never heard before. Yes, these headphones are that good. And the bass is still high enough to listen to bass heavy music.So if you're only interested in bass heavy music because you've burned your eardrums out listening to rap at the highest possible volume then you may not like these. But if you have good hearing and really want to enjoy music I believe you will love these headphones.As for the microphone it is clear and has excellent background noise reduction. People on the other end don't even know you're on a headset. And listening to calls is very clear too.I have used Soundpeats products for a few years now and they keep getting better. They have bluetooth speakers as well as every type of headphones and earbuds. I hope my review helps you.",

                "reviewText": "In comparison to earbuds for this price range, the sound is very full with a lot of dynamic between soft and loud parts, which is really immersive. I like how the cover for the charging port goes in firmly, as this makes it more waterproof, however I have carpal tunnel in both of my hands and it can be more of a challenge than it should when I just want to charge my earbuds. So if you have any disabilities that impair fine motor or affect your grip, keep this in mind.My biggest complaint is how it lacks basic remote control features that most other wireless earbuds have. You cannot go back by holding - or skip the song holding +, which are very basic functions that nearly every other Bluetooth earbud has. Also, they do not automatically connect to my phone, which is extremely annoying and off-putting. Honestly, as much as I love the sound for these, I may consider returning them since they don't think I can do without the remote functions or auto-pair.Update: I found out you can go forward/back, HOWEVER the hold time for it is Very long in comparison to other earbuds (about 4-5 seconds), and on most music apps, after 5 seconds have passed, trying to remotely go back will only restart the song... When it takes 5 seconds for the remote to trigger to go back, and 5 seconds have passed in the song... Yeah, you can see the problem.Edit 2: They don't work anymore. I haven't had them for a week. Tried to connect them to my iPad,and they were just making little static sounds and the light was blinking. Couldn't even turn on/off.",

I have been using versions the SoundPEATS Q30 for a couple years now, and just ordered this set to replace my previous pair (Which I ran over with the car).I love these headphones. They stay around my neck, so my risk of misplacing them is reduced. The sound quality is great, and the selection of several size ear inserts helps me get the perfect fit. The controls are simple and easy to use. Additionally, this model has upgraded to USB-C for charging, so I do not need to fumble in the dark trying to figure out which way to plug it in. Also, the USB port cover is much easier to open and close.These are my go-to headphones.",
