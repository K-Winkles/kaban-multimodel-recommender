                "reviewText": "These headphones are very well made and the sound quality is top notch.I have smaller ears so sometimes over the ear headphones would cause soreness or irritation after extended use. I have yet to experience that with these, and I have worn them for multiple hours at a time.The adjustable frame makes for a very comfortable fit. I can adjust the frame so I can wear them over a beanie or hat and have no issue with the headphones moving or being too tight.The headphones are connected to an app that allows you to choose between preset equalizers for a different listening experience. You can also generate customized equalizers that tune the headphones to your preferred sound quality. Whether it be increased bass, treble, or both, the options are endless. The ability to personalize the sound quality of the headphones is one of the main reasons I love these headphones.I\u2019ve had these for about 2-3 weeks now and have only charged them once\u2026when I first got them. The battery life is surprisingly long, which is always a plus.The only negative thing I can say about these headphones is that they don\u2019t collapse. But, that\u2019s a very small issue and is more personal preference than an actual issue.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A solid pick",
                "reviewText": "I bought these for a bargain price. My Sony MDR-XB650BTs kept breaking (and while I adore the sound on those they kept going up in price). Knowing Sony\u2019s sound quality to be good, I looked for another pair of Sony bluetooth headphones and stumbled upon these for an incredible sub $50 bargain.I apologize in advance for the constant comparison to MDR-XB650BT in my review. I\u2019m no headphone afficiando, but the only fully experienced reference point I have to compare these to are the MDR-XB650BT which I bought these to replace.MATERIALOn the WH-CH520, the material of the pads appear to be made of synthetic leather. The issue with this is that this material absorbs moisture (oils and sweat) and wears down the fabric over time causing pilling and eventually tearing of the fabric, leaving your ear pads with a spongy hernia.Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t aware of this until only recently and had this happen to multiple MDR-XB650BT ear pads, but I took preventative measures for my WH-CH520 by purchasing a pair of silicone ear pad covers like another reviwer had mentioned to protect them from degrading.Despite the headphones being lightweight and made of plastic they feel sturdy at the same time. They feel less fragile than the MDR-XB650BT which is definitely a plus but I haven\u2019t had them for long enough to talk about the build quality and how long you can expect them to last. By handling them I get this feeling they\u2019re pretty durable. The only thing I find I might be concerned about over time is the swivel.FIT AND DESIGNI have a small head and these fit me fine. The headphones are worn on-ear. They\u2019re a snug fit but can become uncomfortable after about an hour but that\u2019s usually because I wear them tight but I can loosen them when I please. Because of how round the design is there\u2019s a bit of space between my head and headband when it connects to the earpeices which can look kinda goofy (see pic) but it\u2019s nothing major and has no bearing on what I\u2019m looking for in headphones. The good news is because of this gap you can probably wear them comfortably with glasses. The actual ear pads a little small compared to other headphones.I really enjoy the design. The WH-CH520 are minimalist, streamlined, and the matte is charming.SOUND AND SOUND QUALITYBottom line: It\u2019s good.In comparison to other cheaply priced headphones I\u2019ve had the experiences of trying (but not owning myself), the sound quality is good. It\u2019s not stellar but it\u2019s definitely good for the price.One thing that bugs me is the depth of the sound dynamics. In the app, you\u2019re able to adjust and set your own custom EQ settings but the sound quality is slightly boxy or stuffy. I\u2019ve tried a ton of different settings adjustments in the app\u2019s equalizer with it and I experiment with different songs to see which settings holds up between songs, but there\u2019s still a baseline emphasis on lower-mid frequencies in this sound of these.The EQ setting that I find sounds best ends up just being the flat default with bass turned up and 400Hz slightly cut. I do wish the equalizer options in the app were more granular.Overall I find that the WH-CH520 has less of a dynamic range than the MDR-XB650BT. An analogy to this are \u201cblackest blacks\u201d and \u201cwhitest whites\u201d on a screen with a dynamic range monitor. In terms of sound this is loudness and quietness in instruments which create a feeling of depth in the music. With the WH-CH520 the actual balance of the volume of the instruments are a bit muddled compared to the MDR-XB650BT.Their noise isolation leaves something to be desired but it\u2019s better than nothing.It\u2019s not the end of the world and I would still recommend these for the price. When you can adjust it right to work around the low-mid oddity it\u2019s actually pretty good.Also, everyone hears things differently and I\u2019m quite sensitive to subleties in sound so take what I\u2019m saying with a grain of salt if you\u2019re not as sensitive.BATTERY LIFEI haven\u2019t even charged them out of the box yet after using them nearly every day and they\u2019re only at 50% battery life. Phenomenal. That\u2019s all there really is to say.FEATURESThere\u2019s a minor feature of these headphones that bug me. At least pairing it with my iPhone, the volume control on these is tied directly to the volume of your phone. If you click the volume up button on the headset, that\u2019s going to use your phone\u2019s volume. The MDR-XB650BT has a separate sound adjustment from your device. Unlike the MDR-XB650BT, with the WH-CH520 you can\u2019t further increase the volume on your headset if the volume of the song on your phone is a tad quiet. This takes away a bit of listener flexibility.As other people have stated, the buttons are difficult to distinguish by finger.The MDR-XB650BT that I\u2019m used to has a button that sticks out between the volume controls where you can press it inward to pause/resume the music or flick the button forward or backward to change the song in a playlist.The WH-CH520\u2019s buttons are flat which makes it harder to distinguish and it does not have that controllability from the headset. You can pause and resume your music with the middle button (which you might mistake for the volume buttons unfortunately) but if you want to change your song to the next or previous, you\u2019ll have to do it on your device.Despite all the negative things I have said, these points are all relative. In a vacuum, these headphones are great for the price especially if you just need a set of headphones that can get the job done while sounding pretty good. You\u2019re probably gonna get more than you expect for the price.",

Excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. En el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son c\u00f3modos, ligeros y no se mueven. Los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha da\u00f1ado nada. El audio es buen\u00edsimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o m\u00fasica del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. Nunca ha sido necesario subir al m\u00e1ximo el volumen. Adem\u00e1s con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, tambi\u00e9n recomiendo, si usas Spotify, ecualizar ah\u00ed para tener la mejor experiencia posible. La bater\u00eda dura much\u00edsimo, en 3 meses de uso us\u00e1ndolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. Cargan muy r\u00e1pido tambi\u00e9n. El \u00fanico detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi SmartTV Hisense, jugando Playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con Youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto \"se brinca\" o \"se come\" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. Pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar m\u00fasica desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. En resumen, son c\u00f3modos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de bater\u00eda.",

The 70 percent charge lasts me a full 2 weeks, and that is impressive considering that I listen to music for over 7 hours per day. The look and build of them is of course not premium quality, but definitely worth more than you pay for. They are made of plastic but it's sturdy and will only bend if substantial pressure is put on the headphones. They are relatively slim, but they do not fold which can be an issue when finding space in a backpack. The ear cushions only get uncomfortable at about 5-ish hours of non stop wear, but it's not too bad. The sound quality is bangin for the price. With the dedicated app, you can control eq settings. Completely customisable sound. No complaints, especially for such a great experience for under 100 dollars.",
