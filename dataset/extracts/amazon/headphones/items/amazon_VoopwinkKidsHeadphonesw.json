I figured that they would probably get him by for awhile and I would probably have to get another pair after Christmas break. They survived the entire school year and worked just as well as the day we sent them in. I planned on letting him just take them back this school year as well, but I accidentally slammed them in the car door one day during summer break. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f They still technically worked, but just weren\u2019t too comfy on his ears, so I bought the same exact pair for this school year.",
