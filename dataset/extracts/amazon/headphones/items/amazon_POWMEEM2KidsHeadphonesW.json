                "reviewText": "We've had these a week as of August 21st. If they fail us I'll edit the review, but so far, really GREAT. I'd bought other children's headphones in the last two years for my two kids (for school and home) and they always end up getting wrecked likely because the cord is vinyl and easy to destroy. One ear phone would always fail after a few weeks. These old styles also had sponge foam covers on the ears that always start to shred after some time.This particular brand and style I'm reviewing has many pros and so far I cannot give it any cons.First, the nylon cord is excellent and sturdy. It's long (that may be an issue for younger children) but it's perfect for my 6 year old and 9 year old.The sound quality is great for kids. There's no noise reduction on this model, but these headphones aren't some high tech stereo sound product. The sound volume is normal and not too loud for young ears.The ear cups are super soft, like those headphones us kids had in the 1970s/1980s. Adjustable and comfortable, easy to store away loops for the cord.The color pink I bought here is nice, the kid likes it very much. Very happy with it.The price is excellent. Should your kid mess the headphones up in any way you at least haven't lost much on expense.All in all, I highly recommend these. Great product!",

He says they are comfortable and works well. Listening myself they have decent sound quality and can block out most outside noise. They do have some noise (static) at louder volumes but we would never have him listen at that loudness. They seem durable as he whips them in his backpack back and forth to school daily.",

Just came back to purchase some new ones for school only.I also purchased the pink ones a month or two earlier and one of the headphone side stopped working.As far as the noise cancellation.. I constantly have to tell the kids to take atleast one side to the back of the ear since they do not hear anything I say.FYI: the kids have had these headphones EVERYWHERE and being mistreated as usually kids do and I\u2019m just now having to purchase a new set only because I don\u2019t want them to stop working during school time.Definitely recommend!",
