                "reviewText": "I needed some earbuds for work so I bought these. I needed to wear just one bud so I would be able to hear people talking to me and other alerts. These buds work very well with my iPhone 13 mini.Usage: I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. I wear the right bud on MWF, and the left one on T,Th,Sat. It is easy to pause the music with a single sharp tap to the outside of the bud. Taps work through latex gloves but not through fabric mittens (unless they have conductive material I imagine). The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds (you might need to be wearing both buds for this type of control). I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using \"Hey Siri.\" The buds are a tiny bit clumsy when handling because they slip out of your fingertips a little, so be careful not to drop them. The case is nice and slim and fits well in a pocket. It's hard to tell which one is the right bud and which one is the left bud, but there is a small letter on each one. They have to be placed into the case in their appropriate positions for charging.Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes several hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. Each bud shows a red indicator light when it is taken out of the case if it is not fully charged, and shows a blue indicator light if it is fully charged. There is no indicator that tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6\" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with moderate amounts of motion; however, I would hesitate to use them for exercise or sports because they feel comfortable but rather loose compared to my running buds. My running buds also have a rubber flap that helps keep them in place, and these buds don't have anything like that. I had to run across the street with these buds and they didn't fall out, so maybe they would be OK to take jogging. So far they have not fallen out at work. I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands, and I don't know much about noise cancellation, but I have used buds with terrible sound so I know that I would have returned these if I didn't like the quality. I listen to a lot of music and I also write songs on an electronic piano keyboard using a computer workstation and I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.Overall these buds are a great value for the price and I am looking forward to enjoying my music library at work for as long as I can.UPDATE: I decided to wear them while exercising because my other pair broke (typical). I went jogging/walking for 3.1 miles at a 10-minute mile pace on a slightly warm day (70 F). I broke a sweat but it was not like dripping sweat that I would get in South Carolina or Florida in the summer. I wore a headband to keep the sweat from dripping down, which was sufficient at this temperature. I think the buds got moist but not wet, and they didn't fail. I cleaned them gently afterward with a cloth that was damp with isopropanol. I was afraid that they would fall out of my ears but they stayed with little need for adjustment. Pairing to my Apple Watch was no problem. I just told the phone to forget the device, then took the buds out of the case. They turn on automatically and go into pairing mode when there is no device that has previous association. Then I just went to the watch settings and hit the TOZO T6 button. Excellent! I decided to buy the NC9 which is a sport water-resistant model since both of my Jaybird devices are now in the trash.",

                "reviewText": "Skip down ~2 paragraphs to get to the review. The first two paragraphs are information about how I conduct my torture tests to determine quality. To ensure fairness and that it isn't the equipment I'm connected to I'm comparing these to the first pair I received to the second as well as a couple of other earbuds and my Sennheiser headphones. I do not expect these to sound as fabulous as my $130 headphones and neither should you.I'll start this review by providing information. This is an updated review after having written my original review. I was contacted after my initial review by the company stating that I may have received a defective model and was offered a replacement model at no cost. I have received them and have gone through several rounds of headphone torture tests. While I do not have the equipment to conduct serious tortures nor access to such equipment, namely graphing features and an oscilloscope in order to find out exactly what wave shapes are being produced, I'd like to think that my tests are at least semi valid.I'm conducting my torture with straight rips from CD as well as streaming services. I also use audiocheck.net tests to determine everything that I can't with just straight listening to music. I use both live and studio versions where available. Here are the songs that I have tortured with. I'll include notes as well. Keep in mind that I am cross dominant (left handed, left eye, right ear, right foot) so sounds tend to be a little different for me and sounds that I hear that are supposed to be directly in the middle of my head tend to sound stronger on the right channel.REVIEW!!!!!!Outside of quality, which actually did improve with this set,The bass on these earphones is great. The ability to switch at low frequencies and to be able to determine the moment of the switch is well done. Here's where I get an issue with the bass. On higher quality headphones, you should never hear a whine (unless they've been poorly built, just beat to death, or used for quite some time completely unlike what I do here). These headphones produce a buzz when you use the audiocheck \"Quality test\" which is designed to beat your drivers enough that they shake quite a lot. I don't fault the makers of these for the buzzing because they are bluetooth earbuds, but I still shouldn't hear the whining of the drivers begging me to stop the bass test.The mids still aren't top notch even with the replacement set, but they are certainly better than the previous pair.The highs are fairly well defined, but can muddle at the very top of the range that humans can hear (I have excellent hearing and it's been determined that I can hear up to 18,000 hz down to 22 hz). When sounds reach that level, that's pretty rough on headphones and these do pretty well. Do not discount these headphones because of the fact that they muddle at the very top of the human hearing range or right at the bottom, that's tough to deal with.Overall the replacement pair is far better than the defective model that I originally received. Excellent quality for the price point. They still do not compare to some of the higher quality headsets that I own, but for earbuds they are top notch.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This section is all about what I use to test headphones.Before I start the list here is my grading scale for bassFail = Poor quality, extreme difficulty switching between frequencies.Fail+ = Poor quality or difficulty switching between frequencies with the other being good or greatPass = Great quality at single tone, difficulty with switching between frequencies. IF single tone, great quality.Pass+ = Great quality, great switching between higher and lower pitch bass soundsBass quality determinationPaper Trails - Darkside (Pass)Magma - Yello (Pass+)Pure 30 hz Sine Wave - Binaural Beats Isochronic Tones Lab (should shake loose any earwax buildup. Pass)It's a Long Way to the Top - AC/DC (Pass+ They are fully capable of handling the droning bagpipe with the bass guitar. Absolutely passes with this).Falling - Olive (Pass+ The song is awful, but the bass at the beginning does not disappear like it would on low quality headsets)In this section I'm going on how much trouble I have picking out separate instruments. I should be able to pick out the majority of instruments. If I have trouble then it is a fail. If not, pass.Instrument clarity across all levels (this is unfortunately full of \"Your call is very important\" hold music)Giant steps - John Coltrane (Pass)Milestones - Miles Davis (Pass)Stella By Starlight - Miles Davis (Pass)Rotation - Herb Alpert (Pass)Flight of the Cosmic Hippo - Bela Fleck and the Flecktones (Pass)King of Swing (live and studio version) - Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (Pass)If there's muddled sounds and it sounds like things blend together too much then it's a fail. I'm not trying to pick out first and second chair on an instrument but I should be able to pick out separate instruments.Mid range test (Clarity is extremely important here).King of Swing (live and studio version) - Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (This is a pass, but it's not an orchestra. 7 piece band though)The Imitation Game - London Symphony Orchestra (Mostly passes. Some trouble picking out strings.)Violin Concerto No. 5 in A Major..... - London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) (Pass)Flute Concerto No. 2 in D Major - LPO (Pass)I used a single album for determining whether or not things sound like they are too close together and boxed in. I used Pink Floyd's Pompeii concert. This single bit has determined both through the remix and the original (which you can stream or if you're electronically inclined can probably hook up a bluetooth module to a TV with a built in VHS player) that the ability to not sound boxed in is a Pass+. Excellent job on managing to do this at this price point, this isn't something that is exactly easy to do especially over bluetooth or again at this price.",
