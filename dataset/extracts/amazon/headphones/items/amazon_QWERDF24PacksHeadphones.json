They aren\u2019t too tight, but they fit snugly and comfortably up against the ear. The sound output is a little less than he prefers, but he still likes them and uses them at home and at school.The other 23 headsets I will be using as backup headphones for my kindergarten class. It seems every week there\u2019s at least one student who forgets their headphones or has them short out, so these will be a nice backup set. While I cannot yet comment on the longevity of the product, so far they have worked well for nearly a month without any issues. Besides, at a little more than $1 per pair, even if a few of them short out or break down, it will still be worth the price of the set. Overall, I\u2019d recommend these headphones especially for classroom use.",

                "reviewText": "24 Packs Headphones Bulk for Kids Classrooms Set School Students Class Wired On-Ear Over-Ear Earphones Individually BaggedThese are cheap, lightweight headphones similar to what you'd get on an airplane. They're nothing fancy, but they do the job when you need a wired headphone. We got these for my daughter's elementary school, where children always need headphones. Both the teacher and students have been happy with them. They came just in time for a big semester standardized test day, and several children who had lost or broken headphones really appreciated them. I'd say these are a great classroom/school donation, as there are always going to be children in need of headphones, either for financial reasons, technology problems, or just the standard kiddo absent-mindedness. I've been using a pair myself recently because the speaker on my laptop has been blown out. The sound quality isn't exactly high fidelity, but it's nice and clear, definitely good for voice and certainly adequate for music. I like that they're simple, cheap, and wired, so no batteries to charge and no tragedy if the get broken or misplaced, perfect for schools. The fit is fine for both me and my daughter, and there's a wide headband where you can write the child's name, and the plastic section over the ear foams is large enough that kids can decorate them with small stickers if they like.",

We go through headphones fairly often, as a result, since the headphones are used multiple times a day. We've, traditionally, gotten more expensive, over the ear headphones that we've found don't seem to last long, so we've started opting for cheaper headphones like this.Due to the size, of course, they come in a fairly small box. Each pair is individually wrapped in a little polybag. They're pretty standard headphones that you'd see of this variety otherwise. The length of the cable is decent, at about 4 feet. Since we only utilize these for voice training, and not music, they are more than sufficient for our needs. Hopefully they last as long as our others, which we are hoping, but since they are far cheaper, it's a much better value for us.",
