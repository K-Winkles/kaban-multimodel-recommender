                "reviewText": "These particular headsets are great to have in that one it looks like the apple original headphones but the actual cable material is tougher which was a bit surprising. The reason being is that these headphones are fairly cheap and there are two of them. They do have microphones so you do not have to worry about not being able to have headphones that you cannot use on your phone. The microphone is okay but I would not say they are the best. A person on the other side said they could hear me but it is definitely not crystal clear. You can use this for several of your devices such tablets but be aware that it needs to support having a 3.5 mm in order to utilize the microphone. The wires themselves are really nice and do not see them fraying over the course of a few years or months which is really nice. I would say they are unfortunately prone to the sun damage being white colored. If you happen to touch your headphones a ton or leave them in the sun, they will most likely get bleached. These headphones do fit pretty well in your ears so you do not have to worry about it falling out. It fits my ear and majority of the people I have seen that have tried this it fits pretty comfortably. It does not feel irritated or anything and overall a pretty good set if you are looking for something to work out in and not worry about it breaking or such. It provides decent sound quality. Overall I think these headphones are great. They look great, work pretty well, and give you two so you can keep one in your bag at all times if needed. It also comes in a nice little case so you can store them easier.",

                "reviewText": "For whatever reason, more and more, the world seems to invoke a demand for earbuds with rubber tips on them, and I seem to belong on a disappointingly tiny list of the people on earth that can't stand them. LUCKILY, these white earbuds, reminiscent of the OG Ipod earbuds, are some of the only rubber-tip-less-earbids that I am able to find, because they're absolutely perfect. The quality of these specific units though, are definitely not up to par with the original Ipod units but, for this price, they are WELL worth it. And for TWO of them...? They are an absolute steal. They are sturdy enough--(I have to buy a new pack of two around every 9 or 10 months.) I can't necessarily blame that on the quality of the product, as much as I can attribute it to how often I use them and where.(I literally always have them underneath my shirt and they tend to get caught on... LITERALLY EVERYTHING while I'm working). They sound pretty good, and if you're deaf from years of listening to, recording, and performing music like I am, they have a rather high decibel threshold.There not much else to say.But these.They tha dopest.They that good-good earbuds.",
