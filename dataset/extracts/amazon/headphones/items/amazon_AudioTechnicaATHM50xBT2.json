But we weren\u2019t content to stop there. Introducing the ATH-M50xBT2, the second generation of our critically acclaimed M-Series wireless over-ear headphones, featuring a number of enhancements to improve performance and usability. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 we\u2019ve changed nothing about the critically acclaimed sonic signature. The M50xBT2 delivers the same exhilarating wireless listening experience as its predecessor, offering exceptional clarity and deep, accurate bass response. There\u2019s even the option to adjust the headphone\u2019s EQ settings, if you so choose \u2013 make the changes in the A-T Connect app and save directly to the headphones. In addition, we have greatly improved vocal pickup, incorporating beamforming microphone technology for clearer phone calls and communication with the built-in Amazon Alexa voice assistant. We\u2019ve also added multipoint pairing to let you connect wirelessly to two devices at once. An updated USB-C connection, a low latency mode, and compatibility with high-quality audio codecs round out the enhancements.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a fan of the original ATH-MX50's for a long time and the ATH-MX50x BT2, is a great upgrade. I am not sure I really needed to upgrade, my originals still work great after 6 years, but I thought the Bluetooth feature would be nice to have. Right out of the box, this headset is great! Fit feels just like the originals, buttons are responsive and seem durable. Being able to plug in is a great option but with the battery life, I don't think I will ever need to use it. I will appreciate this function when I travel as I will be able to plug into the airplane's entertainment system as well as walk around the airport without the cord catching on all of my travel gear. Even though these are not noise-cancelling headphones they do a great job of blocking out unwanted noise. Just like the originals the construction is sturdy, ear cups fit great, nice, and soft on my head. I have no complaints about this product, it is great. Although I highly doubt, I will ever need to, I would purchase this again in a heartbeat. Great product, highly recommended! I may never need to purchase them again, but I will tell everyone else that they should.",

                "reviewText": "These are great headphones in all respects. The build quality is pretty good, sound quality is excellently flat (though I prefer a more bass-heavy sound signature), and they're quite comfortable (though being a sweaty person, my ears sweat after an hour or two wearing these). They don't have lag either when you're watching programs nor playing games. I just found out you can also plug these in using a 3.5mm jack to an audio source and sound goes through even when the headphones are wirelessly off.My only complaint is when you have the headphones connected to two sources via Bluetooth, you don't hear sounds from the two sources at the same time. When I'm listening to music on my PC and a notification sound plays on my phone, the connection to my PC \"pauses\" for a second or two to acknowledge the notification on my phone, then the PC output resumes. I have to disconnect it from one device so it can play seamlessly on the other.They're great headphones despite a few minor flaws. Definitely worth a try, esp when they're on sale.",

                "reviewText": "Easily the best sounding pair of wireless headphones I've ever owned. The app is a gamechanger for adjusting balances, and getting a sound mix you really enjoy. These headphones sound great, have a long lasting battery life, charge fast, and most importantly the build quality is really strong. However, there is no noise cancelling, but you really don't need it if you're listening at above half volume. The only true downside to these is the fact that the bluetooth pairing process is one of the most braindead systems of all time. You have to hold down 3 buttons (one of which is power) for an arbitrary 15 seconds and 99% of the time the device thinks you're trying to turn it off again instead of pairing. Otherwise these headphones are a no-brainer. At this price you simply will not get more out of your money, when everyone else is moving towards better noise cancelling, audio technica put all their eggs in the sound quality basket, and its really paid off.",

                "reviewText": "The sound quality is really good for 200$ Bluetooth over-ears. But for myself, they were horribly uncomfortable. There are A LOT positive reviews from people that really like how these headphones feel, I am not one of them. Which is unfortunate because I really wanted to like these - they're the best over-ears I could find without ANC (which I purposefully didn't want), in this price range.The ear-pads are angled, and oval shaped, and relatively small. Which apparently doesn't work for my head-shape. They are a snug fit over the ears - I highly recommend upgrading the ear-pads if you do buy these. The angle of the ears makes the headband sit weird on my head, they feel like they're falling forward on my head. And if I angle them back, the angled / oval ear-pads sit uncomfortably on my ears.They're also heavier than I was expecting, but that's to be expected with BT headphones like this.4 stars because the sound is really good - worth the price. But the shape really didn't work for me -1.",

                "reviewText": "I got my first pair of wired mx40s back in 2016 and they lasted me until nearly the end of 2023. Never had a reason to switch for something different as a solid go to, since they were perfect for what I wanted. I tried a ton of different things and styles (at very different prices) but they just sounded amazing, were relatively cheep, and were just all around one of best headphones I tried over the years.. Until I sat on them while traveling for the 100th time and finally snapped right where the band connected to the right headphone.. now forsaken to go look for something to fill the void I decided it\u2019s time for a upgrade and OMG the 50s are fantastic. They\u2019re somehow lighter, more comfortable, and the Bluetooth was just another plus. Not to mention finding out about how when you use something like to speech to text it will slightly playback your voice so you can actually hear yourself speaking (idk if I\u2019m alone with that feeling of talking when you can\u2019t really hear yourself just being wrong in some way).Honestly, this is my first time ever reviewing a product, but this was something I actually recommend to everyone I knew and wanted to leave a comment for once. If you are looking for a some great headphones I would definitely suggest getting the 50s (it\u2019s worth it). If you are on a budget the 40s are still a solid pair and (from my perception) had a sound signature pretty similar.",
