However, the low volume can be a drawback, especially if you're looking for earbuds that deliver a bit more punch in the sound department.If you prioritize budget over high volume, these earbuds might still be suitable for casual use. But if you're someone who enjoys louder audio, you might want to consider investing a bit more in a higher-quality pair. Overall, they are decent for the price, but the low sound level is something to keep in mind.",

                "reviewText": "According to amazon, I bought this in July of 2022. This week one of the buds stopped working and I was only getting sound in one ear, verified on multiple devices. I searched amazon for a replacement and this was one of the top results. So this pair lasted me about 18 months of intermittent usage. I'm a hybrid remote/office worker. This pair was in the office. I only used it a couple days a week and it never left my desk. Sounded good when it worked, though.",
