                "reviewText": "I lose or destroy ear buds, so I just wanted something that is good enough and cheap.These are good enough and they are cheap. Probably many vendors on Amazon marketplace sell these same ear buds under different names. No matter. They are a good buy if you want something cheap and good. Plus the microphone works, and works quite well. I did not think I even needed the microphone that comes with these ear buds, but I have had strange problems with my phone's microphone. Using these ear buds totally solved that problem while I am ordering a new phone.The ear buds also come with some extra ear bud pads. Since those fall off, that is a big plus.I have bought these ear buds three times, and I will definitely be buying more of these ear buds in the future. I am hard on ear buds, and lose them too, and that is why I have bought this product several times.I do have one suggestion for the seller. The ear buds come in plastic bags that have to be torn open.Instead, it would be much better if each set of ear buds came in a small zip locked bag, kind of like a snack-sized zip lock bag.Tip: I bought a bag of snack-size zip lock bags for $1.25 at a dollar store. I now keep each pair of ear buds in their own snack-sized zip lock bag. Work great. Better to keep track of the spare ear pads, and also keeps the ear buds from getting tangled. I even keep a pair of ear buds in a snack-sized zip locked bag in my wallet. Works great.All in all, a good product.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very hard on earbuds--so price and durability are always factors for me. After more than 2 years of use--about 10 hours a day plus a sleep cycle of 6-8 hours, I'm still on the 1st 2 sets I opened. Comfort level is good--I sleep with them. Sound quality just fine for audiobooks. Noise cancellation? I only want limited levels for that since I like to listen to audiobooks when walking or driving and need to hear ambient sounds. They don't work well in overcoming sounds in restaurants or most waiting rooms. Just guessing that these may produce about a 10 decibel reduction in external noise--I've no complaints with that. Through decades I've spent much more for earbuds that died quickly and performed less well overall.",
