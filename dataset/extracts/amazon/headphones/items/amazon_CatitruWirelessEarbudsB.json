You would have to work at knocking these off your ears which makes them fantastic for working out.So simple to set up and use. Battery life is fantastic - I don't know how long it lasts b/c I haven't got there yet. :D Case has a nice flat bottom and has a nice smooth satiny feel to it. Charges the earpieces very quickly.

                "reviewText": "The design is supreme to anything ive tried before with soft rubber ear hooks to keep each ear bud secure. They pair easily with my phone and the sound quality is good. The battery lasts forever. They are great to use at the gym because the ear hook prevents them from falling out while exercising. I'm super happy with these.",

                "reviewText": "I have several Bluetooth earpieces in many forms.I wear them at least 12 hours a day for phone conversations as well as listening to Sirius while working,I really like that you can use one at a time to allow hearing your surroundings while listening in the Bluetooth. When wearing both, it blocks out background noise.I find it comfortable enough to wear for hours without irritation.The battery life is excellent and the charging case adds to endless daily power.The only modification that would be helpful is if it came with a lanyard strap to carry the case by.The operation functions are easy to use, making answering and ending calls simple as well as pausing and starting music tracks. The volume buttons are convenient and easy to operate.This is a great choice at a great deal . I definitely recommend buying this bluetooth earbuds",

The sound quality is amazing, which is something I\u2019m picky about as I\u2019m very into music. I\u2019m surprised with the sound quality, to be honest. The case seems very durable and the battery life is great! They were easy to pair with my phone also. Highly recommend these headphones.",
