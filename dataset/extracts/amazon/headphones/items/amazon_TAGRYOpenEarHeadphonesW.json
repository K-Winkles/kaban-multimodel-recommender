                "reviewText": "I just got these new Tagry K08 headphones. They are nicely packaged well protected, come with detailed instructions (user manual, come with the charging cable (USB A to USB C) and a nice round carrying case. I like the quality of the product at a good price. The battery percentage is shown on the case (in white digital numbers) so you can see how much usage you got left and know when you need to charge them; and while it is charging the digital numbers a readily visible and increase until is fully charged. These are really comfortable and don\u2019t go inside your ear, just rest around the ear like a hearing aid and no matter how you move while wearing them they don\u2019t fall off. These Wireless Open Ear Headphones Sports are awesome to use when running and doing other exercises. The setup pairing is very simple and it does not take long to connect. These have good sound whether you are taking on the phone or listening to music. Also the play and pause feature (double tap) works good. These for sure rival some more expensive alternatives. I have another set of ear buds from Tagry and both of them are great!Other color choices would be a good addition for Tagry.I would definitely recommend them and would buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "I recently took the plunge and invested in the K08 Wireless Open-Ear Sport Headphones, and let me tell you, they have imrpoved my workout audio-life in ways I didn't think possible. With a design that marries style and functionality, these headphones are a fitness enthusiast's dream come true.Let's start with the aesthetics \u2013 which may not be the K-08's strongest point. The biggest issue I have with these is it looks like I am wearing a hearing aid. However I am not sure if there's a way around this due to the nature of the item. If you want open-ear design that stops your headphones falling out while jogging, you need something that looks a bit different. Personal preference, I would have liked something that came in black to it was a little more discreet. With all that said, they are incredibly lightweight, and kind of silently sit there (e.g. you aren't fiddling with them constantly).Setting up the Bluetooth connection was a breeze, and the signal remained stable throughout my high-intensity interval training sessions. I opened the box, took out the headphones and linked them to my phone straight away.Comfort is key when it comes to headphones, and the K08s excel in this department. The open-ear design eliminates the discomfort associated with prolonged use, making them ideal for extended workout sessions. No more sore ears or that claustrophobic feeling \u2013 just pure, unadulterated comfort.Now, let's talk audio quality. Considering the open-ear design, I was initially skeptical about the sound performance. However, the K08s delivered a surprisingly immersive audio experience. The sound is clear, with a well-balanced mix of highs and lows. While they may not replace your high-end studio headphones for music production, they are more than capable of elevating your workout playlist to new heights. I felt they could be a bit bassier, but I guess this is the trade-off you have when using headphones that aren't in your ear directly.Durability is a significant concern for any fitness accessory, and the K08s don't disappoint. With a sweat-resistant design, they can handle the toughest workouts without missing a beat. The build feels robust and sturdy, instilling confidence that these headphones are built to withstand the rigors of an active lifestyle.Battery Life in these seem to be really good. Generally they seem to last quite a while before I need to charge them. A solid 10+ hours of use and then I whack them in the charger.One of my favourite things is the carry case for these. It's small, clearly shows the battery life and fits into my gym bag with little hassle.In conclusion, the K08 Wireless Open-Ear Sport Headphones have earned a permanent spot in my workout arsenal. They work well, are durable, and most importantly do not slip off my head during work outs, which I found in-ear headphones has the tendency to. You aren't going to be blown away by their audio quality or how amazing they look, but you are going to be able to have a great workout with reliable headphones, at a decent price.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these Bluetooth earbuds, and I must say, they have completely exceeded my expectations. After using them for some workouts and running, I am ready to share my thoughts on this product.Sound Quality (5/5):Let's start with the star of the show \u2013 the sound quality. These earbuds deliver an exceptional audio experience. The bass is punchy, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Whether I'm pumping up my workout with energetic tunes or enjoying a podcast during a run, the audio quality is consistently impressive.Designed for Workouts and Running:The marketing tagline that promotes these earbuds as perfect for workouts and running is spot on. The over-the-ear design of the earbud stem is a game-changer. Unlike traditional earbuds that can slip out during intense activities, these stay securely in place. I can confidently tackle my most vigorous workouts without the constant worry of readjusting or, worse, losing an earbud. It's a small design feature that makes a significant impact on the overall user experience.Comfortable Fit (4.5/5):In addition to their secure fit, these earbuds are very comfortable. The ergonomic design ensures they sit snugly in my ears without causing discomfort, even during extended use. I prefer this design over earpods which is pushed inside the ear canal, but that is obviously a personal choice.Battery Life (4/5):It's been only a week since I got these, but the first impression about the battery life is great. After a full recharge I had used it for a few hours and when I put it back in the charging case it showed close to 95% charge, so I am expecting a long battery life.Bluetooth Connectivity (5/5):Pairing these earbuds with my devices was seamless. When I first took it out of the charging case, it immediately went into pairing mode and it was a breeze to connect it for the first time. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and I've experienced no dropouts even in crowded environments. The range is impressive, allowing me to move around freely without losing connection.Durable Build (4.5/5):The build quality of these earbuds is solid. They feel sturdy and well-made, able to withstand the rigors of regular use. The sweat-resistant design is a bonus for intense workouts. They have also put some thoughts in designing the look and feel of the charging case. The earbuds magnetically attaches to the case when you put them in. It turns OFF when you place them inside the case and turns ON immediately when you pull them out. Like other Tagry earbuds, the case also displays the battery percentage of the buds.Overall Impression:In conclusion, these Bluetooth earbuds are a fantastic investment for anyone looking to enhance their workout and running experience. The outstanding sound quality, secure fit, and thoughtful design make them stand out in a crowded market. While there are minor areas for improvement, such as battery life and case durability, the overall performance far outweighs these considerations. I wholeheartedly recommend these earbuds to fitness enthusiasts and music lovers alike. It's rare to find a product that not only lives up to its marketing claims but surpasses them \u2013 these earbuds do just that.",
