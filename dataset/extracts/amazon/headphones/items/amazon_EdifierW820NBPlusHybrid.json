I got these primarily for the LDAC capability, which works flawlessly with no latency issues, even at distances over 20ft.Pros: Comfy, light, easy to use controls, easy connectivity, good appCons: no manual eq, only settings are ambient sound and noise canceling, not foldable/compactGreat for calls and music in a quieter setting. Noise canceling is great, but obviously effects sound signature.*Note: For sound rating, I am comparing to higher-end hps and also considering the lack of a neutral mode.These are excellent value and performance as I said. If you are looking for LDAC capable hps with noise cancellation these are probably the best, and from an established name. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "My head is slightly too small for most headphones, so they can't create the seal around my ears needed to make the noise cancelling effective. When I press the headphones against my head, they are pretty good at noise cancelling. They're no bose of course, but I'd say if normal volume is at 100%, they cancel noise down to like 50%. I'm a bit picky when it comes to noise cancelling due to sensory issues but these are affordable enough that there's no reason to try and return them. They are comfortable, turn on quickly and default to your last noise cancelling setting. My one complaint is that in order to be able to turn off ambient noise, you need to download the edifier app. Without the app, the two settings are ambient and noise cancelling, you need the app to just turn them both off.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my autistic son after buying myself a pair. I was looking for something less expensive since he's at the age where he doesn't take care of things yet. Surprisingly these are actually better than the more expensive pair I bought for myself. They are also SO comfortable. That was the most important part because he's so sensitive to anything touching his ears but when he tried them on and I asked if they were comfortable he said \"YEAH!\" with a big smile on his face. I bought other ones that were specifically for kids that I had to return because they were not comfortable at all. So glad I bought these for him because they seem durable and he will actually wear them because of how comfortable they are. Also, the Noise Cancelling is much better than expected. I tried them on myself to test them out and I can still hear talking but it cancels out all of the bothersome noise, which is what we wanted them for.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars A Mix, But Not Bad Overall",
                "reviewText": "I use these headphones primarily to listen to music and videos on a Windows 11 laptop. My first impression of the Edifiers is very mixed. They initially felt a bit tight on my middle-sized head, but after a short amount of wearing they are still snug, but a bit more comfortable. They stay in place well enough, but they don\u2019t feel especially heavy or light. The ear pads are large and block a significant amount of ambient sound. They can get pretty warm after a short time, but not unbearably so. I can easily listen for an hour or so without significant discomfort. The build feels adequate, but not luxurious or bulletproof. The product description indicates that these are not foldable, but my ear pieces fold flat. The various joints are fairly sloppy, and the entirely plastic headband loses adjustment easily. This is my first experience with noise canceling. The effect is noticeable and pleasant, but not dramatic. Low frequencies are pretty well masked, higher frequencies not as much. Noise canceling is not as important to me as sound quality. The sound quality is good enough for my purposes, but not spectacular. On first listen, the sound seemed somewhat more processed than natural, and a bit thin and flat. From other reviews I knew they wouldn\u2019t be bass heavy, which for me is a good thing. After a 4-5 hours of use, they seem to have gotten better. I haven\u2019t used them enough to speak to full battery life, which is now at 80%. I usually use iTunes for playing my large music collection, and using the built-in iTunes equalizer makes a big difference. The presets are surprisingly good, and they make the Edifiers sound much better. It\u2019s a bit of a pain to add another step, but the improvement is worth it. The sound when listening to speech on videos is good enough, but on some videos, I can sometimes detect a little latency. There is a game mode, but I couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Pairing was easy, and the Bluetooth range a bit better than some of my other devices. After a day or two with no problems, I now sometimes get brief, random dropouts. I don\u2019t know whether to blame the headphones, or interference from some other device. I can\u2019t pin it down. A USB C to A charging cable is included, but not a charger. The buttons feel okay, but are not prominent enough, or differentiated enough, and they are spaced too close together for my large, numb fingers. I wish it had a dedicated power switch instead of a multi-function button that has to be held down to turn the power on or off. The power and ANC controls would be better on the left side. I don\u2019t use the headphones with my iPhone, or use them to take calls, so I can\u2019t speak to those functions.Now for the really unforgivable stuff: The included instructions are totally lacking, and in tiny print on a pamphlet made for very small ants. The downloadable pdf version is more readable, but not very helpful. I suppose the assumption is that you'll be using the app on your phone. It's inexcusable that there is no app alternative for Windows, and some of the settings and options are simply unavailable to PC users. Among other unavailable options there is supposed to be a \"Standard\" mode along with the Ambient, ANC and Game modes; the instructions provide no information as to what that even is. Also missing is whatever passes for an equalizer, and a battery status indicator. The manual makes no reference to it, but I found that battery status can be found in Windows under the settings for Bluetooth devices. Also totally ignored in the manual is the meaning of the various flashing blue LED patterns that come and go. In the manual for another model I found that they are likely Bluetooth status indicators, but the patterns don't really match this model. No clues on the Edifier site. Completely missing is any sort of indication as to whether the power is on or off. Sometimes the blue lights flash, sometimes they don't. This is where a dedicated two-position power switch would be very helpful. And it would avoid having to hold the power button down to turn the device on or off. The ANC is always enabled by default when powering on, instead of remembering the last used setting - that\u2019s annoying and should be optional. How smart would a designer have to be to figure all this out? From what I understand, the phone app is a thinly veiled ad for other products and is likely to be a privacy issue. That trend is certainly unforgivable, and would be very unwelcome in a Windows app. I have little to compare these headphones with, except some older LG neckband earbuds, which sound much worse, and some even older wired Sennheiser P100 lightweight on-ear headphones, which sound a bit better and more natural. Despite the really stupid stuff listed above, the Edifiers are probably as good as I\u2019ll get for the price. If they don\u2019t break, I can recommend them for casual listening to music and video. For the $55 sale price, I probably could have done worse, and, at the moment, I\u2019m planning to keep them. They\u2019d be 4 stars except for the stupid stuff, and especially the functions lost without the app.",

This headphone is honestly so comfortable and it fits really nice on my small head and I love it Yes it doesn't fold and it does not come with a carrying case but it is small enough and comfortable enough to wear it can hang around your neck and like the sides fold inwards like in the first picture. I like that this has an ambient feature and it has noise cancellation both work really well and I both like them they sound really nice and it has a USBC charger which is really convenient. Overall these are the best headphones that I have bought and I'm so glad I bought them and not anything else more expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Sounds great, but there are some short comings.1. Not foldable, plus there's no case to keep it protected during travel.2. Volume is pretty low. I find myself using it at full volume many times.3. No multi point connect feature. It could be a deal breaker for many of the people using more than one device.If you're using it at your desk with only one device, it's an amazing option. But not otherwise.",
