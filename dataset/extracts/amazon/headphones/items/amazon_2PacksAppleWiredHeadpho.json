Immediately knew they weren't apple because the logo was not on the back of the case. They sound pretty good for the length of time they last which is not very long. Very cheaply made and will not ever purchase these again. Good for kids if you don't want to spend alot if they get ruined. I've had better luck from the dollar tree. That says it all. I do not recommend if your looking for good quality.",

The materials used feel and are of significantly lesser quality; as also appears to be the product and packaging assembly.Removing the earbuds from the packaging required some effort due to not being wrapped well. One of the wires was severely and permanently crimped/bent in half. I thought the earbud would not work due to broken wiring, but surprisingly it did. The volume control and mic were nonfunctional. Their sound is mediocre and somewhat muddy. Fortunately, my use case is to listen to spoken word podcasts so they are adequate and I will use them until the die which could be a long while or very soon. When they do, I will not be buying these again.For the price I was not expecting anything resembling Apple quality or performance, but I was expecting better than what these wired earbuds delivered. I rolled the dice and paid the price. I will not be making this mistake again.",
