                "reviewText": "I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldn\u2019t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they\u2019re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds. Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3\u2019s. I\u2019m an audiophile on a budget. They can\u2019t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they\u2019re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I\u2019ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that\u2019s due to the EQ setting I\u2019ve selected. You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven\u2019t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the \u201cambient-aware\u201d or \u201ctalk through\u201d modes. That\u2019s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don\u2019t seem to have any functional ANC. I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They\u2019ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1. However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc. it\u2019s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don\u2019t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",

                "reviewText": "First time buyer of Bluetooth earbuds - it\u2019s about time! I am super picky about sound, back in the 70\u2019s as a teenager, I saved all my money to buy a Marantz receiver and tape deck. I loved the Marantz sound so much! I still have it and still use it.Anyway, OMG, the JBL earbuds are amazing! I compared them to the $300 Sony 1000XM5 and $300 Technics AZ80\u2019s.The Sony\u2019s were out of the running right away, the sound just wasn\u2019t there and the app mainly just had canned sound profiles. Too controlling, no way to set custom EQ curves. If there was, I couldn\u2019t find it. The app overall was horrible, however the one thing I liked was that it had a player in it. I know fit is a very individual thing, but these felt like they were going to fall out no matter which rubber fitting I used.The Technics have a very good sound and if I didn\u2019t have the JBL\u2019s to compare with, I would have gone with those. However, it only has one custom EQ setting. So if you want to modify it, the previous one is lost. The fit was better than the Sonys for me.The JBL\u2019s have the best app and fit of all of them. The app lets you save multiple custom EQ curves! So you can choose from your own curves based on the song qualities. And they feel very solid in the ear. The sound is just amazing after you choose your curves. I cannot believe something at this price point could be this good. Only thing is I am not sure the noise cancelling has much if any effect. I need to compare the Technics for this. Doesn\u2019t really bother me as I have never had or needed noise cancellation before. Highly recommended, you can\u2019t possibly be disappointed with these.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Sound quality is awesome! Love the ability to use the app for EQ.- Noise cancellation is superior! (So great for shopping during the holidays, you can block out all the crowd chatter and repetitively Christmas music!)- Ability to switch noise cancellation modes is easy! (So you can optionally listen to people speak while cutting out a few decibles like fan noise.)- Build quality is solid!- The JBL app works flawlessly!- They connect to phone and other devices easily, total plug & play!Cons:- They tend to disconnect more often, which isn\u2019t that annoying per se \u2014 except it makes a beep sound to alert you that something is wrong. (The Apple earbuds just turn off, so there\u2019s no jarring loud beep in your ears.) This is especially annoying when it happens in the middle of a song.- This one is weird \u2014 If you hold the two earbuds in your hand, and they touch in a certain way, it makes a loud chirping noise. (Almost like the feedback of two microphones being too close together.)- They\u2019re kind of bulky, and fall out of my ears more often than the Apple AirPods did. Even after changing the rubber tips. (The bright side is that because they\u2019re so bulky, they\u2019re easier to find on the ground.)- Though you can use the JBL app to find your earbuds, it doesn\u2019t help you find the charging chase.Conclusion:- For $50, I\u2019ll keep \u2018em! The sound quality is truly excellent enough to look past the weird quirks.And if they get lost, as most earbuds often do, it won\u2019t break my wallet to do so. (The Apple ones are comfy and have less quirks, but kind of overrated at that price point.)So I would buy JBL earbuds again \u2014 though I might look into the smaller models, that maybe (hopefully) aren\u2019t as prone to pop out of the ear like a cartoon bean.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for some wireless headphones for a while now. Tried a few options under $100 but all of them were bad. Low audio quality, low voice quality or couldn't be heard in anything other than a quiet room, poor battery, poor connectivity, you name it.I was already set on increasing my budget to $150-$200 until I saw these JBL on sale for $70 (I think the original price was around $150) and knowing that JBL produce great sounding speakers figured I had nothing to lose by ordering them.They really hit the mark! for the money I paid I get very nice actual noise cancellation (I commute on subway to work and listen to podcasts) and great audio for music, podcasts, and conversations. Who ever I asked about the sound quality of my speech always replied I was crystal clear, no matter the surroundings (I'll admit that when standing next to a loud bus the quality diminishes, but that's just an outlier and no one, not even the $300 set, will be able to tune out that noise). They fit very snuggly in my ear and don't fall out even as I am pushed out the subway or working out.Pros:+ great value for money+ awesome audio+ very good noise cancellation for the pricecons:- haven't had any for nowOverall, I highly recommend getting these if they're on sale! I don't know if I'd pay full price for them as they have competition once you go to the $150-$200 price range.Will come back in a few months and update if something's not right.",
