Here are a few reasons why:Sound Quality: The audio quality is outstanding. The bass is deep, and the treble is crisp, making them great for both voice and music.Comfort and Fit: The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and do not fall out during moderate activity.Battery Life: The battery life is excellent and the charging case is great when you don't have access to a charger.Connectivity: Pairing the earbuds with my devices is very easy. They automatically turn on when removed from the charging case. I have connected to my android phone, smart TV, and Kindle Fire Max (which does not have an earphone jack).Touch Controls: The instructions for the touch controls on the earbuds are accurate and easy. Voice assistants announce when the earbuds are turned on/off and when they are paired. You can also play/pause music and adjust the volume.Noise Isolation: These earbuds do a great job of blocking out external noise. I could barely hear my table saw when I turned it on while listening to music. I can't wait until spring and summer when rototill the garden and cut my grass.Price: This product is a great value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many expensive earphones and none come close in regards to bass. These have 13 mm drivers, by far the largest drivers I\u2019ve found in earbuds. The bass is soooo good. Main reason why I bought it. I also got these for just $25 during a sale ($70 normally) so insane bang for buck.The battery life is actually insane for its price. The buds themselves pair instantly and stay in, sometimes I forget they are in due to how lightweight and comfortable they are. I see why they have such high ratings.If you want some premium sounding earbuds with heavy emphasis on bass (but not the kinds that makes your head hurt), then these are easily the best. I\u2019ve tried so many earbuds from low price to expensive and these are easily the best. You will not regret it. Usually the are on sale from $25-35 so buy them when you can!Apparently it advertised noise cancellation (which I don\u2019t care about, I actually rather would like to hear a little in case someone needs my attention) but they definitely don\u2019t cancel out all noise. They don\u2019t cancel loud noises, but I prefer that. I want to be able to hear if someone is yelling my name in case of emergency.",

                "reviewText": "Like: Easy to use, audio quality is great, I really like the battery strength.Cons: the bevel of ear bud prevents a deep ear canal insertion. This design prevents a good seat with sweaty or waxy ear canal. But I can live with that.The bigger issue is not having an app to disable features like the touch function because you have to keep reinserting the Buds. I dropped 3 important calls because of pressing a certain spot and the programming disconnects the call.There's no integration with Android wearable as a worst case. I won't return them because the price is so cheap and they give you nearly 60% of big brand features, but unfortunately I cannot accept these as my default Buds, and I will be picking up a big brand Beats or return to Samsung Buds Pro.",

Et il permettent une bonne isolation avec les bruits exterieurs gr\u00e2ce au systeme de reduction de bruit actif. il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 plusieurs fois qu\u2019on me parle et que je ne m\u2019en rends pas alors que le son de ma musique n\u2019etait pas fort du tout.Les fonctionnalit\u00e9s permisent par les boutons tactiles sont r\u00e9active et tr\u00e9s sympa. Il est possible de monter, baisser le son, changer de musique (avant & arri\u00e8re) mettre play/pause. Il est aussi possible de deccrocher / raccrocher en cas d\u2019appel.Autre point important, je trouve que le maintient des \u00e9couteurs dans l\u2019oreille ce fait super bien, je n\u2019ai pas fait de sport avec, mais j\u2019ai eu l\u2019occasion de marcher, cuisiner, bricoler ... et les \u00e9couteurs restent bien en place et ne m\u2019ont pas caus\u00e9 de douleur aux oreilles.De plus je n\u2019ai eu aucune difficult\u00e9 de connexion en utilisant les \u00e9couteurs. Une fois la connexion \u00e9tablie, d\u00e8s que l\u2019on sort les \u00e9couteurs de leurs boiti\u00e9, la connexion se fait tr\u00e9s rapidement au dernier appareil connect\u00e9. Et je n\u2019ai jamais eu de perte de signal / connexion bluetooth.Je recommande ces \u00e9couteurs !",

Verpackt waren sie in einem \u00fcberraschenderweise wertig aussehenden Karton. Die Ladeeinheit hat ein sch\u00f6nes, schlichtes Design.Bedienung und KlangKopplung geht schnell und unproblematisch. Ladefunktion bietet schnelle Ladezeiten und lange Standzeiten der Station. Sehr gute Benutzungsdauer der Buds.Die Buds halten sehr gut im Ohr und tragen sich angenehm. Es gibt auch noch 2 Silikon Ersatzaufs\u00e4tze dazu.Allerdings ist f\u00fcr mich Grobmotoriker die Bedienung der Touchtasten zu fein. Ich komme immer mal wieder daran und verstelle etwas z.B. die Lautst\u00e4rke. Dies ist aber mein Fehler und nicht den Buds anzukreiden. Ansonsten sind die Funktionen aber, gem\u00e4\u00df der Anleitung, einwandfrei gegeben.Der Klang hat f\u00fcr mich gerade den richtigen Bass, welcher von manchem Rezensenten bem\u00e4ngelt wird. Dies ist aber, denke ich, ein subjektives Empfinden. Ich habe sie gekauft weil ausdr\u00fccklich mit einem tiefen Bass beworben. Die einstellbare Lautst\u00e4rke ist f\u00fcr mich ausreichend. Habe es halt, entgegen aller Warnungen hinsichtlich des Schwellenwertes, gerne ein bisschen laut. Beispielsweise klingt \"Neunzig\" von Apache gerade richtig, um mal eine Referenz zu nennen.Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich sind die Buds kein audiophiles Referenzteil, aber zum Preis von 22,98 \u20ac ,die ich bezahlt habe, absolut ihr Geld wert. Selbst wenn sie nur eine gewisse Lebensdauer haben, ist ein Ersatz finanziell verkraftbar.Einzig die m\u00f6gliche Reichweite kann ich nicht best\u00e4tigen, diese liegt bei mir bei maximal 10 Metern.R\u00e9sum\u00e9Klare Kaufempfehlung und 5 Sterne von mir.",
