The sound quality was good and the touch functionality is great and easy to use. I\u2019d definitely recommend these if you do not want to spend a lot of money on earbuds,they are exactly what you pay: a pair of solid, budget-friendly earbuds. The sound quality is decentThese are both cute and functional. If you have small ears like me, you\u2019ll definitely need the smallest tips, and even then I experience mild soreness after wearing these for extended periods, They\u2019re super cute and the touch controls are useful and intuitive. However, there is no volume control on the earbud which I feel is tough if you\u2019re using these to exercise or during periods when your phone is out of reach. There isn\u2019t much bass, but that\u2019s common in earbuds. If you\u2019re looking for bass, I\u2019d recommend over-ear headphones instead. For what I paid, I\u2019m pleased with what I got These have a better case and much better touch controls, though. The fit is good, The batteries in this thing are amazing - They will play a long time without needing to recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works great. The touch controls are easy to use, Simple taps and double taps on the buds for volume control and track skipping. I can also access Siri with a long tap. You can also accept calls and end calls with touch control. I never have a problem connecting to my devices. These are great work and outdoor activities. Would recommend these for sure.",

I was able to easily pair them to my phone via Bluetooth and have had no connectivity issues, even when using them across the gym.The battery life is solid, giving me about 5 hours of continuous playback per charge. The charging case conveniently provides an additional 2 full charges so I don't have to worry about battery depletion for my daily workouts.Overall, these TAGRY wireless earbuds deliver really impressive quality and performance considering their budget-friendly price point. If you're looking for comfort, stability, and great sound in workout earbuds, I highly recommend checking these out. They will not disappoint!",
