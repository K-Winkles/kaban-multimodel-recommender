The problem though is they are both absolutely Deaf when they push the play button. Volume has to be at Max all the time or \u201cI can\u2019t hear it\u201d in the most innocent, yet whiney voice is heard repeatedly like a broken record.I bought these headphones because they are offered at a great price and seemed to be of decent quality. With this being a multi-pack, I figured if the kids break one, I\u2019ll have a backup.These things are GREAT. Sound quality is okay but the noise cancelling is solid for what you get and it actually gave my wife and I a bit of peace and quiet. Worth every penny. Kids have had the same set for a few months now without issues. Weekly use, they been tossed around, stepped on, tug of war with the cord once, carried onto an airplane and they\u2019re still working perfectly. I still have 4 brand new pairs for if/when one of them breaks but that may be a while because these are going strong.",

Earbuds from a discount store are so cheaply made, that they stop working in a few days, even for a careful adult. I came across this brand while looking for school grade headphones. I was shocked to find them in 5 packs, in beautiful colors besides just black. They sound amazing,so much that I bought two boxes of them. They fold for storage, are well made, and outlast the cheap headphones, and the more expensive headphones I've bought my children. I kept a pair for myself to use at my desk because they are so comfortable. I've got this brand bookmarked, because I've been so pleased with them. Can't recommend them enough!",

Others are usually AT LEAST 10 but more like 15 or 20 and higher. They have good sound quality, are comfy and seem pretty sturdy! I donated 2 sets to my children's school and gave each of my kids a pair. So far no issues, months in! In fact I am back again to buy a 2nd set given the quality and price! Love the colors too. Give these a go even if you only need 1 or 2 pairs, you'll have extras and won't need to buy any new ones anytime soon!",

I love that they are kids size but not limited on volume like most headphones advertised for kids. I wish they were a little more noise canceling but overall happy with the purchase. As for size, the fit slightly big bit manageable on my 2 year old and also fit my 8 year old just fine too. I can wear them myself as well since they adjust.",

I ended up buying more because the kids really like them. No complaints about fit or comfort and they fold up nicely. They're still going strong after a semester of daily use from a bunch of 5-year-olds. I've recommended them to colleagues who have also had success. Great headphones for the price.",
