I get overwhelmed by noise especially at stores, so I frequently wear them while they're off, just to muffle the noise. I will say they are sound dampening, not fully 100% noise cancelation. Which is perfect for me, if someone is speaking directly to me I can hear them, but I can't hear the screaming child 3 isles down. I will admit I'm not a huge sound nerd, but these are defently the best quality headphones I've owned. That's not saying a ton, but I mainly listen to music and I can understand the lyrics much better than any other headphones I've had. They're also super comfy. My scalp is sensitive to headphone bands pulling and these don't do that at all. The ear cups are also nicely padded, both for comfort and also my ears don't rub against the inside",

                "reviewText": "Ok when I bought these I got them because they had certain things I wanted such as Bluetooth, battery life, these say they are noise cancelling headphones but idk how that works. I found when I gave it a full charge after I had misplaced these for a month they lasted me for a few more days of heavy use the first few days I used it I spent most of the time downloading music to my phone. I can tell you that they have pretty good sound for the price. There is no equalizer or even a bass button on it, just power on and volume + and volume- and then there is a little o button that I thought was just for answering calls but it does something that I should have mentioned in my first review because then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have came back and wrote another add on to that same review. Because in the month that I misplaced my headphones I threw away the empty box with the instructions in it. So I lost how I was able to pair these to my phone so easy. If you lose the directions or you can\u2019t pair them to your phone the 2nd picture where my finger is pointing at the o button, that\u2019s the button you use to pair your headphones to whatever you want to use them on.I felt so stupid when I threw my instruction book away because it tells you that in the book. It is easy to pair these with your electronics.My complaints are still I wish the buttons were knobs because they are so small an old blind lady like me can barely see them without my glasses. I like that they fit snug with the cold weather they keep my ears warm when I\u2019m walking my dog.These headphones have the capability to be used to answer your phone they have a built in microphone and you just push that little circle button to answer. I\u2019ve never used them to talk because I am a texter but I wished they had these when I was working because as a boss I always needed my phone and it was always ringing and I did have to talk but I\u2019m retired now.So I take back my previous reviews and I would recommend these to people on a bit of a budget looking for headphones that have pretty good sound and a decent battery life. Also it doesn\u2019t take long for them to charge either which is another plus in my book.",
