                "reviewText": "There are a lot of low-cost sleep headphones on the market, but I gravitated toward this one because it's one of the few where you can remove the inner electronics to wash the headband. The material is reminiscent of yoga pants, very soft and very stretchy and a better quality than I was expecting for the cost. Some reviews on other sleep headphones mentioned dye leaching into their pillows so I ordered the light grey just as a precaution and have not noticed any dye leaching.The sound quality and volume are mediocre for headphone standards, with a lot of treble and not much bass even when using an equalizer app. I have a beanie hat with built in headphones that's a few years old from a different seller, and a few cheap pairs of ear buds; the headphones on this sleep band are ten times better than those, however. So, sound quality is mediocre compared to other headphones, but extraordinary compared to other headphones at this price point, for this use.The volume on these is perfect. They don't get extremely loud and wouldn't be good to wear if you're looking to block out loud background noise (while mowing the lawn, a sleeping partner that sounds like someone is mowing the lawn, etc) but they are perfect for 'normal' sleep environment. I've used this during a thunderstorm and with a loud fan going and can still hear just fine.So far the battery life has exceeded my expectations. I've listened to a 1-3 hour long sleep meditation track every night since purchasing these, and it seems to take up maybe 10% of the battery for a 1-3 hour track followed by being on but not actively playing anything for 6-10 hours after that. I don't like to let the battery get too low on my electronics, so for me one full charge per week covers all my sleep needs. If I was listening to music for the entire night and the headphones were actively playing something for the entire time, that may be different, but I'm extremely grateful to not have to charge every single night.There is a little square on the forehead with play/pause and +/- controls that I thought would be uncomfortable, but I don't even feel it- even when sleeping on my stomach with my face mostly pressed into the pillow. There are small disks where the headphones are embedded in the headband that you can feel if you press into the material with your fingers, but sleeping on my side with all my weight pressed onto my ear I still can't feel the disks in the headband. These are EXTREMELY comfortable, much more than I was expecting.Every night I wake up and the headband is laying on the bed somewhere, likely slipped off from me tossing and turning in my sleep, but it has never been an issue. I use this to fall asleep and don't expect it to stay on while I'm asleep. The fit isn't too tight or too loose, I just thrash a lot during the night. Even if I accidentally roll on top of it in my sleep, I don't feel it and so far there's been no damage to the unit.Overall, for the price, I am truly astounded at the quality. I paid full price for this product, I was not asked to leave a review, I am writing this because I genuinely love these sleep headphones. They've exceeded my every expectation. If anything changes I'll update my review but for now I'm in love.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable for pierced ears, but with some caveats mentioned by others",
                "reviewText": "I bought this for my wife who listens to ASMR videos to help ease her into sleep. She has lots of piercings (standard lobe, forward helix, daith, tragus, various other helices, etc.) in both ears that prevent her from being able to use your every-day, run-of-the-mill ear buds or typical on-ear headphones. As such, she'd been using an oversized pair of over-ear headphones to prevent any pressure spots or pain on the piercings. As you might imagine, over-ear headphones aren't conducive to side-sleeping. On top of that, her old headphones (Audio Technica) only have a 3.5mm audio plug, and a recent phone upgrade has left her without a headphone jack. These have very capable and easy-to-use Bluetooth functionality for wireless listening. That said, they do come with a USB-to-3.5mm adapter in case you can't or don't want to use Bluetooth.I searched for \"sleeping headphones\" and came up with this style. Not really knowing if they'd work for her, I opted to try this brand because the price point wasn't premier and the reviews were okay.The short review: These headphones function for their purpose: comfortable nighttime/in-bed wear, but not without their shortcomings (see below for details).The longer review:Comfort: They're very comfortable to sleep in, even as a side sleeper. My wife has had ZERO complaints about pressure or pain on any of her pierces and still randomly remarks about how she's glad I found these for her. The actual ear pieces/audio devices are very low profile so as to not have too much bulk. They're comfortable enough for her to sleep in all night. Some other reviews remark how they're \"too loose\" for small heads. My wife has a slightly-smaller-than-average head, and she has mentioned that the headband is a little loose, but still snug enough to stay in place.Quality: The device seems to hold a charge pretty well right now. She's used the headphones nightly since I purchased them just over two weeks ago, and she's only had to recharge them three times. Mind you, she most often falls asleep with them still on, but her YT videos will eventually turn off. I'm estimating she actively uses them anywhere from one to three hours per night. The headband material seems to be sturdy, but time will tell how long/well the elasticity will hold up. My wife insists that the sound is \"awesome\", even drawing comparisons to her Audio Technica over-ears. These are by no means noise cancelling, but they do seem to dampen/deaden outside ambient noise.Complaints: The control panel sits in a pocket sandwiched between the layers right up front on the forehead (my wife says it makes her feel like Marvel's Vision). Unfortunately, the stitching allows the mechanism to move out of the pocket which renders the button indicators on the front of the headband useless until it gets moved back into place. Another complaint about the control panel is that it has On/Off and Track Skip functionality, but no internal volume control (i.e. she has to reach out and adjust the volume on her phone). The lack of this feature, however, truly seems indicative of the price-point versus oversight. Finally, the last current complaint she has is about the positioning of the earpieces. There is little movement from their stitched pockets to allow for precision adjustment to conform to her ear positions. They're \"close enough\" to a proper position for this to be a minor complaint, but I could see this being problematic for certain people.Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with this sub-$20 purchase. I'll revise or edit this review as is necessary based on how well they hold up.Edit: These headphones stopped functioning after about 12 months of use. It was the small battery pack that finally gave up the ghost. The elastic and material held up just fine, as did the earpieces and main control. I had considered seeking out a replacement battery pack to solder into it, but we instead purchased another brand which did actually illustrate another shortcoming of this particular product: the power connector. Our phones and most of our modern USB-connected devices use USB-C as the standard connector. This product, at least at the time of the original review in 2020, only uses a micro-USB connector which means the cable needs to be swapped out for charging between charging a phone or this device. It's certainly a minor inconvenience, but it's definitely a notable one.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This sleep band is great. First off, it\u2019s insanely comfortable. The material is really soft and it fits snug but isn\u2019t tight to the point where it\u2019s uncomfortable. There are speakers right where my ears are so the sound is great but also, they lay perfectly so they aren\u2019t bothersome. The volume levels are good and they do a great job of blocking out any outside noise. I also wear these when I\u2019m cleaning the house, for working out, running, running errands, or even just around the house to block out the noise of my 2 high energy boys! The controls are great and easy to use. You can also take phone calls on the headband. I can hear great when on a call and the person on the other line can hear me perfectly as well. This headband is perfect for sleeping and so much more. The instructions are clear and detailed and it was super easy to connect them and to use them. Worth every penny, you\u2019ll get lots of use out of this product!",

I can't say yet how they are to wash. I turn them on while wearing, but tend to set the volume using my phone. I haven't had any problems with the volume of the 'voice' that tells you it's powering on or off (she has a pleasant British accent). I have a small head and I find them very comfortable, but can't say how they stay on while active, because I use them to listen to relaxing music at bedtime. The earphone bits are round and have foam, they aren't fixed so you can move them to match up with your ears. I can put my head on the pillow with them on. The stitching is zigzag, not straight like the picture, but I don't care it may even be stronger? The sound seems good to me, the quality is good. All in all hard to go wrong for the price.",
