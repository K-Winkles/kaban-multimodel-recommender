They are the best earbuds I have ever owned, and I have tried many over the years. They fit my ears perfectly, and they are very comfortable to wear. They have a long battery life, and they come with a wireless charging case that has a LED power display. They are also IPX5 waterproof, which means they can withstand sweat and rain. I can use them for various activities, such as jogging, watching TV, working on my computer, or listening to music on my phone. They connect to my android device easily, and they have a clear sound quality and a built-in microphone.

                "reviewText": "Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer\u2026 never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to \u201cclick on a review\u201d for a discount or whatever. No\u2026 the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I\u2019m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what \u201cguts\u201d that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex\u2026 nor expensive. How company\u2019s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I\u2019ve tried those \u201cRolls Royce\u201d buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman\u2019s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I\u2019ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company\u2019s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it\u2019s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY\u2026 yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham \u201clifetime warranties\u201d, that corrupt company\u2019s like Hammacher Schlemmer have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry\u2019s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good \u2018ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience. The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on\u2026 and they love them. And none of had any problems.I\u2019m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I\u2019ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It\u2019s rare\u2026 but it\u2019s out there!",

                "reviewText": "I got these at the same time I ordered some much higher quality earbuds. These shipped in a day. My other pair will arrive in a few weeks and I needed something in the meantime. I will be keeping them. I have mostly praise for these buds for the value but one major criticism, especially when it\u2019s something they\u2019re advertised for and so many reviews I\u2019ve read have given very high praise over: Sound quality.The positives first. These absolutely do the job and then some for the cost. They pair easily, the controls are intuitive and the battery life is fantastic. If I simply need something for simple listening or to make/receive a call with, I could see these being a go-to. They\u2019re comfortable and surprisingly loud with enough clarity that I can understand everything someone is saying without issue. If you need a pair of earbuds purely for productivity or making calls, I highly recommend these.Now for my main criticism. The sound quality is just plain muddy. Whether you\u2019re listening to music or watching a show or movie, if you are looking for even decent quality audio that you will find sufficiently pleasant and immersive, these are not what you\u2019re looking for.I will admit that I have absolutely spoiled myself in the audio department with sound equipment, and it would not be fair to compare these with the best-in-class or even mid-range audio equipment brands. I am only mentioning this because the manufacturer specifically touts them as great for listening to music and many reviews, including one of the top reviews with over 1000 people marking it as helpful, state that these have great sound quality for such purposes. I wholeheartedly disagree. You will get significantly better detail and soundstaging with moderately more expensive hardware, some even with the same $50 non-sale price. However, you will likely sacrifice the convenience and battery life these provide, so it has its use case.If you have never found yourself to be too picky with headphones or speakers to listen to music and are perfectly satisfied listening to your favorite songs over your laptop speakers, take what I say with a grain of salt. These may be perfect for you and a ridiculously good value. For everyone else, please look elsewhere if you\u2019re looking for a pair of earbuds for quality listening.",

Have to do some more looking around on how to use the touch aspect of them for I can touch to pause the music but sometimes it won\u2019t click back on so need to read more on how to properly do that. The quality of them are great the sound is amazing for the price and crystal clear. These ones don\u2019t cut in and out there there is another blue tooth device around like the skull candy ones I bought. So would defiantly buy again. The battery life is amazing and charges super quick and lasts a long time",

So far, I got the earbuds to connect with my cellphone; but unfortunately, I didn't find any luck in connecting it to my laptop and mp3 player. The sound quality of the earbuds are very good; despite the noise cancellation being adequate. When it comes to recharging the case (with the earbuds inside it); I would recommend getting a fast-charging adapter with a reasonable price online (orin store like Walmart) rather than buying those wireless charging pads. However, you can also use the USB-C cable given to connect the charging case to one of your USB ports in your laptop or desktop CPU to complete the job. I am glad that I bought these wireless earbuds during boxing day from last year; the pricing was reasonable for the value of the earbuds.",

                "reviewText": "I have used a lot of Bluetooth headsets and earbuds over the years. I have pretty happy with this set, but there are a few minor gripes to be aware of. I will start with the negatives then.The case is well built and the magnets that hold the buds in place are strong. This is great until you are trying to get the buds out of the case. It takes a bit of finger wrestling to leverage them out every time which isn't the end of the world, but definitely annoying. I use one bud on my daily dog walks so I am pulling them out three times a day.I also use the buds on public transit which can be very noisy. They do a poor job of isolating exterior noise from seeping in so I find I need to raise the volume more than I like. Perhaps I could use the larger nibs to force a tighter seal, but I find that uncomfortable for extended wear. Sound quality is good and music is highly enjoyable in quieter environments. It could be spun as a positive that outside noise isn't cancelled out, since you will hear cars and bikes around you as a pedestrian.My other gripe is interference. I have a Pixel phone which have notoriously bad Bluetooth stacks, but I haven't never had a pair of ear buds that experience as much interruption to other signals. It is especially bad in dense areas like downtown or malls. It never loses signal, but there are intermittent audio interruptions that completely ruin listening to music. I do listen to a lot of podcasts so there is less impact for those.I do love the extended battery life and how the case gives a three digit numeric value to the charge status. I have been charging the case less than once a week which is an improvement over all other buds I have tried. The buds themselves are a familiar stick style which seems to provide better phone voice quality when taking calls, though I prefer the nub style that doesn't hang down. They setup easily with my phone, though everything does these days. I do find they occasionally fail to auto pair out of the case, but a quick Bluetooth force connect has been reliable. I don't use the earbud controls with any regularity though occasionally I accidentally trigger the play mode as I am trying to extract them from the case.If you are looking for a feature rich budget value, these are definitely contenders. If the Bluetooth interference wasn't as bad and the buds were easier to extract from the case, I would lean towards a five star review.",
