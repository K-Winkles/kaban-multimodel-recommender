                "reviewText": "REAL PERSON REVIEW! For the price, these headphones are absolutely perfect and exactly what I was looking for. The sound quality is outstanding and they are so comfortable! I bought and returned a few pairs of over ear headphones before I decided on these ones. The ones I tried before always ended up hurting my ears if i would wear them for a few hours and then take them off, so I can clearly remember the moment when after a few hours of wearing these headphones, I took them off and I thought to myself \u201cwow, these don\u2019t hurt me at all!\u201dI gave 5 stars because 4.5 wasn\u2019t an option, but 4.5 is my true rating because the only complaint I have for these headphones is the noise canceling feature. It does a fantastic job for straight white noise which is nice, but it doesn\u2019t do really anything in the way of canceling out voices or anything like that. That being said, the sound quality is absolutely fantastic, so if I need to block out all sound I can still easily do that by playing music, a book, or white noise. I\u2019m very impressed with the sound quality.I also love the design of the headphone. They are not bulky at all and are easily compactable. They even come with a cute carrying pouch so the headphones won\u2019t get dirty in your bag. Also, the battery life is additionally pretty nice. I prefer headphones with longer lasting batteries because i usually forget to charge them, so these have been perfect for me. They last a super long time and don\u2019t take all that long to charge either!If you are still reading this review and have gotten all the way to this point, I say buy the headphones. They are honestly worth it. Also i change my rating to a 4.8, lol. Get them!! you won\u2019t regret it.",

                "reviewText": "Since I live in an apartment, I use over ear Bluetooth noise canceling headphones to watch TV or listen to music on a daily basis. I have a Sony 1000-XM2 that I love an MPow M5 and Soundcore Q20. The Sonys are my gold standard for sound quality, but both the MPOW and Soundcore were exceptional as well.The MPow M5 finally started to physically break after 4+ years of years of near daily use, so I purchased these to replace them.I selected these because they were the among the highest rated and most purchased over ear noise canceling blue tooth headphones under $40.I received my headphones in about a couple days. The box contained the headphones, a carrying bag, and cables. The build quality of the headset feels good, but not premium. The construction is mostly mat plastic with metal hinges and of course a metal leaf spring in the headband. ANC is controlled with a sliding switch behind the left ear while on/off, volume, skipping, pausing and pairing are controlled with three plastic push-buttons behind the right ear.When you press the buttons you hear/ feel a mechanical click that I am guessing is designed to be hepatic feedback and less intrusive than audible beeps in the headphones. Primary function of the buttons are volume and on/off. Holding the volume buttons for a couple of seconds will allow you to skip forward or back. The center (on/off) button, also allows you to pause and when held for about five seconds will put the headphones in pairing mode. As the noise canceling is on a separate slider, you\u2019ll need to remember to turn this off when you power down the headset or you might drain the battery. All controls seem to me to be very intuitive and standard.Sound quality is really good for the price. These is some punch in the bass but it isn\u2019t overpowering. Mids and highs are clear. At the highest volumes the sound gets a tad muddy, but why would you crank the volume if you have noise cancelation? The sound quality is very good overall and exceptional at the price, on par with MPOW but maybe not quite as good as Soundcore Q20s. I imagine these are best suited for TV, movies, rock and blues music. Though if you like boomy bass or just super heavy bass, you might find the headphones weak in that regard.Noise canceling operates as a single mode without a bypass/ ambient sound feature which is expected at this price point. Noise canceling is at least reasonably good for this price point. Low frequency noise can\u2019t be heard, but, mid-to-high frequencies are not affected much. The sonic profile does change slightly with noise canceling on. It\u2019s hard for me to tell exactly what happens, but I think the mids drop slightly and I get an even more v-shaped sonic profile. In any case, it is a pleasing effect. Overall, noise canceling is what one can expect at this price point. If you need more mid to high frequency noise reduction, I\u2019d recommend just getting a pair of Sony MX\u2019s.Range is good. I can go anywhere in my apartment or even outside nearby with no loss of sound quality. Again, at this price point, I think this is expectedly good.The headphones have a \u201cC\u201d profile that sits a bit off the side of my head. I have a small to medium sized head, and I find these very comfortable, perhaps the most comfortable pair that I have every tried. The headset feels reasonable light and my ears don\u2019t get hot with extended use.Overall I give this set extremely high marks for sound quality and comfort which are the two most important aspects of such headphones. Build quality, noise cancellation are expectedly good, and I see no major detractions, so I am giving this set five stars",

                "reviewText": "I wanted simple headphones that wasn\u2019t gonna be expensive, still sound decent & I can use at the gym. I have a gym at my apartment so that\u2019s what I use and I\u2019ve been going when it\u2019s just me so take my review with that in mind (aka not sure how this holds in noisy environments).For about $40 (I believe) it\u2019s been great. Comes with a pouch, while the headphones is mostly plastic, the earmuffs are super soft! I have small ears & multiple piercings and it does not bother them at all. Sound quality is not going to be top tier. I had AirPod pros before this and the sound difference is night and day- however, over the course of a week I would say I do not mind the sound quality. It\u2019s what you expect from something that\u2019s about $40. Again, I had no high expectations as I wanted something for the gym. There\u2019s a button switch for ANC or not but I kind of found there\u2019s minimal to no difference between the two, sometimes I\u2019m not even sure if I have it on or not. Sound does leak so be aware!I do sweat a lot and I\u2019m not sure if the earmuffs are sweat proof so I make sure to wipe it after use and air dry. They\u2019re pretty much secure but I had to adjust once\u2019s or twice while doing a HIIT workout on the treadmill and would fall when doing core work outs.I have been on FaceTime with these on, walking on the treadmill, and the other person said they could hear the treadmill but I was very very clear. Could definitely hear me with no problems!Honestly for what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s cheap and does the job for me. They do look cute as well! Rating it 4 stars I do wish the sound quality was a \u201ctad\u201d bit better but for $40 it\u2019s still good!",

                "reviewText": "I just connected these headphones to my computer via bluetooth to listen for some music and instantly remembered that I never left any review on them. After 2 years of active use, i think these Infurture headphones deserve a positive review.What can I say, great great great headphones, I bought this item in July 2021 and soon it will be 2 years since I use them almost all the time. The sound is amazing, rich and clear. Good highs, relatively deep bass, clear mids. It plays all frequencies from 70hz to 15khz, i guess. The only downside to consider - it has very weak(bad) microphone, people almost never hear you adequately. I use these headphones almost 100 percent of the time on bluetooth. Huge battery life, I almost never charge it and the headphones stays charged for weeks. I don't remember them running out of power at all.In general, I highly advise it, in terms of sound they are similar to more expensive models from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, but cost around 50 bucks. Use them carefully and you won't have any problems with them. Very soft ear cushions, comfortable to wear for a long time. Headphones never broke, ripped or had any problems with bluetooth connection. As for noise cancellation, it's kinda weak here, but I hardly ever use them outdoors or in noisy places. Take it, you won't regret, 100%.",

                "reviewText": "Scrivo questa recensione dopo 4 anni che uso ININTERROTTAMENTE queste cuffie (e nel frattempo ho acquistato altri due paia di modelli; uno come regalo - graditissimo - e l'altro come sostituto, ancora intatto nel pacco perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8 ancora stato bisogno di usarlo fino ad oggi, ma solo perch\u00e9 il mio PC sta avendo problemi con il bluetooth, le cuffie funzionano ancora perfettamente).Non ho mai avuto un dispositivo di questo tipo cos\u00ec durevole nel tempo. Dopo un anno e mezzo o due (ripeto, di quasi ininterrotto uso di circa 10 ore giornaliere) ho riscontrato qualche difetto con l'ingresso jack - cose snervanti che purtroppo capitano - , ma il bluetooth funziona impeccabilmente ed \u00e8 comodissimo.La qualit\u00e0 audio \u00e8 molto buona, ottima per il gaming, per i prodotti cinematografici e, soprattutto, per i melomani come me che ascoltano musica di generi diversi, sempre e comunque; ottime per chi in particolare ama ascoltare musica classica, corale (cori valorizzatissimi), varie sfumature di metal, di rock, pop rock, e tutti i generi che spaziano dal blues al jazz allo swing; l'unico fastidio che eventualmente si pu\u00f2 avvertire \u00e8 con alcuni tipi di generi della musica elettronica (o ibrida - mi \u00e8 capitato anche ascoltando i Muse), soprattutto alcuni brani contemporanei che hanno ottimi arrangiamenti, ma spingono gi\u00e0 di loro su dei bassi piuttosto \"prepotenti\", e si ha una vibrazione leggermente eccessiva (per intenderci, un po' la sensazione di frittura delle orecchie) anche a volume basso. Si tratta di casi sporadici, ad ogni modo, che attribuirei pi\u00f9 alla concezione di certi brani in s\u00e8 ed effetti concepiti per funzionare in un certo modo all'udito, pi\u00f9 che al dispositivo di riproduzione. L'annullamento del rumore non \u00e8 eccellente, ma comunque molto efficace.Sono inoltre estremamente, estremamente comode.Le amo follemente. Se avete un amico melomane o videogiocatore, sono veramente un ottimo regalo; ripeto, soprattutto durevole nel tempo. Che non \u00e8 assolutamente scontato.",

                "reviewText": "Quando recensisco un paio di cuffie faccio sempre due premesse: da audiofilo ed ex-musicista, per semplice passione provo tante cuffie (ATH-M50, Bose AE2, varie JBL, Sennheiser, Soundcore) Seconda premessa: le acquisto di tasca mia, niente prodotti in regalo da recensire (spesso fasullamente). Detto ci\u00f2, parto subito col dire la mia necessit\u00e0. Avevo bisogno di un paio di cuffie over-ear con ANC, economiche ma discrete da utilizzare prettamente fuori casa (principalmente palestra, tragitti medi a piedi, treni e viaggi intercontinentali) per cui volevo un paio di cuffie non costose, allo stesso tempo non troppo cheap ne ingombranti. Dopo varie recensioni in rete, ho deciso di dare fiducia a queste INFURTURE e devo dire di esserne rimasto positivamente sorpreso. Nel loro range di prezzo, e forse pure qualcosa in pi\u00f9, le reputo le migliori per rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo. Esteticamente gradevoli (io le ho prese argento ma le avrei preferite di un semplice bianco), di dimensioni contenute, leggere ma soprattutto comode. Qualit\u00e0 costruttiva nella media, cuscinetti in memory-foam di buona fattura (vedremo nel lungo termine...). Resa sonora buona, pulita, tendente ad enfatizzare un p\u00f2 troppo i medi. L'ANC non \u00e8 affatto male (quello delle Soundcore Q30 \u00e8 di un altro pianeta) anche se ovatta e distorce di un (bel) p\u00f2 il suono e riduce la durata della batteria. Manca un'app e un equalizzatore, la confezione \u00e8 molto minimal (troppo?). Non \u00e8 inclusa una cover rigida ma solo un sacchettino. Pratico si, ma morbido che quindi non protegge le cuffie se le mettete in uno zaino o valigia.Per il resto null'altro di negativo da segnalare. Pagate 39,99\u20ac. Non avevo grosse aspettative ma a questo prezzo e con queste prestazioni direi che me le tengo strette.",
