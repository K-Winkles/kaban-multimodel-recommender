                "reviewText": "Noise Cancelling - 5 stars: My son can often not even hear me when I talk to him, which is very frustrating. I have to check the volume at which he is listening to his music to make sure that it's not too loud.Sound Quality - 5 stars: When I check the volume he's listening at, the sound quality is really good. not as good as my Bose, but impressively good for inexpensive headphones.Volume Control -5 stars: I gave this 5 stars because it's easy to control, though my son uses his phone to control the volume.ALL THAT SAID - I still only gave these headphones 4 stars. WHY? They fit really big, very loose and there is no way to adjust them. You can adjust it up and down, however, it's almost like when they designed it, their model head was super wide/ huge. The width from ear to ear is really big, making the headphones fit very loosely and they tend to slide off when you move your head around.Because of that, I wouldn't buy them again. Even though these have been the best \"Noise-canceling\" in this price range, we've come across.",

The volume control does not work but that didn't bother me. I would recommend if you are looking for something cheap that gets the jobs done. This is a good choice.",
