They were delivered on-time and come in beautiful packaging that is very thoughtfully designed and demonstrated.Even the video promo reviews that have been posted on their product page don't describe how delightful these earbuds really are, so let me take a few minutes and tell you why these earbuds deliver INCREDIBLE \"Bang for YOUR Buck\"!1. Exceptionally simple and clear instructions on product usage (translation errors forgiven). \ud83d\ude092. Thoughtful, attractive and complete product design, labeling and packaging.3. World class stereo \"HI-FI\" sound and tonal quality with such a powerful bass response you'll swear you're in a movie theater featuring DOLBY Atmos.4. Excellent Bluetooth reception when using it's phone call features; even from 30+ feet away with no loss of call/conversation clarity.5. Full voice assistant capabilities for BOTH Android and Apple devices, even though the instruction manual/booklet doesn't explicitly state that.6. Earpiece gives helpful and discrete voice prompts and alerts for it's status while in use and offers virtual Caller ID functionality.7. Earpieces can be used singly, or together, with each one still retaining full functionality.8. Over-the-ear hook is incredibly comfortable EVEN if one wears glasses. No acclimation period needed!9. Earpieces fit so comfortably and securely in place over your ear(s) that you may not feel like you're even wearing one/them, despite engaging in intense physical activity!10. Full Lifetime (Worry/Hassle/Return Free) Warranty!! Although, I can't imagine ever giving up THESE \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udc8e for another brand.However, if there was any one thing that I would question about these earbuds, it would be the apparent lack of \"Mute\" capability as I don't see that functionality listed in the manual. Nevertheless, that is NOT a hindrance for me as these wireless earpieces seem to be so excellent with everything else they do I can live happily without that feature and enjoy their overwhelming value and user-friendliness. \ud83d\ude42\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I was expecting that I would just get what I paid for. Let me tell you that the value is far superior to what I paid! Worth noting, I use headphones/earbuds for work and recreation, and I am a headphone/earbud junkie! The fit on these, as well as the sound, is pretty darn good! I have several pairs of Bose and Apple AirPods which are each great in their own way. But, the fact that these earbuds actually stay in, the music has bass, and the controls are simple is enough for me to highly recommend them and these are a fraction of the cost of the other two brands I mentioned!",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for relatively cheap and reliable bluetooth headphones, I think these will fit that requirement. I didn't have much expectation going in especially since they're really cheap on sale, but as my first pair of headphones these were exactly what I was going for. They fit fine on my ear and the audio quality is good. I also like the button layout once I learned the controls. The different sized spread of earbuds they give you were really nice, I used the smallest pair and it felt pretty good in my ear. I normally don't like stuff in my ears, but these didn't bug me all. The battery life on them is good for a whole day at least and the charging case has a bigger battery than I expected. I fully charged the case when I got it, and have used a single earbud all day on 7 separate occasions and the battery on the case has only dropped down to 81% without charging it at all. These headphones and case definitely exceeded my expectations!",

                "reviewText": "This is a strange market. There are dozens of different brands of wireless earbuds in this price range that all look surprisingly similar. I purchased a set prior to this one that had horrible audio quality. Horrible on both music and audio books. Yet the reviews were nearly all 5 star. And there were a lot of reviews.Luckily on my next purchase I landed on this set of wireless earbuds. The audio quality is absolutely perfect. I compared the sound quality to the internal speaker of my iPhone 15; a pair of legacy style hard wired earbuds; and a pair of wired Bluetooth earbuds that I am very fond of. There was no difference in quality. Just excellent.Functionally these are great. They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in the case. The whole concept of charging from the battery within the case is brilliant. I wish I had thought of that.The nit I have to pick is with how they have implemented the functionality of the plus and minus buttons. I'm used to a quick push on the plus button to raise the volume a tiny amount and a quick push on the minus button to lower the volume a tiny amount. Then a long push on either button to advance or rewind a set amount. What happens here is a short push does the advance/rewind and a long push is required to change volume. I am finding it almost impossible to change the volume a small amount.Your mileage may vary.",
