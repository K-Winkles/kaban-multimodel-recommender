Not too overblown with bass, not tinny or fuzzy like other brands, even ones that are double or triple the price. The cord is flexible and hard to break or make unusable with bending. Even in the age of bluetooth everything, having some good, inexpensive aux earbuds and a dongle is a must.",

                "reviewText": "These used to be really good earbuds! I remember buying them at Walmart some time ago and them being able to last for over a year easily. I once had a pair that I lost right before a big snowfall, apparently, they had fallen out of my pocket while I was walking onto the bus for school, months later after the ice had melted, I found them on the sidewalk, I picked them up, brought them inside, cleaned em up a bit, and to my surprise, they still worked! I didn't keep them for much longer, I ended up buying a new pair, but that's a testament to how good they once were. Now, they seem to not last as long. I've bought multiple pairs from Amazon and Target and they've all fallen apart on me, either it was the chord that stopped working, or a piece of the earbud fell off, whatever the reason was, I no longer see these as a decent quality set of earbuds. For that reason, I'd say, be careful, understand that they're a $10 pair of earbuds. I no longer wear traditional earbuds, I now use wireless ones because I find more and more that the chords on a lot of earbuds are cheaply made and end up breaking, however, these will do the job if you just want a cheap pair of headphones.",
