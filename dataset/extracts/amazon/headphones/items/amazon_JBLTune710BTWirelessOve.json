                "reviewText": "#1- I'm not an audiophile but these headphones were so much better than others I've used that I had to leave a positive review. I've never used any of the premium headphones so this review is based on comparing them to the ~$50 generic ones you'll see all over Amazon. I got these on a Black Friday sale, so basically same price as the generic entry level that I usually go to. At the same price level these are a no-brainer, but even at the normal price difference I would say these are worth it. The sound quality is night and day difference better on these. They (BT) connected immediately and stayed connected to my iPhone 14 with no issues, and I'm noting this because sometimes I've had connectivity problems with cheaper BT devices. I have an average size head and bigger ears and the over the ear muffs on these headphones fit my head perfectly and they are comfortable to wear for hours. Others I have tried the muff tends to run small and doesn't cover my entire ear very well, but again these are perfect for my head type. I can't speak to battery life, but out of the box I wore them about 3 hours and battery life was fine. That's about as long as I'm ever going to wear headphones in one sitting so the battery life/ comfort was fine for me. I didn't use the NC feature yet so can't comment on that. The over-ear seal was very good and seemed to do a great job of blocking outside noise. Have yet to use them as hearing protection from loud noise (i.e.- mowers, etc.), which will be a primary use of these, but based on how well they block out normal background noise I am sure they will do a great job of that too. If you're looking for a mid-level set of headphone to block out some noise, be comfortable, and play some tunes while you get some tasks done then I highly recommend these headphones from JBL.",

My absolutely favorite thing about these is the battery lasts a long time!! Daily use I probably charge them once maybe twice a month. The battery is great. They are also really comfortable and do not fall off or slip off. After a couple hours of having them off they do get a bit uncomfortable but hey that's normal after hours of having them on. They are simple to use with only 4 buttons: power button, volume up/next video, volume down/return to the video before, and the play/pause. The sound is pretty good, a bit more than average, the sound really locks in. I bought these in late 2022 and am writing this review in 2024, these headphones are amazing. I've had no problems with them so far. I'll definitely be getting more in the future.",

                "reviewText": "SOUND QUALITY: GOOD TO PASSABLE AUDIO, BAD MICROPHONE, NO MEANINGFUL NOISE CANCELINGI can't comment intelligently on the audio quality, but I can say it's much better than $35-and-under in-ear buds I've tried. It's passably clear in both modes and doesn't sound obviously crunchy/tin can-like, that's all I know how to listen for. No perceptible difference in quality between wired and wireless modes, even, but people with better ears might think differently.Can't say the same about the microphone, which I tested with an alt account in a Discord call and believe is the small hole on the right cup. It sounds about as bad as any other Bluetooth microphone with the disadvantage of being so far from my mouth & throat it struggles to pick up my deep (by female standards) mumbly voice without dropping several syllables. I'm not that bummed since I bought these to walk, not call, but if \"has a mic\" is in your pros for these and you're not intending to speak a little louder than conversationally, remove it.If you're looking for proper noise canceling, these aren't it.CONSTRUCTION: BIG HEADS BEWARE, STIFF ADJUSTMENT, LIMITED PADDING, TOLERABLEThe wire is pretty good. I go through cords like nobody's business because I'm inattentive and tend to warp and bend them, but the aux cord this thing comes with a very pleasant \"obtuse angle\" . Maybe that's standard.They're small and pretty stiff (this might be because they're new, however). While this works to my benefit (small to average sized female cranium, needed something relatively portable, don't feel like a total tool wearing them in public) I wouldn't recommend buying this if you have a big head and/or big ears. The cups BARELY fit over mine, and they only started doing so after they became so painful I had to make a concerted effort to push the top of my lobe into the top of the pad so they'd fit.The adjustable headband is pretty standard - a downgrade from the Steelseries elastic I'm accustomed to, but definitely not the worst I've ever rested atop my head. The padding is thin, but a couple notches down the adjustment eliminated the scalp ache I was starting to develop after a couple hours of continuous use. Aforementioned snugness around the ears aside (which I personally somewhat appreciate) I barely notice they're resting on my head.CONTROLS: ...They're Bluetooth headphone controls. At the very least I can tell what I'm pressing by feel (sort of).That means I didn't find them very intuitive beyond the very basics of increasing volume and had to consult the manual during testing, but it's a helpful visual guide type manual. Definitely won't be committing it to memory since I prefer to use my phone's buttons though.",

As far as comfort of the over-the-ear headphones go, it\u2019s snug and good for the most part- 9/10. It\u2019s adjustability to fit your head size is fantastic- 10/10. It\u2019s ability to fold up for travel convenience is pretty good- 7/10. It\u2019s battery life and charge speed is impeccable! - 10/10. It\u2019s overall controls on the side are okay - 6/10. Volume is solid - 9/10.",

JBL were much clearer and more music depth than Beats and AirPods. Love the noise reduction, not noise cancelling. Battery life is longer than the other two as well. Very happy with purchase.",

De igual manera si tienes el volumen al 100% con musica muy estruendosa, una persona junto a ti puede escuchar levemente la m\u00fasica.
