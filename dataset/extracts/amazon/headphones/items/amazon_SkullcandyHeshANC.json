I was able to walk roughly 30 feet/10m from the source with no issues. You DO notice the lack of noise cancellation when its plugged in, but fortunately, at least for my ears, the headphones fit very well so it still did a decent job of blocking outside noise.",

Super noise cancelling- can't hear the printer next to me with these on! - and they're comfortable to wear. I do wish they would get a little tighter since I have a small head, but they fit nicely and I can wear these on the flight to Italy - they fold up into an easy-to carry little package and as mentioned, they don't weigh much at all. Very nice solution and way more comfortable than ear buds!",

No humming sound. The music on my iPhone is super loud. Wish it was louder on my new Samsung tv but maybe it\u2019s so I don\u2019t blow my ears out. I know they can get louder. Still amazing headphones for the price. They are super light, my ears fit in the ear cups. The color is cool. The battery life is real good. Cool purple light that comes on when you are using them. One button to turn the ANC off. Super short charging cable though. I would invest in a longer USB-c cable to charge them. No complaints with these. Buy them, one be disappointed for $100",

I was super excited and i\u2019m glad I got them. They are good quality, I love the color and the fit of it around my ears. The sound quality is also very clear and it can get suuuuuuuper loud. The only issue I have is that the audio leaks out of the headphones. Bad. Like, you can barely listen to your music at mid volume without everyone else listening to your music with you too, bad. I haven\u2019t seen many reviews talk about the audio leak so here\u2019s your warning. If that doesn't bother you too much, I would still totally recommend these headphones. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

                "reviewText": "Skullcandy has been my preferred brand for years. I always bought their wired earbuds. I've had other more expensive brand wireless headphones but these are by far my favorite!Pairing them to your phone is easy. The buttons for sound/ skipping tracks have a raised mark making them easy to identify. The power on/ of switch is smooth making that easily identifiable as well. The active noise cancelation is amazing along with sound quality.I did have an issue last year where they kept unpairing unexpectedly after a few seconds. I didn't want to give up on these and luckily I didn't. That issue has long been fixed by an android update. Now I'm converting all my family members to Skullcandy.As for the battery life, there are days I will wear these hours on end listening to music then torn them off. When I put them on again I'm usually at 70% battery life (on Android easy to see by looking at your connected Bluetooth devices). If I do run out of battery, a quick charge 10 minutes or more of I'm busy doing something and I'm right back at 100%.The cushions around the ears are comfortable although if you wear them for hours be prepared to sweat a little. The entire headset is adjustable too so as to accommodate different head sizes.Overall I highly recommend these! I don't think you'll find better quality sound in this price range. I forgot to mention I've had my first set of these for 3 years and counting now. They still work and charge seamlessly.",

The buttons don't lag and work perfectly as well. The noise cancellation is great, it doesn't block out everything alone but if you have music playing even at a very low volume you can't hear a thing.Saw a few reviews say it doesn't come with a bag when it does, along with a charging cord, and an aux chord for a wired option.",

                "reviewText": "I need these for work more than anything else since I need to concentrate on work and not be distracted. They fold up nicely and are easy to setup, connect and use right away. The verbal cues are on power on/off are a little loud for me but there isn't any question on when they turn on an off.The noise cancellation is a little low but acceptable. It doesn't cut out enough noise.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE MY HEADPHONES! These are FANTASTIC! I can still hear some things with the noise cancelling on, but it is definitely a lot quieter. Sound quality and comfort is fantastic. They are Bluetooth and connect really well, and they come with an aux connection if you'd rather do that. It doesn't seem like they do the noise cancelling when connected to aux though, but that's not a problem for me. They are pretty comfortable, they start to irritate me after about 3 hours, but that's pretty good because I am very sensitive. I also wear glasses and they work great with them. 100% recommend. Great product!",

Los utilizo en casa para ver pel\u00edculas, jugar a la PS4 escuchar m\u00fasica etc. y no hay ning\u00fan uso para el que no lo recomendar\u00eda.La cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido funciona muy bien, aunque obviamente no consigues un silencio perfecto. Particularmente \u00fatil cuando trabajo ya que actualmente tengo una obra al lado y elimina en un 90-95% el ruido de la maquinaria.Muy muy recomendables por su relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio.",
