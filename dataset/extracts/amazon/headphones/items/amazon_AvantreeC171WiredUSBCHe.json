                "reviewText": "I have had these Avantree E171 - Sports Earbuds Wired with Microphone for about 3 weeks now and I mainly use these on the treadmill when I run. I have found these to be more than adequate for that purpose. I previously bought Koss $6 headphones for the same purpose but I found those didn't last long enough before one of the earpieces would just go dead.With the Avantree, I can see that for the price, they are a little better made and the wiring is a little stronger. They don't seem flimsy at all, and the earbuds themselves and the portion that fits on your ears seem to be sturdy. They fit on my ears nicely enough with the loops and they do not bother me with or without glasses. They come with the middle size eartips attached, but I did find that when I run on the treadmill, they seemed to jump around a little, so I put on the larger ones. (The earbuds come with 3 sizes of eartips).The eartips are a little hard to get off and get the new ones on but you just need to grab the main part of the earbud and grab the base of the eartip and twist and pull a little to take it off, then work the new one on to the stem by working the opening of the eartip on the stem and pushing down and twisting a little. I have dexterity issues with my hands and I still got them on and off in about a minute.As far as the sound, these are not bass heavy at all, but that is fine (especially for the price) as the music I listen to doesn't have much bass (such as with rap and some rock), but I found there is enough bass where needed, and they provide a nice rich, melodic sound without being \"tinny\" at all.In addition, although they do not have built-in noise cancelling functionality, I find that with the larger eartips when I am on the treadmill in our community fitness room, I do not hear the lady that babbles on loudly and continuously :). Thank You Avantree!I have not tried these with a cell phone, so I can't speak to using with that. But, I have tried these on an iPod shuffle, an iPod touch and an iPad. The product listing here under \"Before You Buy, Please Note That...\" notes:\"The built-in volume control does not work on PC, laptop, or iOS MP3 players, and the volume up button does not work on the Pixel 3A and Galaxy A9, S10, and Note 9 (it'll activate Google Assistant instead).\"I will verify the in-cord volume control and the pause button does not work on the iPod shuffle, but I found they DO work on the iPod Touch and my iPad. Seems to be a bit of a bonus.Overall, I think they are worth the price and provide a set of nice sounding wired earbuds.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have purchased around-the-ear earbuds before. Some have a harder plastic piece for going around the ear, which hurts after a while of wearing them. This one has a silicone piece for around the ear. I can barely feel it when I am wearing them. Other brands that I have purchased that do have a silicone piece for around the ear, still have a hard plastic for the ear bud. That begins to hurt quite a bit after wearing them for a while. This pair features a silicone ear bud that goes into the ear as opposed to just resting on it. Finally, with it being jacked instead of Blue Tooth, I was expecting the sound to not be as loud because I have noticed that my Blue Tooth ear buds perform better than my jacked ones, but that is not the case with this pair. As my heading states, the sound quality is exceptional.",

It means that I'm not jerking them out of my ears as I work out, talk on the phone while I'm doing something else. I also love the clip for the microphone. I can turn volume up and down, I can rewind/fast forward something I'm listening to on the phone.I have a hybrid hip holster that is also fall protector of the phone lands on the floor or cement front porch deck. No breaks and I can work hands free knowing I won't break my phone not the little wired in these me headsets. Awesome setup.",

                "reviewText": "Sounds great if you push and hold them into your ear canal. The tips seem to be engineered for larger ear canals, so they don't stay inside all the way of you have smaller ear canals. You can still hear everything fine, but lose a lot of bass. Would be 5 stars if they came with different tips for different sizes. The cord is a bit short. Not excessively short, but 10 inches longer would be nice. The clips that hold onto your ears are comfy. The buds don't fall off no matter what. Just wish the tips stayed inside the ear canal fully for maximum bass sound.",

The option of having small sizes plus the over ear hooks work perfectly to ensure they don't fall out! Plus, the sound quality is much better than expected. I can't hear what she's listening to at all, and she can't hear me when she's got these in... I'm not sure if that's really a good thing actually. Just kidding, it's great. Affordable too. Glad I purchased.",
