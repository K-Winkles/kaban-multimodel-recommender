                "reviewText": "My wife and I listen to books almost exclusively and have for many years. Therefore, we use mp3 devices and headsets daily and I rather not spend too much on in-ear buds. These buds are low price, have a mic built in, a pause button, have a broad frequency spectrum (good sound) and are very durable. So I\u2019ve given them 5 stars especially as the cable rarely tangles (never), but\u2026 there is one definite. They are not so comfortable in the ear while lying on a pillow and we often listen to books in the night. Still, they\u2019re great for the price. I highly recommended them.",

The length is over 4 feet, which is plenty long enough. The plug is very secure, which I really appreciate. The sound quality is perfect and I find the ear buds comfortable and stable.

                "reviewText": "These are cheap, yes, but they are well made. The sound quality reminds me of $20 earbuds. The built in noise cancellation is phenomenal. Beyond all that, these earbuds are DURABLE! I stepped on one of the earpieces by accident the other day and it barely left a scratch on them. The earpiece still works beautifully. These are worth the money and then some.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased twice. The first set that I purchased one of the buds wasn't working and for some reason wasn't allowed to return the purchase. I was accused that I broke them since I purchased them at such a cheap price I wanted to give these earbuds another chance since the reviews others had given were good. Bought a second pair and the wire on the second pair looked like it was chewed by a mouse or something else and of course only one earbud worked. These earbuds suck and don't have any lasting power. Do not purchase these earbuds for price as they are not long lasting. Spend the extra three bucks and buy another brand that starts with an S and ends in y. This brand is so much better and it has a better lasting quality. Always stick to a brand that works and not because of price. Lesson learned. Don't buy cheap.",
