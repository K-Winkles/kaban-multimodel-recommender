As the alternative was somewhat loud in the house, I moved expeditiously to repair/replace the faulty unit. When she said she didn't like the earbuds anyway because they kept falling out, a light headphone set seemed indicated. We chose these, and she is very pleased with the upgrade. The sound is an better, the adjustable feature has yielded a better fit, they are more comfortable over her ears rather than in them, and they don't fall off. They are a simple plug in replacement for the earbuds. Best, Sounds of Silence have returned for the rest of us.",

We have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various children's movies and TV shows. They usually watch the same clip over and over and over. It gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously. They were using ear buds when watching their clips, but those broke before the holidays. After a week of no headphones, I decided to order these for them. I actually ordered 3 pairs, one for each of our classroom computers. These aren't super high quality headphones, but they are working great for our students. Yes, it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice, padded, over the ear earphones, but we don't. Since these were purchased with my own money, this was what was in my budget. I'm not sure I would order these for myself, but for the students, they do the job!",

The price is reasonable.They are not comfortable. much to small for adult heads, and the ends of the headband come out of the track and poke you in the ear or head. The foam pad would be adequate, if the size issue did not create a lot of force on the headphones, causing them to press pretty noticeably into your ears.probably good for kids or older people with small heads. I wear a size 7 hat, so mine is not large, cannot imagine anyone wearing a 7 1/4 or larger hat even getting these on at all.",

I got him a tablet to listen to music and it came with a cordless, over the ears headset which my grandson could absolutely not tolerate. I wanted to get him non restrictive, headphones to listen to his tablet quietly. I took a chance and purchased these. Things turned out well. They are lightweight, adjustable to accommodate his smaller size head and he can play with the cord contently, (which is part of his condition to have something between his fingers to manipulate repeatedly.) They resonate a clear crisp full stereo sound that apparently pleases my little one. I will say this has been a great buy.",

Just be aware that if you want headphones to wear on the bus or out jogging, these are NOT those headphones. You\u2019d go through a pair a month because the construction is a bit cheap. (And you\u2019d probably rate them one star and leave an outraged review.) I got what I paid for and they work exactly as I need them to.",
