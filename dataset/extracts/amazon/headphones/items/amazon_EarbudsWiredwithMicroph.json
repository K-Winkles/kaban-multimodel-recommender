I like that I can put either side in either ear for ease of use, or I can use them in the ears they are meant for if I want to. The shape fits well in either ear. They are a great size, not too big or small, and I like having several pairs for myself and my family. I like the color variety as well! Thanks for making such a wonderful and affordable product to make my life easier and happier!",

Very tinny with no richness to it.I only need them as backups in emergencies though.Guess you get what you pay for!",
