                "reviewText": "I honestly love these. They're really comfortable, the sound is clean, definitely worth the price. I like the braided cord, hoping it will help the headphones last longer. I took off a star because the ear pads were a bit smaller than I thought they'd be. It's not a problem for me since I'm only 5 feet tall but I wouldn't buy these for my partner who is 6 feet tall. Seems best suited for children and small adults. I saw another review that talked about how uncomfortable these were for them but I haven't had any discomfort and have been able to wear them for extended periods of time. However, as I mentioned, they are a bit on the smaller side and I could see how they may cause discomfort if the fit isn't right. I don't know that I'd go as far as to say that these are noise canceling headphones. They do muffle surrounding sounds and you can definitely turn up the volume to drown anything else out but they're not going to give you the same noise canceling as the more expensive headphone brands. Overall, I'm really happy with them and would recommend them to children, teens, and small adults.",

I use them in the evening so I don't disturb others in the room watching TV. The TV doesn't wash out what I am listening to thru the headphones. The cord is plenty long, and covered with a durable nylon. They are very comfortable and the plastic is soft and doesn't hurt my ears. Well worth the great price. I listen and watch tutorials mostly with them, but music sounds great too. Perfect for what I use them for.",

                "reviewText": "Disclosure: I did receive these at a discount (not free) to review them, but all thoughts and opinions and photographs are my own.I was immediately drawn to these because I knew my 9 year old daughter would LOVE the colors, and she does. She was so excited to get her own pair of over the ear headphones because she says that sometimes her ears get sore from using the ear buds that she has for school (which they need them to be buds because of space/storage issues) but not at home. She likes that they have very soft ear muffs and she likes that they have noise cancelling features so she can do her thing on her tablet without hearing her brother on his tablet (mom on the other hand has had to learn that she may not hear me if she is wearing them). It does have the ability to pause/play music or answer/end calls but she hasn't had a need to figure that out yet. She said she also likes that the headband part is adjustable.Even though space is not an issue, I like that these fold up nicely as you can see in the picture because it makes them more compact for when we are traveling.I really like that the cord is covered with a braided fabric so that they can stand up to any abuse that a child does to it by twisting and wrapping and not break like has happened with plastic cords.",
