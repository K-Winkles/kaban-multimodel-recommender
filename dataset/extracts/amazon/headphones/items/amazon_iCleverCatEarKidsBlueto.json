                "reviewText": "LOVE THESE!I bought them to be an aggressive visual suggestion to my nosey gossipy coworkers the I will absolutely NOT be discussing my shift partner quitting, and that I do not care to hear anybody else do so either.They are SUPER CUTE and comfortable. The light-up feature is just the right amount of special effects that can be turned off and on at the touch of a button.Sound quality is OUTSTANDING; even my husband thinks they're AWESOME and he is ridiculously critical of sound quality from audio devices.They charge quickly and efficiently. The battery life seems highly adequate; I've been using them for hours and they're still showing over 70% charged. I imaging the battery would drop a bit faster if the lights were left on continuously, but not dramatically.They come with a 3' cord with an eighth inch jack at each end so that the headphones my be used hardwired to a player, computer, etc. It works perfectly.The charger cable they come with is comically short (about 8\"), but does the job. The length is just enough to charge the headphones by plugging them into a laptop or powerbank. Luckily, I have loads of longer cables if I need to plug into a power source that is further than 8\" from the nearest table top.I see what some other reviewers mean when they talk about the folding mechanism being a bit delicate. It locks in place when the headphones are unfolded; if anything, it isn't that they're so particularly delicate as that it locks so well that it feels as though you might break them if you push them too hard to unlock and fold them. But as long as one is not thoughtlessly aggressive/utterly careless folding them up, there's no reason they should break.It's nice that it has 3 maximum decibel levels that can be set and changed easily. Makes it much more difficult to accidentally blow your own eardrums out/control your child's listening volume.I cannot say enough nice things about these headphones. They work beautifully. Are FUN AS HECK at any age. And are BRILLIANT at driving the point home that one has precisely Zero interest in participating in, or listening to useless gossipy nonsense.100 out of 10 would buy repeatedly.",

The design is cute and functional with ear pieces that are comfortable and fit over her small ears. The light up effects are fun but could be a little distracting in dark places (think driving in the car) Be sure to hang onto the cords that come with, she did lose her headphone jack right away which lead to some tears.",

Very uncomfortable wearing with glasses but that's an issue with many headphones so I can't hold it against these. I didn't expect too much at this price point but I was impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. The flashing lights are cute and fun addition. I haven't pushed the battery life to the end but they've easily lasted all day.The headphones don't look super sturdy but they seem far stronger than they appear. I don't use the folding function so I can't say anything about it.Overall, I've been impressed with these considering the price. I'll update if that changes.",

She also has sensitivities to loud noises as well as my (what we call) \"bat hearing\" lolShe loves them!She doesn't like things on her head, but she loves these!She will oftentimes wear them to both hear her tablet but also tune out noises in the home (such as me doing dishes)Many times she has surprised me when I've noticed they've helped her tune out the sounds of me doing dishes or watching TV - but if I say her name (absentmindedly forgetting she has them on) she will respond. That tells me they help cancel noises that seem to overload her- but don't block sounds out enough that she can't hear important noises.I was very worried about the setup process as I was struggling at first - but once I googled the process per her device, it was a simple 5 second process.They've now become an everyday staple in our home and I struggle to remember how we managed without them as not only are they an adorable pair of headphones - they've also become a crucial tool in sensory input management at home.Definitely recommend!",
