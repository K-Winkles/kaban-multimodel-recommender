                "reviewText": "These are my favorite true wireless earbuds for the money, but they aren't without their quirks.This is my second time buying these because they are so comfortable and have everything I want in a pair of headphones. You can usually find them on sale for a little less than $40 and they are 100% worth it.My first pair was worn 30 - 40 hours a week for almost a year before the in-ear sensor in the right earbud started bugging out, playing and pausing when it was in my ear.I highly recommend these despite their flaws, and I have seen them make improvements between my first and second pair, notably you can now cycle through ANC, Transparency, and ANC off.Pros:Comfortable - I work as a custodian and wear earbuds for 6 - 10 hours a day and these are by far the MOST comfortable ones I've ever owned. My ears never hurt no matter how long I keep them in and they STAY PUT whether I'm dangling them over a toilet or bending down to pick up something of the floor. I've never had these come out of my ear or feel like they are slipping out of position.Battery life - these have great battery life, often lasting 6 or 7 hours with ANC. I want something that can last all day so I can focus on my work and block out the annoying noises of vacuums and rolling trash bins. They can also be used independently, so when the battery does get low and I don't need the ANC, I'll pop one in the case for 15 min to get more out of them.Wireless charging - I just put them down on my charging pad when I get home and they're ready to go the next morning.Active noise cancelling - the ANC is GREAT, automatically blocking out the worst noises including multiple different vacuums (which each produce different annoying frequencies) and the surprisingly loud sounds of empty rolling trash bins and rolling trash cans.Sound quality - I'm not an expert on earbud sound quality, but I AM a part-time sound tech who mixes for live worship so I have some experience training my ear to know what sounds good. I think these sound good! I never get tired of listening with these and I feel like the music reproduction is pretty darn good! No EQ needed like with my JBL live free nc+ earbuds.The case - the size of the case is compact and fits great in my pocket.Cons:The case - this is my second time buying this model and the case seems to have been \"updated\" (or perhaps cost-cut) and now the hinge seems...floppy. Not too bad, but not as stiff and sturdy-feeling as the old one. The hinge has more \"wiggle\" than I'd like, and the older version didn't have any. The new case is glossier and retains fingerprints more than the old one which was nice and matte. The case can feel a little slippery in the hand, although I usually keep it in my pocket.It also has this annoying issue with wireless charging where it won't stop charging when it's full on battery. My JBL Live Free NC+ earbuds will stop when fully charged. Additionally, when I remove my headphones from the wireless charging pad, without even opening the case they will connect to my phone. I've remedied this by just opening and closing the lid whenever I take my headphones off the charger, but this SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. It also means that if the power goes out while they are on the wireless charger that will automatically connect to my phone (often in the middle of the night). Hopefully it will be fixed in subsequent versions.All-in-all, the pros outweigh the cons (significantly, in my opinion). I think these are an amazing option for the $40 price point and I have been very pleased with their reliability and performance. I hope this new pair will also last another 1,600 hours or more. If Tozo solves the issues with wireless charging and goes back to the old case design (firm, sturdy hinge and matte finish) while keeping them at an affordable price then these would be undisputably the best possible earbuds I could imagine.",

                "reviewText": "[LATEST UPDATE: In Feb. 2023 I contacted TOZO regarding the warranty for my no longer working earbuds. It was the best customer service experience I have ever had! Not even kidding! Friendly, easy, painless, quick, and satisfactory. They replaced the broken product and were extremely friendly and pleasant and so easy to deal with. I am surprised and grateful. Elva is the lovely person who helped me out. Have very high confidence in this company now, and trust they will make things right when things go bad. Very, very pleased. And the replacement earbuds are great, and so far have not failed me at all.Glad to have a positive experience I can report instead of complaints! :) Oh and I guess I was wrong about the warranty mentioned below. I don't know where I got that. But they had a warranty processing form on their website, which I filled out, and found out from the info there that I was still covered, perhaps. Which I was. My bad./end of latest update from Feb. 2023][UPDATE as of 1/2023: These earbuds finally fit in my ears, and then not even 4 months after I got them, they stopped working! First one of the little mesh screen things just fell right out and it stopped working, it must have been held in by the ear tip thing for who knows how long. Then the next day the other earbud also stopped working entirely. Then I realized there was only a 30 day warranty?!?!?! That's super lame and now I have no earbuds. Thank you very little. :( /end UPDATE)---------I like the sound of these a lot, nice and warm overall with decent bass. I was quite pleased. I mainly listen to podcasts and some folk/indie/rock/bluegrass/classical/and/or punk. The noise canceling works surprisingly well but the transparency mode, not so much. It's so loud, just the ambient noise is a constant loud hiss, and odd things are amplified (a lot!).Calling (outside in quiet, still conditions) with ANC on, for some reason, the other person was very very quiet but could hear me okay. But when I switched to transparency mode during the call by mistake, it was suddenly ear-shatteringly loud f on both ends (but upon turning the volume way down sounded okay for me and the caller, apparently.) A few other calls with NC on were fine but they were all conducted indoors, so I don't know..I definitely dig the ear detection/auto pause/resume feature, but that would be even more useful on a pair that didn't also have transparency mode AND a pause touch control, I think.This isn't a deal-breaker but I can't stand the way the earbuds fit into the case, they're unnecessarily awkward to put in, pretty hard to get out, and impossible not to manhandle the touch controls when trying to extract from the annoying annoying annoying case. It's just weird!I was able to find a glow in the dark silicone Case for the case, which is nice because it has a carabiner clip on it. I found I found that rather useful to clip to all kinds of things because the case is so big I don't really want it in my pocket.The battery life seems good, but I have not really been able to test that to the point of needing a charge because... *. Here comes the deal-breaker: no matter how much I might like these earbuds, I cannot wear them for any length of time. The right one hurts my ear terribly - it seems it bruised my ear or something the first time I tried them and even now that it has healed (took a week or so, ouch!) and I am super careful putting them in, it still causes pain, especially in my right ear but in my left one too. And they slide out. I tried nearly all the sizes of tips, too, just in case I was doing it wrong. Nope, nothing could make these things fit in my tender little ears. I have never had that problem with this type of earbud before, but now I'm so worried about finding ones that will fit and won't hurt that I don't know what the heck to replace these with. But unfortunately, they've gotta go back, I must return them and try yet another pair.[NOTE] - I've been on the hunt for the right earbuds ever since my duolink mbits crapped out on me (left bud) which had replaced my mpow mbits (same exact but different brand names) crapped out on me (left earbud as well ). I tried the Jlabs evo something with the button (not touch), but pressing the button jammed the whole thing painfully into my ears, ugh. Tried another jlabs one (i think) but the stupid case had no lid, what is the use of that?? Then I tried whatever soundcore buds with the stem and the giant case that they sell at Walmart for $35, and i returned them because they sounded so terrible, just godawful. Even with the other eq mode, I hated them! But they were tiny and super comfortable. Then these, they sounded the best by far, oh well...Now what?",
