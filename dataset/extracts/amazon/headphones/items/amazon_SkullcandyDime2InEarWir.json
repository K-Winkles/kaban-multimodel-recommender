                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Not perfect, but still great earbuds at an affordable price",
                "reviewText": "At this price point, I expect to be making tradeoffs on earbuds. The Dime 3's aren't perfect earbuds, but they're almost perfect for me. I have other earbuds that I really like, including ones that cost significantly more. But these are now my go-to everyday buds.First off, they're extremely comfortable. This is a personal thing, of course, but these are the most comfortable earbuds that I own. I have narrow ear canals and the design of these is perfect. I think what makes the difference for me is that the nozzle where the silicone tips attach is oval rather than round and that works better for me. The buds are very small and lightweight and they stay securely in my ears. I can basically wear these forever without them becoming uncomfortable.Related to that, they seal really well and I don't actually miss ANC much at all. I'm sure there are situations where I would want to go for my ANC buds, but in everyday use, these are sufficient. I spent a while a walking around the Mall of America on a very busy day with these earbuds and could listen to my music just fine without any ANC. Related to that, transparency mode also works well. When I turned it on at the Mall of America, I could carry on a conversation just fine and it really didn't feel like I was wearing earbuds, but it still took the edge off the noise. As someone with some noise sensitivity issues, this matters to me.The big selling point for me is that the case attaches to my keychain. I always have earbuds in my bag, but sometimes I want to just grab my keys and my phone and go. With these earbuds, I can do that, and have them handy if I noise is getting to be too much for me, or I just want some tunes. The case is about the same footprint as my car fob and about twice as thick. It's a little bulky in my jeans pocket, but fine in a jacket pocket. On first inspecting things, I was a little worried about the lid popping open, but it hasn't happened. I've had these on my keychain for several weeks now with zero problems.Of course, these are earbuds, so it matters how they sound, and they're good! They don't have the bells and whistles of more expensive earbuds, like custom EQ, but the sound is good enough right out of the box that I don't really care. I have better-sounding earbuds, but these still punch above their price point.The Tile functionality was a selling point for me (because they're on my keychain with my house and car keys!) and I think it's not worth it. First, the sound the make is pretty quiet, so it's not useless, but only useful if you're in the same room. More importantly, using the Tile functionality drains the batteries. The battery capacity is fine, but not stellar, but if the batteries are drained after just a few days of non-use, it defeats the point of having the these earbuds on my keychain. As a result, I deleted the Tile app from my phone and reset the earbuds, so hopefully the battery will last longer.Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons for me and I really love these earbuds. Not perfect for everybody, but I do recommend them if your needs are similar to mine.",

                "reviewText": "for only 20 dollars these earbuds are amazing. i\u2019ve been using airpods pro for the past 2 years and lost them so i needed a cheap alternative. once i got these the difference was mind blowing. when they first came they weren\u2019t that loud. i had to take off the mesh wax protector to get the full sound quality. it was blocking out most of the sound since i did get these used, but the quality is crazy good. i heard sounds and instruments in some of my favorite songs that i\u2019ve never heard before. the fit was a little uncomfortable, they feel like they\u2019re about to fall out when i\u2019m chewing for example. also don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to attach the little lanyard. it was a little rope that came separate from the case that i assumed you were supposed to feed through the hole on the side, but i couldn\u2019t. no issues with the battery life, case is very small and light as well. the noise cancelation is great as well. would\u2019ve been nice for the controls on the earbuds to be accessible while it\u2019s in the case since you can press the buttons from there, but it\u2019s not much of an inconvenience. there\u2019s a tiny bit of audio delay in the sound and screen but it\u2019s not very noticeable especially if you\u2019re just listening to music. overall 10/10 for the price it\u2019s incredible",

                "reviewText": "Summary at bottom of review, because this got a lot longer than I expected.Liked: These earbuds have no business sounding so good for the price point. The bass is nice & rumbly, even with the default sound settings enabled. The stay-aware setting is great; I can simply pause my music and participate in conversations without having to take out an earbud. Stay-aware mode does cause a slight hissing sound when not playing music, but it's not unbearable. They hold a charge for way longer than 8hrs of continuous use -- I often use them all day (about 8 hours) on 60% volume, and their battery only drops to about 50% by the end of the day. Also, their range seems longer than advertised, as I can connect them to my computer on one end of the house and stay connected in the garage on the other end of the house. That's like 15 yards.Disliked: Okay, what's up with the weird button press times? To enable stay-aware mode, you do a quick press followed by a one-second press/hold. But the press/hold registers as a quick press unless I hold for 3 full Mississippi seconds (\"one Mississippi, two Mississippi,\" etc). So any of the settings that utilize multiple press/holds, or multi-second press/holds, I just don't use. It's too unpleasant to wrestle with that, because they never register correctly. Also -- and this isn't the earbuds' fault -- it's Bluetooth. So yeah, there's some problems from the Bluetooth being Bluetooth. Occasionally my earbuds won't sync properly, or only one will connect to my device but not the other. This is solved by replacing them both into the case until the charge light comes on, then removing them both again. Also, using a single earbud is fine until you try to use the second earbud. Again, this is solved by quickly replacing them in the case. Full disclosure, I hate Bluetooth with all my heart. I refuse to buy a new phone because none of them have headphone jacks. I refuse to buy a laptop if it doesn't have a headphone jack. The future will have to pry my wired earbuds from my cold, dead hands. HOWEVER, as stated above, the stay-aware mode on these earbuds is really nice, and I can use them for walking my dog without getting hit by a car/bus/plane/boat/SpaceX rocket/etc. So that overrides the drawbacks of Bluetooth for me. Finally, the case looks nice, but the earbuds are literally exposed, so it's not super protective. I'm a little worried about the longevity of the earbuds' buttons from being unprotected like that, and I'd never throw the case into a bag or clip the lanyard to my backpack due to this.Summary: These have a good value for the money you pay. Bluetooth has connectivity issues. (Again, I may be biased here, as I love wired audio with my entire heart & soul.) The stay-aware mode works as advertised. The timing of button presses is weird and counterintuitive. The bass is great for the price. The case design is lacking but gets the job done. Better battery life than advertised. Each earbud is equipped with Tile, but I haven't used that yet so can't speak to it. Also haven't used these to take calls, so I can't judge the quality of the mic. Overall I recommend these, but don't expect them to blow your mind if you're used to more premium audio.",

Easy to set up and use, fast charging and good battery life, and the perfect pair of earbuds for anyone who loses/breaks things easily and doesn't want to waste their money. The sound quality is FABULOUS, though I'm a bit biased because I've been a Skullcandy fan for nearly 10 years. Definitely would recommend this to literally anyone, but I'd especially point parents of forgetful children (or the forgetful children in question) towards this very well priced pair of earbuds.",

I never used those anyway.The downsides are that you can't operate any commands other than start/stop music/answer phone with ONE bud in. The push button is difficult to press as well. You really have to jam the bud into your skull to press the button. I just operate commands via my phone. I don't mind for the cost.These buds are perfect for $30!!!I would buy 3 sets of these instead of the Evo. Math.",
