                "reviewText": "I got the Black and Red Bluetooth Headphones Over-Ear, 60 Hours Playtime Foldable Lightweight Wireless Headphones Hi-Fi Stereo, Bass Adjustable Headset with Built-in HD Mic, FM, SD/TF for PC/Home.The headphones, in my opinion, are not particularly noise-canceling and they felt quite heavy on my head. Another thing that I didn't like about the headphones is how small the ear pads are - they hurt my ears, and I don't have big ears (or maybe I do and just don't know it). \ud83d\ude04When I received them, I plugged it in and when I awoke the next morning, it was fully charged. As for how long the charge lasts, I cannot attest to that because I don't use them every day. I can't tell you that I have gone as long as a week between uses, and I still had a charge. I wish the charging cable that came with the headphones was a little longer. Having all of the buttons to control the volume, phone, on/off, etc. on the same side drove me crazy because I found myself pushing the wrong button and disconnecting a phone call or disconnecting the device that I was listening to.They were very easy to connect to the Android phone, my husband's iPad and iPhone, as well as my HP laptop. My daughter saved some music on an SD card, and she had no issues whatsoever listening to the music. The sound quality is great! The headphones can adjust to a little over 1\" on both sides and there are numbers 1-7, and I'm not sure why. I love how they fold up so I can put them in my bag. It is neat how the outside part of the headphones changes color too; however, the light is quite bright if you are using them at night in the dark.Overall, I really like the headphones.",
