                "reviewText": "For the price, I thought I'd give it a try. It's great! Has 3 sound settings. Noise cancelling - which does a very good job. A listening mode - which allows ambient sounds to come in through headphones. You can use this to talk/listen without taking headset off. 3rd - off, though it does offer some sound blocking.I've used top-of-the-line noise cancelling headsets. They're great, but very expensive. This item compares very well to the top models. Not quite as good, but darn close. This one is adjustable, lightweight and comfortable.The audio quality is very good. A very minor complaint: I'd like to be able to turn the volume up a little higher, as it tops out below my 'blast a good song' desired setting. But, it's probably better for my hearing in the long run anyway. Blue tooth paring worked with my iPhone easily. No cord to fuss with. But if you have a device without blue tooth, there IS a cord option, a nice featureCharged it up and used this on 3 1/2 hour flights, plus airport waiting use, round trip. Never had to charge it during trip. Ear cushion speakers fold in to make it easier to pack away. I would have liked a carry case, but that would raise the price - and I was able to use a different case I had anyway.Great for travel, or home use. Very nice, economical ANR headset.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by these headphones. Use them when my wife goes to sleep. Wanted something that would last longer at a sitting than some earbuds I already had and constantly had to recharge. So many choices but these were relatively less expensive to start, and then they were on sale on top of that. So, I figured it wasn\u2019t too big of an investment if I got it wrong. But again, I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. I\u2019m not an audiophile, but I think they produce good sound with good range. They\u2019ve also provided solid Bluetooth connectivity and range. One thing I was wary of from reading reviews for other brand headphones was durability. Others warned that other brands broke too easily. And while mine enjoy an easy, gentle, home-based life, they\u2019ve given me no reason to think that they will turn out to be fragile in the long run. I\u2019ve also been happy with the battery life between charging. Way better than the old earbuds. Even though I choose to use them on a setting that is not meant to produce the longest duration between charges that these headphones should be capable of, I still get approximately 34 hours on a single charge, which is fantastic to me. Overall, I am pleased and feel like I got good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I am professional web Broadcaster and s mobile DJ and very fussy about clean sound so I have some pretty good audio equipment at home. In this case I was looking for a wireless headset to use at my regular job to block out the loud white noise sound of a massive air conditioner in my work area (and the constant bothersome negativity and complaining of the guy next to me). I was also shopping for an inexpensive one that has some active noise cancelling without paying close to $400. For this low price, this one is surprisingly very good with clean sound, good deep bass without being too loud, and no audio distortion. Bluetooth connects easily and quickly to my computer and cell phone and it is easy to operate. Battery life is outstanding. It has a good range with no distortion so I can walk away with no loss of sound quality (have not tested the actual max distance which will vary anyway by device). The noise cancelling works as indicated and blocks a good amount of external noise, besides, with music it sounds amazingly detailed without awareness of loud external noises It is very comfortable, lightweight and not too tight. The mic is pretty decent and I can be clearly understood on calls. The build feels good. I definitely recommend it a good work and travel companion, and for personal daily use.",

Well, these were on sale\u2026 and they looked pretty cool, so why not give them a try. I wasn\u2019t expecting a whole lot of amazement i would let these\u2026 make their own statement and see what else they offered. I\u2019m glad I bought them on sale. But first things first. They look expensive from a far and can come across aesthetically. But they\u2019re cheap. The build is solid but a lot of plastic parts. So durability will be very questionable. Ear cushions are the best thing. Second the sound is \u2026. Not poor but leaves a lot to be desired. Muddled high end and lacks bass punch. I\u2019ll break them in and see if that gets better. ANC is very good at this price point. The price point is very low. Overall.. the 3 stars is generous. I\u2019d recommend TOZOs over these. If you want cheap headphones that pack a punch for the money. These will probably be on static display\u2026. For me, decorating the music room.",

Connect to your phone via Bluetooth and listen to music, not engine hum or screaming kids. Great for sitting in an airport relaxing with or without music between flights. Also great for making phone calls in an airport. You are hands-free without the background noise. Very light with soft foam. Recommend it to anyone who travels by airplane.",
