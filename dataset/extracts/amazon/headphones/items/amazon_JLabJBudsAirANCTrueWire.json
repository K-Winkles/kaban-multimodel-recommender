                "reviewText": "These JLAB ANC earbud are fantastic so far. I've had them for about 6 months now and as my first pair of wireless earbuds and my first set of Active Noise Cancellation of any sort they are fantastic. I've wanted an active noise cancellation headset or earbuds for quite a while and finally jumped into the pool. There are dozens of options that provide a wide range of price points and consumer ratings. I read a lot of reviews and settled on these from JLAB and I am glad I did.I get very reasonable noise cancellation. They won't completely block out a lawn mower or a crying baby on an airplane but will make those sounds tolerable. When I cut the grass, I wear the earbuds and a cheap pair of over the ear sound protectors and get great results. I have tested the $200+ noise cancelling headsets but only in the store and I think these perform very nearly as well for an affordable price.As they are my first earbuds of any kind, I can only say that they stay put. The memory foam tips come in 3 sizes and are comfortable. I can't say if they are heavy or light. I can tell that I am wearing them for sure but they do not grow bothersome or painful after several hours of continuous use. I've gone 4 or 5 hours with them in and found no discomfort.That leads to battery life. Advertised as 10 hour capacity, I can't see ever wearing them that long at a stretch. My longest session was about 7 hours. I think I have heard the \"low battery\" alert just one time. Between uses, I pop the earbuds back into the carrying case (included with the earbuds) and that tops up the earbud charge. So, it is difficult to say just how long a single charge will last. I carry the case in my jeans pocket or a day pack to use the earbuds several times a day totaling maybe 3 or 4 hours per day. The LED lights on the case let you know charge lever remaining and I pop them into a USB port on a laptop or wall when I see the LED dots drop a light or two. That isn't test to failure kind of report but is what I get with my normal use.My only regret is that I didn't look to see if they are offered in colors other than black. I have left them laying on a counter or bedside table and the dark color can make them difficult to find. But then they aren't white or some other stand-out color when I am wearing them. I guess it is a fair tradeoff and I will take the look when I am wearing them.I don't recall just what I paid for the earbuds here on Amazon.com but I think it was in the $50 neighborhood. I am very pleased with the performance, durability and functionality for that price point. I could afford the higher price for the big-name earbuds but can't see why I need to. They certainly offer style points if that is your goal. I prefer very good sound quality, battery life, water resistance and the rest while keeping an extra $100 in my pocket. That fits nicely alongside the JLAB charging case that comes with the earbuds.",

                "reviewText": "About the edit...I edited this for a little finicky thing that I disliked about them. However these are the best earbuds I've ever had The battery life is absolutely freaking amazing, and they sound wonderful! I like the brand so much I even bought one of their Bluetooth speakers! LolEDIT (after bout 1.4 months of use):there's only two complaints that I have about this amazing earbuds. Number one is in my picture you'll notice that the j buds earbuds have a notch in the top of them. Now if you buy the regular j buds not the icons, the things that go around the ear bud that you get have a notch in them as well so that notch meets with the other notch and it doesn't move around. Well on the icons it has the notch but the things that surround it do not so they slip all over the freaking place sometimes if you don't fix it before you put it in the case so they won't charge and all that kind of crap.I mean it's a little thing to deal with but I'm being picky here and I want my thing to be perfect! Lolokay now number two I'm finding that if I only use the right earbud the button does not work I have to have the left one out as well in order for the button to work. I may try to reset them and see what happens but... Yeah...Oh man what to say about these... Well, if you're like me... Then you have already had a pair of JBuds, maybe a pair of Go Airs too. The Jbuds had sooo many good things, but the KBuds depended on the right ear bud to function. The Go Airs solved that problem by allowing each earbud to connect individually!So after that I was like, \"Dang' I wish that JLabs would just combine the 2 into 1, it'd be serious quality.Well guess what?These Icon AirJBuds ARE the combination of the 2!Edit: almostforgot to mention the \"covers\" for the edges of the earbud. Before they only came in 1 size which seemed to be fine for most people. People with a rubber\\latex allergy may find them causing a rash irritation or evenpain! WellJLan thought about that and shrink them! So with the Icons you get 2 pairs of those covers. The regular ones, and nowa much sllimmer even smaller cover that will not put so much pressure on your ear. So it will still lock it in but with much much less discomfort!The Icons have almost triple the playtime of the regular JBuds, they can be paired individually just like the Go Airs, still kept that awesome JLab Signature equalizer setting, included is a pair of noise cancelling \"cloud foam tips\" too! Those tips are good for 2 reasons but also bad for 1 reason. Forsythe good, well with these cloud tips they expand on your ear canal exactly like earplugs! So they cancel out like 80 or85% of background noise, and will absolutely NOT fall out.Now the only downside to the noise cancellation of those tips is if, like me, you wear like 1 earbud at work... For me personally that didntworkouttoo well, my boss basically whispers and I'm on my way to being deaf, so yeah didn't work out for me lol.As a whole, the Icons are worth soooooo much more than the extra $10, or is it $20!Either way, totally worth it and I HIGHLY recommend these!Ok quick edit Fyer using them for oh I dunno dozens of hours....This is a weird quirk I found when only using 1 earbud... So I was using ONLY the right one for at least 4 hours... Then I went to turn it up but nothing. The button actually ceased to function! Now this scared the crap out of me because I just bought a \"renewed\" pair and replaced them 3 times because the buttons would just stop working.But the Icon JBuds are so bad ass that IF this happens to you. All you have to do to correct it is take out the other earbud and use the button for a command. Since it was the left one for me, I hit volume down until it worked. Then BAM! THE RIGHT ONE WAS WORKING PERFECTLY AGAIN!",
