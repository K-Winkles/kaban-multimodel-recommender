                "reviewText": "Well as the title says, they are perfect, for me at least. These buds fit me perfectly and the shape is such that I can sleep with them in and they don't bother me. JBL crafted these well to fit the ear in either the traditional wire down position or if it suits you the up position to wrap around your ear. Each bud is marked for which ear it goes into for both positions. There's a handy notch in the centre-piece that you can stick the cord into if you want to shorten it up. The sound is great with plenty of bass. The microphone captures my voice very well for phone calls. The plug is nice and narrow for plugging into your devices with or without a case and has a bit of tilt so it swings away at an angle. These come in an assortment of colours so you can match your attire or personal aesthetic. Unlike Apple earbuds, the cord material is made of some magical polymer that absolutely resists tangling. I'm not saying it never happens but it is amazing to unravel them and most times they end up tangle and knot-free. Kudos JBL! Please don't stop making these.",

                "reviewText": "Feb.03 2024 - ordered 2 weeks ago, satisfied so far, good sound, offers 3 different earbud tip sizes and seems though enough to last long, they stay in my ears even when running / exercising. The cons : no volume control (only play/pause, answer call) and the \"left - right\" markers on the headphones : each one has both a R and a L (one built-in, the other is a sticker). Not a big deal, but amateur mistake. Don't buy over 20$I will update this review if anything bad happens",

She says the sound is perfect and noise cancelation is surprisingly good too, her old ones lasted her over 2 years and she uses daily for many hours. It is a nice size , feels nice in the ears and quality is undeniable. I got the colour black and it is very discreet as well. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "Was looking for something decent but not too expensive. These are awesome for the price point. Magnetic buds improve the tangling problem wired earbuds usually deal with. Sound quality is amazing. You hear the low notes clearly and the mids and highs are not the highest fidelity but still sound really good! Might not impress the pickiest of audiophiles but seriously, if you're not acting like you're the Anton Ego of headphones, you will not notice much difference between these and a $200 pair. Worth it! Very, very worth it",
