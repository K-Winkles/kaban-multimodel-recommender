                "reviewText": "So far so good. I have purchased these for my 21 month old and also 2 additional pairs for friend's kids. I will say that these are not quite volume limiting. I turned the sound up all the way to test it out and it was blasting in my ear. It was closer to the level I would personally listen to music/tv on a plane and nowhere appropriate for sensitive little ears. I would recommend you monitor your children closely when wearing these to ensure they don't accidentally increase the volume. Research recommends that the child should still be able to hear and respond to you with headphones on to ensure they are at a safe level. My son loves these and they fit his little head well. The cord is soft which is nice because I'm hoping it doesn't fray as easily as most wires do over time. The cord is a good long length making it convenient to set the tablet at different distances. I do think the cord has a slight smell but nothing alarming. I read a lot of review prior to purchasing and will be monitoring for the earphones shorting out on one side. For all of the items I purchased the 2 and 3 year protection plans just in case. They were only a couple of dollars so worth it for peace of mind should you have to replace.",

These are comfortable and our kids like the colors a lot. Thank you!We bought these for our 6 yo and were very happy at first: compact, easy to use and easy to share the sound by plugging into our son's headphones. Perfect for road trips and air travel. Great.Except the right ear stopped working today. Tried a different cable, different devices, nothing. Pretty annoyed that these didn't last that long. Our daughter is pretty bummed out - she really likes them and took good care of them.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second purchase of this brand of children's headphones. Our first pair was purchased about 3 years ago and they still work great. Purchased a second pair for the 2nd little as the price is excellent, quality is great, and the fact that you can fold them makes them even better!Good fit for both of my kids- ages 5 and the other almost 2. I love how comfortable these headphones are for their ears! Sound quality is perfect for kids! It was still great using a splitter for one ipad and two kids with both sets of headphones being loud enough over the white noise of an airplane while being used simultaneously (I used this splitter: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07431YDWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).Highly recommend for little kids headphones!",
