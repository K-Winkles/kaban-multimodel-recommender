                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The case is really good looking, light weight and compact. Inside the box there are 3 pairs of silicone eartips (one installed in the earbuds, and the others are in the accessories box) of different sizes (S, M and L). The paring process in Android phones is really easy. The audio quality is really good for the price as the highs and mids are clear, crisp and detailed, but in my opinion it lacks a bit of bass, but this is only my personal taste. However, I am really surprised of the sound quality overall and I could use them everyday without a doubt. The construction material (plastic) does not feel cheap at all and they look premium devices. The earbuds are really lightweight and comfortable but passive noise cancellation (it does not feature ANC) is just ok. The charging case has a transparent lid with a LED charging indicator and battery duration is great for me as I don\u2019t usually wear earbuds for so long (only when I am working out, walking, commuting, or relaxing). To sum up, I really like the sound quality and I enjoy it so much that I could easily ignore the lack of bass. The weight and design make it very comfortable. A great purchase for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've been pleasantly surprised with the build quality and overall functionality of this new Zingbird brand. Their products are priced very competitively and offer exceptional sound as well as extremely comfortable fit when wearing. I work from home and use in-ear earbuds all the time as they are more comfortable than using an actual headset.This T62 model delivers exceptionally good sound and has a great microphone that dampens background noise easily. I love how they are truly in-ear and so light and well fitting I sometimes forget I'm wearing them. They're easy controlled with the touch pads on top of each earbud and super simple to pair via Bluetooth to any device you may want to connect them with.If you're looking for a great, solid set of in-ear earbuds for everyday use or a less expensive pair to take with you to the gym or out running, you can't go wrong with the Zingbird T62. The pill shaped case fits easily into the smallest of pockets or handbags and the rapid charging USB C cable lets you power them up within an hour or so. In active use they easily last me through the day and I can get usually a couple of days active usage on them on a single charge.If you want a solid, economically priced pair of in-ear earbuds, you can't go wrong here. My only complaint would be that I would love a small loop point where I could fit a wrist loop or lanyard for those of us who like much larger bags as it can sometimes be tricky to find at the bottom. Otherwise I'm continually checking for new Zingbird products as they've become a favorite of mine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For the good points;They're definitely a good little pair of Bluetooth ear buds. For the price, it's a great deal! Plus you get a lifetime guarantee, so you really can't lose. Easy to read and follow instructions. They're sleek and compact. I wore them under my helmet while riding my motorcycle and I had no problem with them pushing against the inside of my helmet while in my ears. The battery life is really good, as well. I made a phone call and I could hear the person really well and they could hear me very clearly.For the not so good points; Unfortunately not tremendously loud. A bit disappointing on that. I played a couple of songs, while the sound was crisp and clear, the definitely lacked a bit on the bass lows. However, those were the only things I found these ears lacked.Overall;They pack a lot into a $30-$35 pair of Bluetooth ear buds. Good price, good quality, decent sound, good battery life, easy to use and compact.These would be great for: someone who's working out at the gym or home, while at work to block out some of that coworker chatter, while cleaning the house, someone who needs to make a lot of hands-free phone calls.",

The sound quality was good and the touch functionality is great and easy to use. I\u2019d definitely recommend these if you\u2019re not wanting to spend a lot of money on earbuds,they are exactly what you pay: a pair of solid, budget-friendly earbuds. The sound quality is decentThese are both cute and functional. If you have small ears like me, you\u2019ll definitely need the smallest tips, and even then I experience mild soreness after wearing these for extended periods, They\u2019re super cute and the touch controls are useful and intuitive. However, there is no volume control on the earbud which I feel is tough if you\u2019re using these to exercise or during periods when your phone is out of reach. There isn\u2019t much bass, but that\u2019s common in earbuds. If you\u2019re looking for bass, I\u2019d recommend over-ear headphones instead. For what I paid, I\u2019m pleased with what I got These have a better case and much better touch controls, though. The fit is good, The batteries in this thing are amazing - They will play a long time without needing to recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works great-I never have any problems connecting to my devices. These are great work and outdoor activities. Would recommend these for sure.",
