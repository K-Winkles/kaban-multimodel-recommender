                "reviewText": "I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT\u2019s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450\u2019s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My \"demo\" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL \u2013 REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they\u2019ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700\u2019s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony\u2019s.C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I\u2019ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I\u2019m not 18. ;-)Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting \"Funky\". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.",

They use eight microphones and two processors to cancel out a wider range of noise than ever before. I was able to wear the headphones on a flight and barely hear the engine noise.**Sound quality**The WH-1000XM5 also have excellent sound quality. They support Hi-Res Audio and have a new driver that delivers deeper bass and clearer highs. I found the sound to be very well-balanced and enjoyable.**Other features**The WH-1000XM5 also have a number of other features, including:* Adaptive Sound Control: Automatically adjusts the noise cancellation and ambient sound settings based on your environment.* Speak-to-Chat: Pauses music playback and enables ambient sound when you start speaking.* Fast Pair: Quickly pairs the headphones with your Android devices.* Multipoint pairing: Connects the headphones to two devices at the same time.**Overall**The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are the best noise-canceling headphones on the market.

It's like magic.- Passive noise isolation: 8/10 - surprisingly decent.- Sound Quality: 8/10 only and, ONLY if you are using a LDAC capable source. (windows does not support it at the time of writing). The app is good for tuning your sound profile to your preferences. Non LDAC connections use the standard Bluetooth pairing and it will sound meh, but that's the codec's fault, not the headphone's.- Battery life: 10/10. Actually lasts 24hours. In real life use that's roughly 3 days- Connectivity: 9/10. strong signals and you can connect 2 devices at the same time. It's all day phone and work laptop with no hassle and intelligent automatic switching between sources. works with a dead battery via cable - you always have a backup.- Call quality: 10/10. The other side is always clear and friends said my voice was crystal clear even in noisy environments (as the headphone filters noise out too)- Functions: 9/10. Easy to use buttons, the environment and chat functions are awesome. The touch sensitive panel is nice, but can get an input wrong here and there.- Price: 8/10. Better and cheaper than Bose. Buy on promo though.",

                "reviewTitle": "Best consumer headphones.",
                "reviewText": "These are the best headphones from Sony. Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones. I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days, I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.Update on N.C.:I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.",
