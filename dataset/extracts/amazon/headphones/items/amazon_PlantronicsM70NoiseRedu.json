                "reviewText": "I love using a bluetooth when I am talking on the phone, have owned approx. 5 over the last couple of years, including a Jabra, a couple of Samsung 1700s, the Mpow Knight Pro 4.0 and most recently the Plantronics M55. I've been using the M70 (certified refurbished) - for just over 2 months now and am very happy with it.Clarity is the top priority for me and the Plantronics M70 delivers. I can hear very well both in the house and when driving, without having it on full volume. It holds a charge for several days, even though I use it throughout the day, every day. When you power it on it conveniently lets you know exactly how much charge time is left. it's small in size and it has built-in software to help you find the bluetooth if (when) you misplace it. The audible beep it sets off is not very loud (would recommend that Plantronics changes this), but it is loud enough to enable me to find it if I am close by. The only other suggestion for improvement would be if it came with a couple of ear gels in other sizes as the only one that came with it is a bit large for my ear. I can still wear it comfortably for the most part, and even have occasions where I forget that I am wearing it. That being said, if I leave it in for an hour plus, I eventually want a break from it. My favorite bluetooth before this was the Samsung 1700. I think the quality between the two is close to the same, but this one was 1/2 the price so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad that I did!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Plantronics M55 for over 5 years, and I accidentally stepped on it a while back. Amazingly it still works, but it's never quite been the same since.Since M55's are getting very hard to find, I started looking and finally found the M70. I think it's also no longer being made, which baffles me. Both the M55 and the M70 are worlds better than anything Plantronics is making today. They are just as small and light, but have 50% more battery life. Both of these have an honest-to-goodness 11 hour battery life. All the current ones are more like 7 hrs.Both are extremely comfortable, very durable, great sound quality, and awesome battery life. They're just amazing.The one area where the M70 really excels is the volume switch. The M55 had a single volume button. M70 has a proper up and down volume rocker.However I do have to say that the M55 had slightly better looks. I mean the M70 isn't bad, but it's black matte plastic with a white plastic accent running around the edge. The M55 has a metal frame with black plastic panels (some glossy, some matte).I also suspect the M55's metal frame makes it more durable. I hope I never step on my M70, but I wouldn't expect its plastic construction to survive as well. But the M70 does feel quite solid, and I'm sure it will handle any normal wear and tear.",

Each time you power it on it says how many hours of talk time are left, which is a convenient way to check your battery level. I also like that when synced to my Note 5 it will also stream music and other audio, which is useful when I don't have a pair of headphones while in a public place. Easy to use and sync, and the standard micro USB slot makes it easy to charge with any charger. Call quality is ok. Could be better, but at this price point I'd say it's solid -- it's not difficult to understand people or anything.Good purchase.",
