                "reviewText": "Since I mostly work from home and listen to music when I'm not on the phone I use several bluetooth ear pods including AirPod Pros.The Max version has always intrigued me but I have quite a few over ear headphones so until they went on sale there was nothing compelling me to purchase them.I've had them long enough to break in the drivers to some degree. Yes like most dynamic headphones these need to be broken in for 20 to 50 hours before they can be judged for sound quality.1. I'm a headphone guy so sound quality is my first priority. This is an excellent headphone. They blow away my bluetooth Sennheisers on sound quality. They even compete with some wired headphones. They may not reach the level of my Grado 325's but they are much more comfortable. My Focal Clears, which incidentally match well with the output voltage of my iPhone, are superior but are much more expensive. And wired. BTW you can't get Lossless audio through Bluetooth so a wired headphone has that advantage. And you can't talk through the Clears. My wired Sennheisers don't really have the output levels to match an iPhone so they are not in the consideration. These have a wide range sonically and reproduce all kinds of music well. And unlike some Beats models they are not bass heavy. I think they work best with Spatial Audio off. iMy only complaint is that the midlevel sound stage is a bit compressed regardless of volume. Apple did their home work in designing these headphones. I'd go so far to say that you will not find another headphone wired or not that has as good as sound for the money.2. Comfort/Fit. One goes with the other. The head band is comfortable for my large head and does not squeeze my ears. The ear pad material is not what I'd like but it is surprisingly comfortable. Typical of any headphones they are best used without glasses for maximum comfortable. If you use glasses put the pads on your ears with the glasses on for maximum comfort. I do not notice any weight - these are much lighter than most wired headphones. The ear space fits my large ears although ideally a couple of extra mm's would be better.3. They connect easily once you go through the initial connection procedure. Most importantly they have excellent battery life. They have double or more battery life than Pros. Put them in the case when you are through with them for the day as it is the only way they turn off. You will otherwise lose battery life as they are otherwise constantly scanning for possible bluetooth targets. The case is not great but it works well for being put into a bag or backpack. Generally they do a good job of picking up your voice in telephone or FaceTime mode.4. They are an excellent value. Usually a substantial discount means that there is a newer model is coming out. My research suggests that is not the case. There is likely to be a newer model of the Pros coming out which explains their greater discount.I am very pleased with these headphones and I think that you will be equally as pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Creo que la mayor incertidumbre de comprar estos se debe al precio y las competencias con precios mucho m\u00e1s accesibles, uno de los mas fuertes son los XM4 de Sony.Mi opini\u00f3n sobre los Airpods Max teniendo experiencia con los XM4:Definitivamente debes tener un dispositivo Apple para considerar la compra de los Airpods Max. Si no cuentas con un iPhone, iPad o Mac ve y busca otras opciones.1. Presentaci\u00f3n:- No hay mucho que decir, los mejores de la gama. Calidad de los materiales bastante premium.- En cuanto el estuche, una desgracia.2. Comodidad:- Son pesados, pero al utilizarlos se distribuye muy bien el peso siempre y cuando no se haga mucho movimiento en la cabeza.- Las almohadillas son reemplazables lo cual es muy bueno que hasta se puede personalizar los colores, son c\u00f3modas pero prefiero el material suave de los XM4. Eso s\u00ed, creo que cubre mas mi o\u00eddo los Airpods Max.- 2 botones efectivos, uno de ellos es una coronilla para subir y bajar el volumen. Nada mejor que estos botones f\u00edsicos los cuales aseguran una buena funcionalidad aparte en una ubicaci\u00f3n bastante apropiada.3. Tecnolog\u00edaDesde aqu\u00ed adelanto que es el mejor apartado de los Airpods Max.- Ecualizador adaptativo, esto permite tener una fidelidad a como las canciones deben ser escuchadas.- Noise Cancelling/Transparencia: Peleados por el reinato contra los XM4 de Sony. Puedo decir que los Airpods se llevan la victoria, para el noise cancelling no es una gran diferencia pero para el modo transparencia simplemente nadie supera a Apple, una cosa espectacular.- Spatial Audio: Una maravilla al momento de ver series y pel\u00edculas compatibles, \u00e9sta tecnolog\u00eda integrada por Apple es \u00fanica y ahora con la llegada de la compatibilidad con Apple Music y Dolby Atmos no tiene rival. El sonido 360\u00b0 de Sony queda en rid\u00edculo.- Ecosistema de Apple: la fluidez de sincronizarlos y utilizarlos de inmediato con tus dem\u00e1s dispositivos Apple es el para\u00edso del mundo del Bluetooth. No existe ninguna otra compa\u00f1\u00eda que te ofrezca la calidad conectividad como lo hace Apple.Calidad de audio:(Apple Music como mi servicio de comparaci\u00f3n)El punto m\u00e1s importante pero puedo resumirlo f\u00e1cilmente.En efecto, los AirPods Max tienen una calidad bastante buena y s\u00ed, superior ante los XM4. Que tanto? Dir\u00eda que un 10-15% m\u00e1s, a que se debe este %?- Claridad y nitidez del sonido, un audio m\u00e1s limpio y sin distorsiones.- Los Airpods Max estan hechos para adaptarse a la m\u00fasica que se reproduce y por ende permite tener un sonido personalizado para cada canci\u00f3n. Otros audifonos se ajustan a la configuraci\u00f3n predeterminada y quiz\u00e1s esos ajustes no sean lo mejor al escuchar otros g\u00e9neros.- Al tener un balance los sonidos m\u00e1s beneficiados son los medios, as\u00ed que si esperas unos graves robustos como ofrecen los Sony lamento decir que no ser\u00e1n as\u00ed. S\u00ed, tienen buenos graves pero no tan predominantes como muchas personas quisieran. Se podr\u00e1n hacer ajustes dentro de la aplicaci\u00f3n del servicio de m\u00fasica pero no directamente a los aud\u00edfonos como lo es con los XM4 o los Bose 700. En mi opini\u00f3n, prefiero m\u00e1s los sonidos como los artistas quieren que ma gente los escuche, as\u00ed que prefiero la forma en que Apple lo hace.En lo personal creo que los Airpods son una excelente opci\u00f3n para aquellos que tienen la oportunidad de pagarlos, que pueda sacarle provecho al ecosistema y que igualmente est\u00e9n suscritos al servicio de Apple Music por las grandes novedades que tendr\u00e1 y las ventajas que tendr\u00e1n los Airpods Max, d\u00e1ndole m\u00e1s justificaci\u00f3n a la compra.Si no te interesa tanto el ecosistema y las funcionalidades que ofrecen los Max, no vale el precio extra al menos no por ese 10-15% de mejor calidad ante su mayor rival, los Sony XM4 que por cierto estan a la mitad del precio...",

                "reviewText": "I took a chance and purchased the Air Pods Max because I\u2019m a big fan of noise cancelling headphones and already own the Sony XM4 and the Bose QC35.Note: I used to own the Bose 700 but returned them because the head band was so tight it gave me headaches and I couldn\u2019t wear it for more than 20-30 minutes.Here is my experience with each.Best Noise Cancelling: Air Pods Max Sony XM4 Bose QC35I use all 3 headphones with televisions in the background, small children and outdoors. The Air Pods Max is very close to the XM4, I would rate it as a 10% difference \u2013 it\u2019s almost tied. The QC35 on the other hand, I can hear faint television/small children in the background, even at high volume.Long Term Comfort: Bose QC35 Air Pods Max Sony XM4Nothing will ever beat the QC35\u2019s. I can wear them all day and take video and phone calls however, it does give me a slight disorientation effect and minor vertigo, similar to diving or moving to an elevated height (driving up a mountain for example).The Air Pods Max are comfortable, and the ear cups surround my large ears just like the QC35 however, there the clamp is noticeable \u2013 this may go away after some time; the clamp causes minor discomfort with glasses; I removed my glasses for the purpose of this short review and the discomfort has faded, even after 60 minutes of listening \u2013 it does clamp more than the QC35 and XM4s.Something to keep in mind is the XM4 earpads are not thick enough and my ear brushes against the speaker area; this also makes my ears get hot after 30 minutes and I eventually have to take a short break \u2013 this does not happen with the Air Pods Max \u2013 there is lots of room for my ears and the cushions are thick enough that my ears do not touch the speaker area.Microphone: Air Pods Max Bose QC35 Sony XM4I completed several zoom video/audio calls, Facetime and regular calls. I asked my friends/family to compare my voice quality on each headset and every time, the Air Pods Max was the winner. Bose QC35 is still great in this department however \u2013 I was using them as my primary driver for calls prior to getting the Air Pods Max.The Sony XM4\u2019s are below average; people cannot hear me clearly. In-fact, I stopped using them entirely for business calls because colleagues would make remarks about my microphone. They are \u2018okay\u2019 for personal calls, but not desirable for me at least.Synchronization: Air Pods Max Bose QC 35 Sony XM4I place the Air Pods on my head and it immediately connects to my phone. I do not have to touch anything on either of my devices. When I place the Air Pods Max around my neck or left one ear cup, the music pauses. When I place both ear cups back on my ears, the music auto resumes. I tested this for several hours and it has never failed.As for the Bose QC35 and XM4\u2019s, no matter if they both have multi device pairing, I am always having issues. Both headsets never switch to my other device without me having to manually disconnect 1 of 2 devices (the one I\u2019m not using). This is frustrating and I hate doing this multiple times per day.Music Quality: Air Pods Max Sony XM4 Bose QC35The Air Pods Max I would rate have 30% better music quality than the XM4. I tested Hip-Hop, Bossa Nova, Jazz, Classical, Deep House, D&B, Techno, Trip Hop, Dubstep and Lounge. The must is more engaging, and I can hear the instruments and vocals in more detail \u2013 an elevated musical experience. The biggest difference for me was Jazz, Classical, Bossa Nova and Salsa \u2013 I would say a 50% better listening experience for these genres.Build Quality: Air Pods Max Sony XM4 Bose QC35Air Pods Max are easily the highest quality headphones I have handled; they look at and feel premium and are crafted exceptionally well \u2013 even the buttons are strong and durable; these are basically on another level entirely. When extending the headphones, there is a steel connector with resistance when adjusting the sizing to fit your head properly.The XM4/QC35 are hard plastic \u2013 nothing special or extravagant; the XM4 look better than the QC35 however.Spatial Audio Note:I was completely blown away when I loaded an Apple TV series on my phone to test the spatial audio feature. It felt like I had speakers surround me in a 360 fashion at the move theatres. I stood there for 5 minutes with my eyes wide opened in disbelief that headphones were capable of offering this level of experience. It is something that you have to try it to believe it. This is what sold me the most.---Are the Air Pods Max worth the price? Based on my experience so far, I would say yes. I was actually expecting them to be close to the XM4\u2019s, but on certain categories, they have accelerated immensely.",
