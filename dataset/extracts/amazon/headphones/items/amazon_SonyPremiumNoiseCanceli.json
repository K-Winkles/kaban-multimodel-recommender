                "reviewText": "Note: Originally, I did buy these used to save a few bucks. After discovering a break, I ordered a new pair and had significantly better results. If you use EQ, these even rival the 200-dollar kinds. Sony ZX-110s are known to be used by casual listeners to enjoy the support of EQ software. I've even seen people wear them while doing live covers. When professionals wear something, it's best to find out why and trust them on it. That's why I took a gamble and bought these.[When I bought used]I really really really wanted to like these. The cups were comfier than the standard zx110s, but the audio didn't come close to the standard. I compared the zx110nc to the standard zx110 I already owned and found it's volume and sound to be significantly less. While this did improve when I flicked on the \"noise cancelling\" switch, I noticed vocals were clearer and the sound was louder. I live alone, noise canceling had nothing to do with this performance. I tried to test it out with the tv on but could still hear the television. It seems the noise canceling can at most damper the noise of an electric heater. Nothing higher. You'd have to turn up your volume to the high twenties and even thirties to block out a person's conversation.For some reason, the pair I had had cracked speakers. Meaning the black plastic that covers the actual speaker was slightly cracked form a weak foundation. Not sure how this happened during manufacturing, most likely someone but manual blunt pressure and \"popped\" a crack into it.Sadly, the audio is great with the so-called \"noise canceling\" on, but not enough to support the idea of changing a battery every ten days if you listen for eight hours per day.I'll maybe buy it again to see if I just had a lemon. But there's a lot of reviews with the issues I had.I did buy new, and had a significant change of mind! I didn't realize how much two little cracks on the earpad covers could change so much![Second Attempt, bought new]Upon arrival, I was greeted to the firmness of the pads that help with my stemming and adhd symptoms. The sound was a lot better but slightly airy. That's when my mom pointed out, I needed to tighten the band. That's when the real results came, and even the noise canceling was a success. I didn't hear anything, not even the cars outside. I live near the airport, and I didn't hear the planes or the helicopters helicopters. I even didn't hear the TV that I forgot to turn off.If the sound is still not to your satisfaction. I highly HIGHLY suggest you use EQ. It's FREE. Honestly, the headsets don't even need them, just make sure the headband is NOT loose!",

I'd give 5 stars relative to the price but when comparing to other (more expensive) headphones they would not equal up. I'm very satisfied for the price.Update Oct 2023: I used these on the plane (again) and noticed a big difference when I slightly pressed the earpiece against my head. When I applied a little pressure the high-end noise went away and they were very quiet. I could not adjust the headphones to fit tight enough without pressing on them. Again for the price they are pretty good and maybe they will fit your head better than mine??",
