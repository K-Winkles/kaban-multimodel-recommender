                "reviewText": "Pretty decent. I bought two of these, one for each of my daughters. Overall they're pretty nice. The sound is good, they're a little smaller and seem to fit my 2 and 3 year old comfortably enough. Both girls like the colors (I bought a pink and purple one.) The material around the ears and the headband seem to be good quality and are soft. It pairs very easily with an iPad and there's a decent amount of feedback with the single LED on the headphones to tell you what mode it's in. What I didn't like about the headphones was cheap feel of the volume switch and the micro usb connector. I'm not sure if it's the connector or the cable that came with the headphones, but they just don't seem to fit together like all my other micro usb devices. It seems a little harder to plug in and flimsy. You have too much leverage and it would be very easy to pull what looks like a surface-mount micro usb connector right off the circuit board. The rocker switch for the volume seems flimsy, too. Like cheap components were used on the circuit boards of the headphones. The shell that surrounds the speakers seems like it could be a little thicker or more solid considering these are expected to take some abuse by kids. I was disappointed by was the volume limiting, too. It says they're limited at a certain decibel (I don't recall at the moment what that number was), but the limit was greater than the decibel limit where hearing is damaged which makes no sense to me. Also, there's no charger in the box. In my case I had a bunch laying around, but for $50 they could at least add it to the package. One of the really great features I do like is the manual cable in case the batteries die although kids can break the small plug pretty quickly with a little abuse. I'd have to think hard before buying these again. They're of good enough quality to me to consider them again but they're pretty pricey when you end up having to buy two of them at a time. If I could make changes to these headphones, I'd suggest they secure the micro usb connector better, beef up the shell around the speakers and find some way of limiting the max volume and locking it at the headphone. It's just too easy to crank these things up and no way to tell when it's on my kid's head how loud it is.*** Update 08/23/2015 ***After having some time to play around with these and really look at the spots I felt were trouble, I've come to the conclusion that the issue with the micro USB adapter is the cable and not the plug in the earphones. The plug is locked fairly solidly by the cover that surrounds the electronics so I don't think that will be an issue.I also got some information about db and what constitutes a dangerous sound level. From the information I found, the db limit on these headphones is well within the range that would protect my daughters' ears and the length of exposure to sound is a main factor in damage. This was my main concern with these headphones and it's not anymore.As far as durability goes, these things have been dropped, walked on and dragged around for a while now and have stood up without an issue. I don't think the shell will be an issue.I can comfortably say I'd recommend these for kids. They're grown-up quality in a small package.",

                "reviewText": "I am a petite older woman with an exceptionally small (child-size) head. Finding a headset for personal listening for my TV has been extremely difficult and frustrating. I just got my Lil Gadgets Untangled Pro child headset and am so impressed with the comfort, ease of pairing, adjustability, quality of sound, and overall quality, I just had to write an older person's review. These are great for adults and children! I especially love that I can continue to listen to the TV from every room in my home without any disruption in sound quality because they are wireless. I wish I had purchased these when they were first introduced instead of spending time in \"tech\" stores and online looking for a fully adjustable - smaller, not just larger - headset. I highly recommend these for anyone with a smaller head size. They are outstanding in every way!",

                "reviewText": "My girls like it a lot. I bought one for each of them. Now they wear it every time them have to watch their iPads. The great part is that they can be around us while we watch TV while they play on their iPads.Here are some of the good things about the headphones.1. It is a good fit for both my 2 year old and the 7 year old.2. They loved the colors. We bought 2, green and pink.3. The bluetooth setup is extremely easy.4. Though it wasn't easy for my 7 year old to operate at first; however, after I explained it to her she could work it on her own. It is just that an adult has to set it up first. Wasn't an issue in our case.5. Due to lack of max volume control on the iPad or the headphone, we have setup a rule while using the headphones. If we can hear the audio when my kids are wearing them, it is too loud for them. They have to bring the volume down.Here are some of the things I want LilGadgets to improve upon.1. There is a lack of literature about what kind of charging sources that could be used. Do I plug it into my iPad/iPhone chargers or the USB port of my Mac? Or can I use any other charger? What should be the power/current rating of any charger where I should plug these headphones? Eventually, I plugged it into my Mac. You have to be careful about the source you use, since it reduces the number of charging cycles the internal battery can go through. I want these headphones to last.2. The metallic part of the slider assembly that allows to expand/contract the headphones are a bit of nuisance. Sometimes my kids hair gets caught in it. The sides of the metallic slider are not beveled or rounded, and wife continued to worry that it may hurt our kids. Hasn't happened yet, but we are careful.Overall, a great pair of headphones for the price. They look great and work great.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:We have now had these over 6 months. They are amazing! I wouldn\u2019t buy any other kind of ear phones for my toddler. They\u2019re comfortable (I\u2019ve used them myself), easy to use and the convenience of having no cords is absolutely worth it. We\u2019ve taken them on many road trips and they\u2019ll be coming along on some big flights in the next few months!As usual, I did my research and also read a lot of reviews before purchasing these. We\u2019re very happy with them! Our son is only 2.5 years but we wanted something comfortable for him to wear on a couple long flights and over vacation, that would also be useful afterwards. I am SO happy we went with cordless. They\u2019re still a but big for him at this age but they do the trick and I\u2019m hoping they last him a couple years. He has worn them for about an hour (for the longest period at a time) and never complained. I think he likes that they drown out the noise of busy malls or restaurants when we just need him to chill for a bit.A couple last things: - they were hard to find in store, and Amazon\u2019s price was the best I found anyway.- It can be a little tricky to know if they\u2019re on/conncted. When you hold down the power button the lights flash a bit but I usually have to just test it a couple times to make sure the sound is coming through.",
