She's been through countless of the cheap ones so I decided to spend the money because nothing is worth your peace and quite right? Right, so far so good, they are still in one peace. I could care less about the volume as long as I can't hear what she's listening to lol. I will update if they break.Update: it ain't even been a month and they broke! Idk if it was her or the product but good God I'm not buying anymore. I'll have to suffer",

Fits great, comfy to wear and the volume setting is nice. They also fold nicely and the cord seems durable, especially in little hands. Happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend for someone needing headphones for their little one.",
