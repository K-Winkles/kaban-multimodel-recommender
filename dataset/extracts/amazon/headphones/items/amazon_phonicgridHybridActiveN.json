                "reviewText": "I'm not sure what the price on these will be when you're reading this review, but I got them for the sale price of $29.99. And wow! That's a HELL OF A DEAL.In my review, I've given the noise cancellation five stars; if I had paid $150 for them, I would have rated it four stars, which means I would have been reasonably happy with how well the feature works even at that price.I can't speak to the battery life because I've yet to charge them; I've been using them for about five hours straight, and it has dawned me that they are extremely comfortable even during long periods of use.Also, their VOLUME CONTROL IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER HEADPHONES\u2019 I'VE EVER HAD BEFORE. For whatever reason, three different pairs of headphones have had compatibility with issues my brand-new laptop's Bluetooth (to make a long story short, there was no middle ground in the volume; it was either too quiet or too loud); I expected these phonicgrid E7s to have the same weird problems as the others, but they don't. As a result, I'm so happy with my purchase that I've decided to give them a glowing review right now, even before having used them for an entire battery charge.I did not expect these phonicgrid E7 headphones to be as overall great as they are; I bought these because my Soundcore Life Q30 headphones are old, and their battery life has drastically degraded. I really, really liked the Soundcore Life Q30s when I first got them; I thought they were one of the best purchases I had ever made, and I would still rate them five stars (they lasted long enough and are overall excellent for the price). However, their battery degraded more quickly than I anticipated. Admittedly, I dropped them a few times. Oopsies.However, the person I live with has a brand-new pair of the Soundcore Life Q30s (because of my recommendation I might add), and she let me borrow them so that I could do a direct comparison between her new headphones (the Soundcore Life Q30s) and my new headphones (the phonicgrid E7s). Below are the results.The phonicgrid E7's noise cancellation is comparable to the Soundcore Life Q30's. The Soundcore Life Q30s do have superior sound quality, higher quality materials, and I would imagine better battery life (if they're brand new)--but these phonicgrid E7s are superior in other ways; they're also no slouch on sound quality (and allegedly no slouch on battery life). . . . The phonicgrid E7s are much more comfortable, much lighter, have much better volume control (as well as better compatibility with my laptop's Bluetooth [but that is only one device and therefore a negligible sample size]), and they're CHEAPER! . . . Also, do you really want higher quality materials in your headphones? When it comes to metal and plastic, higher quality means harder and heavier--so, if you accidentally drop the headphones on your face, it will hurt more. Moreover, lighter headphones mean less strain on the neck and therefore the ability to use them for longer periods of time.In the areas where the Soundcore Life Q30s are superior to the phonicgrid E7s, the gap is small; in the areas where phonicgrid E7s are superior to the Soundcore Life Q30s, the gap is large. Overall, I would say that at the $29.99 price I paid for them, the phonicgrid E7s are a significantly better purchase than the Soundcore Life Q30s even though both are excellent values.In summation, if these phonicgrid E7s are on sale for anywhere near the price that I paid for them (which again, was $29.99), I suggest that you buy them immediately--before the sale ends.",
