                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic for the price!",
                "reviewText": "These Belkin bluetooth headphones are *fantastic* for the price (under $30). Amazon shows a number of critical reviews dragging down the review score for these based on pairing/connectivity issues, but like many older bluetooth devices, this can be very device-dependent with newer phones/tablets being more reliable.I'm glad I gave these a shot since I personally had no issues pairing the Belkin headphones with my Google Pixel 6. I paired them once and now the Belkin headphones connect immediately when turned on and disconnect immediately when turned off. I have multiple other bluetooth headphones and speakers paired with my phone, and they each connect perfectly to my phone when turned on (although I never turn on more than one headphone/speaker at the same time).These Belkin headphones fit great on my 6 year old daughter at the smallest setting. The headband has plenty of adjustment to the point where they could even stretch to fit my adult head, so they should continue to fit her well for years to come. One thing to note is that if you have larger teens, the thinner plastic in the headband becomes unsheathed when extended and I could see that being less durable. But at the smallest setting, these feel pretty sturdy, especially in light of how affordable they are.Sound quality and battery life are both more than acceptable for the price point and intended use for kids. My daughter thinks they are clear sounding and told me several times she appreciates how she can better hear the words in her favorite songs. She uses the headphones mostly for longer car rides, so I haven't been able to confirm whether it achieves the quoted battery life, but it is plenty long enough for our needs.Last thing to note: I suspect that the listening protection/maximum volume of 85 dB is for bluetooth only. I wanted to buy a bluetooth headphone that also can connect via wired since my daughter can use it when playing our keyboard/digital piano. However, when plugged in to our keyboard at full volume, these Belkin headphones get noticeably louder than they do over bluetooth. So if you're going to have your kids use these wired, consider supervising or monitoring the volume to avoid hearing damage!",

                "reviewText": "My kod is 1.5yrs old and this fits great at the smallest setting. Being his first headphones we didn't want to drop $100 on a pair. The $20 JLabs looked like it would be too big so we opted for these Belkins. The sound quality is as expected for the price range. When maxed out it didn't seem as loud as standard headphones. I could barely hear them at listening volume when they were sitting on the coffee table.On the first go, the tike kept them on for over 5 minutes. Whether it was the allure of Vivo or not, it was comfortable enough to not be bothered. He has since gotten more used to it. Hopefully, 2 months is long enough for him to enjoy having them on or else that 5hr flight is gonna be rough...Pairing them is very simple. I do not like how you cannot enter a pairing mode with a long press. Regardless of device, it needs to be unpaired before you can pair it to another device.Can't speak on the battery life too much since the kid hasn't used it enough to warrant a recharge. That being said, he's used it for at least 1 hr - longer if you include standby mode.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these for my 3 year old daughter. She will be traveling by plane for the first time, and I think these are going to be perfect! The overall fit is great and the design is perfect. I love that the product came with stickers, so she can decorate them. It only took 1 hour to fully charge the headphones, and pairing the device with Bluetooth was super easy! I tested the volume out myself before allowing her to use them. The sound is very clear and the perfect volume for a little one. I couldn\u2019t hear any noise from the headphones after she put them on, so I believe these truly are noise cancelling. I also love that there is an auto shut down that occurs after 5 minutes without use, so the battery doesn\u2019t get drained! Overall, I\u2019m very impressed. I hope the battery life is as great as all of the reviews have said!!! Don\u2019t hesitate! Make the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have TINY ears. I have never been able to wear ear buds because they would always hurt me or pop out within seconds of putting them in my ears. These fit in my ears AMAZINGLY! They don\u2019t hurt, don\u2019t pop out, and came with several size ear pieces (I have to use the smallest one they came with \ud83e\udd23.) They also have pretty good sound too. I like that they don\u2019t get louder than 85 decibels to protect my hearing. They have touch controls to switch songs, pause what you\u2019re listening to, answer calls, and control the volume.",

I have searched high and low for tips that fit because literally every other earphone I've tried would fall out, and I came across these and bought them because they had tiny size earbuds so I gave it a shot. The xxs fit perfectly in my ears (embarrassing) so I'm really really happy about that. HOWEVER... the mic sucks. I bought these pretty much solely for talking on the phone and apparently I sound muffled and as if I'm underwater. Sound quality on my end is great, music sounds great and clear, touch controls are easy. But if you are buying these to talk on the phone, don't bother. Only music? Get it. Need tiny tips? Absolutely, but find another brand of earphones to use the tips on. 3 stars for sound quality on my end and tiny tips.",
