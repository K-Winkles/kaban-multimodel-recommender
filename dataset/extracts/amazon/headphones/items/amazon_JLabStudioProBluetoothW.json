                "reviewText": "I've been an audiophile freak for close to 40yrs. As such, I mock cheap gear, especially the end gear, that being speakers and headphones. I did not buy these for myself, but was really impressed with the bass and overall sound quality. They are comfy on the head with no ear fatigue, and the battery lasts an hours long listening session with plenty to spare. Bluetooth range was adequate in the 1200sq ft, single floor listening space.Side note - I was not super familiar with JLab, and bought these only because I have a set of JL ear buds I use for podcast at work. While I cannot comment on sound quality of those based on podcasts, I have been impressed with the durability. Because podcast, I never spent much money on 'buds, and usually got 3-6mo out of a pair. The JL's have lasted 2yrs thus far. Based on that alone, I looked to JLab for a reasonably priced pair of full 'phones when one of my kids asked for a Bluetooth set. Again, I am pretty impressed.A note on poor reviews. I have seen a few complaining of buttons wearing out an sticking. I will update this review if that happens (I update ALL my reviews). As far as the complaints of them not pairing, failing after first use, and poor sound quality: You have to keep in mind $40 (believe it or not) is NOT a lot of money for headphones. That said, you have to expect some quality control issues. Bad sets will make it in a box. Cheap 'phones, or most anything for that matter, or a gamble. I honestly think these are a good gamble. Buy with confidence. On the off chance you get a bum set, JLab claims a 24-48 response to all issues. I am certain they will make it right. For best response, I would suggest you contact them directly. Google JLab for their website\u2026.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a long time fan of JLab. Though, I admit I have had a range of experiences with their products..... I have mostly hugged onto their studio line up since 2013. I have always had decent audio aside from a few models, decent connectivity aside from a few freak occurances. I recently daily drove the Studio Pros (standard) but had issues with the buttons after years of use so I moved to the Studio ANC (2 mics, round cups) and was left unimpressed with the volume and lack of ANC so I decided to get dirty and throw a few extra bucks into the fire and came back with these Studio Pro ANC (This Product). These took the best of all I know of JLab and combined them into a single pair of awe inspiring headphones. The sound is the same great JLab sound, volume is nice and loud when you want it, and includes 4 ANC modes. The highest ANC is certified to cancel my annoying sisters screaching by 90-some odd percent; which is a feat I thought to be impossible.The sound is awesome with the 3 EQ settings and gets even better when you run the burn-in tool. The burn-in tool plays a bunch of frequencies to loosen the diaphragm, your own music can also do this. I suggest breaking up the 40 hours into 4-6 hour increments so you can use them in-between sessions and also let the diaphragm rest of you care about that sort of thing. Or you could just skip burning in and just let your audio naturally work the diaphram over use.The cushions are impervious in comparison to the cushions on the similar designed studio pros (standard). The cushions are almost too comfy if that makes sense. I can't speak on the battery, I charged for about 30 mins when I received mine and haven't charged since, it's been about a week or so, but I'm not listening 24/7, I usually only log about 4-6 hours a day, possibly up to 8 between music and Netflix so I'm obviously not using them enough to reach the low battery warning between charges to be able to speak on that behalf. But if you consider 4-6 hours a day for a little over a week, I think that's kinda impressive. They support both aac and sbc codecs, which is good, though I wish they'd support more profiles that tie in to the android ecosystem like Qualicomm AptixHD or something like that.Overall, great experience. Cant go wrong with these pair, they are perfect for the price range and maybe even pretty decent in the range above.Buy it, you won't regret it.The only thing I wish was different is maybe the option to choose the color scheme and maybe app based sound preferences, but that would obviously tie these to a mobile experience and they shouldnt be restricted to just one environment.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good Overall for the Price; Lag Compensation is Very Annoying",
                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that for the price I do think these are great headphones for audio (as opposed to audio accompanying video; more on this at the end of the review). Studio Pros are durable, their battery life is fantastic, and most importantly they are super comfortable because each phone fits around your entire ear, and exerts no pressure on the ear itself, so they don't hurt after a long listening session (also with no synthetic fabric touching the ear, they're surprisingly a lot less sweaty than smaller headphones in warm weather).There is one substantial problem with this model that I wish J-Labs would fix, however: Probably in an effort to compensate for wireless audio transmission lag, these actually have a kind of reverse or negative lag, where the sound feeds on the headphone BEFORE it occurs in a video file. So, for example, if you're watching a movie you'll hear a character say a line about 1/5 of a second before you see their mouth move. It's a very pronounced effect and annoying/distracting enough that I mostly avoid using these headphones for video. This is my third pair of JL Studio Pros so I know this problem is a function of the model itself, not a malfunction with my particular set, and I also know it's something JL could solve for if they wanted to, because I've also had several pairs of JL AirSports and they do not have this problem.Keep in mind also that while the audio out is very decent for the price, audio in is extremely poor, all but non-existent; it's not a big deal as this technically isn't a headset, but worth noting if you intend to e.g. use them for work and go back and forth between listening to music/podcasts and attending meetings.Despite the few shortcomings, I still highly recommend.",
