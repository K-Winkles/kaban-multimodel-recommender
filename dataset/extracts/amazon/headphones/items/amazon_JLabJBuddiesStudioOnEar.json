That kind of durability is hard to beat!2. **Comfortable Fit:** My twins find these headphones comfortable to wear for extended periods. The on-ear design is just the right size for their little ears and provides a secure fit without being too tight.3. **Safe Volume Levels:** I appreciate the built-in volume control that ensures my kids' delicate ears are protected. It's a reassuring feature for a parent.4. **Tangle-Free Cord:** The tangle-free cord design is a small but appreciated detail. It saves us from the frustration of untangling knots every time they want to use their headphones.5. **Clear Sound:** Despite being budget-friendly, these headphones deliver surprisingly clear and crisp sound quality, allowing my kids to enjoy their music, movies, or educational content without any compromise.6. **Priced Right:** The affordability of these headphones is a major plus. I've bought multiple pairs over the years, and it doesn't break the bank.7. **Variety of Colors:** The availability of different colors is a nice touch, allowing my twins to pick their favorite and express their individuality.In summary, the JLab JBuddies Studio On-Ear Kids Wired Headphones have been a reliable and cost-effective choice for my twins.

                "reviewText": "My 12 year old daughter has adhd and autism. She is very sensitive, especially with tactile things like clothes, shoes, and headphones. We searched extensively for headphones she liked and when her first pair broke we tried to buy similar ones but she has been very consistent that these are the only ones that will do. I thought she might enjoy being cord free and tried buying some Bluetooth ones that were the same brand it was still a no from her. It's these or bust. The padding is comfortable for her and blocks noise a little too effectively. I have to really shout before she hears me trying to talk to her with them on. We have gone through a few pairs now. She is really rough on her things (I often find them on the floor or with cord wrapped in the brushes of the robot vacuum) and I'd say these usually last us about 6 months. Her sister really likes them too so we keep 3 pairs on hand so they each have their own plus an extra in case one breaks. This was the first time I saw them in pink and she was very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these and some JBL JR 300 to gift to a younger family member. I decided to test both and see which would end up being the better headphones.The JBuddies feel like they are made of stronger material, except the size adjustments sliders, which are just a couple of thin metal rods per side that seemed like they could get bent out of shape pretty easy. They also had a vulnerable point, the signal wires going to the ear cups are exposed and could snag on something or get pulled by absent minded fingers.The JBL JR 300 felt a little more plasticky, not much more. Also the fake leather covering the ear pads felt thinner. However there were no vulnerable wires or any overt weak points and no exposed signal wires. The cord is not a round wire, it is flat like a ribbon which feels kind of thin compared to a traditional round wire.I used a basic sound meter (factory calibrated, not certified) to test how loud they would get. Quieter is safer for young ears, so lower dB is better. Safety standards that are often quoted claim 85dB is the upper limit for safe sound levels.The JBuddies won out here, they wouldn't go past about 80dB no matter how much I tried to push them. The JBL JR 300 went right up to the line at 85dB.Next was sound quality, tested by having me and another family member listen to a variety of music.The JBL JR 300 easily won this comparison. The sound was cleaner, clearer, and bass/midrange/treble were balanced very well. These sound like adult headphones, just not as loud.The JBuddies had a touch too much midrange and lower treble. This gave them a sort of muffled sound. I found myself trying hard to hear some instrument, voice, or other sound.I ended up keeping the JBL JR 300, to gift to my family, and sending the JBuddies back. My reasoning was two-fold.First, the JBuddies thin metal rods and exposed signal wire don't inspire any confidence in it's ability to survive life with kids. The JBL JR 300 is a more solid structure and feels more kid-proof.Second, while the JBuddies maxed out at a lower volume, the more muffled sound quality caused me to want to listen at the higher volumes just to try and hear things better. The JBL JR 300, being clean and clear allowed me to hear at lower volumes and did not make me feel the need to turn it up.With a few adjustments, the JBuddies could be great kids headphones, I hope JLab refines them and puts out a better product in the future. I love their Retro Rewind Headphones, so I know they can put out something with more quality. Right now, the JBL JR 300 get my vote.",
