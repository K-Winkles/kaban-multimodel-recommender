Love the fact that they are connected to two devices at once, meaning, you have them connected to your computer to watch a movie, but they\u2019ve also connected to your phone. So, you\u2019re watching a movie and a call comes in, you can take it. And when you\u2019re done, the movie returns. This is all transparent and automatic.They sound GREAT. They feel GREAT on your ears for long periods of time.Love that they fold, they charge quickly, and their battery life is tremendous! In realtime experience, I\u2019ve used them for 16 hours continuously, without charging. Extraordinary.",

Beautiful balance and tone with a nice Soundstage. Comfort and fit are excellent. Spot on connectivity...Fast. No 3.5 but who cares. They're Bluetooth with over 60 hours of battery. If I want wired I'll head to my amp and get real serious. I got the beige and it's really stylish. I may pop for the grey just for fun. If I'd spent $99 I'd be happy with my purchase. At $40 it's a flat out steal. There's an app, but I haven't bothered. The sound out of the box is muy bien. No EQ. No nothing. Nice job, Edifier.",

                "reviewText": "There are a bunch of these headphones from Edifier and Anker, similarly priced. I compared the features and got what I wanted in this model: they fold, they have ANC, and they have an \"ambient sound\" setting which amplified the sounds around you so you can be aware of your environment. They have an app for adjustments.The sound might not be \"audiophile\" level, but they have solid mid bass without losing accurate treble. They get loud enough. No listener fatigue. And they were relatively cheap. It would be nice if the app had an equalizer instead of pre-sets. Happy with them.",

Since they\u2019re so obvious when you\u2019re wearing them, I wanted ones that fit my style but also didn\u2019t want to settle for rubbish sound or flimsy quality.I\u2019ve had them about 8 weeks now and so far these have been an excellent choice for the price. Easy to use, adequate noise cancellation and incredibly comfortable even for several hours at a time and despite the fact they are slightly too big (I have a small head so most run too big). A negative mentioned by others is the lack of a case but I\u2019ve been folding them and putting them in my bag with other things and they\u2019ve been fine. The sound quality seems pretty good to me, they paired effortlessly with my iPhone and they hold their charge well. When in use there is a flashing indicator which can be a bit distracting if you\u2019re using them in the dark/low light but that\u2019s about the only negative I can find.",
