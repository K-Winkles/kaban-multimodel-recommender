                "reviewText": "I did expect these to be decent headphones without knowing much about them. These were at a price point where I felt it, worthy to take a gamble and buy by them. So just to try them out, I purchased them and shipped them to my apartment. I get my tablet out because it's the only thing I've got readily available with a \u00bc\" TRS jack for headphones. I listen to mainly heavy metal and I also like some EDM of different varieties. They sounded great, as expected. So I had to see if they met other expectations. I got a guitar amplifier out, a small Yamaha practice amp. I also got out my Schecter Damien 8 Platinum with 808Xs. And I played the nastiest riffs into that Yamaha. These little headphones were loud and overwhelming, while being clear and precise to the tone. You couldn't tell a difference between the raw tone coming out of the speaker, and the sound coming from the headphones. The only difference was your atmospheric noise pollution was cancelled out. It's kinda like a personal sound room or studio experienced. These headphones are worth it. If you jam, give these a try.",

But I think the flexibility of the headphones help make up for it. Great entry-level headphones that work decently well for mixing audio!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered these for home use. They are larger than i had expected, but do collapse down into a carry bag, that is included in the purchase. Come with 2 different cord options. Ear pads fully cover listener's ear, which reduces background noise. While these are not actively 'noise cancelling', this fitment does block out some ambient background noise pretty well.Once on your head, there is a little pressure on your ears/side of head, but the padding on the ear pieces does help keep these comfortable.Sounds are clear, delivering the highs and lows quite well. I have used these with a couple different portable MP3 players, and the headphones have been able to take max volume and still maintain sound clarity. Other than for rating purposes, I don't think it would be advisable to utilize these at that volume level for extended time, but these will punish your ear drums if that is something you are looking for.Nothing but good things to say about these after a week of ownership. Hoping they last for a while!",

Musically, they are very impressive as well. I own many, many different headphones, most of which are MUCH more expensive than these, bought for more musical applications but amazingly, at this price point these have proven themselves to be amazing for a Podcast application. Don't spend a ton of money for nothing, give these a try, I very much doubt, that you will regret it.",
