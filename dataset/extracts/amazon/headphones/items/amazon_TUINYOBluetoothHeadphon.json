Sound is really good with great bass and a number of different equalizer settings built in! Feels good on the head and ears compared to most at this price range. Also comes with a USB charging cable and a standard headset cable ( if your device has a headphone jack). Wasn't watching the time but it seems to charge very quickly. I would definitely recommend these \u0125eadphones.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I\u2019m pretty satisfied with these headphones, though there were a few disappointments weighing against an otherwise quality purchase.The Pros:--The travel case. At this price point, it\u2019s a really nice addition to have a fitted travel case for your headphones, and this one is sleek and sturdy.--The look. I really like the look of these headphones, especially the white option - it just looks classy. As an added plus, I don\u2019t always like having a company name emblazoned on what I\u2019m wearing, and the white option allows the silver \u201cTuinyo\u201d brand name to be a lot less noticeable.--The easy setup. You can connect these headphones in just a minute with the simple directions, and I haven\u2019t had any connectivity issues or noticeable lag.--The fit and hold. These fit like a charm around my ears, and I wore them for a few hours without noticing any pain or discomfort at all. While I haven\u2019t used them for running or extreme exercise, I\u2019ve used them for yoga, housework, light workout videos, etc. and they grip snugly enough that there\u2019s no chance of them coming loose or falling off my head when I move.--The range. Though I haven\u2019t exactly measured the range of these headphones, they perform well enough that I can walk around my (smallish) house a bit while I\u2019m listening without having the sound cut out.--The battery life. Not disappointed with this at all! I haven\u2019t tested yet to see if it\u2019ll hit the full time promised - usually I just charge them in the evenings - but I\u2019ve listened all day without skipping a beat.The \u201cMeh\u201d:--Low to average sound quality. The audio quality of these headphones is about what you would expect from low-end headphones. It\u2019s nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. Switching from my $10 earbuds, I notice a slight decrease in quality - though fiddling with the equalizer can help a bit. That said, you get what you pay for, and after about five minutes of listening to my music I forget that there was a noticeable difference at all. Can\u2019t take a star off for this, because again, I knew what I was paying for.--Noise cancellation. Again, this is just okay - you get what you pay for. There\u2019s some noise cancellation properties, but you can definitely still hear sounds around you.--The build. These headphones are plastic and *feel* plastic. That\u2019s not to say that they don\u2019t seem durable - there\u2019s no give to them at all, and they adjust without feeling fragile. But if you\u2019re looking for a set that really feels premium, you\u2019ll need to invest in higher-end headphones.The Cons:--A disappointing quality flaw. Right out of the box, I was SUPER bummed to find a major aesthetic quality issue - the head cushioning is pulling away from the top plastic band on both sides (see photos). I wasn\u2019t expecting magic from these budget headphones, but I DID expect them to at least look just as shown in the promo photos. It\u2019s a position I definitely shouldn\u2019t have been in on day one :( It also doesn\u2019t speak well to these headphones\u2019 long-term lifespan.--The volume. Unless I\u2019m doing something wrong, it seems like these headphones don\u2019t tolerate *very* low volumes - the kind you listen to when you\u2019re trying to nod off at night in a quiet room. Beyond a certain (relatively high-volume) threshold, they\u2019ll just stop playing altogether, even if you continue lowering the volume on your device. This is true for both my phone and computer - I just can\u2019t get those nuanced, ultra-low decibels I can get from my other headphones.EDIT: --The one-device connection. Unfortunately, these headphones only connect to one device at a time. If you want to switch between your phone and computer, for example, you have to go into the settings of one device and disconnect them, then go into the settings of the other device to pair them. Kind of an annoying step.All in all, I\u2019d recommend these as a budget buy if you don\u2019t mind middling/average sound quality, but DEFINITELY be aware of the chance of receiving a pair with cosmetic flaws!7/8/2021 EDIT: Unfortunately, I DID end up returning these when I discovered they can only connect to one device at a time. That's on me for not reading the product description, I assumed it was a standard thing.",

When I turn up the volume just a bit, it pretty much muffles all sounds other than the music I am listening to. Its also much more comfortable than other headphones with nice cushioning. Sound quality is next to none, even rivaling top tier brands at triple digit cost.",

                "reviewText": "They come in a nice, sturdy case. Comgortable to wear, soft on the ears. I like the fact that they also come with an aux cord in case your device doesn't have Bluetooth or if it doesn't work or maybe if you simply want the assurance of a cord connection instead of a wireless one. I use them for work, connecting to laptop was super easy and quick, sound quality is pretty good, bluetooth connection is reliable, these headphones haven't given me any issues or inconvenience. Bought my spouse the same ones (different colour) and they both have been working perfectly fine!I spend around 4 hours on work calls every day and the rest 4-6 hours I usually listen to music non-stop and I've never had to put them to charge mid-day. I just connect them to charger once I'm done foe the day so that the next morning they're at 100% again. However, I sometimes forget to charge them and they've lived through the second day on the same charge as well, so I'd say the battery life is really good. Noise cancellation is good too, once I have them on, I barely hear what's going on around me. Overall - happy with the purchase!",

Ich habe sie t\u00e4glich mehrere Stunden im Gebrauch. Der Akku ist immer noch super sie sind immer noch super bequem und h\u00f6ren sich toll an. Ich werde sie weiter nutzen aber mir trotzdem demn\u00e4chst ein neues zweites paar zulegen damit ich ordentliche f\u00fcr unterwegs ect habe\ud83d\ude05 aber vielleicht hole ich nochmal die selben. Ich empfehle die Kopfh\u00f6rer auf jedenfall weiter \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb top Preis Leistung",

The quality is also quite good- they are sturdy and well made AND the sound quality is as good as much more expensive headphones. Very deserving of the 5 star review",
