                "reviewText": "Someone wrote that they returned them because they didn\u2019t work well with her laptop. Well I\u2019m here to tell you that they work just perfectly with my laptop! As well as for my dad\u2019s phone too (we purchased two of them).The battery life is phenomenal so far. I\u2019ve only been using them for about 3-4 days, so about a total of 6 hours of usage and they\u2019ve only gone from 75% battery to 60% in that time (the percentage can be seen on Bluetooth pairing settings in Windows 11).Granted, battery life tends to reduce over time but for the time being it\u2019s excellent. Not sure I believe it can last 65 hours actively from full though.Sound quality for the price I got these for is more than adequate too. I have an old $350 pair of Astros that sound obviously better but comfort wise they suck in comparison.Which brings me to my next point. Comfort. These Beribes headphones are the most comfortable cheaply priced set I\u2019ve ever worn. I\u2019ve tried several brands over the years and these take the cake by a long shot.The microphone included is something I believe every headset should have at the very least nowadays. It\u2019s funny how there will be some headphones that are super expensive like some Bose QC or something which wouldn\u2019t even have a simple omnidirectional mic. It\u2019s kinda pathetic imo. Well these do have one, omnidirectional meaning they take sound from all angles because they don\u2019t have a boom mic, but that\u2019s ok because it\u2019s not the main thing you buy them for anyway. Just nice to have if you\u2019re up get a call or use it for video conferencing like me.Only unfortunate thing is they can\u2019t be used for PlayStation 5 as it doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth headset without a USB dongle. Other than that they\u2019re perfection.They\u2019re currently at a discount for the holidays I assume and I can\u2019t recommend them enough if you need a pair of Bluetooth headphones for any Bluetooth capable device. They\u2019re fantastic and well worth it.",

The thing I like most is that they are lightweight, not too tight on my ears, and the sound quality is really good for the price. I ordered a second pair for my husband, and he also likes them as he can wear them comfortably with his glasses on. I need them for traveling on the plane and trains in Europe and these fit my needs perfectly. They connect easily with phone, computer, and Chromebook. I highly recommend.",

However, the charger it comes with it very short so the headphones have to sit on the floor next to the outlet.The volume buttons do not work at all. Nothing happens when you press them.The sound quality is okay. It sounds a little muffled compared to my wired headphones from a different brand. This isn\u2019t a big problem though. It\u2019s easy to get used to.These block out noise surprisingly well, even at a low volume. I\u2019m impressed with that!They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.I have not tried the microphone yet. I probably won\u2019t, because I got these for music, not phone calls.Overall I do like these headphones! I just wish the volume buttons worked and that it came with a longer charging cord.:)",

                "reviewText": "I've had these for about 5 months now and really like them. The reason I got them was to have some Bluetooth headphones I could wear when I go for walks or want to watch my shows without disturbing the rest of the family. My hearing is also not great, so it helps to have headphones, which improves my ability to hear what I am listening to or watching. I use them daily for around 2-5 hours or more. Typically I use them for watching videos on my iPad and Instagram/TikTok on my Android phone. I also like to wear them while working out (walking). They pair easily with both my devices. The controls work fine and they hold a charge for quite a few days. The noise cancellation is actually pretty good for cheap headphones! I definitely have to take them off to have a conversation and hear what my family members are saying. I was mostly worried that they would get dirty because they're white, especially since I wear makeup, but they haven't stained at all. The other concern I had was that the fake leather would fade or crack with how much I wear them while exercising, but so far it has held up very well. I like that they can fold up for travel but haven't needed to use that feature yet. Overall really pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "Better than expected.Coming from neckband-in-ear headphones (also BT5.3)- Comfort surprising. Very light and soft padding everywhere, ear fits in fine, nice for long wear. Only heats up with activity.- Sound: Can't be an audiophile over BT. Much better than in ear phones. Bass and volume is better for all categories of listening.- BT5.3: Anything with this chip has great battery life. The two source connect is a great feature. (one at a time, sound switches to a source when it goes from silent to playing.) Range is a bit better than neckband. Sadly it's got the odd British lady reporting connect and power. I like tones better.For the price, it's a great product. But don't expect beats or Bose performance.Buttons: Why is it beyond our technology suddenly to have enough buttons to run the thing? Shared functions on the +/- btns. But it's worse... they put volume on the long click. If you can't fit two more buttons, at least make it configurable as to which function is long-press (or add one toggle button to ctrl what btns mean). I need skip without digging for the phone for podcasts, etc. But adjusting volume with a long press is awkward and stupid. Just have two sets of +/- and charge another $5.",

                "reviewText": "BERIBES Cuffie Bluetooth Over EarPremetto che ho preso queste cuffie per una persona anziana che per sentire la TV metteva il volume a 70 \ud83d\ude01La TV in questione non era bluetooth e quindi ho dovuto acquistare anche un trasmettitore/ricevitore bluetooth da collegare al televisore Panasonic.Cosa arrivaAll'arrivo della confezione \ud83c\udf81 sono rimasto stupido da quanto piccola fosse. Invece all'interno ho trovato le cuffie \ud83c\udfa7 ben riposte con i cuscinetti auricolari che si piegano/ruotano in modo da occupare meno spazio. Oltre alle cuffie all'interno c'era un cavetto per la ricarica (presa type-C), un cavo AUX da 3.5 mm per poterle usare collegate direttamente alla TV ed un piccolo libretto di istruzioni. Non \u00e8 presente la presa ed ho usato quella del cellulare.DescrizioneLe cuffie sono molto carine, regolabili e con i cuscinetti pieghevoli/rotanti. Cuscinetti molto morbidi che non danno fastidio. All'interno di ogni cuscinetto c'\u00e8 rispettivamente la lettera L o R.Sulla cuffia di destra (R) troviamo la presa per la ricarica, il led indicatore della carica (blu/rosso) il pulsante di accensione/spegnimento due pulsanti per volume/brano (su/gi\u00f9 o precedente/successivo), la presa audio per il jack da 3.5 mm ed il microfono (che non ho provato).Sulla cuffia sinistra (L) troviamo solo il pulsante EQ per cambiare le varie modalit\u00e0 (classic, jazz, pop, ecc).UtilizzoAppena arrivate le ho caricate una decina di minuti (e la luce indicata era blu) per poter installare/collegare il tutto.Si sentiva un ronzio di fondo e infine l'audio era diventato mono.Temendo di aver fatto un errore nell'acquisto causa mancata compatibilit\u00e0 o con la Tv o con il trasmettitore bluetooth ho voluto riprovare e lasciare quindi le cuffie sotto carica per le 2 ore e mezza indicate per una carica completa \u23f1\ufe0f.Riaccesa la TV e fatto il pairing con le cuffie, l'audio \ud83d\udd0a si \u00e8 dimostrato veramente ottimo. A mio avviso sembra di essere al cinema, parere puramente soggettivo. Da quel momento chi le deve usare non se le toglie pi\u00f9 e grazie anche al fatto che si sente la TV anche dagli altoparlanti pure con le cuffie collegate (altoparlanti che si possono tuttavia inibire), anche chi \u00e8 in stanza pu\u00f2 ascoltare la TV ma ad un volume pi\u00f9 ragionevole \ud83e\udd23. Non ho utilizzato n\u00e8 provato il cavo AUX 3.5 mm in quanto non \u00e8 lungo abbastanza per poterlo utilizzare con la TV restando seduti in divano.Funzionalit\u00e0\ud83d\udd0b ricarica: Per una carica completa \u00e8 indicato 2 ore e mezza per una funzionalit\u00e0 di 65 ore. Se durano veramente 65 ore non lo so ma durano parecchio.Presa di ricarica: il cavo type-c si inserisce abbastanza facilmente ma \u00e8 un po' duretto nell'estrazione, cosa, dal mio punto di vista, non negativa.Accensione/spegnimento: per accendere le cuffie basta tenere premuto un paio di secondi il pulsante multifunzione (MTF) fino a che non si accende il led blu. Per lo spegnimento tenere premuto qualche secondo in pi\u00f9 lo stesso pulsante fino a che non si spegne il led.Per l'utilizzo che ne verr\u00e0 fatto e per le conoscenze di utilizzo di questa persona non le ho fatto usare nessun altro pulsante. Ho solo impostato tramite il pulsante EQ, posizionato nella cuffia sinistra, il suono a mio avviso migliore.ConclusioniQuello che dovevano fare lo fanno in maniera egregia, rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo ottimo. Non credevo funzionassero cos\u00ec bene.Adesso il volume della tv, per gli altri, \u00e8 accettabile.Funzionalit\u00e0: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Suono: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Facilit\u00e0 d'uso: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Estetica: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Per quanto mi riguarda hanno risolto un bel problema e visto il suono ed il prezzo che hanno posso solamente consigliarle \ud83d\udc4d.Spero di essere stato utile nella scelta, in tal caso fatemelo sapere. \ud83d\udc47 Grazie.",

                "reviewText": "The headphones work great, really like the colour as well. The sound quality of the microphone when talking on the phone isn't great, but that's to be expected with over the head style headphones. The noise cancelling works well and you can connect multiple devices to the headphones to switch between them easily. The only downside of this is that sometimes you can have trouble switching over the audio to the device you want when multiple are connected and might need to ensure the other device is disconnected to have the sound transfer. Overall, great value and would recommend.",
