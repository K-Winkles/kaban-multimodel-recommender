                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Look great and very comfortable!",
                "reviewText": "I got these as a replacement for my Power Locus 2 headphones. Though these don't have radio, they feel sturdier and I would choose to get these if I had to pick between the two. (At first I was upset that the P6's didn't have a radio function, but then I realized that I never used it on my P2's! Lol.) Anyway, as a general user, I'm very happy :) Pros and cons below.Pros:- Like the title says, they look cute and are comfortable. Especially in comparison to my P2 model, the P6 has thicker cushions and it's honestly nicer to wear them.- Battery life seems sufficient. I haven't timed it, but they have lasted multiple uses between charges.- Can reach low volumes. This is a personal preference, but I have sensitive ears. I've had a few bluetooth headphones and not all of them can go as low as I'd like. I had a pair that would go \"BLUETOOTH ON!!!!!\" and it was so loud and jarring! Awful. I hated it. So, for anyone else with sensitive hearing, these are free of that problem.- Customer service is *fantastic*! Like I said above, I'd previously had the P2 model. They had started to make a rattling noise, which was minor but annoying and affected my desire to use them. (The P6's feel sturdier and I'm hopeful that I do not have that problem with them.) Customer service stood behind their 12-month warranty and offered to replace the P2's or let me try the new P6. I should probably add that this review is for replacement headphones that were sent to me, but this is still my honest opinion.Cons:- Did not come with a hard case. The P2's came with a hard case as a carrier. This one only had a soft velvet bag. :( Definitely not as protective when traveling.- Noise cancellation is minimal. I think it has better noise-cancelling than the P2's (thicker cushions) but I would never say these block out other sound.I've tried a few bluetooth headphones off of Amazon over the years, and these are so far my favorites. I would recommend if you're looking for a general, comfortable, over-ear pair of headphones!",

                "reviewText": "$30 and it lasted me 7 months, considering I was using it near everyday anywhere from 4-10 hours a day. I would say they more than held up. They charge quick, just a few hours can keep them going for multiple days of use. They're comfortable and the padding never felt annoying no matter my hair length. They can fold in for easy transport, have a backup wire just in case they die. As well as being fairly durable, they've been out with me during thunderstorms and come back fine. As well as saved me from bumbing my head more than a few times at work. The only con I can think of is the built in microphone is not the highest quality. Though considering it's an internal microphone it's fair for the price. Mine eventually broke but I attribute this to not only the stress of what I put it through but how I had to wear it for work. With one muff over and ear and the the other behind my ear keeps the plastic sat at a weird angle. Eventually it snapped clean through the outer and inner band. Taking a look inside I can say the actual padding is a mix of a gel outer-layer and the inside has some memory foam too for added cushioning. Overall, you get more than what you pay for and if you only plan to use them casually without a stressful environment. I can see them lasting well over a few years. Worth the buy and the fun color selection makes it even better.",

I use them during the work day and have to charge them about every 2-3 days for about 30 minutes to get full charge back.

                "reviewText": "Aspectos positivos:- Est\u00e9ticamente son muy bonitos.- Perfecta compatibilidad bluetooth, f\u00e1cilmente reconocible y se conecta muy r\u00e1pidamente.- Alt\u00edsima duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda y adem\u00e1s se carga muy r\u00e1pidamente.- Sonido muy bueno. No soy un experto ni tampoco necesito una alt\u00edsima calidad, pero si quieres escuchar m\u00fasica o una pel\u00edcula sin molestar a nadie vas a poder hacerlo totalmente enfrascado con un buen sonido.Aspectos negativos:- En mi caso concreto el pabell\u00f3n auditivo no queda totalmente integrado en el casco como en otros modelos que he probado. Esto, a\u00f1adido adem\u00e1s a que uso gafas, genera algo de molestia e incomodidad en las orejas cuando pasa algo de tiempo.Si la zona de acople auricular fuera un poco m\u00e1s grande ser\u00edan perfectos.",
