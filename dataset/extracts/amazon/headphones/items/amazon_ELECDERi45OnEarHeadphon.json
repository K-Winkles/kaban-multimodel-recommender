The showed they would be delivered that same day and were a good price. My son uses them for his laptop to record music and said he loved how lightweight they were and they folded up to fit in his backpack. He also said how surprised he was by the quality of the sound and now wants me to buy a couple more pairs for backup, so I guess we found a winner. :-)",
