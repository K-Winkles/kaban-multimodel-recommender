                "reviewText": "We have a kiddo who has sensory processing disorder & finding headphones that she liked was a journey, nay a quest that started in elementary; kiddo will be a senior this year. We bought A LOT of different headphones at different price points & for one reason or another, she couldn't use them. She tried, she really did but we struck out over & over; too tight, too loose, too pinchy, too squishy, too hard, smelled funny etc, until we found these. We now keep a supply at all times in case they ever stop making them. (please, please don't do that!) Her friends, our niece & nephews, coworkers, art group members all ended up with all the others we didn't use, so bonus for them! She's not rambunctious with them & barring the occasional whoops (dog jumped on sofa, landed on them. I accidentally sat on a set that were also left on the sofa etc.) she wears them everyday almost all day and they can last a couple of years or more (unless she forgets to not leave them on the sofa!!) Sounds fine, mic works for video chat, online class, gaming etc. Comfortable on her ears, cords last the entire time. Breakage does happen after awhile, usually at the hinge. They might not please everyone but we love them! (Request that a black & neon green color scheme be made though! \ud83d\ude09)",
