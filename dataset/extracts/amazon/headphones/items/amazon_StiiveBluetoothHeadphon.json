They do get a little uncomfortable in my ears if I wear them for >60 minutes, but they also stay in my ears very well, they are great for running/working out.

                "reviewText": "I've been searching for the \"ideal\" bluetooth earbuds for two decades now, and have finally found them. I use them for sleep, providing background noise without which I can't fall or stay asleep. First and foremost, they had to have a strap between the earbuds - I've had many fine pairs of earbuds with no strap, and still have one bud from each of them, the other having vanished almost immediately. A close second requirement is battery life. Less than 8 hours is a pain. These have 16 hours of battery life, the best I've ever seen, and it is honest. Sound quality is quite good, as is the noise cancellation. They're rugged, the controls are first rate, and they're visible without being garish - that makes them harder to lose. They're the best overall I have ever found, and a great value.",

                "reviewText": "Before I start with the positives, I want to give you all a warning about these \"waterproof\" earbuds that you might want to know about.My main caveat with these earbuds is that they're not entirely waterproof, even to slight water damage such as rain. The design features a small foam cube on the inside of the right earbud. This cube is meant to provide a cushion for the volume buttons, but is very susceptible to retain moisture. Should you take this in the rain for instance, this cube could get wet and damage the wiring inside the hardware. These designs try to prevent this from happening by adding a wax coating between the foam cube and the circuit board, but it is still not enough. I have had many earbuds of this design and they always have wiring problems, such as one earbud completely losing signal and damaging the sound quality. I have had to return these earbuds for a replacement because I accidentally left them on a shelf in my shower. Bear this in mind when you purchase these earbuds.Outside of that, these are outstanding earbuds for the price due to two things: the USB-C port and the insane battery life. The sound quality is decent, but it is nothing compared to the battery life. I work long hours and have had these earbuds on my head for over 24 hours and I have had no low battery signal. I have even left these earbuds on overnight by accident and still have enough juice to get me through a workday. It is by far the most battery I have gotten from earbuds of this price.It's even better that these headphones have a USB-C port. If you are not familiar, a lot of old devices have used various ports, such as Micro USB. These designs were inconvenient, and could not be plugged in except for a specific angle. USB-C does away with that and allows you to plug into your headphones at any angle. I'm glad this is slowly becoming the standard, as even stingy Apple have adopted this with their devices.For the price, it's a must own. My only other negative thing would be that the headphones do not power off on their own like previous models do. Sometimes I forget that it's even on and, like I said, I have had moments that it had stayed on overnight. As long as you're a little mindful, it's not a big deal. These headphones are great to have! I would highly recommend them.",

The ear pieces stay in place for me just fine (your ear shape may vary). Telephone check was successful proving the microphone works. What a great value. Multiple size buds are included.",

                "reviewText": "Great sound when new and for about 8 months or so (until issues started - see next para). USB C charging was a plus. Charges fast and charge lasts for a long time. Connects pretty well to devices. Good range. Used it both indoors and outdoors (hot and cold weather). Great for hiking.However, these kind of headphones invariably seem to stop working after a few months (8 months in this instance). In my case, the left headphone has stopped working almost completely, which is annoying. I have to buy new ones again and I\u2019m not sure I will be buying this brand again.On the whole, quite cheap compared to the more expensive headphones. I did like them and used them often. But would have liked these to last at least a year. The limited reliability is why I have to give it 3 stars.Buy it if you only need an option that lasts 6 months or so - in which case these are quite ideal and would work out great for you.",

Resta valorar cu\u00e1nto duran a mediano plazo y si efectivamente su clasificaci\u00f3n IPX7 es real ya que necesito someterlos a rutinas de ejercicio exigentes. Por ahora, sorprendido y contento con estos aud\u00edfonos.---ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N: Despu\u00e9s de m\u00e1s de un mes de uso y con rutinas a veces muy exigentes en cuanto a sudor, los aud\u00edfonos siguen funcionando sin ning\u00fan problema.
