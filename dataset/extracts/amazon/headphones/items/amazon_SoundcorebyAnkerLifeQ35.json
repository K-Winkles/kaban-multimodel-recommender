                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing HiFi sound. Tremendous value!*Update*",
                "reviewText": "I am a giant Anker fan. I have owned their cords and cables for years as they have always been high quality items at reasonable prices. A few years back, Anker branded their speakers and headphones under the Soundcore label. Soundcore follows in the footsteps of their parent company in making really high quality stuff at a great price point. These Q35's, while not as inexpensive as their prior models, are simply amazing. These are the first Soundcore headphones to offer the LDAC Sony codec which makes them capable of HiFi less compressed sound. You will be able to take advantage of listening to Spotify on the very high quality setting or, better yet, really hear Tidal Masters the way they are meant to be heard. I am not a giant over ear guy. I have a ton of ear buds. My wife has the world class Sony WH-1000XM3's which I have traveled with a great deal. I owned the Soundcore Q30s for a few days, loved them, and gave them to my oldest who was whining that he needed a pair. I currently own the Microsoft Surface 2s that I got primarily for working from home. Love them but the sound is just average for music. So, enter the new Q35's. I have had these about a week. Here is the breakdown:-Sound / App: It is amazing. One of the reviews complained about sounding muddy. I am no audiophile but I just don't hear that here. These are crisp and vibrant sounding. Yes, Soundcore does tune these to emphasize the low end a bit. They come preset to the \"Soundcore Signature\" profile. However, Souncore gives you a very robust app to work with. Just get in there and tune these to your liking. You can use one of their many presets or make your own custom sound. When you get these going with a high quality stream, at the risk of sounding overly dramatic, it is breathtaking. Listening to The National, The Eagles, and Metallica on Tidal all just sound incredible. Great lows, full mids, crisp highs, all of which are nicely separated and balanced. Beautiful to listen to. Also, when watching video there is zero discernible latency. Voices match what you are watching. Well done.-Battery life / Connectivity: Really as good as it gets. 40 hours or so with ANC on and 60 hours without. Just about best in class. Bluetooth 5.0 is here so easy pairing and rock solid range and stable connection.-Active Noise Cancellation: If there is an area to ding these, it is here. The ANC is good. Soundcore has been steadily improving in this arena for some time. It is not Sony / Bose good. However, for most, I believe this ANC will be more than fine. It should handle planes and traveling. The only things that really get through are sudden high frequency sounds. Again, overall good, but just not as spectacular as everything else Soundcore offers here.-Form Factor / Controls: The Q35's build is outstanding. They feel great in your hands. Not like $129 headphones should feel. I feel no discernible difference in quality from the Sony headphones. The controls are handled via physical buttons on the right can. The left can has power and the ANC toggle. One nice feature that Soundcore borrowed from Sony is that you can enter transparency by simply resting your hand over the right can. It's great! Something new I love is autopause. All my buds have this but I have never seen over ears use this. Simply slide a cup off of either ear and whatever you are listening to pauses. It is really helpful. My son walked up to me and began speaking. I didnt miss anything he said and didn't need to worry about pausing my content. Great addition! Soundcore also gives your a 3.5mm audio cable if you want to go wired. I haven't tried it here yet but it worked great on the Q30's.-Call Quality: The Q30's were nothing special with how they handled calls. The Q35's still aren't special but seem to be vastly improved. They have added an AI algorithm to the beam forming mics that seems to be more effective at isolating your voice especially in loud environments. I still get too much wind noise when outside but calls are solid and very capable here overall.I will update as I go here. For $129, Soundcore is offering you a tremendous value proposition. HiFi sound, good ANC, great battery, and tremendous build quality. If High Fidelity sound isn't your bag, get the Q30's. Same build, same ANC, and same great app, for about half the price. However, if you want to really hear music buy these, find some uncompressed (or less compressed) music, and enjoy. It really is something you need to hear.*Update* I have really been pounding these and didn't really say anything about comfort. They are lightweight and very comfortable for long term wear. I am a hot guy (sweaty not physically) by nature and these are warm but overly hot like so many over ears I have worn. I have had them on now for about two hours tonight. All good. I am warm in there but not too much so. Solid.***Update for later model Samsung users***So one really important note I just figured out thanks to testing the new B&W PI7's is that you really want to make sure you have HD Audio (in this case, LDAC) enabled on your device. Samsung actually deactivates it by default. If you go in to developer options, you can turn it on. Go to \"about phone\", go to \"software options\", and find your Android build number. Tap on that 7 times. Back out and go to \"developer options.\" Connect your Q35's to your phone (or any LDAC capable headset) and then scroll down in developer options and you should see an HD Audio button. Slide that over to activate it and it should automatically connect to your highest possible streaming option that headphone offers. Don't worry, you will not hurt anything here. Get your Tidal account going or move your Spotify quality to \"very high\" and you will be off to the races. Game changer for me and my S21 Ultra!",

                "reviewText": "I've been an Anker/Soundcore fan since Anker first started selling on Amazon. The products never fail to amaze me. I listen to a lot of music and have several pair of over-the-ear ANC headphones, several generations of earbuds, the X600 Spatial Speaker, and my partner and I both have Wakey's on our nightstands. (not to mention power cord and other accessories) Yes. I am a hard-core fan!Over the years, I've only had 1 or 2 warranty claims. They've always been handled well, with no hassle.My Q35s started to feedback on the left side. Typically, this is a microphone issue related to noise canceling. This was a repeating issue with my high end headphones (starts with a B) and why I switched to Anker/Soundcore in the first place.After going through all of the troubleshooting steps, I was not able to resolve the problem. I called Customer Service and was cheerfully assisted by Justin. He quickly got my info and a replacement pair is on the way.Seriously, though, I can't say enough about these products. They are durable, dependable, have more range, are comfortable and sound better than my high end big name headphones at 1/3 of the price.Keep making a superior product. Anker has my business for a lifetime.If you're on the fence about any of their products, just go for it already. You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Comfort and Fit:This product is very comfortable yet will fall of your head VERY easily if you try exercising with them (or even just bending down to pick something up). I tried using these for the gym and ultimately I just would not recommend. These are perfect for watching movies and sitting/laying somewhere. You could go on walks with these with no issues but running/weight lifting (primarily deadlifting and any exercise that consists of a lot of movement) on will make this a challenge to keep on your head. Comfort is a 10/10, never get tired of wearing these and never get any discomfort. Fit is a 6/10 for how loose the headphones feel almost always and I have a pretty large head so I'd expect it to fit more tightly on me.Noise Cancelation and Transparency Mode:Noise Cancelation on these are pretty good. They for sure block out a lot of background noise and when you're listening to music, there's rarely noises that will break through. 8/10 rating for that. The transparency mode amplifies the noises around you very well and is useful when talking to people around you. 9/10 rating.Sound Quality:AMAZING sound quality. I feel as if I'm in a theater whenever I watch movies and listen to music. You can hear every little detail thrown at you. Truly worth the money for the sound quality. The only downside is there can be a lot of adjusting to make these sound amazing. I spent SOOO much time adjusting these to make them sound just as I wanted them to sound. The soundcore app just has so many different options for EQ settings that it can be a hassle finding the right one, especially if you're nitpicky (like me haha). For those wondering, I'd recommend the acoustic, piano, flat, or your own personalized EQ setting when you get the chance to customize this set of headphones. 9/10 for sound quality.Volume Control:The controls as shown in the photos I've included look simplistic yet they can be hard to remember which is which when using them while being worn. I have had these for a few months and still can't entirely remember the controls all the time. The touch controls as well as the headphones ability to stop the music/video once you take off the headphones is annoying. Had to be turned off. It's hit or miss with it for it simply doesn't work all the time. The touch controls also had to be turned off. Just found the button for NC was easier to click to change modes.Overall, I'd say these are a great set of headphones yet there are some flaws. The battery life is amazinggg and the quick charge feature is great. If you want a pair of headphones for relaxing and not exercising, these are for you!",

                "reviewText": "I have only had this for few days so far.I was taking a leap of faith based on the reviews on amazon. I did go to YouTube for further reviews as I do with all electronics specifically. You get a better clarity of what you will be getting with more objective pros and cons of any product to make your own informed decision.They do fit comfortably the area for the ear is spacious and I feel no pressure on my ears even after having them on for hours. They are light weight and do not get hot and sweaty like my old over the ear headphones.For me the sound is clear and the equalizer available through the app helps to adjust to my further liking. I will admit my expectations for sound in extreme highs, lows and base are not as atuned for those who look for that. I consider myself an average person and I did not find the sound muddy at all as some said. Have had very clear calls. Music sounds good for me not muddy or too much base. Good for listening to audio books too.I have only tried these on the balcony and noise canceling is not complete. You still hear very muted background noise but in anc mode music and voice are heard very clearly despite that. Again I think complete ANC where completely blocking out all outside noise is not necessary for the average person. For $110 this does enough to make me happy.Took a few tries to get use to buttons on the headphones. Once I did was able to go to anc and transparency mode by just pressing my palm to the right side of headphone. Been easy to pause by just taking the right headphone off the ear. Volume buttons easy to adjust.One thing I'm waiting to see if it's an ongoing issue is when wearing headphones there are random pauses for a second or two. It continues playing on its own. This only happens sporadically at random more likely a connection issue when other app notifications are coming in. This happens with all Bluetooth devices. Going to see if there is a difference if I turn other notifications off.For now I'm impressed for spending $110 (got the promo price still good value at reg price of $160)these are a great value headphone with all it features. Not everyone can spend $300+ for the same features. I have spent for more expensive models only to regret that I really did not get my moneys worth.Bonus with app I have access to ambient sounds for sleep. Rain, camp fire, ocean, birds chirping, chimes, wind and more in any combination.",

                "reviewText": "Ich bin ein sehr aktiver Musikh\u00f6rer und h\u00f6re Musik in allen m\u00f6glichen Genres, und ich kann mit Sicherheit sagen dass diese Kopfh\u00f6rer sich \u00fcberall gut machen! Der Sound ist einfach nur bombastisch und du kannst die Lautst\u00e4rke super hoch drehen um wirklich alles aus diesen Dingern rauszuholen. Das beste ist die Qualit\u00e4t vom Sound, denn der ist sogar auf sehr lauter Lautst\u00e4rke immernoch angenehm (kann je nach song variieren aber generell schon). Die App f\u00fcr diese Kopfh\u00f6rer bietet verschiedene Equalizer Presets an, die ein MUSS sind! Ohne den Equalizern ist der Sound flach, aber das ist ja der Sinn dahinter, jedes Presets passt wunderbar zum Genre und viele Davon sind universell verwendbar ohne den sound komplett kaputt zu machen f\u00fcr andere genres (ich h\u00f6re gerne alles auf HipHop preset weil es einen klaren Sound verschafft aver trotzdem den bass st\u00e4rker h\u00e4lt). Diese Kopfh\u00f6rer sind nicht die teuersten aber daf\u00fcr ist die Qualit\u00e4t \u00fcberagend. Die sind zwar aus Plastik, aber so verarbeitet dass man nicht das Gef\u00fchl hat das sie 30 Euro kosten, da hier verschiedene Materialien verwendet werden und auch optisch sie sehr gut aussehen mit matten und gl\u00e4nzenden Elementen. Auch sind sie super bequemen und gut gepolstert, halten auf dem Kopf sehr gut und ich kann damit den ganzen Tag Musik h\u00f6ren ohne dass ich schmerzen an den Ohren bekomme. Und nat\u00fcrlich das Noice canceling! 3 Varianten in der App, und alle wunderbar, lassen kein ger\u00e4usch durch, schirmen alles ab, sogar beim lautesten Staubsauger im Haus oder einer Bohrmaschine drau\u00dfen wird's einfach still. Die Akkulaufzeit betr\u00e4gt 48 Stunden wenn man Musik spielt aber keiner h\u00f6rt so lange durch, deshalb halten sie locker paar Wochen bei regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger Nutzung durch.Die sind das Geld wert wenn ihr auf top Qualit\u00e4t setzt und guten Sound sch\u00e4tzt! Ach ja, die kann man auch super falten und transportieren. Auf jeden Fall sage ich Danke an soundqore f\u00fcr so was!",
