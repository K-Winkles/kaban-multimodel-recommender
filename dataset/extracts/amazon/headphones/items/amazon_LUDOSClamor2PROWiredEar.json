                "reviewText": "SO. It all started the other day when my favorite earbuds of 7 years finally kicked the bucket. They had come to me bundled with an old phone purchase, and to my despair, were discontinued/out of stock everywhere. I was desperate to find a replacement but nothing out there seemed to fulfill the basic features I was looking for, namely: a 90 degree headphone jack, volume and microphone support, and a durable braided cord covering.In come these earphones from LUDOS! This design had precisely everything that I wanted out of a set of earbuds plus change. The 90 degree jack is personally a HUGE win for me and the chief reason why I chose these over the original Clamor. I'm loving the easy-to-operate volume slider and the magnets that help keep the earbuds together. The foam tips are comfy and the sound quality is great. Absolutely worth it for the price!I was a little confused since I couldn't find this updated model on the LUDOS website, but I guess it hasn't been added yet because it's a new listing. Really hoping that more colors are planned for this model - I would love to get this in the grey or gold that the original Clamor is available in. This time I'm going to make sure to get backups! :)",

                "reviewText": "These are something else. I was looking for something small and wired for my laptop so I didn't have to lug around my large Sonys in my laptop bag.After doing some searching I came across these and they ticked all the boxes. Small, inline mic, and inexpensive. Now I don't claim to be a headphone master or audiophile but what I can say is for the price, you're getting a lot of value. The first thing I noticed is the overall build quality. Nice, fabric wrapped wire that feels durable. The inline mic is pretty standard for earbuds of this type but otherwise no complaints from anyone that they can't hear me. Something I really like is the fact that they're magnetic. This should in theory keep them from getting too tangled in your pocket or gym bag. Speaking of which they also include a decent little bag to keep them in.But how do they sound? For the price? Superb. Deep lows and bright highs. Subjective, but I'd recommend playing with your EQ a bit to get them sounding just right. Out of the box they still sound fantastic. And the addition of a volume slider on the inline mic is nice.Something else that makes these unique is the use of memory foam for the actual ear plug. They're very comfy and come with an assortment of sizes for all different ears. I have the yellow set pictured (Others in the package are black).So you want something wired to keep in the desk, gym bag or even just for casual listening? Give these a try. Amazing for the price.",

Useful for taking calls remotely say from a cafe with ambient noise.- They're my primary set of wired work headphones now.- Not great for listening to music - the stereo effect is mediocre.- Good for both Mac and PC",

                "reviewText": "The good: pretty decent sound quality, nice volume control slider, several size optional earbuds to try.The bad: the memory foam earbuds that came installed, and which I\u2019d hoped meant they\u2019d fit and stay in my ears well, were too big for me. (Do I have small earholes? I don\u2019t think so but maybe.) Installing one of the other options was difficult but once done, I found with effort I could squeeze them into my ears. Not ideal but worth a try \u2014 time to go for a run. That\u2019s when I discovered the controls aren\u2019t compatible with my Shuffle \u2014 thought I was getting play/pause, fwd & rev controls but no, just volume slider and a button that did nothing (answer calls? I don\u2019t need that, it\u2019s a Shuffle).Now for the grumpy: why is it so damn hard to find headphones for my Shuffle? I have headphones I like but they have no controls, so I\u2019ve been using a Belkin dongle to patch that in; worked fine until it didn\u2019t, a loose wire or something = sound cutting out in one ear. Went to replace that and\u2026$35 for a wee dongle?? C\u2019mon, Belkin, get real. Ridiculous, I guess my old Etymotics are due for retirement (too bad b/c these have very thin, long tubes that fit well into the ear canals, with soft silicone grips to keep them in place \u2014 but no controls). Apple earbuds have the controls I need but quality is not commensurate with price, and they fall out of your ears easily.The search continues\u2026",

These came with a good range of options for tips. They fit great and the volume is amazing. I like that the cord is not the silicone or plastic stuff, maybe it'll survive being chewed on by my cats...or kids. Great quality, comfortable, and great sound. The tips do take a bit of effort to change out but I know the tips aren't going to fall or slide off easily.",

The sound is so much better than expected, I'm playing Wu-Tang as I write this amd the base is great. Their comfortable, I can shake my head and they dont fall out. I'm 5' from my TV and March Madness is on and I've got the volume on \"I'm doing chores around the apartment and want to hear the game\". I can't hear the TV at all.Would have been 5 stars across the board but I'm not sure I will like the volume slider and I can't speak to the mic, which for me is crucial and I can't speak to durability.
