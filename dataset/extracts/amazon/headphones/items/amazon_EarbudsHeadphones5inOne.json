I had tried earbuds that were shaped like these without the \"ear pads\" and they were great, didn't fall out of my ears all the time like the other. So I saw these and gave it a try. Design is the same as the others, but they don't stay in my ears quite as well... but the sound is good. I think for the price I got a great deal.Aug 15, 2022 update - I went through 3 of the 5 sets I bought in about a little better than a year. For the price I'm thinking that is ok. I still love how they fit my ear. I know all wired items like this are delicate and since I'm wearing them almost all the time. I've had them in while my iphone dropped from my pocket - at least my phone didn't land on the cement but I think it damaged the wire. So for about $3 each I can't complain. My husband wanted to watch his portable dvd player, forgot his headset I loaned him my earbuds and he was happy. He is EXTREMELY hard of hearing but without his hearing aids in he was able to here with these buds. I'm buying another set. I'm thinking that I could spend a lot more and the expensive ones would not survive any better than these affordable ones.",

Sounds are very clear and crisp esp on phone calls. I was delighted to finally have good sound quality on my calls. No more struggling to hear. I am very happy with my purchase.

If you play a lot of games. or use your phone a lot. and find yourself constantly pulling something. out of that 3.5 mm earbud hole., these may be what you need. especially if you have kids. or are clumsy yourself and might be prone to breaking earbuds that are more expensive.

These all broke within two days of use, and I am not rough with them. They are loose where the nub goes into the speaker jack and where the button is for the microphone. I lost four of them within a week. Not happy.As I said, this used to be my go to place for these, and they worked, but now no.",

                "reviewText": "These are great for the price. They're cheap headphones and appear to be cheap headphones, but good for the price. I would have guessed that these were $5 earbuds. The sound isn't spectacular but it is loud and clear. (I have bought dollartree headphones before, these are WAY better than that.) I'm guessing they won't last forever but no earbuds do for me and I have many pairs in this case. I haven't used the microphone yet, and the microphone was not important to me. The button doesn't work on my phone, but that could be my phone and it really didn't matter to me. These are nice to keep a pair in a backpack etc so you always have them, and nice to have if expensive earbuds stop working to always have a pair.",

                "reviewText": "It says they are noise canceling, but they aren't, I can hear everything going on around me throughthem unless my volume is almostall the way up. The sound is kind of muffled compared to my Sony earbuds I had before these. They are uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. So if you like to listen to music every waking hour like me I would not suggest these.",

I often get annoyed about my younger brother being too loud in his room, but I cannot hear him when I use these headphones! The noise cancellation is very good and they fit more comfortably in my ears than iPhone headphones or any other earphone shape I\u2019ve tried. Also, the quality of the sound is very crisp and clear ~ And it\u2019s super cool that they came in nice pastel colors - so cute :-)",
