                "reviewText": "The overall construction is better than most dollar store headphones, with a slightly higher quality plastic and the metal within the headband. The cable hasn't frayed on me, and both connection points feel sturdy. They are very light and hollow but that actually helps them stay comfortable for longer. Unlike many pairs of cheap cans, these ones extend pretty far and clicking between the adjustment levels isn't impossible. My only gripe with the fit is the fact that the cups don't swivel, meaning the larger you set them the more they won't lay flat against your head and the bottoms will begin to dig in. But again because of how light they are, it's not that bad. The headphones get nice and loud, another problem budget ones can run into. The passive noise cancellation is better than I thought from how hollow they are. Finally, the sound quality is good enough and what you would expect, slightly muddy, weak bass, and harsh highs. But I'm sure if your looking at these that's not a problem.TLDR: They are fairly comfortable, don't feel like they're going to break from normal use, get loud, and sound decent.",
