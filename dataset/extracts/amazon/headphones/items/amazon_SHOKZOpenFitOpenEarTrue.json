Shokz DirectPitchTM technology uses reverse sound waves to optimize the distance and angle between the sound source and the human ear. CAN OTHERS HEAR YOUR MUSIC OR CALLS? No, generally they can't. OpenFit uses DirectPitchTM technology, which amplifies sound pressure in directions toward the ear canal, and cancels sound and pressure in directions angled away from ear canal. This greatly reduces sound leakage. DO YOU NEED TO USE OPENFIT WITH AN APP? You can use OpenFit without an app. However, the Shokz App can help you customize your listening experiences. You can personalize your EQ modes, and button functions, access real-time power information, and update the firmware through the Shokz App. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE BATTERY LIFE OF OPENFIT? OpenFit provide up to 7 hours of listening on a single full charge. The charging case extends the earbuds to 28 hours of listening. The actual battery life depends on the volume, sound source, product features, use habits, and other factors. ARE OPENFIT WATER AND SWEAT RESISTANT? OpenFit earbuds are IP54 water-resistant. The earbuds are designed to be resistant against dust and drops of water but aren\u2019t meant to be submerged under water. We don't recommend you wear them in heavy rain or wash them with running water.",

                "reviewText": "I have loved my Plantronics BackBeat Fit buds for 8 years. While I am not an aficionado, I do appreciate and enjoy good sound quality, which is the main reason I kept the Plantronics for so long... I tried a few other brands over the years, but none of them could outperform the Plantronics.Until these Shokz OpenFit.Though the Shokz are not IN ear buds (like the Plantronics), they are still warm and rich, and full of bass, even set to the standard EQ.The very BEST thing about the Shokz, though, is how comfortable they are. Seriously, I forget they are there. And, they stay put! I have tried shaking my head back and forth at all angles of tilt, and they don't budge.The open ear design of these is perfect for me, as I like to experience my music while still maintaining a connection to ambient sounds. I love to cycle and hike, especially. These buds, and the speakers, do not cover your ear canal at all. They rest above that, but still deliver full, satisfying sound.I like to listen to many styles of music from dub/reggae to jazz and classical. They all sound terrific through the Shokz, again, even with no tweaking of the standard EQ. With the jazz, cymbal sticking is crisp and clear, and every nuance on the snare and toms comes through richly. Guitar, keyboards, sax - all rendered excellently. Classical music sounds clean, warm and vibrant. Dub drum and bass is punchy - plenty deep for me, and if I want more, I have the option of boosting the bass with an EQ preset, or with a manual adjustment.Touch controls on the buds work well to play/pause music, accept a call/hangup, and FF or REW a track. Unfortunately, there is no volume control on the buds. It's the only minor drawback that I can think of.The Shokz app is a nice touch, too.Overall, I can say within two hours of owning and using these, that they are fantastic. They make me want to use them!",

                "reviewText": "**Shokz Earphones: A Heartwarming Experience**As someone who recently purchased Shokz earphones for my 80-year-old mother, I am delighted to share this glowing review. Initially, my mother was apprehensive about embracing such new technology, but her concerns quickly dissipated. The ease of connecting via Bluetooth and the auto-pairing feature brought a sense of simplicity and relief.**Comfort: Unparalleled and Forgettable**The most striking aspect is the comfort these earphones provide. My mother, who wore them all day, even forgot they were on her ear! This level of comfort is a testament to their design, especially for someone of her age.**Sound: Crystal Clear Communication**The sound quality exceeded our expectations. During calls, I noticed a remarkable clarity in her voice, and she reported hearing me much clearer than through the phone's speaker. This improvement in our communication has been a game changer.**Overall Satisfaction: A Perfect Choice for the Elderly**In summary, these Shokz earphones have been an excellent investment. They offer superior comfort, exceptional sound quality, and are incredibly user-friendly for the elderly. The added convenience of a large, rechargeable case that attaches to her keys alleviates any worries about her losing them or having them fall out. This purchase has brought not just a technological upgrade but also peace of mind and joy to both our lives. I am thoroughly pleased with this product and highly recommend it, especially for older adults.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice upgrade from OpenRun with some drawbacks",
                "reviewText": "I have used two different shokz bone conduction headphones in the past, starting with the aeropex and most recently had the openrun pro. Keeping my ears open while exercising outside is very important to me and those definitely delivered that. Sound quality however was never a strong suit of them and I found that overtime both started developing excess vibrations or rattling. Most recently the openrun pro has started vibrating a lot after some time of use while exercising, potentially from sweat between the driver and my skin. I also found them super comfortable to wear, but since both sides were connected, they were exactly compact.I only have a short time with the openfit, but I think I have a decent idea of some of the pros and cons as compared to the openrun pro.Pros:- Sound quality. Its a noticeable improvement over the openrun pro. Bass actually exists with these. Its still not top tier, but for an open ear product, I think its pretty good.- Still open ear. While it covers your ear a bit more it doesnt seem to block out much if any sound. Situational awareness seems to be just as good as the openrun. Obviously if you need isolation, these are not for you.- TWS. These are much smaller and more compact than the openrun since each ear is separated. Still have ear hooks, so I think they will be stable without any worries about losing one or the other.- Charging case. Having a compact case to carry them around with and provide extra battery life is nice.- USB C. The charging case charges via usb-c instead of a proprietary connector with the open run. No more worrying about having to bring a special cable.- Comfort. They are very comfortable to wear and very lightweight. No more loop around the back of your head getting in the way of things.Cons:- Comfort. Also a con since part of it has to actually protrude over your ear canal and its been more noticeable while wearing them while I could pretty easily forget that I was wearing the openrun pro. I expect I will get used to them, but I do find it a step down.- No multipoint. I use these with both my phone and my watch, and now have to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices. The openrun pro had multipoint and while my watch sometimes had issues connecting, I at least never had to manually go into pairing mode just to switch between devices.- Controls. There are touch controls on each earpiece. They can be customized which is nice, but by default volume control isnt enabled, and can only be enabled on long press, which is 3 seconds. It feels very long to hold down for 3 seconds for volume. Also due to the way they sit on the ear, it kind of puts pressure on the ear to press or tap these controls. The openrun pro had dedicated volume buttons and a dedicated play/pause button. I much preferred that. The openrun pro could also be turned on or off with the controls, cant do that on the openfit. Seems placing them in or out of the case is the only way to turn them off or even disconnect the bluetooth without disconnecting it from your phone or other device.I of course havent used them long enough to see how they hold up over time. But I expect since creating sound isnt based on vibrating against your head, quality should hopefully hold up and not start vibrating as both of my previous shokz products have through use. The sound quality improvement while still being open and keeping situational awareness is really nice.I havent tried phone calls with them yet, but I imagine they would be just as good as the openrun pro's which were great for that.A lot of good upgrades and overall I think the form factor could prove to be a lot better. But there are some noticeable steps back, so I am settling on 4 stars because the cons are enough for me to prevent a full 5. The app does allow for firmware updates though, and there was one available as soon as I turned them on. I imagine multipoint could conceivably be added (if the hardware supports it) or the controls could be further tweaked or expanded upon.Update 8/23/23 - Lowering to 3 stars. All the positives from above remain. The size is nice, they are compact. They sound good, especially compared to the openrun. Still have all the same situational awareness.But I find myself adjusting them quite often when using them. I have never had either side fall out while exercising, but they still dont feel as secure as the openrun ever did. They can bounce around just slightly when using them.I also find call quality doesnt seem to be as good when paired with my phone. Still quite usable, but not as crisp or clear as others.There have been a couple of firmware updates so far, but nothing that has allowed for more customization of the touch controls. A swipe motion to change volume like other tws earbuds have would be very welcome as an additional control. And the long press is still obnoxiously long.But the biggest issue is that I have started developing trouble charging one of the earbuds. It doesnt seem to reliably make contact with the charging case anymore. I use them pretty much every day, but I do feel like I may not be getting near the advertised battery, and find myself having to charge the case seemingly once a week, even though there is no way I am using them for nearly 30 hours a week. Might be an issue of the actual earbuds not seating or charging properly.And since the charging case is needed both to disconnect the openfit from my phone or other device and is needed to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices (since they have no multipoint), it has made them more and more difficult to use. I have had multiple instances where I cannot properly activate pairing mode to switch devices and have to try multiple times before it works. I Even had one night where I put them back in the case, but they never actually registered in the case so they just remained on and draining theirs and my phones battery overnight.I do not know if this is just from poor design or potentially from some stray sweat after working out with them, but if its the latter, these are advertised as water resistant and to be used for \"sport\" so this would seem like a possible failure point or issue. And I feel like now I am going to have to go through the hassle of getting a warranty replacement for a product.Update 8/28/23 - Back to 4 stars. The right earbud completely died on me and I could not get it to charge in the case. Though somehow I eventually managed to get it to charge again, and it seems that it is charging somewhat consistently again. I still sometimes have to reseat it or wiggle it to make sure its actually registered as being in the case.But the real reason I am back to 4 stars is because the latest firmware added multipoint. 2 devices can now be connected. And it seems to work pretty seamlessly. So I am quite happy with that. Weirdly it doesnt look like they have updated their product pages with this yet.I cannot tell if anything else has been changed with the latest firmware update as I cannot find any patch notes. The long press delay seems like it might be slightly shorter than before, but its still quite long. There wasnt even any mention of multipoint other than a new setting for it just appeared in the app after the firmware updated.At this point I think these would be 5 stars for me if they were able to update the gestures. Based on some other TWS I have used, single tap and swipe gestures are not available. And given the larger area of these, a swipe at least seems like it would be the best for volume control. Not sure if its possible with the hardware, and maybe the single tap was left out to prevent false activations while working out. At the very least, the long press still seems like it could be shortened.",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe schon verschiedene Kopfh\u00f6rer ausprobiert.Meine letzten Bluetooth Kopfh\u00f6rer von Sennheiser hatten nun einen B\u00fcgel, der um den Nacken gelegt wird. Daran waren die beiden \"Ohrst\u00f6psel\" mit d\u00fcnnen Kabeln befestigt. Der Vorteil war, dass ich die Ohrst\u00f6psel nicht mehr verlieren konnte, da sie am Nackenb\u00fcgel hingen.Der Nachteil war, dass sie sich tats\u00e4chlich angef\u00fchlt haben wie St\u00f6psel. Die Umgebung war nicht mehr gut wahrnehmbar und die Ohren taten nach einiger Zeit weh. Auch beim H\u00f6rbuch h\u00f6ren im Bett dr\u00fcckten die Ohrst\u00f6psel. Sie hielten jedoch auch nicht gut und fielen immer wieder raus.Ich trage die Kopfh\u00f6rer auch bei der Arbeit, beim B\u00fccken oder zur Seite drehen sind mir In-Ear-Kopfh\u00f6rer immer wieder rausgefallen.Die Ausf\u00fchrung der Kopfh\u00f6rer von SHOKZ bietet einige Vorteile:- Die Kopfh\u00f6rer sind leicht und dr\u00fccken nicht- Die Kopfh\u00f6rer sitzen fest und fallen nicht raus, auch nicht bei der Arbeit, B\u00fccken und Drehen.- l\u00e4stige Kabel entfallen, diese hatten meiner Erfahrung nach nach einiger Zeit immer einen Kabelbruch- Das Ohr wird nach meinem Empfinden geschont, da nichts ins Ohr hineingesteckt wird --> keine Schmerzen mehr- Kein Nackenb\u00fcgel, der sich im Kragen der Kleidung verf\u00e4ngt und schief rutscht und dann die Ohrst\u00f6psel rausziehtEin entscheidender Vorteil, den viele wahrscheinlich nicht auf dem Schirm haben:bei lauten Arbeiten passt ein normaler Geh\u00f6rschutz (z.B. 3M Peltor, diesen benutze ich) immer noch \u00fcber die Ohren.D.h. man kann die Kopfh\u00f6rer benutzen und trotzdem den st\u00e4rksten Geh\u00f6rschutz f\u00fcr extrem laute Arbeiten verwenden. Ohrst\u00f6psel sind mit fr\u00fcher auch unter dem Geh\u00f6rschutz immer wieder rausgefallen.Dies kann nun nicht mehr passieren.Das H\u00f6rerlebnis bei Musik ist f\u00fcr mich ok und f\u00fcr die meisten Personen sicherlich ausreichend.Telefonieren geht auch, der Gespr\u00e4chspartner versteht einen gut wenn die Umgebung nicht allzu laut ist.Wind- und Stra\u00dfenger\u00e4usche muss ich noch testen.Die Verbindung \u00fcber Bluetooth ist in 2 Sekunden hergestellt --> perfekt!Die Kopfh\u00f6rer werden in einer Dose geliefert, die als Ladeschale dient, d.h. daran wird bei USB-C (vorbildlich) das Ladekabel angeschlossen.Die Kopfh\u00f6rer haften mit Magneten in der Dose, so dass ein herausfallen beim \u00f6ffnen unm\u00f6glich ist --> perfekt!Es wird noch eine kleine Tasche f\u00fcr den Transport mitgeliefert, auch sehr sch\u00f6n.",
