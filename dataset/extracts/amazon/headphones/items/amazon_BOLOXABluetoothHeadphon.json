I'm really surprised. Usually we have to sacrifice the mic with these types of headsets, not with this...it works great.Controls- One of the best feature about this headset is that it uses buttons, not touch...I can easily turn on/off, turn up the volume and rewind....Would give this more starts if I could.",

Too bulky, uncomfortable and make me sweat more under them. Ear pods normally haven\u2019t stayed in for me. I seen these and thought they were the ones to do the job, and they didn\u2019t let me down. They were reasonably priced. Setup was a breeze and man they are comfortable! They stayed put and the music sounded great. I love them!!!",

Amazon made it right (above and beyond) tho the product itself is great. Great mic. Great sound.",

Easy to operate, able to connect to my android phone, however, not working with my ipod. It connects, is recognized but no sound comes through, disappointing as I wanted for use on flights. For the price, I'm keeping and will use anyway.",

But were great on quality and sound was goodI got these as a replacement and it\u2019s the same, Good Sound and so far good quality! It comes in a nice carry case with extra ear buds/sizes. Connecting was super simple and easy with no troubleI\u2019d however like to see USB-C for the charger but they are using the old style, no biggie but I understand that the price would more than likely increase so it\u2019s a win lose situation.I\u2019d definitely buy these again if they break or are lost again!",
