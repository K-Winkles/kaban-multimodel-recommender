                "reviewText": "I am a long-time user of the Skullcandy brand, going back to their infancy, really. I knew they were sturdy, and my last pair of similar went through so much wear and tear and abuse before finally wearing out. They were nearly a decade old. However, times change and companies cut corners, and I was concerned with the replacement pair and was very worried when they accidently were put into the washing machine when a family member was tending to me post-surgery. She didn't realize they were in my jacket pocket. However, they survived and still work perfect. Plus, the sound is overall good, the mic has no issues and is clear, and the rest you expect from Skullcandy.",

These fit my ears better than my $200 Pixel Earbuds pro do. The buttons are weird. There appears to be three, top and bottom buttons but they're not discreet it's a single plastic piece that you can press top, bottom and middle to perform the same functions which are answer/hangup call, play/stop audio, skip/go back tracks. Odd there is no volume control given the button layout but that's my only gripe.",

They have a discreet wire that sits under the throat connecting the earbuds, and if you have hair that covers your ears, people don't know you are even wearing them. They last about 3 hours tops, not 6 like they list. When you get them, use them and let them run all the way down and make sure they don't konk out when the icon on your phone shows there is still supposed to be 50% power. That's the only thing, check them out as soon as you get them and exchange them if the icon doesn't show the power nearing 0% on the little battery indicator on your phone. I figured out some people are returning them after significant use and the company possibly resells them not knowing what happened. Most sets are great and they have lasted me at least 2+ years. Also, don't brush your teeth with them in, you can accidently drip toothpaste in the charger and it ruins them, lol.",

I had mine for maybe 2 months and one of the ear pieces split . For the price they are not bad . Just keep in mind you will need to buy more sooner than later.",

The noise cancellation is basically non-existent, but I prefer it that way. The mic isn't the best quality but it can definitely get the job done. Typically these types of ear buds do not have a long life, but I would still buy them over expensive headphones.",
