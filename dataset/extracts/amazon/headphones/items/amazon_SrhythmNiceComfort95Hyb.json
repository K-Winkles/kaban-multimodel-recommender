The controls print on the headset is amazing. Answer and end calls, pause skip and start music, volume up and down and turning the anc noise cancelling in and off without needing your phone is amazing!4. Sound isn\u2019t 10/10 but it\u2019s still 9/10 personally I think it\u2019s perfectly great for $65. If anything I could describe it has \u201cthe bass and subwoofer is a little too high compared to the voices and instruments\u201d if that makes sense. But I\u2019d rather have more bass than not enough so it\u2019s a win for me!5.The noise cancelling WORKS! I ran my sink while resting the modes and it works so well to dim it.",

                "reviewText": "These are knock offs, but for $80. They honestly do the job. The noise cancellation works, but is more better and effective when music is playing. The transparency mode is pretty effective, but it\u2019s not crisp. They\u2019re very comfortable to wear for a long time and glasses safe. However, sound does leak through when you put the volume halfway loud. The battery life seems to go down every hour and 30 minutes. The headphones come with a aux cord so you can plug your headphones into your phone or a computer without using Bluetooth. Overall I think it\u2019s worth the money if you like the sleek design and want some nice headphones with good quality sound that aren\u2019t $599 these are your go to!",

People have actually asked me if they were the Airmax Pros ! I also really like how you can pause/skip & adjust the volume on the headphones (which many headphones lack). Noise cancelling are pretty good. I can\u2019t hear very much when I play music. When there\u2019s no music, they still cancel a lot but not everything, like most headphones. I do wish they could get a little louder but still great sound quality. 4.5/5",

The sound quality is pretty good (can't say too much since my last headphones were $10 from the drugstore). Doesn't cancel noise 100% unless you crank the volume up, but I don't mind since I like to hear a bit of my surroundings in public. They are very comfortable on even though they are a little big for me. I wear glasses and they are comfortable around the ears with them on however I do have to occasionally adjust on the nose because they shift around a bit (probably because the headphones are a little big). Overall I really like these headphones and hope they last for a long time!",
