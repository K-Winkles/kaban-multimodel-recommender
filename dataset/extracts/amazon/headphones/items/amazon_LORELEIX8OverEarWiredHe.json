Not badly but enough it does affect me by near the end of a movie.Ear cushions are decent, nothing special but just fine.No noise canceling.Since I have an iphone and Apple doesn't believe in non-Apple options, I can't test that aspect. I use it on my puter when I stay up late to watch a movie and don't want to bother others.The build is respectably sturdy.Sound quality is fine, nothing special.They're perfectly fine for their current $17 price point.Don't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many everyday things you buy will generate a small donation from Amazon to the charity of your choice at no cost to you.

One day two years later they finally broke and we bought the set again. She\u2019s tried other kinds but these by far are the most comfortable. She also has sensory issues so this should also say a lot about the comfort and quality of the headphones! Definitely buy!",
