It's clear without distortion and people on the other end of the phone have no issues with hearing me as well. They work well for sitting still or walking around.Their downfall is they let wind noise distort the sound if it's blowing, or I am riding my bike with them. They don't work well for that at all. The wind volume increases and sound volume decreases.The silicone earbuds covers fit fair, they are oblong the way they're mounted and don't really seal as well as if they were rounded. For the price and for basic listening and calling they do well enough.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, when I bought these I wasn't expecting much. I just needed a pair for a brief period of time while I worked on getting a genuine headset. But I've had these things for about a year now and I'm happy (and mostly surprised) to say that they still work.I'm no audio connoisseur or anything- but based on my knowledge of having had a great many wired earbuds over the span of my life, I can say that these are actually pretty decent. The sound quality is good and has remained such. The microphone quality is not the greatest but you'll definitely be audible (and it has also continued to work). And most important of all in my opinion; the earbud jack, and the part of the cable that connects to the earbud/mic itself, has remained strong and intact.Which, if you've ever had earbuds, chances are you know the feeling of having to practically crack the DaVinci Code moving the wire every time you want to get audio in both ears.But with these, I've never had that problem in the entirety of owning them.So TDLR: if you're looking for pretty cheap headphones, want them to last a long time, and don't really care about audio quality either way; these are a great pair to purchase.But also a bit of a heads-up; the wire itself is a bit flimsy, so do be careful with it. Otherwise you should be good!EDIT: Just my luck, a few weeks after I wrote this review, the headphones finally gave out. Left side only works if I hold the wire at a very specific angle, and right side gave out completely. Overall though, they lasted a little over a year total (with my heavy use and terrible treatment of the things), so really still worth getting if you need a decent pair of earbuds for a low cost.",
