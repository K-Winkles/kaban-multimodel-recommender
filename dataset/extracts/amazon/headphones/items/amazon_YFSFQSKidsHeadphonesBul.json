                "reviewText": "PROS:1. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that they did have some low freq response! No, not like a pair of $25 Sony headphones, but far better than I expected (and better then any others under 6 bucks I have tested).2. They are very lightweight and I find them VERY comfortable.3. The type of wire used is more like the Sony flex cables than the cheaper Koss wires.4. The wire only goes in one side and fed to the other across the top like more expensive phones (far fewer tangles storing and getting them on).5. They have a 90 degree 3.5mm plug which means the wires should break less often!6. The audio response is perfect for voice files (e.g., news, YT vids without a lot of music)CONS:1. Low freq response is lacking, but there is some, at least! Music is, at least, bearable.2. Not sure how they will last, but I suspect not too long. [SEE EDIT BELOW]You can bet I will buy another 30 of them for the price!!EDIT: They are lasting far longer than I would ever have imagined, and I will surely get another 30 of them just in case they discontinue production (the supply will surely outlast my life on the 3rd rock from Sol). It is an excellent price:value ratio! I am upping my rating to 5 stars for that point alone! I have only lost 2 pairs to wear and tear, but admittedly, they do have to run the gauntlet against a one year old who is learning about physics and material sciences by grabbing things and pulling on them just to see what happens as he records the destructive breaking force required it in his memory banks. He also records the unhappy grandpa who ends up hugging and kissing him anyway (and no, I do not let him use them - he is jerking them right off of MY head during his tests of strength).EDIT No 2:I am back to buy another 30 (just in case they stop making them). It has been 13 months since I got the first box, and I have 10 pair left of the original batch of 30. Most of problems were caused by wear and tear and not poor construction or materials. Like I mentioned before, you can't hang a 2 year old from your headphone wire and expect anything but trouble. You should see the knots he can put in the headphone cord in under 60 seconds! Here is the damage summy:11 pairs stopped working from the wire being stretched or literally ripped out - It is mostly my grandson playing Tarzan on them or the wire getting caught on kitchen drawer handles jerking my head sideways as I walk away, and after 3 or 4 times they just quit working - I can't believe it make it through 3 or 4 times being stretched like that - the wires are petty good,3 - pair were stepped on or caught under the edge of my heavy recliner (they do not survive my 200 lb 6 foot frame crushing them),1 - pair went in the toilet (Oops - fell off into the bowl leaning over to flush),2 - went in the sink washing dishes (never quite sounded right after being under water),1 - burned the wire with a soldering iron at my work bench1- defective out of the box - right ear had no sound. 1 defective so far is not bad for the price (2 bucks each)1- I broke the head band stretching it to make it fit better. When you first put them on they are a bit tight being new and I have to stretch them out so they they are comfy and don't squeeze my head (I got a bit carried away).The reason I wear these so much (almost all day) is, I have an FM transmitter set up that covers my whole houseand my 1/2 acre lot with good signal strength and my computer feeds the transmitter. So they provide audio from my computer. I also have a one of the computer audio inputs fed from the ringer on my land line phone so I can hear it ring when outside (I at least know someone called). Plus, I have a mic input so they wife can walk up to my desk and mash the button on the mic and talk to me. It's like a cheap P.A. system + half intercom. So I can listen to pod casts, know when someone calls, and hear from the wife. I use a Sangean DT-120 FM stereo radio (available here) and the pair of rechargeable AAA batteries last well over 24 hours and I always have a fully charged pair to pop in when needed. For my needs, they are close to perfect.",

No pairs have been broken yet in over a month. A bulk set of 30, so obviously the quality is what it is. If you have strong classroom culture and emphasize the importance of being gentle with them to your kids, there should be no problem. If you deal with students that are very rough with things, this product will not last long.",
