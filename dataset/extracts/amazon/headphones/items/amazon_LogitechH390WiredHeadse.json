                "reviewText": "What you see is what you get here: a solid-feeling quality USB headset at a great price. The USB cord is long enough to use in a variety of circumstances and the ear pieces are reasonably comfortable, though obviously not as comfortable as dedicated headphones or ear pieces would be. But you're not going to find those things at this price point, which is the key selling feature here. It's obviously intended for occasional use on a work telecommuting laptop and for that it gives fine service.The only downside is the slightly odd placement of the headset volume buttons. They are on the edges of a round insert about 1/4 the way down the cord from the headset which I'm going to bet you're going to find is either too close or too far away. For me, it was too far away, and sometimes results in the insert being pressed up against the edge of my desk if I'm wearing the headset near the desk. On a couple of occasions, this has resulted in the desk either pressing the mute button or pressing one or the other volume buttons. So it's something to watch out for. There is a thin clip on the insert if you want to clip it somewhere where it will stay out of the way.All in all, if you're looking at this item, you're looking for quality sound for an inexpensive cost and that's exactly what you're getting here. Not a lot of frills, but it should give good service for several years.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works great but ear pieces are painful if you work in a call center for 8 hours a day",
                "reviewText": "These are exactly as advertised, but I do want to warn fellow Call Center workers bc the ear pieces are smaller than even my tiny girl ears so it squishes the earlobes. After several hours of wearing this my ears are red and in severe pain. I cannot wear my blue light glasses with these at all in order to protect my eyes bc it makes the pain unbearable after less than 1 hour. These are GREAT with excellent sound quality both in the ear piece and recording through the mic for call center jobs, sales, or other phone from home/remote phone positions. The only ding is comfort. I've bought headphone earpiece adapters and so the noise canceling isn't as good for me, but the sound output is still goodish, but the mic is still excellent and now I can use them all day with no issues. That being said, it's still worth it, I just don't understand the high price. There are plenty of other models that are comparable but more comfortable and at a lower price. I bought this specific model bc my job said to, but now LITERALLY everyone in the training course who bought this model like I did is complaining about ear pain, so it's not just me; It's everyone. I gave 4 stars bc it's not the seller's fault and the seller was great! They were honest in the representation and even shipped quickly. The product its self deserves 2 stars bc what is the point of headphones you can't use without buying additional parts to use? And at this price point, it just doesn't seem right to me, BUT this seller offered this product at a lower price than other sellers so again the seller does deserve a good rating. I trust the seller and recommend them, but not the product bc of comfort issues. The product is decent for sound quality as is without adapters. It's a toss up for you as the potential buyers to decide if you want to adapt the headphones for comfort, which is a quick and easy fix. Either way, I recommend the seller and will probably purchase other items from this seller in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this as a replacement for the same product as my old one broke when my spouse sat on it. I used the old one for over 10 years. I hope to get a similar amount of use from the replacement. I like that it is a USB headset, making it easy to plug into my computer. While a 3.5 mm plug works, it is difficult to plug it into the back of the computer. The sound quality is fine. It may not be up to listening to music critically, but it is more than adequate for zoom meetings and streaming video. The mike works ok and does a good job of noise cancellation. The cord is long and lets you sit comfortably away from the monitor.",
