                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My Skullcandy earbuds that I've had for years are falling apart and I wanted another pair that you can drape around your neck. I came across these and it checked all the boxes that was looking for. I also love that it comes with it's own case.Sound Quality: For the price, I was not expecting it to be this good. They aren't noise canceling (to me), but I personally don't mind. One thing that made me try this pair was it said it has great bass and I can confirm that it does sound great for the price!Comfortable: They are extremely comfortable in my opinion. I actually forget that I'm wearing them. They come with extra size silicon ear buds so it can accommodate different sizes. The part that goes behind your ears are also silicon and comfortable. It hasn't bothered me at all, even when sweating.Battery Life: I haven't had them that long, but from what I can tell that battery life seems to be good.Sweat Resistance: I'm not sure if they are water proof, but I can confirm they are sweat resistance.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase. It meets all my expectations and honestly think this is the best pair of earbuds I have ever owned.",

                "reviewText": "Update: So the company reached out about my original review and worked to get me a new pair. The new pair sounds great. That weird can like echo is gone. Also the glitch isn't there either. The company was super polite and so nice about helping me get a pair that suited me. I do a lot of shifting at work and I need to listen to something to break up the monotony of it all. These definitely get me through 8 plus hours. I don't have to charge them every day so the battery seems to be long lasting. Pretty good for the price.Original Review: Okay, I GuessI bought these in a pinch as I use my headphones for work and replacing my old pair with my normal brand was unavailable. I like the color scheme but the sound is...hollow? Like sometimes it sounds like I'm listening through a tin can. And every time I stop and start something that plays sound, it forces the volume bar to pop up onscreen. I'll have to replace them something else.",

I had a problem with Sony xbh, and bought these to try out some debug on the TV and phone. The sonys would not connect to the tv. These work good on the phone and TV for the purpose. Remember this review is for Day 1 results. The songs sound decent. Now I am not sure about noise cancellation features.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought 2 pairs of these headphones-- the first one lasted me almost 2 years and I went pretty hard on them. They're my workout headphones, so they stay in my car when I'm not using them. I guess the noise canceling works perfectly, because I can never hear anything except for my own music at the gym. The battery life is great. I only have to charge them once every 3-4 uses, and I only charge them on my way to the gym which is less than 10 minutes away. I also use them in the sauna almost every single day, so I'm surprised they lasted as long as they did before having to purchase a new pair.My second pair however, one of the volume buttons stopped working after only a few weeks, and when I messaged customer support they responded same day and had a new pair out to me within the week. Honestly, the best pair of headphones for the price, if you're looking for rugged use. They're durable and the sound is perfect for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "I have a love/hate relationship with these headphones. I can only give them 3 stars because they just don't last, but I really like them and they are at a price point where I can replace them without getting too upset.They have good sound and are comfortable to wear while working, running, or for normal day-to-day use. I typically keep just one side in when I'm listening to a podcast or on a phone call, and then have the option to put the 2nd side in when I'm listening to music or using power tools.The downside is that the are effectively disposable headphones. I have bought over a dozen of these under different brand names over the past several years, averaging a new pair about every 6 months. They work great until they don't. Sometimes they stop taking a charge. Sometimes they start to randomly shut off while using them despite having plenty of charge left. Sometimes one side or the other just stops working for no reason.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pair of earphones to use when I go to the gym. So I only have them on every other day. I used them on Monday and then put them back in their case. On Wednesday, when I put them on, I noticed that the blue light was flashing. I had left them on since I went to the gym on Monday morning. Today is Wednesday (I go Monday, Wednesday and Friday). I was afraid that it would not last through my workout. But they worked perfectly! They last the whole session without a problem. Now I can't speak to sound quality because I am not really bothered by the sound of my headphones. I like the music coming out of them. It is loud enough to drown out most noise and to me, the pitch is beautiful. The only thing I can say negative is that it does not totally drown out the surrounding sounds. But our gym has a basketball court and they get pretty loud. I don't know if anything could drown them out! I think for the price, these are a great set of earphones!",
