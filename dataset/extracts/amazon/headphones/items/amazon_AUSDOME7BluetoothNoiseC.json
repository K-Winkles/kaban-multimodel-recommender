                "reviewText": "Just snagged the AUSDOM E7 Bluetooth Headphones, and I'm pretty stoked about it! The sound is crisp with clear highs and deep bass \u2013 perfect for my music cravings. The noise-cancellation is like magic, immersing me in my own little world. These headphones are super comfy, too; I've worn them for hours without any issues.Setting them up was easy, and they connected faster than I could finish a cup of coffee. The design is slick, and the fact that they fold up makes them my new travel buddies. Plus, they're budget-friendly, so it's a win-win.I'm digging the whole package \u2013 from the easy controls to the LED lights indicating charging status. The mic works like a charm, picking up my voice crystal clear. And the fact that I can use them with my VR headset, turning gaming into a full-blown experience, is a major bonus.A little heads up though \u2013 they can get a bit warm on hot days, but it's not a deal-breaker for me. Just wipe 'em down with an alcohol pad, and you're good to go. Overall, these headphones are a steal for the price. Solid sound, comfy fit, and all the basics you need. No complaints here! \ud83c\udfa7\u2728",

                "reviewText": "These are nice headphones if you want something a bit more noise cancelling and something you can take on the go. It is good headphones for a budget. These are great to travel with. Compared to many other wireless headphone, these are over the ear headphones. The headphone does have a microphone built in. It does come with both Bluetooth and aux connection if you want to do it that way. That being said they can work for laptop, tablets, desktops, and phones given they have Bluetooth capability or 3.5 headphone jack. The headphones are fairly decent size. They are not extremely heavy so it is great to walk with. There is a simple bag carrying case with a pull string to close the bag. You can control the sound and such on the actual device or your phone. There are LED light indicators to show charging as well. From what I can tell, you can use an aux port even with the device's battery is dead. It utilizes a PU leather and foam for the ear cushions. With this material, you can expect the material as some irritation to your skin if you sweat. For best cleaning, I would just wipe it down with a damp towel or an alcohol wipe. It is a simple press button. It does utilize type c charging which is nice. I do not think it can connect it wired to use the headphone The type c cable provided is pretty long. The headphone fits nicely and comfort. It does take a few uses to break in the leather material and be comfortable putting these headphones on. Like a pair of shoes, you have got to break the headphones in for they are easier to fit on your head. The head piece can also be adjusted on the ends. One thing to note about this is that it does get warm to wear this during hot days. It can rub against your skin if you happen to sweat. It can cause irritation. It does not pinch too much on my ears so it will not crush my ear into my glasses which is nice. It uses the USB cable charging purposes. The sound quality is really good as well I am able to use this headphones with my VR headset and the sound is amazing. It feels like I am sitting in the room as it has surround sound. All controls for these headphones on the left side. You can mute/unmute. The microphone definitely picks up my voice very easily and clearly. It blocks out a good amount of surrounding noise for something without a wind guard. The device is also very easy to adjust in my opinion to make it definitely feel very comfortable. The black and red color is nice. I would say if you can just to wipe it down with those lint catchers to get rid of hair and just wipes with an alcohol after use. It is very easily fitting to any head with the adjustment. There is no dongle so you need to connect this via bluetooth or you can use aux cable. Overall these are inexpensive headphones that are good quality for the budget. The sound is good and it has the basic features many other headphones of this size haven. It does make gaming on your phone an experience though which is great. I do like that you can use both aux and bluetooth.",
