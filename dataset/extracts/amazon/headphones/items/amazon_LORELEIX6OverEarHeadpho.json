                "reviewText": "I purchased these for a disabled World War 2 vet that loves to listen to baseball on the radio.They have way more features than he'll use.... and the sound quality is very impressive for the price point. If you need great cheap headphones... these are hard to beat... if you're expecting Beats Pro level sound... you'll be disappointed with he sound... but at under $18.00 you won't find any better.These use a standard 1.5 jack as a plug in so all you iPhone users like me... you'll need an adapter.These are plug in only... no bluetooth... which is exactly what my vet friend needed... no batteries to run out and no bluetooth to fuss with. These are good basic old school headphones that deliver good sound at a price point anyone can afford!",

                "reviewText": "I had three different pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones over the past ten years. They averaged about $200 each. I used them constantly at work where I did sound and animation for online courses. I used them everyday for 8 hours a day, and went through them fast. They snapped over the earpiece. One of them was a pair of Dolby's and the earpiece simply fell apart. You cannot replace the batteries on most of the high-end headphones. So when I retired, I started going for walks at nearby Lake Washington. My last pair of good headphones fell apart, so I bought these. The sound is just as good, they are inexpensive and holding up well after more than a year. They are more durable than the $200 headphones and the quality of sound is similar. If it breaks, I am not out $200. My understanding is that the planned obsolescence on wireless headphones is about 2 years, so I guess I was lucky that mine lasted for as long as they did.",

They do get used quite a lot as we homeschool but they tend to wear out sooner then I would like. One ear tends to stop working. Also, the cord where it inserts into the computer becomes finicky and needs to be wiggled in order to hear. I will continue to replace them at this point because it is for a 5 year old and 3 year old and I don\u2019t trust them with anything more expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this so I could use it while playing my guitar without disturbing anyone. The sound is ok but it's a little muffled? I thought it might be cuz I plugged into an amp but also plugged it into my macbook listened to spotify and it was the same. There's no distortion or anything. I guess my ears were expecting better. But again, its under $30 so it is what it is. Noise cancellation fairly good. In a quiet room with AC running I couldn't hear much. Not sure how well it would do outside if I was on the street tho. Basically these are just gonna stay home for the purpose I bought them for. I went with the purple just cuz it looks cool. Overall, the build feels pretty sturdy. Not cheap or doesn't feel like a toy. I've seen other reviews on them breaking but again if you are just gonna keep them at home and treat it with respect I think they will last a long time.",
