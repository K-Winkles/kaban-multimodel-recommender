                "reviewText": "I'll start off by saying that we're a big headphone/earbud family. My husband works in tech at a big school, and I tutor & do lots of video, music, confrence, etc work. We're also a very big music family & content creating. Sound, is really important to us; as are products. I'd stumbled upon the brand a few years back; and it wasn't long before they'd become one of my(our) preferred brands. We own several of their other headphones & have had EXCEPTIONAL customer service experiences. I was really excited to try these out, as they're similar to another model we have, that's a bit older (although still sounding fantastic & has stood the test of time).These headphones are a great budget headphone- and I used \"budget,\" quite loosely. They have the sound and quaility of a mid grade headphone (comparable to those in the $80-$120 range) and the craftmanship, comfort and look of such as well. While more expensive and luxurious models do have more- well luxury (such as over the ear muffs, that are a bit more cushiony) I dont have any complaints with these. The muffs themselves are very soft, yet firm as you'd want them to be. The plastic doesnt feel cheap; and you do get small little features such as an led indication light by the power button; a toggle switch to swap between bluetooth and noise canceling-which in our vast expeirence doesnt typically come in headphones anywhere near this price range. The packaging is nice, yet simple-you get a usb charger, an audio jack & an easy to read instruction manual. As far as the noise cancelling feature; simply having the headphones in bluetooth mode; immediately deadens sounds- without any auidio playing. As I type this sitting on my patio, I have my music paused and I barely hear the tractor beside our house in the vegetable field. I wouldnt say it's as \"strong\" as their higher end models; and I have a very loud & rowdy 2yo and enthusiastic, energentic ever singing 5yo, and 13yo gamer, to test the limits of those cababilities lol these will definitely drone out the loud theme song of Paw Patrol; barrads of Frozen, and screeching of a teenager slaying shrieking zombies-at least to a very muffled, and intelligible thought processing cability, level lol I do prefer their more elaborate nc headphones for tasks I need to really concentrate on--like critiquing musical composures; or tuning out the tractor or often annoying sounds of my husband putzing around in his paramotor. The headphones also have a metal extension-not plastic; a cushioned top, and the ear muffs swivel both up and down & side to side with ease; and easily excessible volume buttons beside the power button.Hopefully my long winded review gives some better ideas of comparisons and overall daily capabilities. The only reason I don't rate the nc fx 5 stars, is that while it's definitely great and subperb for the price; it is a bit less than higher end models-although I think most would opt for those overall; if that's something they were actually wanting.In conclusion: great headphones, amazing price, awesome customer service, and craftsmanship. These are fantastic headphones for the average person & listening activies. Great for kids too; especially those who can tend to be a bit rough-as kids often are!Update on battery life: I recently took these on a 3 day trip, and our 13yo Alone used them for over 23hrs-I also forgot to power them off and left them on overnight until the next day around noon. It's been a couple days since our trip & I still have yet to have to charge them. Conclusion-Very impressed with the battery life, especially with utilizing the nc for all usage time!!!",

                "reviewText": "Got these headphones for $30 when the red ones were on sale. And for $30 I have to say I'm impressed.Noise cancelation - The noise cancelation mode is completely useless.Build quality- The build quality is what you would expect from $25-30 headphones. All plastic construction. Buttons feel a little bit cheap.Comfort- Headband is soft, but padding is thin. Ear cups are average quality. They are a bit odd shaped but my large ears just fit. I had no problems wearing headphones for extended periods of time.Fit - I have a big head and these headphones fit well when adjusted 3 clicks from fully extended.Sound- Sound is GREAT. Was really impressed with the overall clarity and clean bass. Was surprised to see that even Austin evens on YouTube said they were the best wireless headphones he had heard for under $50. I have to agree.Range - They advertise like 30 or 35 foot range but mine will go way further. I can go anywhere in my 2,500 sq. ft. home even the basement with zero issues. I have easily been 50 feet from my phone with things like walls interfering and have had zero signal loss.Battery life- Headphones took forever to charge when I first got them. When paired to my phone they showed 90% battery when fully charged? But I have used them for a few weeks now and put a good 5 or 6 hours of use on them and my phone still shows the headphone battery to be at 80%. So battery life seems really good so far.Conclusion - If you can find these headphones on sale, BUY THEM. BUT...I would have to pass on them at their normal $59.99 price. I think for $60 you could do a bit better.",

                "reviewText": "Son los mejores aud\u00edfonos que he comprado en muchos aspectos: son muy c\u00f3modos, no pesan, uso lentes y no me han lastimado para nada las orejas, su dise\u00f1o es lindo con materiales de buena calidad, tienen buen volumen, las llamadas se escuchan bien, el tiempo de retraso es tan peque\u00f1o que ni se nota (hablando del audio en juegos) y la cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido es excelente, ni siquiera se percibe el ruido de una licuadora en funcionamiento. Un punto importante a destacar es que la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda es genial, los aud\u00edfonos me llegaron el 11 de junio y a penas el 03 de julio se descargaron por completo despu\u00e9s de usarlos casi diario en un promedio de 2 hr.El alcance del bluetooth tambi\u00e9n es bueno, m\u00e1s o menos de unos 7 mt.Los puntos negativos son:Forzosamente hay que prenderlos, no importa si se utilizan con bluetooth o con cable (el cable sale sobrando ya que no funcionan si no tienen bater\u00eda)Otro punto negativo es que carece de bajos, no importa qu\u00e9 canci\u00f3n escuche, todas suenan brillantes y sin bajeo.Al usarlos con volumen muy alto se llega a escuchar un ruido molesto, como de 'rasgu\u00f1os' lo cual se soluciona bajando el volumen.En relaci\u00f3n precio - calidad le doy un 8 por el tema de los bajos, pero si ese detalle no les importa estos aud\u00edfonos son excelentes.",
