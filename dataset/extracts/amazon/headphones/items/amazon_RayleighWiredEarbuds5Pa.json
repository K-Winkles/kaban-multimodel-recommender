                "reviewText": "I bought these because I had an experience on a long flight where I could not get my BT headphones paired and did not have a backup.Never again I vowed.I ordered these to place in strategic locations for backup purposes.They do sound pretty good.....if you can get the ear pads to work for you.The listing advertises soft silicone ear pads.They do have a couple in the pack but most are the harder versions that I could not get to seal well.The seller did come through with a solution that almost provided enough soft silicone ear pads in all the earbuds. Kudos to them for working with me on this.The cord is a little cumbersome as its really \"grippy\" (does not really tangle) and kind of sticks or binds.Also I find that the cord is one of those type that transmit movement noises directly into the listening experience. Not terrible but others do this a lot less!I would not recommend buying these if you are picky about having a big selection of the soft silicone ear pads for each of the earbuds in this pack.To be fair they are super cheap and do sound decent. I might be expecting too much.-- edit -- 12/24/2021Also, to be fair the seller has been very responsive. I would give them 5 stars as a seller.This review is for the actual product and as such is a fair and honest review.",
