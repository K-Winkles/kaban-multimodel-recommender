                "reviewText": "The is a great piece. I bought two. One for me, and one for my girlfriend, and they work perfectly. The noise reduction is truly impressive. I can be walking in the wind outside, and she can be driving her loud car, and the sound is near perfect. When she is driving, it sounds like she is a quiet room, where before she would need to shout into her iphone 6, and I would need to strain to hear her. The operation is very simple, but still full of features. She is not good with technology... at all, but she can easily use this after I walk her through pairing it. I love finding all of the options, and there are plenty to find. My favorite is the feature that disables the headset when you aren't wearing it, and knows when you put it on. With my other device, I would always forget it was in my pocket, and go to answer the phone, and they would not be able to hear me, so they would hang up before I switched the audio. Doesn't happen any more. When this one is in my pocket, I answer the phone, and the audio is on my phone. I then put the bluetooth on, and it automatically either answers the call if it is still ringing, or switches audio to the bluetooth. It works great. The fit over the ear is very comfortable. She is really picky about headphones and how things fit in her ear, but this stays in place perfectly. It is easy to put on, and easy to switch ears. overall, I love it.",

                "reviewText": "As of this review, ordering a brand new Voyager Legend directly from Plantronics on Amazon can be had for and extre $10 by going here -- Plantronics Voyager Legend Wireless Bluetooth Headset - Compatible with iPhone, Android, and Other Leading Smartphones - Black .I highly recommend you take that option, if for no other reason you'll get a full 1-year warranty instead of just 90-days that the third party sellers are supplying. My seller that I purchased from was \"Pavilion Electronics\" and I contacted them exactly 120 days after my original order. The unit I received wasn't really holding a charge that well, but now I can charge it to full and even if I turn it off it will be dead within a few hours. (Or at least to the point it tells me to recharge already.)I'm sure this is a great headset. The first month I had it, I loved it -- except for the lack of talk time. Sounded good with my iPhone 6. They've fixed the power button issued I had with the old Voyagers. The boom mic doesn't smack the side of my cheek and rub my beard like the older models did.I'll likely order a new one, direct from Plantronics. At least then I know I'll get a solid year of usage for $65 instead of about three months for roughly the same price.",

                "reviewText": "Best bluetooth headset I have ever used. Comfortable and amazing at killing even the noisiest traffic. I was outside a Starbucks talking to a client and was recording the conversation. I honestly thought that it must be very hard to hear me even though the client assured me there was not problem from their side. The noise from the traffic was so loud I could barely hear myself talking. When I got off the call I immediately played back the conversation and to my surprise, it honestly sound as if we were the only people in a quite room. There was no hint of background noise even with lulls in the conversation. It gives me 5 to 7 hours of talk time and easily self attaches to the magnetic charging cable. The only drawback is that it does require a special charging cable but that is not too big of a problem but does add $10 to $20 to the cost of owning since I went ahead and bought 2 extra charging cable, one for the car and one to carry in my computer bag. Because if you don't have this cable you cannot charge the headset. Not enough of a negative to even drop a star because it performs so well.",
