These have held out for longer. Will huy again for my next child.",

We also like that it has ear protection, as well as the option to make it louder for ambient noise like on airplanes. We ordered another one for him to use at school, and we also ordered one for his sister. The one we ordered for school broke recently, and it was still under a year. So we contacted customer service, and they were fantastic! They replied quickly, attempted to troubleshoot the issue, and then they sent us a replacement for our broken one, when it was clear it couldn\u2019t be fixed. For the price, quality, and service- buying this is a no-brainer. And the other headphones we have from them for longer have had no issues and work well. Highly recommend.",

The ear and head padding are nice'n soft ,, she was wearing these as soon as they were delivered and watched one of her films which was about 1hr 35minutes long with no problems , she didnt get any ear ache which you sometimes get when wearing these type of headphones squashing the ears, because they are softly padded , she also liked the control button on the lead so she could pause and unpause the film when needed :) overhaul she's happy with them ,.As an adult I also found them to be comfortable to wear with ther adjustments easily made either side , They do have a nice clear crisp sound and decent bass tone ... we was using a samsung tablet",
