These are great little headphones and better than same-price pairs you could find at other stores. I got sick of my kids destroying the cheap black headphones from Walmart (the ONN brand specifically). The sound quality from is surprisingly pretty good and the cord is sturdy (not common in headphones I\u2019ve found). They aren\u2019t noise cancelling, but I try to keep volume levels modest anyway to prevent auditory damage. My son loves them and I even use them myself if I can\u2019t find mine - comfortable and well built, but a little small on the ear pads. Not a big detractor for me, and the kiddo has small ears himself (why we have to use over-eat as opposed to earbuds in the first place) but this may be an issue for larger ears. The colors are also cute! (The orange and white pair) Makes them a breeze to locate. I\u2019d buy these again if I needed another set.",
