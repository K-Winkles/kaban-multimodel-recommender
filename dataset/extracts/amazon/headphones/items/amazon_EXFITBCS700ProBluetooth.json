I'm blown away! The sound quality is amazing, better than LG. Actually they sound better than my Sony WH1000XM5 headphones. Double tapping the play button allows you to change the sound profile. With the bass profile, the bass is deep, clean, and the highs are clear. They connect seamlessly and were easy to pair. The auto call answer feature works great and calls are clear on both ends. You can also use audio transparency to hear your surroundings. The only thing I would improve works be the volume/skip button, it is a slider button. If these last at least a year I will be buying them again.",

                "reviewText": "I am surprised at the quality of this product. I like neckband style headphones because I do not like the feel of any earbuds in my ears all day. They become uncomfortable. The neckband style is comfortable. I have used this style of headphones for quite some time but my previous brand doesn't seem to be making new models anymore. I needed to find a new brand. This Exfit has all the features I wanted including retractable earbuds, noise cancelling, vibrates when a call comes in, built in microphone for phone calls plus its water resistant. It has good sound for listening as well as what my callers hear. With other brands, my callers would often say I sounded muffled. But, with this one, the callers say I sound clear and they can hear me perfectly. This is a great unit. I can't really comment yet on battery life but it seems like I will need to charge it every day or two. (I do not listen to music all day and average very few phone calls.) I also cannot comment yet on durability but it seems at least as well made as my other brand that I used to use which was at least 3x the price. Quality seems sturdy and well made but time will tell. This is my new \"go to\" brand for neckband headphones.",

                "reviewText": "I work in a medical imaging dept at a hospital. I need to be available to communicate quickly with physicians, RN's & other coworkers throughout the day. I have used various Bluetooth headsets for about 10yrs. This is my 2nd pair from this brand. The 1st headset I've had for about 3 yrs, and just ordered this one as a backup and to share with my wife. Once the initial phone pairing is done, reconnecting with the phone's Bluetooth is super fast. -Around 3 seconds after turning on the headset's power. Answering a call, is done by pulling out one of the retractable earpieces. The headset stays put throughout the day. It is lightweight, flexible and very comfortable. You will forget they're on your neck. Hearing and talking are both crystal clear. I have found battery life to be excellent. I have the headset on for 8-10 hrs, 5 days a week. Though my total daily talk-time is probably only 1-2hrs. I never run out of a charge. But because the headset is so important to my work, I recharge it about once every 7-10 days. I would definitely buy these again!",

Additionally, frequently people on the other end say the microphone is not picking up my voice and my audio is dropping out. I often have to go to speaker mode on my iPhone since I can't be heard. These do have great microphone noise cancellation when they are working. I can take a call in a concert, and the people on the other end can't tell I am not in a quiet room. Battery life is excellent and lasts longer than advertised. Audio quality for music listening is very good!!!",

Pro model available for a little extra money. I thought \u201cwell I was fine with the normal one so I\u2019ll just step it up a notch.\u201d Literally the worst money I have ever spent as an adult. Terrible, terrible item. Nobody could hear me through the microphone and it would spend more time disconnecting and reconnecting via Bluetooth than anything else. After fighting with it for four or five months it finally enraged me enough that I tore it off my neck, broke it into four pieces and threw it out the window driving down the highway. Never again.",
