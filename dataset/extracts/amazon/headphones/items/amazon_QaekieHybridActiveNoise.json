                "reviewText": "This review is for the newly released Qaekie Q20 ANC style noise cancelling over-ear headphones.I already have and like a pair of their Q10 Bone conducting headphones - so they sent me a pair of these to try for free (they actuallly reimbursed me in less than an hour and were great with email correspondence). But this is a real, objectivem initial review. I'll give updates if anything changes good or bad.This is my 1st pair of ANC noise cancelling headphones, but I have tried a nice $200 set my son has as these are very comparable, which is impressive at the start. The sound quality, both at low volume and high, is well balanced, distortion free, and not overly heavy on bass, but has solid bass. That alone makes these well worth the $35 I paid. Also, the description is identical to pair they list at about $100 more. I find the real test for headphones is how they sound at LOW volume - and they are great. Also, you can use lower volume because the noise cancelling really works!The headphones look cool with machined looking side panels - I do a lot of lawn mowing and hope to use these for hearing protection and to listen to music, books and podcasts while working. I am comparing them to my 3M Worktunes headphones that I previously used while mowing. These are nealy half the weight and bulk and MUCH more comfortable, but with the noise cancelling on, they cut noise noticably better. I tested this by standing about 6 feet from my running air compressor which is very loud, much louder than a mower. The 3M's are ANSI certified, so that is impressive. Sorry, I don't have a sound dosimeter, or I'd give you some numbers.I can't attest much to the battery life, these charged very quickly and have an indicator light when fully charged, I've used them for an hour with the ANC on and they still show 100% on my phone (which is a nice feature) but I don't know how long the battery lasts, likely quite a while the description says 100 hours depending on use. The ANC does use some battery as it is always on when activated. Make sure to briefly press to power button a 2nd time once paired to turn on the ANC - there is a blue indicator light that will come on to show this feature is on. Also, the noise cancelling works even when nothing is playing over the headphones - it feels a little like you are cocooned from the outside world - very soothing. But it doesn't eliminate outside noises, just muffles noises, especially constant noises - not as much with sudden noises like clicking a seat belt or clapping.In the pics you will see how they came, nicely packaged with good instructions that are suprisingly easy to follow. They paired easly with my Pixel 7 and re-pair seamlessly. They come with a 12 inch USB C cord and, as a nice feature, a 1 meter long, audio patch cable to use in case the battery goes out or your device doesn't have bluetooth - they really thought of everything. I tested the patch cable and it sounded excellent directly plugged into my tablet. I got some weird feedback when I tried it through a 2nd patch cable on my desktop - so best used directly maybe.In summary, this looks like a solid, well packaged, set of headphones at an exceptional value. Initially everything works as advertised. I hope this review helps.",

                "reviewText": "The headphones arrived secured in a nice looking box. The package contains the headphones, a charging cable, and a 3.5mm aux cable. The charging and aux cables are underneath the black molded insert. They also come with a QR code for a 18 month warranty. I don\u2019t know if the headphones came partially charged or not, I just tossed them on the charger to start with. The USB charging cable is very short so I used a power bank to charge it up.First up \u2013 the good!I can only compare these to my airpods, and yes, they are different products with one being a headphone and the other an earpod, but since they are made to do the same job and it\u2019s the only thing I have to compare with (except some cheap gaming headphones which I\u2019ll touch on just a bit later) that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.The headphones are beautiful. I\u2019m more of a blue than red person myself, but I can\u2019t deny how purty the red/black combo is. Very flashy. They also fit my head and ears perfectly, and I mean PERFECT. I\u2019m a 5\u20197 adult with a normal sized head and I did not have to extend the headphones at all. If you have a smaller head than normal these miiiiiight be a little big for you on the default size, and if you have a larger head the extension on them will cover you. I can\u2019t picture anyone who has a larger enough head that these wouldn\u2019t work with. Maybe Hagrid. Maybe. (And I\u2019ve stood next to the full animatronic head so I know!)Next up, the sound test. I was able to pair them to my TV via Bluetooth and immediately popped onto youtube and played some music. Impressive! The bass was very good and much better than I\u2019d expected from these. I also liked how my TV remote can control the volume of the speakers. Big bonus for that! The volume is good and should be loud enough for anyone\u2019s tastes. The noise cancelling is good, and I plan on taking them to the gym with me to see how they compare to my airpods. They also have a transparency mode and a noise-cancelling \u201coff\u201d mode.Next I switched to Netflix to test any possible delay/lag and was happy to find there was none. Very cool.Then I paired them to my phone and also found the quality to be on par with the TV. My airpods might get a little louder\u2026maybe.Battery life: GOOD. I\u2019m not sure if they will last 100 hours as advertised, but I\u2019ve had them over a week now and have not charged them once aside from the initial charge.Second \u2013 the not so good.I primary bought these to use with my TV, and in the hopes it would be possible to output my PS5\u2019s sound through the TV\u2019s Bluetooth and into the headphones. Alas\u2026like so many others it does not work. The sound does come through, but the lag is awful and sometimes choppy too. No worries through\u202699.9% of other wireless headphones also do this without utilizing other magic. I can\u2019t really fault these headphones for this though since so many others also have the same problem. Sony just hates Bluetooth I guess. It won\u2019t lessen my review score\u2026after all, it was a longshot. You can use these for wired play via the PS5 controller as well but I don\u2019t recommend using the included 3.5mm cable. Use a better quality one. The one included routed full audio to one ear while only partial in the other and was scratchy from the connections at both ends. The headphones also have a \u201cgame mode\u201d but I can\u2019t figure out what it does\u2026activating it only shuts off the audio. The box it comes in says it helps with the latency but I can\u2019t seem to get them to perform.The ANC, ANC-Off, and Transparency modes have minimal differences between them. Unlike the airpods where ANC is really noticeable when there is no audio playing, I could barely tell a difference between the modes on these, but, since they are full sized headphones that isn\u2019t really a big deal.The only other complaint I with these is the instruction manual. You might as well toss it in the trash and just figure it all out on your own. The section of the manual that lists what each button does is incorrect. I spent about 10 minutes scratching my head going over the instructions and wondering why it wasn\u2019t working correctly before I tossed them aside and just started fiddling with it myself.Here is the correct buttons: The power on/off button is the round symbol button between the volume up and down buttons. \u201cThis is labeled as button 2 in the manual\u2026but the manual says to use button 5, which is the ANC button.) Hold the button down until it turns on/off. It takes about 3 seconds each way.The section of the manual showing how to pair the Bluetooth is missing a crucial step\u2026how to put the headphones into pairing mode! Here is how you do it: Just turn them on\u2026using button 2. If you push button 5 (ANC) it will turn them on and then into whatever ANC mode you have it set to, but it will not enter pairing mode and you will have to turn them off, then back on with button 2 to start pairing. If you have paired them to two devices they will automatically pair when the headphones are turned on again. If you want to add a third device make sure the other paired devices are not in range, or have the Bluetooth turned off, so the headphones can go back into pairing mode.The final score: These get 5 stars from me. I rate them on cost versus functionality. They work, and they work great for what they are supposed to do especially in their price point. The issue with the PS5 gets a pass (although if it had worked I\u2019d be screaming from the rooftops to everyone with a PS5 that I know to get them) and begrudgingly the instruction manual gets a pass too, but only because once I tossed it aside I found the headphones to be user friendly and easy to figure out.",
