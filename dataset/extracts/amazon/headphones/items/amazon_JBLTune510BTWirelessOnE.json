                "reviewText": "I was wearing my ear buds constantly and so my inner ear was feeling weird from not having much air circulation. Also it was a little gross, but I\u2019m not going to go into detail about that.These came up in my search, and I figured for half price, I may as well try them. It also helped that this brand has a pretty decent reputation for me, as my dad has a fairly expensive speaker that he really likes, and I have one of the small speakers that works really well as a bath speaker.I was not disappointed. These headphones are comfortable enough, sound just fine for my constant podcast listening, easy to connect, and last quite a while on one charge.If I wear the headphones all day, they feel a little uncomfortable, but that\u2019s probably to be expected and also not quite how most people normally use them. The sound is not good enough to replace real speakers or anything, but it is more than adequate if one is not too concerned about the sound quality.They last for a couple days on one charge for me. Since I can use them for up to 10 hours a day, this is no small feat. They also charge back up pretty quickly, so even if they run out of battery, it\u2019s no big deal to wait it out with some earbuds for an hour or so.I would 100% buy these again if something happened to them. It\u2019s just one of those things that I cannot do without now.",

                "reviewText": "The JBL Tune 510BT wireless on-ear headphones have exceeded my expectations, delivering an exceptional audio experience wrapped in a stylish and comfortable design.The first thing that caught my eye was the vibrant blue color \u2013 a refreshing departure from the typical headphone hues. The sleek design and medium size make them not only visually appealing but also comfortable for extended wear. The on-ear cups sit snugly without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a perfect fit for various head sizes.Sound quality is where the JBL Tune 510BT truly shines. The Purebass technology lives up to its name, delivering deep, rich bass that adds a new dimension to my music and enhances the overall listening experience. The audio is well-balanced, providing crisp highs and clear mids, making it suitable for a variety of genres.The wireless connectivity is seamless, and pairing with my devices was a breeze. The Bluetooth range is impressive, allowing me to move around without any signal loss. The on-ear controls are intuitive and responsive, providing easy access to playback, volume adjustment, and calls.Battery life is another strong suit of these headphones. A single charge lasts for hours, making them ideal for long commutes, workouts, or extended listening sessions. The convenience of a quick charge feature ensures that even if I forget to charge them overnight, a short charging session provides enough power for a substantial listening period.The built-in microphone delivers clear and distortion-free calls, and the ambient noise reduction feature is a nice touch, ensuring crystal-clear communication even in noisy environments.What sets the JBL Tune 510BT apart is the perfect balance it strikes between style, comfort, and high-quality sound. The inclusion of the foldable design adds portability, making them an excellent choice for on-the-go use. Whether you're a music enthusiast or someone who appreciates a reliable pair of wireless headphones, the JBL Tune 510BT is a solid investment. It's a testament to JBL's commitment to delivering an outstanding audio experience in a stylish and affordable package. I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones to anyone in search of a top-tier wireless audio solution.",

                "reviewText": "I got these headphones on sale, and expected them to at least be decent since they\u2019re from JBL\u2026 and I was surprised that they sounded great! Even if these weren\u2019t on sale they would be worth it. They\u2019re comfortable for at least an hour or so, have solid sound performance, no delay (unlike many Bluetooth headphones), and seem to have good battery life. I\u2019d definitely recommend these to anyone looking for reliable Bluetooth headphones at a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty good headphone unit. The fit is good. I find it a tiny bit snug for long sessions but it isn't so snug that it hurts. The noise cancelation is good as well, but not exceptional. It took quite a while to pair but eventually showed up on my devices. Where it lacks a bit is in the sound quality. The bass is decent, but it lacks depth, especially in the higher notes. Overall, the sound is a little on the muddy side. However, when compared to the price I have to say you get more than your money's worth. It's probably not fair to expect $500 audio from a device worth 1/10 of that price. The reason I mention it is that many of the reviews here rave so highly about the audio quality. Perhaps those reviewers have never experienced a good headset, but my Apple Airpods offer higher quality audio, so I wasn't especially impressed. The sound quality is good, but only exceptional when you compare it to other units in this price range.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 4 pair (3 black & 1 white) as Christmas gifts (the white was for myself just because I needed some). One of my sons & I own a pair of earbuds, but we like headphones as well. I bought him a pair along with my other son & my husband (for mowing, working on cars, etc). They connected fast with all our devices. They have very lightweight & comfortable while wearing. We also like the ability to turn the volume up & down on the side, how easy it is to turn them on & off, & I particular love the ability to answer phones & to be able to talk on my cell with them on! The volume & sound is amazing! I love how compact they are when folded up. I have never used the more expensive brands before, so I can\u2019t compare, but I can say that we are all so pleased with these that we don\u2019t need to own another brand. The price was great also! I caught these 50% off during Amazon\u2019s Black Friday sale. For less that $25 before tax, we can NOT complain!",
