                "reviewText": "I initially ordered these headphones almost 4 years ago. They were still working great with solid sound quality and comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. Bluetooth connectivity is what you'd expect, no problems connecting to computer, phone, tablet. The microphone wasn't great so don't expect to have clear voice calls, but for listening to music its perfectly fine.The only issue I had is that after about 3.5 years the leather-like material on the left earphone started to peel off. I was able to fairly easily pull the headphone cushion off to see how easy it would be to replace it. However, I had issues when attempting to reattach it and had to look up reviews on how to reattach it because it was not going back on easily.Some reviews said that you can remove the plastic ear part to reattach the cushion, which is true, but be careful not to pull it too far. Unfortunately when I removed the plastic earpiece under the ear cushion, it came out too far and the soldered wires broke off leaving the the left earpiece no longer connected and unable to function.Ultimately, I got almost 4 years of enjoyment out of this headset and probably could have gotten more time if the leather ear cushion didn't start to peel off. I could also probably fix it if I knew how to solder wiring, but for ~$20 its probably easier to just reorder a brand new one and recycle this one (BestBuy accepts free drop offs of many common household items for recycling!)I just reordered a replacement set on sale and hope to get 4+ more years of use out of it. If you're looking for a cheap pair of headphones that sound good and will last, these are a great product. The leather-like ear cushion material failed before the actual electronics did. Very pleased and feel confident in reordering a replacement pair for casual use.",

                "reviewText": "I've had these since Jan 16, 2018, and wanted to wait a while to write about them. I update most of my reviews if my purchases continue working exceptionally well so I expect to be doing that with these even after a year. They are working just fabulously after four months still! My husband had a cheapie $5 bluetooth pair he bought to use when mowing the lawn, so I was able to compare the two and it's obvious some thought went into the making of these -- they're plastic but they're quite sturdy and feel well-made compared to his. Have had no trouble getting them to connect to my iPhone.I treated the charging cord very carefully because I saw some other reviewers had trouble with it coming apart, but sadly even with care, the end that went into the headphones just plain broke off and separated from the wire. I wrote in on here to complain to the company (not even realizing that duh, I could use any one of the micro-usb cords from other devices to charge it) and they were super apologetic and said they would get another one in the mail asap to me. I thought they meant just the cord...lo and behold another whole headphones set showed up! Bless them. That's some customer service right there. I probably still won't use the charging cords since I know they're prone to weakness, but my hubby got free headphones out of the deal and doesn't have to use his uber-cheap pair anymore, haha!Nobody is going to believe me but I actually have a pair of Beats Monster headphones and I like the iJoy better. They don't squeeze my head or smash my ears so viciously, lol, and the sound is quite comparable, in my music tastes anyway.UPDATE 8/21/19 -- still working great, have not noticed any issues or decrease in charge, which I consider a bit freakish for anything over a year! I AM CAREFUL WITH THEM. I don't throw them in a tote bag or across the room or drop them down the stairs, so that probably explains part of why they and a lot of my other things last a long time. I don't use them every single day now, maybe four times a week for a few hours when playing games or watching movies on my Kindle while I don't want to listen to my hubby's boring fishing shows on tv, but it's still going strong. I have no idea where my original charging cord is, I just charge it with one of the multiple Kindle chargers I have sitting around. My hubs' pair also still works and charges great, he mostly uses it when mowing the lawn while also listening to boring fishing podcasts. Weirdo.I'm probably the only one who noticed this but the blue light on it is BRIGHT AS HECK at night in a bedroom when you're an insomniac trying not to wake your significant other while watching youtube. Like seriously the blue light is brighter than my entire phone screen on dim. I had to stick a little piece of electric tape over it and even then I still get a glow. But that's what I get for being a night owl, I guess!Still highly recommend, no complaints.",
