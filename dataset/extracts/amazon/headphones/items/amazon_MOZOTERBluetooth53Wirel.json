                "reviewText": "These Bluetooth headphones are bang for your buck! They fit anywhere, and I definitely can see using them for some time.They have a small case and different ears buds you can use. I did not have an issue with fit on these headphones. They are lightweight, so they stay in nicely. I even used them for a run - no slippage. I work on ladders, so that\u2019s important.Waterproof? I\u2019m not sure, they definitely are water resistant and held up to little spills or sweat.Sound? Sound is good. They are not bass heavy and don\u2019t drown out the music. They block out sounds of the outside world very well. But, that could be a con to some.Button placement? I really don\u2019t care for the fact the button is right on the side of headphones. It\u2019s very easy to press when putting them in.Their warranty is bulletproof though, when I had an issue they promptly replaced! Be sure to activate it!Overall, 5 stars on these budget headphones!",

                "reviewText": "So far not terrible for $25. Both work at same time for me despite others having problems with both pairing at the same time. So far I haven't had any problems or delays with pairing them. Sound quality obviously isn't that good because they were only $25, but adequate enough. I can be pretty far away from my phone and they still work, and when I'm close to my phone I haven't had any problems with people hearing me over the earbuds. I have calls fine with no static, my voice is a little delayed for the other person. The button on the earbud pauses music by hitting it once, holding in the button ends a call, and hitting the button twice skips to the next song. The only problem I have with them is you cannot change the sound quality or bass, because I personally don't like bass, luckily there's not much bass but it would still be nice to change it up and down for people that like more bass or less bass. They don't automatically connect, i have to go back into my phone to reconnect them even thing though I have blue tooth on all the time. Container is small and sleek, they are comfortable in ears, shaped nice, not oddly shapped like others out there.Edit: It's been a few weeks and they've been good. I haven't had any issues yet like in the other reviews. I'm actually surprised they've been this good for the price.",

The quality was unexpected with clear audio including bass that did NOT disappoint. In fact I was surprised it was as deep and smooth as it was from such a small form factor.Battery life was excellent and matched the time my phone.Call quality was good on my end but was excellent on the other end as well; a plus, considering that I usually have to switch my bluetooth off so the person I am speaking to can hear me.The fit is unintrusive and I had no issue whatsoever wearing these all day. With the large size cups, they stayed put all day as I worked outside.The case is small, stylish and fits nicely in a front pocket. I even forgot it was there! The power display is pleasant to look at and easy on the eyes; showing through a panel you otherwise wouldn't know was there. Love that it charges wirelessly.Overall, I can't see spending twice the money for what might be perceived as better bluetooth. Seriously, I can't see a negative and so far this has proved to be my BEST bluetooth purchase! And at such an incredible value, I'm definitely going to purchase a backup set!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using these to listen to audio from my phone for six months. It comes with a charging case that holds enough charge for around 24 hours of earbud use. The earbuds in use will go for 4-5 hours. Just drop them in the case for a recharge. You only need to plug the case when its charge is low. The display on the case is clear and shows how much charge remains.The set up was quick and simple and once connected by blue-tooth, all you do to use them is remove from the case and insert into ears. It comes with a variety of sleeves to fit different size ears.I am happy with the sound quality, and the range is about 30 feet before you lose connection to the device.",
