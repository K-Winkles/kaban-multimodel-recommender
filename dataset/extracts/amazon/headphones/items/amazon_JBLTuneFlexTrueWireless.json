                "reviewText": "I got hooked onto JBL headphones after a coworker recommended them to me and I am SO glad they did. I was looking for a new pair of earbuds that had actual noise-cancelling since my last pair didn't have it (despite being advertised as having it) and I found these. This has great noise-cancelling (my parents hate it lol), ambient mode, and the ability to turn off noise-cancelling completely. Here's a breakdown of my experience with these:Pros: - Has an app to control all of the settings of the earbuds (that actually works and connects) - Can adjust to whether you have an open ear tip or sealing ear tip - Has several adjustments for the level of noise-cancelling, including ambient aware mode and a \"talk thru\" mode so you can hear others talk without having to adjust your volume - Adjustable equalizer - Changeable controls for taps on the buds themselves - Can adjust how much you want to hear yourself when you talk - Options of audio vs video mode - Adjustable left/right sound balance - Voice assistant compatible - Find My Buds service - Power saving mode too - Long battery lifeCons: - Cannot change the sets of actions for tapping on the buds (only has Ambient Sound Control or Playback & Voice Assistant Control) which sucks since they don't have actions for \"next song\" - Adjustments for level of noise-cancelling is a bit confusing to me - Not at all sensitive to touch so it can take a few tries to get the tap actions to work sometimesI might be biased since I love JBL, but these are much better than previous earbuds I've invested in. They match the expectations of the price they're set at and, for me, exceed them. I also got them on sale so it was even better. It's well-worth every penny for buying them. The first time I used them with noise cancelling, I practically had a big O but for my ears. Add an herbal substance to the mix and you're in music heaven. It sounds like the music is coming from inside your head and is all around you instead of the \"yup, I'm wearing earbuds\" feeling.The fact that you can change the equalizer for different settings (and make your own) makes it even better since I like having my sound a certain way for music. It's also incredibly easy to change. All of the features are pretty straight forward (except for the level of noise-cancelling thing) and easy to adjust. With the press of a button, you can change your entire audio experience to just the way you want it, and that's exactly how it should be.Overall, 100% worth the money and the time spent on adjusting the settings to what you want. This has to be the best pair of earbuds I've ever bought. The battery lasts a long time, it's super customizable, and it's easy to use. Love them. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I got these JBL earbuds, and they arrived super quickly. I like the adjustable ear inserts, which let me find the right fit, but the design can be irritating compared to my other go-to earbuds. If you're used to Apple earbuds, the volume control might differ from your favorite - it wasn't mine. The voice command is loud, even after tinkering with the app settings. On the bright side, the noise cancellation is top-notch, especially with the right earbud piece.I mainly use them for calls and meetings, and they perform like champs. Sleek design and surprisingly long battery life - it went five hours straight without a hitch. The bigger earbud pieces practically glue them in during workouts (just be careful with loud music). However, it is not the most comfortable to sleep with them.The charger situation caught me off guard - different from my JBL speaker. So, keep that in mind when packing chargers. Overall, I got these on sale, and they're holding up well\u2014a solid buy. I'd rate them a 4.5/5.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for: JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them. Video mode has no audio lag. They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I picked them up on sale, so I really can't complain for value. I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate. I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag. Must be enabled in the app. By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound. They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good. Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on). Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC. For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled. If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case. This seems to be common with all case based small headphones. There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over. (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case. Not even with the app. Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly. The app can turn off the earphones.* Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off. With or without the sealed tips. But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body. The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

The active noise canceling is better if you switch for bigger silicone earpieces included in the box. Overall, the noise canceling ain't mind-blowing if you use the earbuds as they are but you not spending 2-300 bucks remember... sony, beats, senheiser, they're expensive, but these jbl do the job.",
