You aren't going to want these things if you plan on exercising or moving around a lot, but for laying back and listening, they are a perfect match! Price ain't all that bad either considering where these devices are falling on the scale lately.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second pair of clip over the ear headphones. My last pair (Phillips) I had many moons ago used to have a separate rubber piece on the curved part that fits behind the ear (likely to increase the traction with the skin and for comfort) and one day in the school gym it mysteriously fell off and was lost and it never clipped on the same again.I purposefully bought these Panasonic ones for travelling and because I couldn't argue with the price. They are very very slim and lightweight. And the bonus is I can wear them comfortably with my glasses on (I couldn't with my previous pair). I got red so I love the colour. Given how much I paid for it, it does look a bit cheaply made and the sound isn't awesome. But then again I was sitting over the wing of the airplane so the lyrics of the music started sounding like chipmunks. However, outside of the plane ride I think the sound was decent. It's not like you expect it to be noise cancelling. But I didn't get any noise leaking. And the passengers next to me didn't complain when I amped up the volume.Using it while working out though...while I was on an inclined bench it does have the tendency to fall off. So gravity is not its friend.I think if you're going to use these occasionally but you need to have a pair around so you don't bother the person you're working next to, it's a decent buy.",

                "reviewText": "First, I can't stand ear buds. They don't fit right, they are painful (even the foam tip ones), and I always need to take them out every so often, just because of the painful pressure on my ear walls.These sit very comfortably on the ear itself, just like an \"old fashioned\" headphone would, but without the band that would rest on the crown of your head. Instead, they rest on the top of each ear, but they are so light I hardly notice. The only time i felt the need to take them off for a little bit was 5 hours into a study session; even then 10 minutes later I put them back on for the rest of the session.Something that can be a plus or a minus is that they aren't noise-blocking, the way tight earbuds can be. For me, this was a bonus, as I want to have more awareness of the world around me as I go on walks, but if you're going to be spending 80% of your day writing the next great American novel in the local coffee shop, you should probably spring for over the ear cup headphones.My only complaint is that one of the ear's cables is longer than the other. I presume this is so that the cable can be shorter, and thus less likely to tangle, but I'm not sold on that. Still, I barely notice.If you dislike/hate earbuds, but still want to wear something over the ear (so you can wear a cap as an example), I strongly recommend you give these a shot.",

I needed a straight connector plug instead of the right angle plug to work with my new iPad and cover. The pros: plug fits fine with iPad cover in place, they are very compact and seem comfortable (haven't used them yet for an extended period). The cons: sound quality is fine with dialog, pretty bad for music (absolutely no bass) and the cord for the right ear phone is weirdly longer than the one for the left (this would seem to be a completely avoidable manufacturing defect). Overall, I'm giving them a pretty good rating, simply because they meet the limited needs I have for them (mostly watching Nexflix on an iPad). Skip these if you want them for music. The similar ones from Koss sounds way better.",
