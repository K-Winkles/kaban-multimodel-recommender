                "reviewText": "I just got these, so this is just an initial review for now. If anything changes, I will update after some use.I am pretty \"behind the times\" on most technology, so these are my first bluetooth headphones/ear buds despite the fact that none of my devices have been compatable with corded headphones for a long time - if I'm in a place where I can't play audio directly out of the device, I usually just don't. All of this to give context that I am not necessarily hugely picky about the small details - I just need something that would let me listen to music or movies when I fly. I wasn't sure what to expect from the price, but so far I really like them!Pros:- Clear sound quality! I read lots of reviews that the bass was a little much, but I don't think it's bad. There is a button on the left ear that you can use to change the sound settings, so if the default setting isn't good for you, see if one of the other 5 settings works better!- Easy set up- Stays put on your head. I put these on and did a quick yoga flow with a few down dogs and it barely budged. If you need these for some kind of physical activity, it seems like they aren't going to be needing constant readjustment.- Decently noise canceling. While you can still hear a bit of what is going on around you, these seem to do a decent job of limiting extraneous sound. And they do a great job of containing the media sound withing the headphone - I put them in my lap and played music and couldn't hear it! No need to worry about bothering someone next to you.- Easy to adjust length-Decently comfortable. I tend to have pretty sensitive ears when it comes to headphones/earbuds, so not immediately feeling like my ears are being smashed is important to me. I will update after I have had an opportunity to wear them for a long time (1+ hour) but I've had them on for about 30 minutes and still feel comfortable with them on which is a good sign.Cons:- The plastic exterior just felt a bit low quality to me at first. When I pulled them out of the box I wasn't sure how well they would work because they just felt kind of cheap. They're really pretty though, and lightweight, so I don't really think this is a big deal, especially given the price!!- The joints where the ear pieces can fold in to compact just feel a bit stiff, and I am a little concerned about how many times I'll be able to fold/unfold them before something breaks. For now there aren't any issues, but I'm keeping my eye on it.- It's kind of tricky to control the volume on the actual headset. I have sensitive hearing so I have only been using the lowest possible volume setting and it is plenty, but if I need to toggle up or down it's definitely easier to do on my device. The press and hold system on the ear piece doesn't allow for as much control in the margin of increase/decrease in volume. Not a huge issue, but an area that could use improvement for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a good pair of wireless headphones on a budget price ever since Apple decided to remove the 3.5mm jack from their phones, with every phone company following suit. So now I'm forced to listen to wireless products. However, the cool thing about these headphones is it CAN be wired, which I love.The sound quality is amazing for the price. It blows my wireless earbuds out of the water in terms out sound, from vocal clarity to bass to every little sound that goes into the song. They can get quite loud and powerful. The noise cancelation also seems to work quite well.I've been wearing these pretty much non-stop since they arrived. They're pretty light but also decently durable for the price, so you really can't tell you've got them on. The battery life is amazing I can wear them for ages without charging, I think I've only charged them once in the past few days since they arrived.Another really cool feature is the buttons on side, power on/off, volume up/down, some sort of EQ mode button that allows you to switch between different pre-sets to make specific music you're listening to feel deeper, and you start to notice more sounds.Don't get me wrong, there's probably way better wireless headphones in the market, but for this price (I paid $19.28) they are absolutely amazing and I might pick up a few more pairs in case one ever breaks for some reason.If you're reading this review and still hesitating snagging a pair of these and they're in the $20ish range. Snag 'em up. They're fantastic and I'm very pleased with the quality, comfort, and durability of these wireless headphones for the price.Side notes: It also has an FM feature which I haven't tested much, but that's unique and cool. Useful if you enjoy listening to certain radio shows. The microphone for phone calls seems to be quality, and of course I can hear the calls crystal clear.I'm sure I'm missing a few things, but overall I'd rate these a 10/10 based off all the factors I listed above. Give them a try you won't be disappointed!P.S. I LOVE the gold and black color. It looks incredible. Buy these. They're awesome. You're welcome, now go enjoy some tunes.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these last April 2022. They recently broke because I took them off my head at a weird angle and so they broke. Even though they broke it still functions. Prior to that I had dropped them plenty of times over the year I had them and they did not break. So, they're durable. I was able to tape it together but I'll need to get a new one regardless because it doesn't fit on my head the same. The sound quality is good for headphones that are $20. However, the mic quality is absolute shit, so make sure you have an external microphone you can use. The volume controls are decent but I typically set my volumes using my PC settings. I've used them for work from home, meetings, and even for playing games. The battery life is good too and they work while plugged in and charging. I also like that they'll automatically shut off when not in use. Overall, definitely good for the price. I'd recommend it.",
