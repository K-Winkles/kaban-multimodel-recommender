                "reviewText": "I had bought the corded version of these four years ago and they are still working. My boys are very tough on headphones so I like the wire adjustment on the sides instead of the plastic. I hope they never get rid of this style, they're very strong and the kids can abuse them without breaking them. I bought this because they've been doing a lot of zoom and need a microphone as well. I like that you can use as a Bluetooth or as a corded headphone set, for when they forget to charge it. Plus they plug into the computer that doesn't have Bluetooth. They have worked on our Motorola phones, iPad, Samsung tablet, and a computer with Bluetooth. Very easy to use with only the three buttons. You can turn the lights on and off by long pressing the volume + and -. The power button pauses and plays. And if you press power twice it goes forward to the next video and if you press it three times it goes back.I wouldn't say that these are totally noise canceling, I would say that the noise canceling is just right. They can concentrate without other noises bothering them, but they can hear me if I need to get their attention.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for an extremely affordable pair of toddler headphones, performance be damned, then these are for you. I read the positive reviews and hey, my 3.5-year-old breaks a lot of stuff, so the price made me smile. But after using them only a few times, I could easily see there were better alternatives, even if they cost a few more bucks.The good:-The style appeals to kids. My toddler was happy to scroll through the color options and he thought they looked cool.-They feel sturdy enough. The plastic isn't incredibly flimsy, as I expected, and the photos are a fair representation of the product.-They fold up somewhat to save space.The bad:-The wired connection is awful. My kiddo went this route with his tablet, and it had the problem where you heard extreme crackling any time the aux cable was touched. You spin the cable a little bit or just touch the cable where it is plugged in, and it's all feedback. My kid doesn't sit perfectly still. He moves around, shifts the tablet's position, all kinds of movement during a flight. If your kid is a statue or otherwise mostly immobile while watching something, maybe this is a non-issue for you.-The volume didn't go loud enough. And this is coming from a parent who was worried about all headphones being TOO loud. I tested them with numerous devices before cutting them loose to my son, and no matter what I used, the top volume was not great. That means when we got on a plane, with the default background noise of jet engines, we could barely hear anything, even with the volume all the way up. I found this to be true with two tablets, both wired and Bluetooth, and an iPhone. And yes, I'm aware there is volume control both on the headphones and the devices themselves. Everything involved, all the way up, I was straining to listen.-No noise cancelation whatsoever. To be fair, they aren't advertised that way. But I think everyone expects a little bit of noise to be canceled when using large headphones that cover the ear. These seem to let all the noise in, which pairs terribly with volume that is barely there. The cushion parts for the ears feel very thin. Without any density there, all the noises come right on in.I can't hate on them entirely, right? I mean, they are just over $20. I have a feeling, though, that the cons I've mentioned above are a factor into why these are listed at $40 but always around 40% off. So, if you're someone with a kid who is always breaking or losing their stuff, these are probably a great starter set of headphones. I get it, why spend more money on something that is inevitably only part of the household for a short while? Or maybe you need an affordable gift. Or if money is tight and you need something over nothing, I'm guessing most kids are more than happy to wear these brightly colored, kid-oriented headphones.But for me, I wanted a solid pair for my kid to use during travel for the next few years. Something that would hold up and perform, something he could zone out with and not hear other kids screaming or loud noises, and just enjoy his shows. And these definitely do not fit that description.Better than nothing, but if you have a few dollars to spare, there's got to be a next step up.",

                "reviewText": "I picked up 3 sets of these for my girls that spend an above average amount of time (we feel) on screens. They had been using corded volume limiting headphones and the weakness on those was the cords themselves breaking and constantly needing to be replaced. The cost for that was starting to add up and it made sense to look at Bluetooth ones.Pros- After 2 months of daily use they seem to be working great and have good sound quality- Battery life is good, I charge them once a week and takes about 2 hours or so- They are comfortable to wear- The connectivity is greatCons- The lights are cool but they do cut down the battery life, and when the kid is wearing them they can\u2019t see them anyway so not much use for that. Nice option though and easy to turn on and off.- I feel they are a bit loud for volume limiting headphones but it could just be that they cancel outside noise well because they do seal up well against the ear - either that or the kids are just ignoring me (not impossible).- Not a big fan of the USB port to charge, it\u2019s easy to try pushing it in upside down if you\u2019re not careful which could cause damage, and in reading other reviews it has happened to some folks. I see that was changed up on the newer version that use USB-C that can be reversed, so a lot easier.I would have no problem recommending these, hopefully they last a long time to come",
