                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The music was a bit quiet, can't really heard the bass unless you put the volume up and when you turn the volume up, your music can be heard from the outside, but it was very easy to connect, super comfy, and came with small instructions as well as a charging cord and the other headphone cord if you want to plug headphones into your phone instead of Bluetooth, also in my opinion,it isn't uncomfortable if you plan to wear it for long periods of time. 9/10, would recommend and would definitely buy this again.",

And I wasn't sure what name to connect them to because nowhere in the instructions does it say. But once it was found it's been great. I bought these for my daughter who say they're very comfortable and the sound is great. She's very happy with them.",

My only qualm is that when it turns on or off it says 'power on/off', and when it connects it says \u2018bluetooth connected\u2019 or \u2018bluetooth disconnected' quite loudly. That audio can\u2019t be turned off (from what I tried) and the volume for it is set and not controlled by the regular volume control buttons so basically you have to live with it.",

Tie ribbons in a bow around each ear piece to make them extra cute!",

I turn them on before putting them on and can hear it from several feet away lol.",
