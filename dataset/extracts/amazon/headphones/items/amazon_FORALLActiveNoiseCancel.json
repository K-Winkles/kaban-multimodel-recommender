I like that they fit completely over the ear. I think their \"noise cancelling\" feature is mostly due to that. I'm a man with a 7-1/2 hat size. I don't find them any more or less comfortable than my wired Bose noise cancelling headphones that are several years old. The Bose cost ten times more. The on/off and volume controls are nicely located. There is a L and R side. Look inside the headband for the L/R. I cannot comment on the battery life. I've worn them for a few hours without any indication that the performance has diminished. Pairing is easy with an audible \"pair the device\" and \"paired.\" Same for \"power on.\"",

                "reviewTitle": "Decent over-ear headphones, average ANC, reasonably clear voice, comfortable, average bass",
                "reviewText": "These are decent over-ear headphones that appear well-constructed and they are reasonably comfortable to wear (at least for the 2-3 hours during the tests). They certainly LOOK premium (and of course it wouldn't be a fair comparison with $500 ones) and they don't disappoint [much] either. Well, they are as premium as they can get at this price point with the features that they have (which isn't a lot but so is the price so that's that).To start with, the earmuff is average (or just slightly above average) which is a bit disappointing; it could certainly use more cushion but it works just fine. The earcups allow for 90\u00b0 swivel which is nice and most others at this price point do NOT allow this. They are also foldable which again not all headphones are capable of this which is often puzzling to me (I mean, why not?). The overall build quality is pretty decent without visible defects of any sort. The adjustable headband is easy to work with without any issue and so is the swivel which is very smooth.The usual buttons (power and volume +/- etc) are located at the back side of the earcup at the right. It can be charged via standard USB-C which is nice.Pairing is a snap (as they all should at this point in time) and the overall sound quality for highs and lows are above average; not great but more than adequate for the average consumers. The bass is equally decent although it's a bit boomy at times and it's probably not gonna be as impressive for those who prefer more emphasis toward the lower frequencies. They don't have any of the low latency or HD codecs such as aptX-LL or aptX-HD which is expected for headphones at this price range.Unfortunately, they don't have cVc 8.0 although they do claim to have ANC (more on that) but it's important to remember that cVc benefits the party that doesn't have one (i.e. it's for the other end of the conversation) while ANC usually helps with the party that has it. So cVc helps the people that you talk to by reducing the noise on your end when you are talking. In other words, if you find it difficult to hear your friends when they are in a noisy environment, it's not because noise cancellation doesn't work, it's only at they NEED cVc (or other protocols that do what cVc does) on their end. If the noise is on your end, then you'd need ANC for your headphones.So how do they perform with respect to calls? Well, it really depended on the environment that I was in. My voice appeared fairly clear as reported by the other party when I was in a relatively quiet place; however, the voice quality drastically worsened when artificial noise was introduced at my end (e.g. lower frequency fan noise).Unfortunately, the ANC didn't appear to work adequately for me either when I was in a relatively noisy environment (artificial ambient noise and fan). As a result, I was having a difficult time understanding the other party at times and that's a bit disappointing since it does advertise being having ANC of sorts although it's not clear to me exactly what it is, hybrid or not.\u2261 ValueLet me be clear - these ain't some earth-shattering over-ear headphones that's gonna blow your mind (and VERY far from it); however, these are in my opinion a decent enough and quite capable at this particular price point of $40 that provides adequate lows/bass and reasonably decent highs/mids with somewhat comfortable earmuffs. Unfortunately, they don't have cVc and ANC doesn't appear to work as expected which is a bit of a boo-boo. I can't speak about longevity for obvious reasons but I'll provide an update if and when that changes.",
