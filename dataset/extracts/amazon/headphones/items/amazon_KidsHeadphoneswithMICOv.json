They are very soft, cable is long, not heavy. Fits my school age kids and I used it comfortably few times. I\u2019m surprised how well they performed and look feel for the price. Sound is good. Expected way flimsier. Color is cute too. If another one needed I would probably get these again coz price was reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the over-ear headphones for kids and I am extremely impressed with their quality and design. The headphones are specifically designed for children, with a comfortable and adjustable fit, and volume limiting technology to protect young ears.One of the things I appreciate most about these headphones is the comfortable fit. The ear cups are padded and the headband is adjustable, making it easy for kids to wear them for long periods of time without discomfort. The headphones are also lightweight, which is great for kids who may have trouble keeping heavier headphones on their head.Another great feature of these headphones is the volume limiting technology. It limits the maximum volume to 85 decibels, which is the recommended safe level for children's ears. This ensures that children can enjoy their music, audiobooks, or videos without risking damage to their hearing.The headphones are also very durable and easy to clean. The ear cups and headband are made of high-quality materials that can withstand the wear and tear of kids' use, and the ear cups can be easily removed and cleaned.Overall, I highly recommend these over-ear headphones for kids. They are comfortable, durable, and have volume limiting technology to protect young ears. The price is also very reasonable for the quality of the product. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I believe the child who received it as a gift will love it too.",
