I came across these ones, price is not bad for a pair of 5s. Sound quality is not bad, I only use it for calls not really for music. The cable looks strong and I like them so far if anything changes down the road I will update my review/rating as always.",

They are comfortable, I am mostly listening to courses, so it works well for me. If you watch the video, I posted you can see that where the headphone jack is a plastic cover is coming off, nothing that impairs the function of the headphones and I find to be fairly minimal especially when in consideration of the price, but that\u2019s why I am giving these four and not five stars. Got these since I sometimes lose headphones, And since there are multiple, I can always have a backpack back up. I don\u2019t regret the purchase.",

Sometimes changing the equalizer settings solves the problem. They do what they were made to do though and seem sturdy.",
