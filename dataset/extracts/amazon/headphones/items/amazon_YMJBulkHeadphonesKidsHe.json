Which my kids would have also broken and/or lost because they are super hard on everything. The two year old ripped the cord out of the headset of one pair. Another pair the interior speaker came dislodged but I was able to open up the headphones and fix it. They are very comfortable, very flexible, and we've had no issues from normal use. I prefer to have cheap ones I don't have to worry about rather than $30 ones I'm paranoid about. I like them so much I'm purchasing another set to have more backups.",
