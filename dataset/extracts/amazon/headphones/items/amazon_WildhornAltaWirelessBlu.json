                "reviewText": "Bought these back on Prime Day, and have finally been able to use them out on the hill a couple of times now, and I have to say these are pretty good little speakers:The initial Bluetooth connection was quick and easy, and I have had no problems with it dropping. When you power them up a voice tells you they're on and ready to pair and the battery level. If your phone is nearby they will then automatically pair and the voice confirms once paired up.I have 3 helmets (Wildhorn Drift, Giro Jackson, and an old Smith Variance - all size L), and these fit in the ear covers of all 3 with no-problem. The cable between speakers is long enough, and the extra cable stashes behind the liners so that they're almost invisible.The sound quality of music is great. Songs are clear and crisp. Bass is full sounding , but not heavy, as some reviewers have noted. However, I wasn't really expecting them to be bass-heavy. These are not in-ear or over-ear speakers. They are barely-pressed-against your ear speakers. (Pull your Beats headphones away from your ears so that they are barely touching your ears and the Beats will not sound bass-heavy either.) The sound quality remains clear at high volume, and these get louder than I would ever need them to be. They still allow outside noise in, so you can still talk to friends on the chair, or hear what's going on around you during your run.I can't really comment on call quality as cell service is spotty at my hill, so I haven't made any calls on them.The buttons are a little difficult to use/locate at first, but once you use them a couple of times and get used to where the buttons sit inside your ear pad they get easier to use. The speakers respond quickly to button commands, and I haven't had any issue using Google assistant with them.The battery seems pretty good. 3-4 hours of use seems to only zap about 15-20% of the battery. I've never run them all the way to 0%, but would expect to get at least 14-15 hours out of each full charge.All in all, these are great little speakers, and to me they are way more comfortable/practical than trying to use ear buds inside your helmet. At $70 the price is right, and is half the price of the other guys. If you're looking for speakers for your helmet, I'd give these a try first.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty hard to find anything negative about these headphones. Pairs instantly with iPhone and has great sound and no issues with being too thick for helmet earpads. Any complaints about lack of bass or volume are extremely nit-picky. Battery life is good, audio is crisp and clear. With respect to volume, in all seriousness it's way more than adequate. Listening to music at high dB's causes irreversible hearing loss so beware. Very easy to listen to music and still hear all that's going on around you, even conversing with folks on a chairlift if you're skiing.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Review for Smith Vantage Helmet with Chips Comparison",
                "reviewText": "I replaced my 3 year old chips wireless system because the battery wasn\u2019t holding much of a charge any longer. I chose these as a replacement for a few reasons. First, the price. Second, the three button design is much simpler. Although the chips have a few more features, the combination of pressing buttons was confusing, always had to learn it again at the start of the season. Third, when you run out of battery these can be plugged into a power bank, which I always carry in my coat, and retain all functions. The chips system requires connecting a standard audio cable which defeats the purpose of having glove friendly large buttons and limits functions.Now for a review and comparison of the speaker system. Overall the system works well, sounds as good as the chips and has great Bluetooth connection. I appreciate the audio response for pairing, battery level and power off which the chips don\u2019t do. The cord is long enough to span the back of my helmet, the speakers fit well in the space provided in the ear flaps and provides no additional pressure on the ears. It also has the charging port, a standard micro usb, on the left side which matches where my zipper opens, the reverse of the chips.It does have some issues though. Not sure why, but the included charge cord is only a few inches long, I would really have appreciated getting a 3 foot cord with a 90 degree jack. It would make charging much easier, be more durable and double as a backup way to use the speakers with my power bank when they run out of charge. The large buttons are also deceptive. The rubber is merely a covering over a smaller button underneath. Not a problem to use with bare fingers but definitely not very glove friendly. I don\u2019t normally adjust volume or have a need to skip tracks so the left side doesn\u2019t really bother me. My main use is on the right side, usually just to pause my music as I talk with my lift mates. Although, I have found that I use Siri more often since it is easy to access, great way to ask for the time. With gloves on I had a lot of trouble engaging the right button since it is really only about the size of a soda bottle cap. I found a good hack though. I got a hard rubber furniture pad, cut it to size and attached it to the speaker. The added width does not put any more pressure on my ear and now I hardly ever miss hitting the button. I would occasionally have problems hitting the chips buttons but they definitely work better because they are actually larger and provide a more tactile response when engaged.As another reviewer pointed out they annoyingly beep in between songs. I contacted support and didn\u2019t get a resolution. However, I did find a fix on my own if you are using an iPhone. You need to change the call routing selection in the settings to automatic, only downside is that your phone will also ring using its speakers which can be annoying to lift mates, unless you use the silence switch.Update 4/3/19. The fix to remove the beep stopped working when I adjusted the volume using the left buttons. Tried everything, finally let the headphones completely drain of power and then charged fully. The beeps went away. However, when I used my phone to adjust the volume they came back again. It appears that the on,y way to get rid of the beeps is to perform this battery drain and then not adjust the volume.I rarely make or receive phone calls while skiing. I have asked people on the other end how things sound and reviews were better with the chips, sounds the same to me with either system.Final result, I prefer the Wildhorn system, just hope they prove as durable and lasting as the chips were.",

La calidad del sonido deja mucho que desear. Hay una gran ausencia de bajos; siquiera con el ecualizador de Spotify, por ejemplo, se consigue que el sonido deje de estar tan descompensado con las frecuencias m\u00e1s altas (medios y agudos).3. Supongo que depender\u00e1 de cada caso, pero en mi Casco de Snowboard (OAKLEY MOD5 Mips) son inc\u00f3modos: los altavoces se dejan ubicar bien en las orejeras y el cable tiene la suficiente longitud, pero cuando te pones el casco, las orejas quedan presionadas y las orejeras quedan como abiertas hacia afuera como consecuencia del espesor de los altavoces, que no es mucho, pero lo suficientemente para ser incomodo cuando te pones el casco.",
