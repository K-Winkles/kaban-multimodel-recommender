It doesn\u2019t work, neither pair. It acts like a Bluetooth but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know how to explain it I plugged the headphones into my phone and they connected to my business phone, which was right next to it, and I could hear things off my business phone while I was plugged into my personal phone. It was weird both headphones did the exact same thing, I\u2019m going to Apple and I\u2019m purchasing a real pair for the same. These are supposed to be plain wired headphones, not Bluetooth but as long as it\u2019s plugged into a power source, it will Bluetooth so weird.",
