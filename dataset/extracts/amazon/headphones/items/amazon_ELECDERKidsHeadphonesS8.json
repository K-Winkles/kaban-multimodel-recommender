                "reviewText": "I was concerned at first because the outside of the box said these headphones were great for kids 3+. I immediately thought (before I even opened the box), that I was probably going to have to return them. But after opening it, I was happy that the size was similar to most other headphones. I tried them on and I was surprised at how soft and comfortable the cushion was. I was able to plug it into a computer (Mac and PC) and there weren't any issues. The buttons to adjust the volume were functional and the sound was clear. The ultimate test was when the actual owner of the headset (the kid of course), was excited immediately because of how the color popped. He also \"LOVED\" how the cushion felt. It seems durable and I appreciate that it folds quite easily. For the cost, it's definitely a great choice for kids that need to bring in headphones at school.",

Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of these sooner! Bought an extra pair for my son to take to school!",
