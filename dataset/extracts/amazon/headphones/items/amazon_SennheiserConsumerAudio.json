The only major defect I see in these headphones are the volume levels\u2026I see the same issue in momentum 4\u2019s as well that is reason I have returned those\u2026same issue with accentums as well\u2026not sure why sennheiser do not consider this defect to fix or may be that\u2019s how it\u2019s designed\u2026we only feel fuller sound when the volume is 100 percent\u2026if the volume is below 80 you feel nothing\u2026the volume we get for 100 usually need to be at 75-80 level\u2026if this is fixed no other headphones even very expensive which are out in current market can beat these headphones. I may return because of the unsatisfied volume levels.",

The inner ear area is large enough at 65mm tall and the padding is super soft and doesn't bother me while wearing glasses. They can get warm but the cushion is easily wiped down from any sweat if you're in a hot environment. Best thing I've gotten myself all year!",

They were too tight for long term comfort, and only were used 1-2 times per week.I read reviews that they would be comfortable for a larger head, but I could never wear them for long. Just after 30 day return window, they started making crackling/or skipping sounds while listening and have stopped holding charge. I'm not sure if I just received a faulty device, but for the price, it's beyond annoying, and I'm not even sure I will get product support.",

This buzzing was an issue I had with low quality headphones I tried before but I never though sennheiser would not have this since I really like their earbuds (true wireless1). Idk why it has that noise if its the active noise cancelling which cannot be turned off only switched to transparency mode which is really annoying. The headphones were packed very poorly so they could have been knocked around during shipping but it could have just been bad wiring that is making the buzzing noise.",
