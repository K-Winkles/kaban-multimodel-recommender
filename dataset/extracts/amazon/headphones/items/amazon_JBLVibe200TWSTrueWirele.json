                "reviewText": "Bought these to replace my first pair of wireless ear buds (Tozo T10) because they are smaller and I was hoping would fit better. The Tozo ear buds worked great but didn't fit me very well and would come loose during exercise which was the primary reason I bought them in the first place.I initially searched for replacement ear bud tips (foam/silicone) on Amazon but then decided to try buying a whole new pair of wireless ear buds that were slimmer in shape and would hopefully fit my ears better. These come with three pair of silicone tips (small, medium, large) and I initially had issues getting them to stay in my ears but found the solution by using the smallest pair whereas I've used medium my entire life with every other pair of ear buds.They connected to my phone quickly and easily although the noise/chirp every time they sync is very loud and a little annoying. For anyone that experiences interruptions/skips in their music, try turning your Bluetooth off then back on. This was a huge problem for me at first as I was used to playing music in my car then switching to headphones upon arriving at the gym. My music kept cutting out and at first I blamed interference and the range but, after some googling, found a simple solution.They charge quickly and the battery lasts a long time. Music quality is good although not a ton of bass which might be a problem for those who prefer a heavier sound. I like the small case as it fits neatly in my pocket.Excellent for the price. Didn't want to spend a lot of money on wireless buds but this brand is growing on me and, when this pair breaks down, I think I will go with another from JBL.",

                "reviewText": "I have had these for 7 months - and they are exactly what you pay for: a pair of solid, budget friendly ear buds. Sound quality is decent - mine will loosen in my ears after prolonged activity, so it affects the sound. I have to push them back in every once in an awhile to get a good seal. The fit is good, but not perfect like my air pod pros. The batteries in this thing are amazing - it really blows anything I've owned out of the water, life-wise. They will play a long time without needing to recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works great-I never have any problems connecting to my devices. These are great for work and outdoor activity if you want to save your air pod pros for more important stuff. Got these on Black Friday last year for $25, so you can't really go wrong. JBL always makes solid products. Would recommend for sure - but beware those are not high end by any stretch.",

                "reviewText": "My AirPods Pro gave up on me after 2.5 years of use, and I wanted a cheaper replacement headphone that I could throw around and sweat in without worrying. These sound great, good microphone quality, and great battery life. One inconvenience is switching the earbuds from one device to another, which isn't nearly as smooth as the AirPods are, but that's not expected at this price point. As for longevity, I wouldn't know how these hold up since I've had them for less than a week, but so far so great",

Every time I try to pull out the earbuds is a frustrating event that usually ends up with the earbud on the ground and me chasing it.Pros1. Sound is good.2. Charge fast and last a bit.3. Stay put in my ear when chewing gum.Cons1. They are too round to grab.2. The case is too small for normal man fingers.3. No app access to customize the sound.4. The sound goes way down when using the microphone on a computer. I had to load an equalizer app to boost the sound just to compensate for the loss in volume from the earbuds.",

My work is not far from an airport so when the planes go over every you do struggle to hear. The sound quality is good as well. Not as good as higher end, but if your buying these those other probably aren't in the budget. I would definitely buy these again.",
