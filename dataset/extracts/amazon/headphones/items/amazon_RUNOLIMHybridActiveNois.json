                "reviewText": "Since I live in an apartment, I use over ear Bluetooth noise canceling headphones to watch TV or listen to music on a daily basis. I have a Sony 1000-XM2 that I love, an MPow M5 and Soundcore Q20 that I gave to my mom. The Sonys are my gold standard for sound quality, but both the MPOW and Soundcore are exceptional as well.The MPow M5 finally started to physically break after 4+ years of years of near daily use, so I purchased these to replace them.I selected these because they were the among the highest rated and most purchased over ear noise canceling blue tooth headphones under $40.I received my headphones in about a couple days. The box contained the headphones, a carrying case, and cables. The build quality of the headset seems very solid with substantial earcups, a large battery between the head padding and earcups. The construction is all mat plastic with a metal leaf spring in the headband. I\u2019m not sure if the swivel hinges are metal. ANC is controlled with a sliding switch behind the left ear while on/off, volume, skipping, pausing and pairing are controlled with three plastic push-buttons behind the right ear.When you press the buttons you hear/ feel a mechanical click that I am guessing is designed to be hepatic feedback and less intrusive than audible beeps in the headphones. Primary function of the buttons are track skipping and on/off. Holding the track buttons for a couple of seconds will allow you to control volume. This exactly the opposite of most headphones and very annoying in my opinion, as I more often want to adjust volume than skip tracks. The center (on/off) button, also allows you to pause and when held for about five seconds will put the headphones in pairing mode. As the noise canceling is on a separate slider but it does turn off with the headphones unlike other budget brands/ models. Aside from the very annoying track skipping, the controls are intuitive and reasonable.Sound quality is really good for the price. These is some punch in the bass but it isn\u2019t overpowering. Mids and highs are clear. At the highest volumes the sound remains super clear with consistent bass. The sound quality is very good overall and exceptional at the price, better than my MPOW on par with Soundcore Q20s.Noise canceling operates as a single mode without a bypass/ ambient sound feature which is expected at this price point. Noise canceling is at least reasonably good for this price point. Low frequency noise can\u2019t be heard, but, mid-to-high frequencies are not affected much. The sonic profile does not change with noise canceling on. Overall, noise canceling is what one can expect at this price point. If you need more mid to high frequency noise reduction, I\u2019d recommend just getting a pair of Sony MX\u2019s.Range is good. I can go anywhere in my apartment or even outside nearby with no loss of sound quality. Again, at this price point, I think this is expectedly good. Battery life seems insanely good. I have probably listened to 80.hours of TV and music on a single charge.The headphones have a \u201cC\u201d profile that curves moderately off the side of my head. I have a small to medium sized head, and I find these fit reasonably. However, they are a bit on the heavy side and the protein pads are thick and can get a little hot, though not unreasonably so.Overall I give this set extremely high marks for sound quality and battery life. Build quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are good. The only detraction I see are that that weird track skipping primary function in the controls. If I could give four and a half stars, I would, but given how Amazon reviews work, I\u2019ll give this five stars.",

                "reviewText": "These headphones do everything right at an astounding price. Sure, more money will buy you better noise cancellation and better sound. But right here you have *good* ANC and *good* sound, built into light, comfortable headphones that connect quickly and (so far) reliably. They are also light, foldiable and comfortable. They don't come with a case and they take 5 seconds to power on and off, but those are the only negatives at this price.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these headphones to replace my main noise-cancelling headphones. I don't have a large budget right now to purchase electronics, so these were a good price for me. I was able to purchase these headphones for just under $30. I currently live in an apartment that tends to have a lot of very loud background noise, so noise cancelling headphones, as well as white noise, have become a necessity for me.I ordered these headphones on Thursday, and promptly received them on Friday, the next day. They came with all the items that were supposed to be included. I really like that there is a hard shelled case that is included. However, the case is enclosed in a fabric that seems to be kind of irritating/scratchy to the touch. I haven't used the case, yet, but, it may come in handy in the future. One thing that I really like about these headphones is that they are so lightweight. They have a good, solid feel to them, without being bulky or weighty. They are snug, but, not to the point that I have to keep readjusting them to make them fit comfortably. I used them all day Saturday, and I have only experienced maybe slight itchiness inside my right ear. My ears have not gotten irritated, itchy, or overheated, as is the case with a lot of headphones that I have used. I wear glasses and alot of headphones push my frames in to the point of being painful. These headphones do not cause problems or discomfort with my wearing glasses. The one thing that I do not like, is the loud, (to the point of being jarring), voice prompt that lets the user know that the headphones are connected. I have found that I am better off not wearing them when they are connecting or disconnecting, as the voice prompt is so loud. I wish that there was a way to turn that down. They seem to hold a charge, and even when I have charged them, they don't seem to take very long to charge. The noise- cancelling could be a little better, but, they do seem to reduce some of the background noise. Overall, I have enjoyed using these headphones, and am very pleased with this purchase.",

It's easy to not only listen to my music but also tune out the busy office environment so that I can focus on my work. Battery seems to last a while. Headphones are very comfortable on my ears. It folds easily for travel purposes as well. Comes with two chords one for charging and one to go into my cell phone I have several pairs of headphones and I would recommend this one to people who are looking at getting noise canceling headphones.",

                "reviewText": "Basically I like the feel of these headphones -- when they're on my head that is. I have other headphones galore, but some are too heavy, some are too floppy. I like these because they are comfortable, stay put, and I forget I have them on my head. The sound is great with my Mac. I like them with my Yamaha silent guitar where those qualities I mentioned previously are important, to me.One disappointment only: when using them with my silent guitar I have to use the included 3.5mm cord because these headphones don't have sufficiently low latency to accommodate the instrument via a plugged in Bluetooth transmitter. I pluck a string and it is heard half a second later. But that's the only issue. And using the 3.5mm cord makes sense anyway because it simplifies things since I'm frequently jumping up and shutting things off or back on again and I don't want to have to consider Bluetooth anyway.i'd give them 5 stars if the latency wasn't an issue with my guitar. Actually, I may buy another pair so one set can be dedicated to may Mac and the other pair to my guitar.",

After testing it for about an hour while paired up on my Samsung Galaxy A21 phone while listening to some songs on Spotify, it seems to be pretty good. The noise cancellations on this headphone while outdoor is so-so, even if for example, you're at a subway station or the bus platform. The mic quality seems to be pretty good during a call. The build quality is alright, though I would prefer it to not be a hard plastic kind, but I won't hold it against them for that.Honestly, if you really want a Bluetooth headset, you could go for this one if you're tight on a budget. Otherwise, it wouldn't hurt if you spend a little extra. The name-branding on the side of the ear cups is a bit much, but no big deal.I would also like to suggest the seller for a possible consideration of providing an replacement ear pads for this headphone for those who wanted something a little more comfort. Just my two cents.All in all, this is a pretty solid headphone for those who're on a tight budget.",
