The foldable feature makes them incredibly portable, fitting snugly into the cute case that comes with the package. This makes it convenient for travel, ensuring that my headphones stay protected and tangle-free wherever I go.Comfort is a top priority for me, and these headphones deliver in spades. The over-ear design provides excellent noise isolation, allowing me to enjoy my music without any disturbances from the outside world. The cushioned ear cups are so soft that I can wear them for extended periods without any discomfort \u2013 perfect for long flights or marathon music sessions.Now, let's talk about the sound quality \u2013 it's truly impressive! The wireless connection is seamless, and the audio is crystal clear with a robust bass that adds an extra layer of depth to my favorite tracks. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes or catching up on podcasts, the sound is consistently excellent.What's even more impressive is the versatility of these headphones. The option to switch between wireless and wired modes gives me the flexibility I need, especially when the battery is running low. It's like having the best of both worlds.Last but certainly not least, the price point is incredibly reasonable for the quality you're getting. These headphones provide a premium experience without breaking the bank. It's rare to find a product that offers such a fantastic combination of features at such an affordable price.",

I also can\u2019t believe how clear they sound while using to talk on the phone. Everyone says they can also hear me clearly. The battery lasts a long time. We have only used these as wireless, we have not tried as wired. I have suggested these to friends and family also who thank me for the recommendation bc they like them so much! Great price and great product.",

                "reviewText": "It's crazy what you can get for so cheap these days. I'm really impressed so far with these.First of all, the features. I can't believe these have a built-in SD card reader?! I put some 8 hr sleep/relaxation mp3s (thunderstorms, ocean, box fan etc) on a card and just leave it in the slot. When I need to chill I can just put them on without any fuss (or Internet & phone.) They also have FM radio! Very handy. These features would make these great for kids, especially with sensory issues.Another thing that makes them great for kids is the size!!! My head is small and I've never had a pair of headphones fit this well. They can adjust to fit ANYONE!They are very comfortable. I do wish they had padding on the top part of the band though. It's just a bit of pleather that LOOKS like padding. But I normally get headaches from wearing headphones and these have been fine, even wearing for hours on end.The sound quality is very good. Bass tones are the only thing lacking. They can get VERY loud (which may be the one thing to watch out for with kids.) I saw a review saying these have noise cancellation but I don't think they do? However they seal well and dampen noise significantly.One charge lasts hours! Not sure how long, they've yet to die on me even while wearing 4-5 hrs straight. They also charge fast.Pairing was quick and easy. They only take a few seconds to connect and no issues with that yet.Last but not least, these look beautiful. I like rose gold EVERYTHING so color choice was easy. They fold up to save space. They also come with a matching case. It even has a mesh pocket for your charger. The case is pretty flimsy, it won't hold up to much abuse, but that's not a big deal for me.Man I really hope these last. I didn't expect to like them so much, now I'm attached.The ONLY negative so far: I occasionally hear this mechanical clicking noise in the left side. Hard to describe. I have sensory sensitivity which is why I needed these. The sound is really unpleasant and startling to me. It sounds like some part is moving inside, but nothing is loose. It only happens now and then but I am worried and bothered enough that I may exchange them. That's why I docked 1 star.I WILL update this review if they stop working or have any major issues. I've only used them for a few weeks but I have used them for at least 30 hours before reviewing.",

These earphones practically connected themselves...super easy to connect. They are very comfortable, however, my favorite thing is the sound, I can literally hear everything on the screen and they cancel out a lot of noise around me. I feel as though I'm at the movies. The price is awesome, I almost didn't want to write a review because I didn't want everyone to get them and have the price go up before I purchased my second pair. However, I decided that it's only fair that everyone should enjoy this product just as much as I do. I want to thank the sellers for offering this incredible product at such an amazing price. I highly recommend this product.",
