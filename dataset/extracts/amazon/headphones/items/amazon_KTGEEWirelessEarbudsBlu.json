                "reviewText": "The KTGEE T08 wireless earbuds are AMAZING! I purchased these earbuds with little thought of how they would sound. But, after reading the info about these earbuds (Bluetooth 5.3, 40 hrs play time, charging case with a LED screen showing the amount of charge left, and works with iPhones). The earbuds also being WATERPROOF is an unexpected plus! They are rated at 4.8 which is very impressive and the price is reasonable. I have several other earbuds at different stages and styles to compare the NEW earbuds against when I got them.The packaging was tightly packed and plastic sealed (NICE)! The instructions are really EASY to understand along with illustration. The earbuds synced with my iPhone with ease. And I noticed that when I use these earbuds, they QUICKLY sync to my phone. Unlike my other earbuds. The sound is GREAT and CLEAR! What REALLY got my attention and a little EXCITED was the fact of the earbuds feeling feather weight LITE and COMFORTABLE in my ears. Even though my NEW earbuds fit securely in my ears, without music; I had to touch my ears to make sure they were still in. And my BEST compliment about these earbuds is the fact that the touch to control whatever I need to do is very PRECISE! Just a simple touch and the earbuds respond as they should! My past earbuds purchased would NOT respond unless I\u2019m touching the earbuds several times before it responds (if it responds). Which has made me irritated in having to try any command. And my other earbuds are not that old.So, sum things up; I purchased the KTGEE T08 earbuds not expecting much. But, noticeably getting earbuds exactly how they are described and much more! I also APPRECIATE the quality of the air buds! Even though I didn\u2019t give the purchase of these earbuds much thought, using them has REALLY captured my attention! Noting that these KTGEE T08 earbuds are a GOOD DEAL and a GREAT PURCHASE! I\u2019m SATISFIED that the earbuds surpassed, my mediocre expectations. It\u2019s definitely worth the price and purchase!",

These are terrific substitutes for the name brand. They fit well, sound is good, charge quickly and hold a charge a lot longer than the very expensive models. I have just had these for a few weeks - so far so good. At this price I can replace them eery few years and still be ahead of the game.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In the few short hours since I received my package\u2026These earbuds have met and exceeded my expectations. The sound quality for how affordable they are is phenomenal and I don\u2019t think anyone could ask for much more. A breeze to set up from out of the box. They connected with ease to a Windows Laptop, and iPhone. The device toggles nicely between devices with no lag. Am able to close my laptop, and they connect back to my iPhone and vice versa if I were to manually disconnect the Bluetooth on my iPhone.I really like the display on the front of the charging case because you can pretty much tap the cover and the display has little bars on the right and left corners to indicate the charge in each earbud, and a battery percentage number for the charging case itself which is neat compared to other budget brands where you have to wait for them to pair to the device you\u2019re using for a voice prompt message or searching in the device Bluetooth settings, or trying to see the blinking lights on the charger case itself.No complaints here, honestly.Affordable, Simple, Sleekly Styled & Functional",

                "reviewText": "Particularly when you consider the cost, these offer a great value. Pairing with Bluetooth is quick, easy, and stable. Sound for music is pretty good, two way sound for phone calls seems good. I really appreciate the battery life indicator on the case, which takes away the guesswork on wondering how much power is left. Battery life is really good. And while you get better sound isolation and quality from ear buds that seal in your ears, I really prefer to wear this open type. I have no idea how long they\u2019ll last, but happy with them for now.",
