                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones for air travel, with some quibbles",
                "reviewText": "I'll do this review as a pro/con. For reference, my previous travel headphones were the very old-school Bose QC15, which were the only game in town for true noise cancelling headphones in the day but didn't have Bluetooth (without a 3rd-party thingy with a funky charger that went into the headphone port), and they finally gave up the ghost after a long, hard travel run.PROS:1. Sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but these sound great to my ears, especially after tuning using their HearID function. (#2 below).2. The app is really helpful. I especially like the HearID (auto EQ), which provides tones of varying volume and pitch and adjusts the EQ for your hearing after making you realize you're getting old and just how many high tones you can no longer hear. It is surprising how much better music sounds after doing this, and I hate manually adjusting EQs. I use Android, and there is even a widget that allows control of the noise cancelling right from the main screen.3. Battery life. Still had battery level \"medium\" after an 11-hour international plane trip (used them for probably 7-8 hours of this).4. Noise cancelling, which works quite well on airplanes. Turn them on, and silence... sometimes I just do that without music for some peace and quiet during air travel.5. The carrying case is hard-shelled and has withstood travel well so far. Initially it can be a little tricky folding them right to fit.CONS (quibbles, really):1. They are a little bulky on the ears. They are not heavy (quite light actually), and unnoticeable when sitting upright. But using them while laying down can be a little uncomfortable.2. The pads that go around your ears are overall quite comfortable, but they don't breathe particularly well so your ears tend to get a little hot and sweaty after several hours. I think this is just the nature of around-the-ear headphones, as my Bose set had this problem but not quite as bad.3. The buttons are tiny, with black shiny icons on a matte black button. When you're getting older, the inability to hear high tones comes with the need for reading glasses to read darn near anything, so those tiny icons can be difficult to see for me. Once you're used to where buttons are, it becomes less of an issue, but they are small and take some \"muscle memory\" when they are on your ears to remember where the power button is and where the volume up/down is.Overall, even with the minor quibbles, I am really happy with them. Sound-wise, they are comparable if not a little better than my old Bose set. Functionality-wise, they are way better, especially when combined with the app and the HearID function. I think Anker has done a great job with their Soundcore line, providing a quality product for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "HIGHLY...HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!I can't count the number of headphones I've had to return due to poor sound quality, ANC was a joke, the charging port fell inside, etc.. etc.. But the Q45s have brought a whole new, top notch, low cost headphone to the market, even crushing Anker's former models!PROS:- Price! I've purchased at least 10 different headphones in this price range, only to return them or have them break within a year- Sound! Excellent for the price range. Even phone calls are OK. There IS an EQ you can download for your phone which helps a lot!- 3 modes for background noise: (1) ANC - Active noise canceling, (2) Normal and (3) Transparency - so you can listen to your music while amplifying what is going on around you. Great for walking in traffic, public transport, watching TV and listening for your laundry or kids etc.- ANC: Amazing - it will blow your mind! My husband can be vacuuming, and I can easily hear what I'm watching!!- DUAL connections: I can have these connected to my phone as well as my TV/Computer. I can watch a movie, and answer my phone. The headsets will automatically turn off my TV and switch to my phone as soon as I accept a call. Love this feature!- AUTO turn off: I can listen to meditation streaming and fall asleep, knowing these will turn off automatically after not receiving an incoming signal after roughly 30 min - 1 hr. Great battery saver!- BATTERY LIFE is outstanding: I believe it's marketed as 45 hours? I would say that's roughly what I get. Although, I use the ANC all the time, so it may be a little lower. Good news is they charge super quickly with the 3.0 USB plug!- CONTROLS are very simple, easy to use, and can do almost anything. Minor issue: I have not figured out how to jump to the next song/video in my playlist. There may be a way, but I'm so happy with everything else, I don't even care!- COMFORT: I use mine mostly to watch TV/Movies streaming. I can easily spend a lazy Sunday with these on all day and NOT have any complaints about comfort. The padding in the ears is TOP NOTCH, the headpiece padding is good, and the adjustability of the height is wonderful. I find the tension which they squeeze on my ears to be good enough to feel snug, but not so strong that it will cause a headache or 'ear fatigue' after wearing for an entire day.- Did I mention PRICE?: You CANNOT do any better for the price - trust me, I've tried! Even purchased a couple of the name brands (Sony, Sennheiser, Cowin, etc) at the lower 'Refurbished' price making them the same price as the Anker Q45s, and none of them were as good as these! (I did keep my Cowins as back ups - but still not as good).- Compared to other ANKER products: I had the Q30s (they were OK) and the Q35s (a little better) and the new Q45s are such a huge improvement!- RANGE: I live in a 2 story townhome. I can go anywhere in my home, and even a few feet outside, and still have reception. I would say after about 50 feet, it becomes a little spotty.CONs: (I don't really have any, but maybe for some of you?):- Because the pads are made out of pleather, I wouldn't use these to work out with. They would be very hot, and the sweat would probably make them slippery.- If you're looking for a set of headphones to travel with a lot, these aren't bad. They do fold up, and swivel about 70 degrees on each headset. I know other brands may do a little better here. I use mine at home, so I don't have an issue with this.- I wish the EQ app was a little better, and I could load on my computer rather than just my phone. I probably can, I'm just too lazy to figure it out?",

                "reviewText": "The headphones are comfortable and look pretty good. They have a good weight and the sound and microphone work well. The app it pairs with gas a good selection of audio settings although the actual noise cancelling isn't as customizable as I hoped, but it's pretty good. It doesn't block out a barking Yorkie but I can talk on the phone while washing dishes and the person on the other line won't hear any of the water or clanging dishes. There is a lingering smell in the ear cups that it came with that I can't quite figure out. It gets stronger after I wear them for a while but I also have very sensitive smell so I'm not sure it's something everyone would be bothered by or even notice. It's a chemical-type smell like sharpie, acrylic, mildly like a stink bug? They do fold up a little awkwardly in their case which is a little frustrating, as you'd expect the case it comes with to fit perfectly. Overall good quality for $100-150 range.",

En este contexto, estos aud\u00edfonos son perfectos. Cancelan perfectamente el ruido ambiental propio de un hogar: pasos, pl\u00e1ticas, perros de los vecinos, aparatos como el refri, el ventilador, microondas, etc. Suenan bastante bien, tanto activos como apagados y con su cable. Ayudan mucho durante los efectos de bajas frecuencias de las pel\u00edculas y el nivel de grabes, medios y agudos en la m\u00fasica es bastante bueno para mi gusto (dejando de lado el perfeccionismo, que no aplica en aud\u00edfonos de gama media/baja o de este precio). Cada persona tiene una diferente sensibilidad a diferentes frecuencias en sus o\u00eddos (depende de la edad, su entorno de trabajo actual o pasado, enfermedades, qu\u00e9 tan alto y por cuanto tiempo escuchan la m\u00fasica a ese nivel, cuanto tiempo est\u00e1 expuesto al ruido del tr\u00e1fico pesado, o a eventos musicales masivos, etc). A trav\u00e9s de la app puedes hacer un test auditivo que eval\u00faa la sensibilidad de tus o\u00eddos a diferentes frecuencias, y en base a los resultados setea el ajuste de audio de los aud\u00edfonos para que se adapten a tu perfil auditivo. El nivel de volumen es muy bueno para mi gusto (ojo, hay que considerar, en base al comentario anterior, qu\u00e9 hay gente con da\u00f1o auditivo o que los usan en entornos m\u00e1s ruidosos y que pueden no compartir de mi opini\u00f3n). Mi Smart TV los detecta en cuanto los prendo, as\u00ed que ya solo tengo que darle OK al control remoto y se conectan. No tengo la intenci\u00f3n de usarlos en la calle, por lo que no puedo dejar opini\u00f3n sobre su desempe\u00f1o en ese entorno. Soy de cabeza grande y me quedan al centavo. Su estuche est\u00e1 genial para conservarlos en buen estado. Las almohadillas son muy c\u00f3modas, he pasado horas maratoneando series sin cansarme de ellos. Dicho esto, no olvides que, a fin de cuentas, los uso en un entorno de ruido ambiental \u201cdom\u00e9stico\u201d y que no dejan de ser aud\u00edfonos de gama media/baja de $150 usd y nunca se podr\u00edan compara con equipo de gama alta.",

                "reviewText": "I've thought about it at length and want to update my review from 3 stars to 5.I'm doing this as I was trying to compare the Q45s to XM3, XM5 etc. when to be fair, they're in a different price category. So, for price of the Q45s, they're excellent and represent great value.Original:I have 3 Soundcore earbud variants, 2 motion booms and my wife has q20s.I'm so happy with the booms for the price and what they do and my top of the line Liberty 3s sound fantastic.We've been amazed at how good Soundcore products sound and at great prices.I have a hard time getting headphones to fit as the clamping pressure gets to me after a short time. I have a set of Sony XM3s that I love but a 1/2 of wearing gets uncomfortable.I was impressed with the reviews on YT that the new Q45s were getting so I ordered them.Received them and yes, they don't fit into the carrying case quite as well as you'd like but the build quality is good, case is nice and they felt comfortable when I tried them on.They connected quickly and easily with the soundcore app like all my other SC products and I was able to get my favourite SC sound profile going right away.All good so far.Then I hit play and I was instantly hit with the realization that these were not going to replace the Sonys, sonically.If I hadn't had the XM3s in the first place, I may have liked the Q45s.The Sony's bass: more detail and punch. The top end, defined and detailed.Yes you EQ to your heart's content and I did but they just don't have the punch and musicality of XM3s no matter how much I adjusted.The Q45s are really good and I love my other soundcore products but I'm returning them and will put up with the discomfort until I find a comfortable and excellent sounding replacement. Probably the XM5s.",
