                "reviewText": "I have been using these as a secondary headset for my ipad/phone. The battery life lasts forever. I rarely need to charge it. Bluetooth easily connects to past devices and the sound is great for the price. Noise canceling is not really a thing, sounds are muffled but that is all. The headphones are super comfortable. I have earrings on the outer edges of my ears, and many headsets that sit on the ear, not over, hurt my ears. Some that sit over ear still do, but these are very soft and comfortable. The cushion on one ear does come squished a little since the headphones arrive folded up, but this goes away when the headset is left open for a few hours. It is not a very sturdy headset, but for the price the sound, ease of operation, and comfort make up for the lightweight feeling.",

                "reviewText": "These headphones are perfect for what I needed them for. I was looking for something that was comfortable to wear, and has a great sound. And these fit my needs exactly.They are labeled as soundproof, which I believe they are, but as someone who wears glasses, they are *mostly* soundproof, personally.I ordered these after I borrowed my brother's for work one day, and I loved them so much I had to get my own pair.They fold at two points and fit perfectly in any bag I have with me for the day. They also have an AMAZING battery life. I've had these for over a year and they've been perfect.The band that goes over your head does have a foam cushion and they are very comfortable. I personally can't wear them for very long (context - I wear adult sized glasses and they are too big, they pop out a lot), but they aren't uncomfortable at all.The charging port is just a regular c charger, so I frequently use my phone charger to charge them, but they do come with a charging cord and carry bag.I don't have anything to say about how long it usually takes to charge them, as I usually charge them overnight, but when the battery gets pretty low - around 10% - the light next to the charging port turns from its usual blue/white to red, and a low battery message plays when there's audio playing.Overall, amazing product. 100/10 would recommend for its sound quality, battery life, and affordable price. Perfect for gifts, or as a treat for yourself.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent low budget friendly Over-the-Ear headphones",
                "reviewText": "These headphones are decent. They have good sound quality but not great sound quality. The battery life on the 3 pairs I own are more then adequate to get through the entire work week on one charge and have had no issues pertaining to battery life. They are not good for people with big heads as they do not have enough extension in the ear pieces to fit comfortably, but over time they seem to slowly stretch out to \"fit better\".The build quality is where I feel needs some advancement and reinforcement. With the larger head shape you tend to see cracks in the plastic at the ear cup pieces and it does not last long after that before they are completely cracked through and falling apart. I think they need some additional engineering design where they look at ways to get better quality, high impact plastic that can withstand the everyday use.The padding around the earpiece is more then adequate for those that DO NOT like having the speaker sitting on the ear like I find with all my Sony headphones that tend to make ears sore.I live in my headphones both at work and at home, I charge them 2X a week because of that extended use. And I really do mean I live in them. They do breathe well, they have some minor flaws in sound cutting out for a blink but I blame a lot of that on the number of Bluetooth connections running throughout the room as this tends to happen more at home then in the office where most things are Bluetooth for the wife and kids with wireless speakers, headphones, computers and televisions.I listen to audiobooks 95% of the time and don't have any issues with sound quality, the music that I listen to tends to be rock and I enjoy the sound quality but it isn't Sony or Beats quality, it gets the job done. As for the noise cancelling, they aren't true noise cancelling but they do drown out the majority of the outside world. I work in an old industrial building that has nothing but huge open overhead space with 6 indoor a/c and heating units that run continuously and can be very annoying to listen to all day long and these drown out about 70% of that non stop loud humming noise, so I find these to be well worth it.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of these headphones is wild for the money. Clear sound with depth, they are comfortable (I have a relatively big head so comfort is important to me), and the battery life is insane. I got these headphones 21 days ago and I have been using them every day for at least an hour a day, but I'm probably averaging somewhere closer to three hours a day. The battery is still on its first charge at 60 percent. This is by far the longest lasting battery I have experienced with any tech device lol. I feel these headphones are super underpriced. Would 100 percent buy again.For what it's worth, I am an audio mixer for a film production company so I have a decent standard for audio. I probably wouldn't use these to mix audio (they won't give you a totally flat response), but that's okay! That's not what they are made for. As a consumer headset, this is a great deal and a quality pair of headphones.My only caveat: I have had these for three weeks so I can't speak for longevity, but so far so good!",

                "reviewText": "There are so many reasons why headphones such as these are superior to ear buds. Here are a few more. The left/right separation is more precise and distinguishable. Headphones are more comfortable and stable especially when cushioned, and with the included Bluetooth, which is easy to pair. The treble to bass response is excellent considering the low cost. It can even be set to a higher level of really throbbing bass, an extra appeal to those who treasure symphonic music such as by Mahler and Bruckner. The only negative is the extremely tiny controls which can only be set with the phones off the head. Well worth the modest price.",
