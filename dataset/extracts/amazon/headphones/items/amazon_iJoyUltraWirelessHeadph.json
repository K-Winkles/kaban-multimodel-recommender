I made the decision to get these. These are very cute and ycomfortable. I have really enjoyed them. If wearing around your neck they tend to get a little heavy so be aware of this. The sound is good and calls are clear. Great for the price. I haven\u2019t been disappointed. So if you\u2019re in a bind in need headphones you will definitely love these. They are not 100% sound proof but they do have some noise reduction and your caller can still hear you clearly outside. I hope this helps anyone who is struggling financially and need a super great pair of hands try these you will not regret it",

                "reviewText": "I was excited when I first got them because they cancel out noise really well, but I keep running into issues. The audio is a tad crackly and fuzzy for one, also they keep disconnecting when I'm using them causing my music to play on blast for everyone to hear out of nowhere even though it has a full battery (not ideal when you're in a library), they also hurt your ears really bad after about 15-20 minutes of use because they are so tight, another thing would be that the plastic feels really cheap and could easily break, and everyone can hear what you're listening to with the headphones on. For these reasons, I wouldn't buy them again. I'd just go for the more expensive over-the-ear headphones. Not worth it at all.",

The fit is comfy, the design is great, the sound quality he says is nice, battery life is good too\u2026so far nothing negative about it. I feel more than comfortable recommending this product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. They are so cute. For the price they are I would 100% recommend them. They're a little tight on the ears but that helps them to stay in place so I believe that's good. The pink is a really soft and metalic pink so they're really subtle and cute. They're really confortable. The sound is like a 8/10 just because it is too loud, I have to put it in the lowest on my phone and it still feels like it's on medium, that's the only reason I won't pur 5 stars - but the quality is REALLY good. The battery life is good too. They came fullt charged and I haven't charged them in 2 days. I used them a lot too.Plus: they look really pretty on. I would love to get the apple ones but for a dupe or similar style these are amazing and affordable.",
