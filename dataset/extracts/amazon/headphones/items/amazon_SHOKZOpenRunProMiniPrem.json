                "reviewText": "These headphones are a game changer. The sound quality isn't great for music - it's sending your sound through bone, after all, but they're absolutely perfect for watching movies, videos and phone conversations. The sound is clear and true enough for these purposes. If I want to immerse myself in music, I'll use my Bose.The battery life is great for the small size. I've worn them all day and I've not had the battery go dead yet. They charge very quickly, too. I'm not overly crazy about the proprietary charging cable, but for a few dollars, you can get an adaptor to be able to use USB-C cables. Replacement Shokz cables are available, too.The main feature of these headphones is the ability to hear your surroundings or have a conversation while listening to music or videos. They're perfect for walking, jogging, bicycling or just staying aware. Amazon's review page asks about boise cancellation, which is like them asking how well the headphones wash dishes. These are not MEANT to cancel noise, but just the opposite, and they do their job well.One of the most important features is the comfort. This is huge on my list because I have small ear canals, and I've found only a couple ear phones prior that would not only stay in my ears, but do it fairly comfortably. Those were both made by Bose, and one is discontinued. Even those would hurt my ears after a couple hours. The Shokz Open Run Pro headphones are the most comfortable I've EVER had. I literally forget I have them on. I've worn them for ten hours and suffered zero discomfort. That alone outweighs any forfeiture of sound quality.In short, these headphones do what they're meant to do and they do it brilliantly.",

                "reviewText": "i bought and owned a pair of SHOKZ OpenComm they were amazingly comfortable and awsome with great noise canceling mic i couldnt have been more happy with them till i wasn't the mic quite! They were still under warranty, company notified me 3 times that i would receive a replacement but 6months to a year and i still did not get a replacement!! Picked up a cheap used bone induction for a while then needed another pair still no replacement from shokz! I was hesitant to order any thing from shokz again. Did research and chose another brand. Mojowa, great qulity, amazing bluetooth range, decent sound, ok mic but terible fit for me they hurt! no mater what i did i could not get them comfrtable, regretted ordering them!kept thinking of the comfort of my old shokz what else did they offer? Still decided to stay away from the open com but relented and order these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! Amost didnt!! but glad i did!! i can wear them all l day i even forget i have them on!!!! full disclosure; i use my shokz most for cell phone use driving and construction work, music listening is secondary, for you earbud sound critics they probably will not match sony or bose but the sound is vastly improved from my first open com and the best in all the bone inductions i have had!(FYI little note/trick with bone induction, if they are not loud eough for you, if you are in a loud enviroment use earplugs or sound proof ear muffs and they will be loud!! Sounds i know, crazy but true!I do not like earbud or things in my ears i also like being aware of my surroundings so bone induction is the only way to go for me! With a great battery life and fast chargeing, unrivaled all day comfort, sound greatly improve and a good mic thease SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! for me, are by far the best overall most comfortable bone induction headset available! i want to stay a shokz user forever i hope the quality of these excedes my last pair of shokz or at least the costomer service is more reliable!! because for now, these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro are great! Stay tuned!!",

                "reviewText": "These do exactly what I needed -- let me listen to music and other things while still hearing what's going on around me. That does not mean, however, that the sound quality is at all comparable to traditional headphones. In fact the sound quality is quite different -- it has a tactile quality (I guess because it's vibrating the bones of your face) that is at first surprising but which I find myself quite enjoying. It has some of the punch of extreme volume (like at a concert) but paradoxically at very low volumes.The battery life is quite short (presumably because the whole mechanism is so tiny), but they charge in no time (from low to full in about 30 minutes), so this is not a problem if you remember to charge them frequently.YMMV, but I love these. They are perfect for my needs and extremely comfortable, and they do not slip off when I get sweaty.",

                "reviewText": "Shokz OpenRun Pro offers a safe way to listen to music while running or cycling.My Holy Grail of running headphones would allow me to listen to music while being able to monitor my environment for potential dangers. I've tried several solutions: Bose sunglasses, Bose Sportsfree, Apple AirPods Pro, and Sony LinkBuds Open Ring. (I've reviewed most of these here on Amazon.) All worked well, but each of these units is very susceptible to wind noise, and here on PEI, it is always windy. So, I tended not to hear what I was listening to, and the wind noise drowned out my environment.The Shokz OpenRun Pro Bone Conduction Headphones are not as affected by wind as the other open headphones, making them much more useable for me. And because the Shokz OpenRun Pro doesn't sit in your ear canal, you don't get that nasty sweat build-up in your ear canals.From what I had read on bone conduction headphones, I was expecting little acoustically, but the sound was enjoyable. This is not high-fidelity, but I never understood why anyone would want hi-fi sound while pounding the pavement and dodging cars. By their nature, bone-conduction phones do not transmit much bass, but you can hear Bass notes.These phones do not cut out any outside noise. It is uncanny. You can converse, hear everything around you, and hear the music. It is like the sound is directly piped into your brain, or you grew a second set of ears.I have a pumpkin head. I wear a size eight hat (when I can find one), and I was concerned that the Shokz OpenRun Pro would not fit my head. They fit and are so comfortable you forget you have them on, with one exception. I wear a tight windproof hat all winter, and the cable interfered with the hat's fit and pressed the speakers into my head. My wife, who has a typical head size, did not have this issue. They do not interfere with a ball or bucket cap. The Open Runs come in two sizes, so if you have a smaller head, the Min version might work better for you.The Shokz OpenRun Pro linked to my Mighty player and iPhone seamlessly. They are IP55 waterproof rated (I didn't test that- there's a limit to what I'll do for the team!) Battery life is ranked at eight hours, with fast charge capabilities. I've worn them for a four-hour run with no battery issues.Some races that ban headphones will allow bone-conduction headphones. But don't be a silly-billy, and wear headphones at a race. Enjoy the crowd vibe that you are probably paying dearly for.My only quibble is the charging cord is the proprietary cable standard to all Shokz. It's a USB A-based cable. I prefer a USB C to C cable, which means one more cable to lug around and look after. Replacement chargers are available on Amazon.The Shokz OpenRun Pro allows runners and cyclists to listen to music while enjoying their sports safely. I will never use in-ear phones while exercising again.",
