I want something that will help keep my ears a bit warm during the winter months. Excellent sound and comfort. The price is so low, I'll probably buy more. If they break during rough use in the city, I'll get more. Highly recommended.

It's better than \"on the ear\"types in terms of comfort, but they count over the ear as noise canceling which is a deceptive abuse of that term in my opinion. One more thing, and lots of people are saying this too, the volume adjustment has issues. It seems to work okay when the headphones are plugged directly into my computer, but when plugged into my monitor's sound bar they become useless. The sound is okay for the price, so if you can live with the downsides go for it. It's cheap and it works. Is the best? Oh, that's a stupid question.",

                "reviewText": "These are excellent! The quality is better than I expected for this price point. The bass is very good and the overall fidelity is definitely good enough for casual music listening or calls. As a man with average ears they fit over my ears but not by a huge margin so if your ears are large it might be a little too small. They are a bit shallow where they cup your ears too so it can become uncomfortable if you use them for long periods of time, but it's not bad. The volume and pause buttons work, and the microphone is muffled but still fully intelligible. Overall worth it.",

If this is a make or break for you, then pass these headphones over. However, if you're looking for high quality audio at a low price, then these are definitely for you.",

                "reviewText": "I use these headphones while I'm sewing and crafting, mainly sitting in a wheeled office chair. I use an extension cord for them so I have a little more room to move around and at times the headphone cord gets caught under the wheels of my chair. The cord covering is a sturdy fiber that doesn't get crushed by the wheels. My previous headphones were just rubber coated so not nearly as resistant to damage from a wheel.",
