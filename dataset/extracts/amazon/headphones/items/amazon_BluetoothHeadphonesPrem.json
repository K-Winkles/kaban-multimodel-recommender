I use them for online meetings and teaching so I needed clear sound and a decent microphone. Wow, more than exceeded my expectations: They come well packaged with charging and audio cable as well as clearly written instructions. The cloth storage bag is a nice addition. They are easy to charge and last for over 24 hours, There is a pleasant British female voice telling you they are on or off and connected. The power and volume switches are easy to adjust when you are wearing them. The L and R markings really help a 70 year old like me!They easily adjust to my head and the cushions help isolate the sound, yet they are comfortable. Some classes I teach are over 4 hours long, yet they don't weigh much so it's a real pleasure to use. I was skeptical about the mike, yet still find myself amazed at how well it works, absolutely no complaints from others. Bluetooth works almost seamlessly and they really do have a 30+ foot range! I say almost because over several different platforms I had to select the audio source and once selected it worked every time afterwards. All in all, an excellent product well worth the price. They are on SALE for Black Friday as well!!",

                "reviewText": "I have some great name-brand BT pod headphones but wanted a pair of Bluetooth headphones that didn't hurt my inner ear after wearing a while and were more obvious, so people at work could see that I was listening to music or in a meeting. These were the right call \u2014 the instructions were well-written (which is honestly rare for a brand you find on Amazon), so pairing with Bluetooth was easy. While the noise-canceling didn't quite drown out the louder sounds as well as the pods, these are half the price, and the noise-canceling still works for most sounds \u2014 just not barking dogs. The sound quality, however, was comparable with the Apple product and better than the other name-brand over-ear competitors I've tried. (Again, this site's not a fan of when you name competitors in reviews, so trying to circumnavigate a bit, but of the two brands I mentioned, one is a fruit and the other is something you do to a drum. ;) )You also get an audio jack and aux cable if you *do* want to go the wired route. Comes with a soft li'l sack to carry them, and a charging cable that's not obnoxiously short like some other devices I won't name and shame here. Also works for phone calls and Siri, volume is easy to navigate and you use the same buttons to skip tracks or go back. Can connect to multiple devices. Comfortable fit on the ears. It's a purchase I'm proud to share with others.",

Very comfortable and amazing sound quality, comparable to other top name brand headphones but at an affordable price. The set up was quick and they are easy to use once you get the hang of where the buttons are. They last a long time too without needing to be charged.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these Bluetooth headphones and have been extremely pleased with my purchase. They arrived quickly and in good shape. I started using them with no problems, and am pleased with the crisp, clear sound which has just the right amount of base. They are very comfortable.....lightweight and soft ear cups....and can be worn for extended periods of time with comfort. They can be adjusted easily to fit perfectly. The switches for noise cancelling and volume control are easy to use while they are on my head, so I do not have to remove the headphones to make an adjustment. I have never had a noise cancelling device before and am totally hooked. I am not a person who can just tune out noise, and I find it hard to concentrate or enjoy music when there is a lot of external noise. This noise cancelling feature is a perfect solution. These headphones come with a very soft cloth bag. They arrive packaged in a sturdy hard plastic shell that I plan to save for protecting them when I travel. They come with a USB charging cable and a 3.5 mm audio cable. There are instructions for pairing these headphones with a cellphone, if desired. They can be paired with 2 devices at the same time so the headphones can easily be switched between these devices. They don't need to be charged often, but they charge fairly quickly. For the price and the quality, these headphones are an excellent purchase. While setting up my warranty online they require the warranty code which can be found on a tiny label attached to the storage bag.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product over 2 weeks ago and since then have been using it on daily basis. I really love the product and I have to say it is the best bluetooth headset that I have ever purchased at this price range. The product is very easy to use. The control buttons are very intuitive and I started using it easily for device paring and music playback without reading the user manual except later quickly glancing through a few control button usages. I can use it comfortably several hours day with its light weight, soft ear cups and great audio quality. During the 2 weeks,I haven't met any connection problem or audio interruption. Also it has great battery life, besides charging it for about half an hour upon arrival, I have use it for 2 weeks with average 3 hours a day and the battery still have 20% left (I don't use ANC often). In conclusion, it is a very good purchase for me.",
