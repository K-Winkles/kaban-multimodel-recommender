                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Still great headphones!",
                "reviewText": "I bought my first pair ~1971, when I had just an AR Amplifier and AR Turntable. I had to make an external switch and headphone adapter for the old amp. Somewhere along the road I was introduced to Sony MDR V6's (~'89) - and one of our cat's chewed the plug off the old Koss set - and the plug off my Stax electrostatic headphones, too. The Sony's were available - the 4AA's weren't. The 4AAA and 4AAT were tried - but returned. My 4AA's and Stax phones found the bottom of a junk box - a spare set of Sony MDR V6's were bought - followed by all too frequent new pads. Over four years ago, I checked Koss' site - they were back making the 4AA's! I found them on Amazon - and ordered a set (6/11). The box they are in looked like the original - flimsy! I didn't care before - or then - the phones looked identical to the old ones - and they are still made in the USA! The fluid filled ear pads were soft and pliable. They fit as I remembered - properly on my big (7 7/8 hat size - with short hair.). Great room isolation. Excellent midrange and highs combined with un real, but properly slightly subdued deep bass extension. The Sony's have a subdued midrange, bright highs, and boomy mid-bass, in comparison. It could be my 67 year old ears - they do have a 3 - 5 kHz dip in response. I like the flat response and distinct/controlled bass of the Pro-4AA's. I like jazz and 'classic' rock & roll, and older r & B, too.One use the Pro-4AA's excelled at - and still do - is listening to short wave broadcasts, as well as DXing, the process of listening to distant and weak stations. They were great - and the new ones are as well. These days I find myself listening to strong old standby stations, like Radio Australia, in the early AM hours and the Pro-4AA's keep me from bothering my wife - or the cats! I moved nearly two years ago - and, recently found a box of goodies I hadn't gone through yet. At the bottom were my original Pro-4AA's! I may contact Koss and see what they would do to refurbish them - they have nostalgic value as well as use value - they are that good. Of course, meter my words by my likes and age... I like a flat response and prefer deeper, but not boomy, bass... and I am 'older', or so I am told! Oh, and my big head doesn't mind the 'phones weight or pressure. And... some folks don't like what I do... imagine that!Edited 10/6/15: After posting my review, I searched for and found my original Pro-4AA's remains, still less the plug but now with a deteriorated strain relief on the coiled cord's headphone end. Comparing them to the newer units resulted in the only visible difference being the relative height of the protrusions, which were surrounded by 'Left' and 'Right' being shorter. The headband, ear cushions, cable, etc, looked identical, except for the wear. I contacted Koss - and their return shipping charge had increased from $5 to $9 in over two decades. I put the remnants in a box with a letter describing their history and shipped them via Priority Mail. They didn't patch them - they sent me a brand new pair! They arrived in new shape - perfect, although initially quite tight. That was remedied by leaving them open over night on my Tivoli Audio Model One AM/FM table radio (My wife had suggested a watermelon...). Now they are indistinguishable from my Amazon ordered 'phones. American made - and a real lifetime warranty!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Yes, these ARE \"giant killers\"!",
                "reviewText": "These sound ridiculously good right out of the box. I cannot even image how these will shine once they've burned in! Sure, they might look \"ugly\" to some and they're not really designed or intended for portable use; they need adequate power to drive and they are a bit bulky and likely too heavy for listening \"on the move\".For points of reference, I also have the Beyer Dynamic DT 770 PROs (dynamic drivers) as well as the Monoprice M1060C (planar magnetic). The Beyers are by far the most comfortable and lean towards a warm register. The Monoprice sound \"lush\" with great depth, but they lack the \"slam\" I sometimes crave. And that's where these Koss come in! These are just so engaging - drums sound like drums, thumping with authority. A true, extended frequency range that allows you to hear everything with clarity, from individual bass notes to treble \"sparkle\" without being harsh. As another point of comparison I had tried the Sennheiser HD 280 PRO and thought they sounded terrible, with the treble being obviously boosted. The Senn 280s are nowhere near as \"balanced\" as they are purported to beSo what you might sacrifice in aesthetics or comfort you will gain in a truly audiophile quality pair of headphones. Though, if you are powering with a cell phone or PC, move on as these WILL disappoint most. For those with a dedicated amp these are magic. In my opinion, these are \"giant killers\" and at only $75! This proves what I've suspected all along: so much of the \"high-end\" boutique headphone market is just out-and-out snake oil. It blows my mind that these $75 headphones (and that includes a lifetime warranty!) sound better than cans I've heard in the $500 - 750 range. I'm serious.",

                "reviewText": "Se volete acquistare queste cuffie per utilizzarle in mobilit\u00e0 con uno smartphone, oppure a casa collegate al pc allora guardate altrove; sarebbe uno spreco di denaro. Queste cuffie sono perfette se collegate ad un buon amplificatore hi-fi da casa. Danno il loro meglio utilizzandole magari stando seduti in poltrona ed ascoltando un buon vinile su on buon impianto. Io personalmente le ho collegate al mio ampli e ho usato un giradischi Thorens TD125 Mk II e devo dire che la qualit\u00e0 c'\u00e8 tutta e si sente! Isolano perfettamente dall'esterno per garantire una esperienza di ascolto ottimale ed una perfetta resa sonora. Non hanno bassi pompati, anzi il suono \u00e8 leggermente flat, ed \u00e8 qui che si rende necessario un buon amplificatore. Per questo collegarle ad uno smartphone sarebbe inutile. Suonerebbero come delle cuffiette cinesi da due soldi.Il primo ascolto l'ho fatto con un remaster 96KHz/24bit di Electric Ladyland di Jimi Hendrix e con una copia Original Masters di The Dark Side Of The Moon dei Pink Floyd e devo dire che l'immersione nel suono \u00e8 totale. bisogna forse rodarle ancora un p\u00f2, ma sono certo che dopo alcune ore di ascolto regaleranno molte soddisfazioni!L'unico difetto, come molti hanno detto, \u00e8 il loro peso che alla lunga pu\u00f2 dare fastidio, ma dopo un p\u00f2, magari standosene seduti comodamente in poltrona, ci si abitua anche a quello.Qualit\u00e0 costruttiva pari ad un carro armato, sono durevoli ed indistruttibili, come un vecchio cellulare Nokia!!!Ve le consiglio se cercate un buon compromesso qualit\u00e0/prezzo per un ascolto in alta fedelt\u00e0, senza doversi svenare per acquistare marchi pi\u00f9 costosi.",
