                "reviewText": "I own several pairs of high end headphones - Sennheiser, Entymotic research, Bose, Grado, etc. These were the first hedphones I bought specifically for their Lync integration - which works great. The audio quality is as good as my ears can hear and favorably compares to the other brands I mentioned. The noise cancellation is fantastic - in an office environment, these outperform my Bose noise cancelling headphones. It's not unusual for me to not notice someone trying to get my attention verbally - if you have low volume music playing, you won' hear much of what goes on in the open office. They are also very versitile - phone calls, music, gaming, etc.In my opinion, Jabra hit it out of the park with these.Compared to the Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for Apple Devices, Black , these are more comfortable (but bigger) and don't make you fuss with replacing AAA batteries (and because they charge plugged into your PC, probably won't ever be dead - but if you plan on using them on airplanes and such, the AAA battery may be more attractive). The Bose headphones has the microphone in the cord, which is bad for audio quality. The noise cancellation on the Jabra seems to work better in office environments. The one thing I like better about the Bose headphones is the detachable cord - I've yanked on that cord way too many times, but it just pops right back into the headphones.Overall Likes:- Noise Reduction is fantastic- Comfortable - I can easily wear these all day in the office- Lync integration - the red LED rings on the headphones to tell people I'm in a meeting is a good touch for a work-oriented set of headphones- Microphone works great, no negative complaints of audio and I'm not worried about using them on customer calls- Charges when plugged into computer- Signalling Lync to transfer the call when unplugging from base is neat- Will work fine with a mobile phone (just won't charge when plugged in)- You can hear yourself when on calls - useful because hearing your key clicks will remind you that everyone else can hear them too.- Work great for gaming too- Mute button on right ear cup is good when someone is trying to talk to you - it disables all audio and turns the NR off temporarilyDislikes:- They are fairly big (as are all active noise cancelling headphones)- For this price, the cord should be replacable- I can't really see myself walking around using these with my cell phone- Would like mute button to pause iTunes",

                "reviewText": "Product was great, good quality sound and microphone. The wired connection and USB connector are both useful for computer and phone / plane use.After 4 months right earpiece stopped working suddenly, no sound, no noise cancellation. I tried a few different devices and it's dead. Since the ANC isn't working either it must be a dead speaker or broken internal wire. For an expensive product I expect much greater reliability. It was especially frustrating because it stopped working in the first 10 minutes of a long international trip.I'm going to try the warranty repair process, but it looks painful and they say I'll have to pay for some of the shipping. I may just request a full refund and dump them in the trash instead.Update: 8 days later and there is no response to my warranty request. Jabra Support is \"assisting other customers\" so calling them appears to be useless. Really disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my workplace, since they only hand out Jabra Evolve 40s. The 40s are pretty lackluster, it is difficult to hear the call sometimes, and noise bleeds in since there is very little sound isolation.These Jabra Evolve 80s are a godsend for my farm of agents on the phone or just chatting noisily. They don't look super stylish, and it'll need some adjusting so the headset sits proper on your head without having the mic half an inch from your mouth, but their performance cannot be understated. I can hear 95% of all my calls with the Automatic Noise Cancellation off, and whenever the calls feels too quiet, or if I need extra concentration, I can swith the ANC on, and almost instantly the sound quality and volume gets boosted, and the noise of my co-workers goes neat silent.With ANC on, you do somewhat hear yourself talking. It's a bit hard to explain, but the closest explanation is that you're hearing what the mic is picking up being passed through a filter. So some background noise, like a very loud talker, will break through the noise isolation and be a bit distracting, but the volume/audio quality boost is invaluable.These headphones also sound amazing for music. Just the passive noise isolation is superb. Then I can flip the switch for ANC, and bam, more fidelity.The ANC is battery powered, and the headphones charge through the aux cord when plugged into the little USB hub! Pretty amazing.Overall, these are worth buying used. Mine were like new, and were a steal at $100. Full price, you'll feel a bit irked by plain silicone sheathing for the wire, and how the earpads rub against each other when taken off (at least at the tallest setting, I have a big head). They're not amazingly comfortable, and I always take them off after a call because you'll miss interactions from your supervisor or coworker (they show you're deep into your work) and ear sweat/grime is a potential hygiene issue (like with all over the ear headphones).Will very much boost your effectiveness if you're upgrading from the Jabra Evolve 40, people won't bother you with them on, and music sounds twice better. Very solid choice for a noisy workplace.",
