                "reviewText": "I ordered these headphone for my 1st grader. They were a great price and came in her favorite color purple which was a bonus. She uses these at school (they don\u2019t come home) and she says that they are working good. Her previous pair of headphone that we had gotten at target for more money had broken/weren\u2019t working right st school. I was happy with the way these looked. They have nice plush cushions over the ear and seem pretty durable so we shall see, but so far no complaints here.",

These are sized perfectly but can also be adjusted bigger. They are decent quality for the price, but I won\u2019t be out a lot of money if they do break. These headphones don\u2019t have any volume control on them and are corded only, but that\u2019s what I wanted. My daughter is happy to have her own headphones now.",
