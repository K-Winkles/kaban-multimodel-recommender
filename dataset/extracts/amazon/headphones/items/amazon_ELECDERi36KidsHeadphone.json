We purchased these at the beginning of the school year (Aug 2022) and already two of the three that we bought are no longer working (the five-year-old has only used them twice, so definitely not enough times for them to have run their course). They are the right size for my kids so, it\u2019s worth the cost to find some thing that fits well for our kiddos. Very cute colors and they do the trick for little ears but buyer beware if you\u2019re looking for something to keep for years and years this isn\u2019t the one.",
