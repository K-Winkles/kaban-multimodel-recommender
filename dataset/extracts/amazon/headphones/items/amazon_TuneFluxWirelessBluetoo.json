Not only that but if I have the volume up others around me don't hear my music unless I take the headphones completely off my head...",

I have also found them very useful for phone calls as well. Highly recommend.",

The on and off voice is a bit iffy but the quality of music, clarity, bass etc far surpasses what I paid.The headphones fold down to quite a compact size. Would be great if they came with a hard case or some sort of storage to minimise damage.Headphones also do not let you skip tracks on the headphones themselves, you have to change it on the device.All in all minor complaints. Really happy with purchase",

The thing that surprised me the most however, was the sound. Clear and accentuated trebles, mids maybe a little flat but still natural, and bass - rich, deep and controlled. I put some of my reference rock songs through them and Tuneflux came out with no shame at all. They sound very comparable to Anker Soundcore Life Q20 ( twice the price), better than 1More Sonoflow ( more than twice the price ).",
