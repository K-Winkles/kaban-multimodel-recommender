                "reviewText": "I purchased these headphones for my daughter in June 2023. Recently, both sides stopped working (I didn't know, but a few weeks ago, one side had stopped working). It's been months, but I figured I'd try emailing their customer support. I got an immediate response asking for my order number. They said that they didn't have the same color anymore, but if I could pick another color, they'd ship a new one out to me. I've had bad experiences where I never received the item after these assurances, but sure enough, a couple days later, a new pair of headphones arrived. They worked perfectly and my daughter is very happy.On top of their great customer support, these are just a nice pair of headphones that fold up neatly for travel and look good. My daughter has a few other pairs of headphones collected over the years but these remain her go-to. She says that they're \"comfortable and pretty\".",

                "reviewText": "Bought these to replace the headset I currently have, and still use. Too busy to return so mostly use them when watching shows on my tablet. They started very tight around my head, and crushed my ears, I had to really adjust them to get them to fit right.The sound is alright, and there's no noise cancelling, I can hear everything around me, and the volume on these isn't the greatest. The folding hinges were so tight that even with the height adjustment; they wanted to stay folded. I ended up sticking them around a pillow for a couple of weeks, forgot about them, and then found them to be pretty reasonable to wear now.Definitely thinking of using them with my VR headset later as the other headphones I have don't fit around it. Will update if it goes as planned, or if they just become a conveniently matching pair to use with my tablet.",
