They arrived nicely packaged and in great condition. The sound quality is excellent, considering the price. I\u2019m actually happily surprised how good it is. The volume goes pretty loud, actually louder than I need. Each set of headphones has a button on the side and a built in microphone. They seem sturdy and able to withstand being used by children. I like the different colors on each headphone so each can be told apart from the others. The ear cushions are very comfortable too. I also like that they fold up for easy storage and travel. They connect via a 3.5 mm jack to most laptops or computers. Overall I\u2019m happy with this purchase!",

They seem very rugged and fold up nicely to store them in the children's activity area. The cord is perfect length and durable and nylon tangle free. Also, the adjust for most size heads nicely. The sound quality is better than Bluetooth as these are wired and don't lose any fidelity. They also don't suffer from wireless latency. Super good deal for a six pack!! Highly recommend for learning, teaching, etc.",

I could see them being a bit uncomfortable by the end of the day.Ease of use:Very easy to use, simple plug into a jack. Bluetooth would likely be more expensive but more helpful, especially with latest phone designs breeding out the headphone jack.Sound Quality: Decent for what you're paying for. The left side tends to be louder and less balanced, leaving your left side a bit blasted.Overall:These headphones will get the job done and are a good price for a six pack. I do plan on using them through my household. I paid about $45 for the six pack, so I would say that $7.50/pair is a fair price for what you get.",

They fold together nicely, so they are easy to transport.Headsets have been designed with kids and young adults in mind - they are easy to use all around. At the same time they are made of sturdy materials and should last a good amount of time. Each headset has a different color on the outside of the ear piece, so they are easy to assign to people. The wire is sturdy and the connections are all re-enforced (see pictures).The headset is comfortable to wear, also for a long period of time. Microphone works great and picks up voice clearly. I tested this on various computers and handheld devices.Overall this set is a great value considering the quality of workmanship and price.",
