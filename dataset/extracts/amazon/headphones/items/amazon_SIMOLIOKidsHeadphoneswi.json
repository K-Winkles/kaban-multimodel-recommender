They have great sound and volume control. I like the nylon cord as well. I do hope that these ones last us much longer than the other pair. I\u2019m glad that customer service was so responsive. I\u2019d buy from them again. I only gave 4 stars because of the other pair of headphones dying so quickly.I thought I was getting better quality headphones for the kids. They are flexible, have mic, and great volume control. My kids said they\u2019re very comfortable too. My child used them twice before they stopped working. Like any typical cheaply made headphone. Will be returning. Disappointed",

I love how it bends and doesn't break, very necessary for a child her age. Volume and sound are great and regulated, so she doesn't hurt her eardrums. Also, great that a other person can connect to listen on at same time. The ear pads are perfect fitting her small ears.",

Made possible because the headphones all connected into each other and then into the tablet.GENIUS.So I asked where they got them and was directed to these on Amazon. I got 3 pairs in preparation for a long flight for my kids. This made it possible for multiple kids to watch a movie on the same tablet. Fewer fights/complaints. My kids loved them!",
