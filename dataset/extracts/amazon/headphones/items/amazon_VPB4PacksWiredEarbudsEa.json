                "reviewText": "I love these little headphones. I wasn't looking to spend a lot on wireless so I went with these wired sets. I was worried when I purchased them that they would be cheaply made as you get 4 sets for the price of one, but they are great. I seem to lose and break a lot of things so I didn't want to spend much on these. The line is long enough to put my phone in my pocket with the microphone still picking up my voice when I am talking. The sound quality is really good and the ear tips are soft. I wasn't looking for anything that cancels out sound as I use them to walk and need to be able to hear the cars. I will definitely purchase them again in the future.",

I gave out most of mine that I got back in 2017 I kept the green and black one. I lost the black one so I only had the green one and it recently gave out after 6 years. I bought these again in August of last year I'm down to my last pair because it's always one earpiece that doesn't seem to want to work and for some reason the last one doesn't seem to fit my ear right even if I switch the got me earpiece from the one that recently gave out. Yeah I'm not buying these again",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought these pack of headphones all the way back in 2019. How it goes is that I stuffed the pairs away in my electronics storage bin for later use and just forgot about it. Bought another different brand of headphones because I forgot I had these lol.While rummaging in my messy storage bin for something else, I came across these headphones. I was really surprised how well they held up. I went through the a few of pairs in the span of maybe two years or so 2021-2023. The last pair I had of these, the black ones left side went out and so now in 2023 I've bought a new pair. They each lasted me maybe 6-8 months roughly.I like how they fit in my ear, it's a comfortable fit. For the cord, it's not flimsy and when placed in the headphone jack it's not loose.I'm sure these headphones would last a lot longer if I didn't use them while in bed, fall asleep and roll around on them lol. So if you take good care of them they'll last as long as they're not a defective pair. I'm quite rough with my headphones too, I don't put them in a carrying case, just stuff them in my purse in a somewhat neat wrapped circle or not at all.Happy with my purchase, I hope these new pairs will last me!",
