They charge like nobody's business. Except mine. It's my business to charge them but it's so fast. Like Flash... only maybe one less motion than Flash. Not like Green Lantern at all... because let's be honest, nobody liked the Green Lantern movie. Even when we all love Ryan Reynolds, we all agree ... he should have left this one out.Back to the headphones, did I mention the soft feel of them? Better than a new baby's bottom... and no dirty diapers to change either. The silicone feel outside makes them easy to slip in my delightful ears and get ready to rock. Or roll. I like to be all inclusive.Sounds are amazing! I'd say Madison Square Garden only in your livingroom, while you enjoy it from the peace of your own quarantined home until we all can go back to normal. These are the next beat thing.Now, go get you some. Buy 2 they're small. And let's be honest, someone you know is going to say \"OMG! Can I borrow those?\" And you know it's like when you used to loan your DVDS or your best sweatshirt... ya not gettin' back.",

                "reviewText": "I have had these for almost a year now and they've worked great the whole time. I bought them for running so I've sweat all over them repeatedly and haven't had an issue. I'm not super picky about sound quality but I have no issues with the sound quality and the volume is good too. And they actually fit & stay in my ears. A lot of others don't; I have small ears & tragus piercings so it can be difficult to find ear buds that fit. They last a long time and charge quickly and the little charging case is very handy.My only complaint is that I'd like some warning as to when they need to be charged, and maybe there is something, but I can't figure it out. I find the charging system a little confusing. They've died on me in the middle of a run before which was unfortunate. But still, I'm very happy with these - and their longevity - so far!",

                "reviewText": "Quality is ok, I used Planet Fitness basic wired earbuds prior to this & I'd say quality is a little better than those. They don't have a very bassy or high treble sound, but still pretty good. I tried a sound equalizer app which made a slight difference but not enough to keep on my phone. Spotify has it's own equalizer in settings so I played with that & it helped enough to satisfy me as far as sound is concerned.What also helps, is putting on the (don't know what else to call them but) ear snugger rubber bands that go around the outside of the fat mid-inner ear plastic part. This also creates an extra comfortable sound barrier & helps to keep them snugly in place during activities.I love that they have the ear hook on them, that's the biggest reason besides price that I bought these.The big downside, which may cause me to return these, is that although I'd love to wear the rubber ear snug bands each time I use these because it makes them more comfy, helps with sound quality & noise cancelling, you have to take the bands on and off before each time you charge or store the ear buds.They won't plop into the charger with the bands on. You can't even squeeze them in. It's such a silly thing, I wish they'd made the charging ports just 1 millimeter bigger for that purpose. So you have to take off the bands each time you charge or put them in their box for any reason, which eventually will destroy the bands, all that stretching etc. Plus the inconvenience.I have pics to show what I mean. The first pic shows the buds in the charger without the bands on them. I'm holding up the band I'm talking about. Second pic shows them with the bands on. You can't even push them in there.I love the color, so that's another plus. Battery life seems great.However the microphone hasn't worked for me yet during phone calls, so that's another bummer. My friends can't hear me on the other end, they say it just sounds like static. So we will see.",

                "reviewText": "Sound quality is amazing. Literally sounds like they are in the room with me right off the bat. Doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cbroken in\u201d to sound good.***COMFORT WISE THOUGH these are the BEST headphones I have worn out of the many cheap-side Amazon headphones I have bought through the years. My dog has an unfortunate, bad habit of chewing headphones if we leave them sitting out, so I\u2019ve tried the Jlab over ear hook, Occiam, Bmani, just to name my most recent ones.Of all the ones I\u2019ve had these are my favorite fit and comfort by far!! I have smaller ears so others sometimes fit loose and feel clunky. I also like the jlabs fit, but I prefer the push button on these, I would always hit the jlabs tap controls by accident while adjusting or something.The noise cancellation is VERY effective. No option of turning that on or off but it is super effective especially at such a low price point. I will probably use them single earpiece at a time majority of the time so I can still hear what\u2019s going on in the house. But I do love to melt away and not hear my surroundings so that\u2019s a big plus that it has good noise cancellation.I will do my very best to keep these away from my dog for sure!!*1 year later- these are still my favorite! Sound quality trumps every pair I\u2019ve tried from affordable brands",

Ademas el audio suena super bien, supero mi espectativa. El precio esta acorde a la calidad y la duracion de la pila es muy buena, pero supongo que es porque estan nuevos.",
