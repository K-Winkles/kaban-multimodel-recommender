They worked perfectly with my adapter for my iPhone 7 and with my iPad (gen 2). The sound quality for calls is crisp and love that I can control the volume while on a call, listening to music or streaming movies. They also fit very comfortably, came packaged good and the delivery was fast. The small bag included was appreciated as it will keep them protected when storing. I highly recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "After using these earbuds for months(since I bought them multiple times), I can say that these earbuds are great. The mic quality is great and sounds quite clear but it will pick up background noise very easily when playing video games. This can easily be fixed with noise suppression if you're using it on other things such as Discord. The earbuds also last a very long time which I was surprised to find out. It can last you about 6-7 months until the sound from one of the earbuds starts to sound lower. But, overall, I'd say these are a solid pair of earbuds that I recommend to anyone who needs one.",

                "reviewText": "My son suggested I try this brand of wired earbuds because I have so much trouble keeping earbuds in my ears. He was right!In the past, when I put earbuds in my ears, I try to make the full little circular speaker face toward my ear so I can get the full benefit of everything from the treble through to the base. It just doesn't work for me. My ear is too small, and they always pop out. And the ones that have a large end to place in your ear with a small speaker sticking out of it that goes into your ear canal still fall out of my ear because I don't have enough \"ear surface\" to keep those from falling out of my ear and they never give me a rubber tip small enough to fit into my ear.I hope I can explain this: These aren't exactly round; they have a small protrusion on one end. The end of that protrusion is flat and THAT is where the speaker is located. You place the bud sideways into your ear; sort of like sliding it in with the speaker pointed toward your eardrum. The bud lays flat against your ear and stays there because the disc part of the bud is held in place by your ear on both sides of the bud as it slides toward your ear canal. All the sound goes directly toward your eardrum through the flat edge buried in your ear. The sound is so amazing. The big surprise is you don't have to have the volume turned up so loud to hear all the music. I had to turn it down from the setting I use for my other ear buds! And I was able to enjoy really good, clear, amazing music. Although I still hear sound around me like if the A/C turns off or on, or someone says something - but it does not bother the music one little bit. To be honest, it was sort of like the ultimate club or bar experience; you get to hear all the great music and can enjoy it with friends without having to shout at each other to share it and your thoughts. Or going to one of those movie clubs with tables and being able to hear the film perfectly and talk about it with your companions at the same time.The quality is not just fantastic for music. Works great for everything I have tried so far like phone, movies, tablet, games. And I mean a lot of different games; Terraria, Minecraft, or COC with my grandson, as well as WOW, Diablo and everything in between. We are definitely a gaming family!I have noticed that all the controls work so far on phone, tablet, and such, but I did discover the volume control does not work on PC. But I am so happy with the quality of sound I don't mind that at all. It is handy to control volume on the phone or tablet using the earbud control because you have to adjust controls on those things with little buttons on the sides; sometimes having to pick the device up to do so while you are trying to use it. Having it on the earbud wire is better. I have volume and other controls readily handy on my PC as well as on my keyboard and don't even think about adjusting it on the wired earbuds, anyway.2 thumbs up, 5 Stars, and THANK YOU. I love them.",

So that's the pro. Otherwise the sound quality is ok, though they are very loud by default and I have to keep my laptop below level ten to avoid blowing out my eardrums. The volume buttons on the earbuds seemingly do not work as well. And like other people have mentioned the bass is off, but voices are very clear. If you need inexpensive headphones in a pinch these work fine. Otherwise there are even cheaper and better options like the old-school Sony earbuds or even skullcandy etc.",
