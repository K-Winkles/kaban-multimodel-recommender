                "reviewText": "I ordered these PerL Pros after reading that they use technology by Masimo. I am familiar with their work in the medical field, as they created algorithms (with my former company's help) to reduce noise artifacts in pulse oximetry measurements of oxygen saturation. I was intrigued by the idea that they were involved in improving the listening experience for listeners of high fidelity music.I recorded a YouTube video of myself unboxing and performing a first listening test of these headphones. I'm glad I captured it on video, because my facial expressions and comments say it all. These earbuds are AMAZING! They step you through a process to measure how you hear sound, and then adjust the audio to compensate for the way YOU hear, they then provide a listening experience for how you would hear through conventional headphones, and then allow you to switch to the 'personalized' audio that they generate. Let me just say, the difference was ASTOUNDING! I had to switch back to my wired earbuds to make sure they weren't pulling a fast one, and the way those earbuds sounded was just like the way the 'default' sound was frome these earbuds. I can tell you right now, you wil NEVER listen to the 'default' sound again. The personalized sound was, in the most descriptive term I can use, an aural orgasm. I literally got choked up when I first heard it, as verified by my YouTube video.I must say that I was listening to uncompressed audio, which can be played by the Pro version of these ear buds (but not the regular version). However, I must also add that I had stored on my smartphonme both an uncompressed (WAV) file of an audio track and also a high bitrate MP3 (320 kbps) encoding of a track, and the difference was like night and day. I thought it would be subtle, but for the track I listened to, it was not even close.The Pro version allows you to play uncompressed audio, whereas the regular PerLs do not. If you want the absolutely mindblowing experience, get the Pros. But even the MP3s sound so much better with the personalized listening turned on, so you can't go wrong with those, either.I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone who has a serious love for high-quality music. These produce sound every bit as good as my multi-thousand dollar media room system. The 'spatial' mode sounds like a surround sound decoding. I can't put it into words, but I'll conclude by saying I came very close to tears upon hearing the personalized sound profile generated by these amazing devices. Buy them, and buy the Pros if you can afford them. You will not regret it in the least.",

                "reviewText": "Denon allows the user to choose between a preset setup or allow a customized setup for each earbud. There is an app to assist you through this up to three customized presets. The app scans each ear individually mapping how you interpret sound. This has created a very immersive experience without having to use a lot of volume.The only drawback of these are they are a bit larger than most earbuds and if you are smaller like myself, Denon does not provide more smaller interchangeable rubber tips.These are my new favorite way to practice music.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t usually write reviews unless i think what I\u2019ve received is either the best or worst thing I\u2019ve ordered. These earbuds are just the best earbuds I\u2019ve ever used in my life. I remember growing up I had a denon speaker like 30 years ago and it was my favorite speaker so when I heard they were making earbuds I knew they were going to be amazing. I listen to 90% hip-hop so if you like bass then these are for you. But I also listen to classic rock, country and piano as well and the clarity is flawless. I can\u2019t say anything bad about these they stay in your ear because the have this little wing kinda like the Apple Beats Pro, but they beat the Apple pros the new Bose easily. The only thing they lack what those has is the ability to change ANC on the fly at least I don\u2019t know how to. Not a lot of info on these yet because they are so knew but i own all three and Denon is just so much better in loudness, bass, vocals and clarity. Good job Denon",

And I love how you can customize the bass thru \u201cimmersion\u201d and get the sound you didn\u2019t know was possible from wireless earbuds. I\u2019ve got at least 10 sets of buds, including Bose, Sennheiser, BW, AirPods Pro, Masters&Dynamic and these instantly became my favorite because of the sound.Now, I haven\u2019t had them long enough to determine battery life yet, to be fair. And I have only made one phone call thus far. But at this point, they seem on par with my other sets when it comes to those points.But I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend these to a friend, based on the sound alone.Love them!",

I put these head to head based on my own priorities which are mainly a) stable fit, b) sound quality and bass content, c) app control/usability.I have always had difficulties with fit and most ear buds fall out within minutes of installation. If anyone has ever used Etymotic Reasearch ear buds then you will know quality and brilliant sound and I found these are the only ones that fit in my ears, sadly they don\u2019t manufacture wireless units and this is where I was heading.These Denon buds outperform even the Bose Ultra\u2019s in my worthless opinion, the wing tips do the stability job and the Massimo software which surveys the internals of your ear canal and tailors the sound accordingly, amazing sound.The only negative is the poor response to a request to Denon UK for support (purely for buying spare ear tips) and when I finally got a response, after chasing twice, they put me onto a UK dealer who told me it was a 3-4 month delivery time and a price tag of \u00a352 pounds for a full set of sizes of silicone ear tips, 3/4\u2019s of which would be wasted. Denon, this needs to be sorted out.Not so great. The product itself, unbelievable. It was an independent manufacturer whom Denon purchased and rebranded, but still amazing product. 10/10",
