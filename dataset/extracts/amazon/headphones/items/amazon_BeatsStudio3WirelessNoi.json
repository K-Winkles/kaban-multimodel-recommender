                "reviewText": "I really love these headphones, battery life is impressive, last many days.Volume can get pretty high with minimal distortion.Controls are easy enough to use.Sound quality is good enough for me. There are some people who might complain these are bass heavy, but for me, there are times I wish it had more bass, or the ability to play bass at lower frequencies.Noise cancelling is nice, but seemingly in a somewhat recent firmware upgrade (likely the last as this is an older model unit that might not be supported for too much longer), if you even turn your head a little and let some \"air\" into the area between your ear and the driver the noise cancelling seems to subdue for a few seconds and then stabilizes and returns. That is annoying, but not the end of the world. Also these often do not work that well in an airplane as the noise cancelling seems to get overwhelmed, typically on one side at a time and it starts to heavily distort the audio you're trying to listen to, worse at higher volumes.But otherwise, these are really nice headphones, I'm not sure about the build quality, they do feel a bit plasticky and the joint mechanisms that allow them to fold feel like they might break, but I've had my set for about a year now with no issues, though I am known for being more gentle than the average person.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars quality headphones, when on a sale a great value",
                "reviewText": "I think these headphones are terrific. I am not a techie or a sound system professional or anything close to that - just someone who enjoys all kinds of music and wants to enjoy it with a nice set of earbuds or headphones. Also, I'm a little bougie and like \"status\" brands so who wouldn't think I was cool in a pair of Beats Studio 3s? LOL.In reading the reviews, I was a bit nervous to get these because it seemed that a lot of the more recent ones were a bit negative in terms of the \"quality of sound\" and the noise cancelling. I looked at a lot other wireless headphones - AirPods Max, Bose, JBL, Sony etc. I decided to still purchase because at the Prime Day price (which I snagged earlier than Prime Day) they were a steal.I have been testing these out for a couple days. I think that the noise cancelling is fine. No, it's not like getting sucked into a vacuum but it cancels out the surrounding external sound enough so that I can fully immerse myself in the music. I find that this fits my \"smallish\" head and ears just fine, it's comfortable after about 4-5 hours of wear and still plenty of battery life. Most headphones, and earbuds, I have owned get uncomfy after a while and honestly I only see myself using these in spurts of 1-5 hours at a time anyway. The matte black style I got is very sleek and subtle; the packaging is beautiful, feels very \"exclusive\".Paired with my iphone 12 with no issue and every time I turn on the headphone power it immediately connects. I like the volume, play/pause/skip/back control. I don't intend to use this to take/make phone calls.So, at the sale price I think these were a great buy.Update: wore these today (7/18/23) in my home office and was driving my hubs crazy because I could not hear him and was not responding to him when he called my name repeatedly. He was sitting less than 10 feet away from me. So I\u2019d say the noise canceling seems to work pretty well. ;)",

                "reviewText": "So I have been a huge fan of the AirPod Pro's since the day they came out. I do light show sequences to music, so I'm using headphones for hours at a time, and need clear, crisp audio quality for what I work on. AirPods were getting to where after 6-8 hours straight my ears would hurt (from them being in, not volume). I wanted over the ear headphones and was looking at the AirPod Max, but saw the Beats Studio 3's. Wife has had a pair for a few months, so I borrowed her's for a day. Figured I'd return these if I really didn't like them, so pulled the trigger and bought them.I don't regret it one bit, and the sale price really helped! Audio is amazing, especially in the higher range which is what I'm needing. They don't exaggerate the bass tones either, which is great. Overall, extremely happy with the audio quality and the noise cancelling they offer. Battery life is amazing as well - I don't know how long the battery lasts, but its more than 8 hours. I've sequenced songs to lights for 8 straight hours yesterday, then after a quick break back at it for another 5 and these were keeping pace.They come with the micro-USB charger cable, which is a drawback in my book, its another cable I have to keep on my desk - why not just do USB-C like everyone else? Thats about my only complaint I can come up with. Minor inconvenience for me, not a deal breaker. These are amazing headphones for why I bought them, and the built in microphone means you can take calls with them as well.I was hesitant but they integrate with Mac/iPhone so well and work perfectly, I'm glad I got them. As with anything that offers AppleCare, I recommend that, especially at full price, its worth the insurance on the device if anything happens.",

They sound decent but their mic is awful and when attempting to connect to my PC, it has such a hard time maintaining a Bluetooth connection. The sound skips and lags. (Other people have the same problem). I have good specs and a great motherboard. So it\u2019s not my tech.",

                "reviewText": "De principio es necesario decir que ya medio mundo sabe que Beats no es la mejor marca de audio, a\u00fan haya sido comprada por Apple, de hecho se escuchan mejor mis AirPods Pro 2 y mis AirPods Max que estos Beats Studio 3 en fidelidad de sonido y frecuencias de voces e instrumentos. Pero hay una diferencia en el audio que brindan estos aud\u00edfonos que hace que el sonido sea delicioso. Tienen una profundidad y una potencia incre\u00edble que ni los AirPods Max ni los AirPods Pro 2 tienen. Tiene una alta fidelidad y calidad de sonido aunque no el mejor como ya dije ni con las comparaciones que he hecho, es bastante bueno. Incluso yo que tengo los ambos AirPods mencionados muchas veces prefiero escuchar m\u00fasica en estos Beats por la comodidad que me dan en el ajuste de cabeza, no son nada pesados ni se mueven y la cancelaci\u00f3n es incre\u00edble, muy buena, si puedes escuchar ruidos pero a menos que sean fuertes y aunque subas el volumen su profundidad o sonido hace que no sea molesto para el o\u00eddo. Cosa que en mis AirPods (ambos) si llega a ser cansado el sonido luego de un rato y en estos casi no. No tiene muchos bajos o son pr\u00e1cticamente nulos a veces y eso que yo soy amante de los bajos pero a\u00fan as\u00ed debo decir que estoy muy contento con el sonido, la calidad y la est\u00e9tica de estos Beats, a pesar de ser viejitos y que el cable para cargarse tambi\u00e9n lo es, a estas alturas del 2024 (los compr\u00e9 en diciembre de 2023) me van perfecto y se han convertido en unos de mis aud\u00edfonos favoritos. He probado otros como Sennheiser, Bos\u00e9, Sony y otros. La verdad que con todos tuve problemas de alg\u00fan tipo y aunque hay marcas que suenan mejor no tienen esta delicia de sonido ni la potencia que brindan los Beats. De hecho aunque no me crean pero es cuesti\u00f3n de gustos, prefer\u00ed devolver en diciembre unos Sony XM4 y mejor me qued\u00e9 con los Beats y no me arrepiento, los Sony sonaban muy bajito y muy alejados. Con cable en estos Beats el sonido mejora pero a\u00fan as\u00ed con puro Bluetooth son excelentes. Yo si los recomiendo. Quiz\u00e1 cuando se descompongan vaya ahora por los StudioPro. Hay que recordar que no solo est\u00e1s comprando unos aud\u00edfonos, est\u00e1s comprando la marca, la calidad de Apple (diferente, pero es de Apple), la conexi\u00f3n con iOS, y otras comodidades con su firma. Hay gente que no le gusta el pl\u00e1stico y que cuando aprietas los botones suena un click fuerte pero a mi me encanta, no tengo problema ni es algo malo para mi. Me pongo a practicar karate con ellos puestos en un dojo de mi casa y no se me caen y disfruto mucho cada canci\u00f3n. Cosa que no puedo hacer con mis AirPods Max y mis AirPods Pro 2 pues su sonido a la larga me cansa el o\u00eddo.",

I reserve my Audeze headphones only for use when i am in the mood for audiophile quality listening with my RMI DAC. I was using the AirPods Pro for late night listening via Apple TV since I couldn\u2019t play my normal hifi setup (wife goes to bed earlier than me), and was looking for an alternative since the airpods do get tiring after couple of hours. I saw the beats studio 3 on sale, and decided on impulse to buy it, and i am really very happy with it!!! The battery life is really good!! The integration with Apple ecosystem really makes it so easy to use. The noise cancellation is good, and the battery life is really amazing!! The sound quality is good but ofcourse not audiophile quality like the Audeze, but then my use for these studio 3 headphones is for late night general listening, so it\u2019s perfect!! It\u2019s also very comfortable on the ears for long duration listening!!Overall I am very happy with my impulse purchase and would recommend it to my friends and family!!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little intimidated by the price of these headphones and was going to opt out for the cheaper model by Apple. Thank god I didn\u2019t. I usually have a hard time finding headphones that don\u2019t hurt my ears after wearing them for over an hour. These are comfortable, stay on head during my workouts, the battery lasts forever, and the noise cancellation is one of my favourites. The hard case it comes in is perfect to protect them and the sound quality for music and phone calls is amazing. Could not be happier with my purchase and for any other gym goers out there, with how much time you spend at the gym, these are 110% worth the price. My boyfriend has had his own pair of these for over 6 years and the only thing that is wearing and tearing are the ear muffs. Amazon has replacements for like $15 bucks. Can only imagine how long these will last me.",
