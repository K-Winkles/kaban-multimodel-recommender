Can I hear things around me? sometimes.. they aren\u2019t sound proof. Is the sound quality fine? Yes, no crazy static or weird noises just clear music. They Bluetooth connect easily. They are light but definitely feel cheaply made .. again this brings me back to they are $20 headphones. So in this sense you are 100% getting what you pay for. The ear pieces fit comfortably over my ears and there is no weird pressure or discomfort.I\u2019m satisfied with my purchase and feel as though I spent my $20 wisely. If you are looking for something to listen to music to while you workout and not do anything spectacular these are it.",

                "reviewText": "For something that seems expensive for the reviews that are given is not true at all because although they\u2019re not $500 they are above and beyond for $30. The noise canceling is low but you can barely hear your snap. The sound is very good and the charge holds for days, and they\u2019re very comfortable and adjustable. I believe the bad reviews but they\u2019re really not that bad they\u2019re pretty good so I recommend buying them because they are perfect.",
