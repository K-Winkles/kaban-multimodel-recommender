                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Literally mind-blowing upgrading from AirPods Pro 2",
                "reviewText": "Beats**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**Two notes about me:* I have a pretty average sized head & ears* I wear glassesThoughts:- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.- I can FEEL the bass.- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I\u2019ve heard.- Classical sounds amazing\u2014way better than AirPods Pro 2.- Folk sounds amazing, & it\u2019s like someone\u2019s playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.- Piano also sounds especially amazing- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there\u2014they also barely fit (see pictures).- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.- Box is very sleek & giftable.- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it\u2019s not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it\u2019s not so uncomfortable that I don\u2019t want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it\u2019s not any real inconvenience.- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out\u2014USB-C or a lightening cord would\u2019ve been way better.- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it\u2019s a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn\u2019t trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that\u2019d be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it\u2019s just barely big enough for that.- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don\u2019t have that and I\u2019m left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you\u2019re looking for good bluetooth headphones and don\u2019t have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. They\u2019re definitely a good value at $200, but they\u2019re mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren\u2019t are barely worth commenting on.Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not. I\u2019d highly recommend buying if they\u2019re in your budget!!!",

Great for the gym. Very difficult to get sweat buildup but it is possible so that\u2019s another reason why I got a second pair. Much more enjoyable than AirPods Pro or Beats Pro (pods)Easily worn three hours with no discomfort. No charging problems. Connect is easy to iPhone. They never fall off or slip at the gym or while biking yet not uncomfortable at all.",

                "reviewText": "At last I finally found the perfect wireless headphones!! I bought these back in November when they were on sale for Black Friday (only $80!) and wanted to give them a test period before I reviewed them. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve experienced this far:Pros1. The sound quality is impeccable. Literally everything is so clear and crisp. Funny enough, to put it into perspective, I was watching a movie and did not notice faint background music until I put these headphones on.2. The battery life is great. For me, they last roughly 72 hours before I need to fully recharge them. With charging, it takes maybe 40 minutes to an hour to get back up to a full charge. Impressive3. They\u2019re compact and foldable. You\u2019d be surprised how many headsets don\u2019t fold when you\u2019re done using them but these are perfect if you need to travel.4. They can connect to anything! I connected them to the Bluetooth on my tv for the first time since I didn\u2019t want to wake my roommate up at 2am and set up was easy and simple.5. Changing the volume or song is simple and easy.6. Not really a pro, just an opinion, but they are really cute and stylish.Cons:1. A lot of people were right about them hurting your ears after having them on for too long; maybe more than 4 hours of continuous wear. I wish the part that goes around your ears was a little bigger to minimize the discomfort, but nonetheless it\u2019s not a huge deal.2. Don\u2019t connect them to numerous things at once. For instance, I had these paired with my iPhone and laptop at the same time. When I turned on my laptop it disconnected from my iPhone automatically and vice versa. My suggestion, disconnect from the device you\u2019re not using and only focus on one sole device at a time.3. I wish the charger came with a charging block instead of just a wire. If you don\u2019t have an extra block make sure you get one.4. They are not 100% noise cancelling but it does block out a good amount of outside noise5. My only concern is that when you call someone or someone calls you there\u2019s a weird echo in the background. Like every time you talk it sounds like you\u2019re talking in a tunnel? Again not a big deal just something I\u2019ve noticed.Overall, I\u2019m really happy with this purchase and if you\u2019re considering getting these just do it. I really needed them for studying purposes and they get the job done 100%.",

                "reviewText": "Basicamente j\u00e1 era usu\u00e1rio de um Beats Solo3, e acabei comprando um novo para mim pois dei o meu anterior para outra pessoa. \u00c9 um fone bom, de qualidade impar. Ap\u00f3s um ano, \u00e9 notavel certo desgaste das borrachas no arco superior do fone, que soltam com o tempo. O fone \u00e9 um pouco desconfort\u00e1vel pelo tamanho das almofadas. Para quem tem lobulos grandes ou faz uso de \u00f3culos, recomendo o studio.Almofadas tamb\u00e9m superaram as espectativas, se mantendo intactas ap\u00f3s 1 ano de uso cont\u00ednuo. N\u00e3o sei se foi feito uma revis\u00e3o no fone, pois meu primeiro fone \u00e9 de 2016. Anteriormente as almofadas se soltavam.Qualidade do bluetooth tamb\u00e9m melhorou. Meu fone antigo, depois de uns 8 meses, parou de funcionar o bluetooth. J\u00e1 para este atual, segue perfeito.DICA: Comprem o preto, os coloridos tendem a amarelar por conta da gordura corporal, mesmo efetuando limpeza. Almofadas tamb\u00e9m.",
