                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones for the price with nice bass",
                "reviewText": "These work pretty much as advertised. They are fairly light, the cushions for the ears are decent and sound quality it pretty good with lots of low end and modestly crisp highs. Unfortunately, many seem to equate good bass with good sound quality and this is not quite the case. These are a bit lackluster in the midrange area which is totally fine for most music where midrange is often lowered via EQ anyway but not as good for movies and TV. Still, while I would have appreciated a bit more midrange, they perform well in my opinion, especially considering the price. Classical music enthusiasts may not be too happy, though so keep that in mind if that's your thing. I have no legitimate complaints in this department myself since I don't listen to a lot of classical music while wearing headphones.The controls are pretty easy to use and connecting via Bluetooth is quick and simple. The ability to hardwire is also nice, although the cable provided is only 3 ft long so either buy another longer male to male 3.5mm audio cable or be prepared to stay close to your device - really close.The LED lights can be turned off if desired but that's about it. You cannot set it to a single color so it's either nothing or slowly shifting colors. That's not really a problem if you don't care or don't want the lights at all but if you're like me and would prefer a single color, you're out of luck. Full disclosure: I could be wrong but there is no information in the instructions for anything other than off/on. It's possible there's a way to do it I have yet to discover but I'm skeptical I will find one. Also, the colors shift at very slightly different rates on either ear piece. So while they are the same color when first powered on, over time they eventually become out of sync. One side might be red, the other side might be yellow. After watching for a bit while writing this, the two sides have never matched colors again after falling out of sync. Again, not a big deal just an FYI in case you care.Comfortwise, these are adequate. The ear pads are nice, not incredible but nice. They fit fairly comfortably but I've noticed they seem a bit tight on me and for the record I do NOT have a giant noggin. Ok, maybe slightly larger than some but not Sputnik level and I use a normal size pillow. I do wish the ear cups were *slightly* larger for my mildly oversized ears (I said mildly so you can drop the picture of Prince Charles from your mind, I'm more a Daniel Craig type ear) but they still fit well and I have no realistic complaints here either, just thoughts of minor improvements possible. It's possible that over time they will stretch out a bit and become more comfortable as is often the case. I currently have mine stored over some books to promote widening. This has worked for me on a number of occasions and I'm hopeful it will work in this case.The noise cancellation feature is for the mic only and works pretty well. Sound quality appears to be good or so my friends tell me. These don't do much to block out ambient sounds, though. I have a window AC unit that's not quiet and I can still hear it with these on albeit much quieter.The headphones come with a 3ft micro USB charging cable (USB C would be nice here but you can't have everything) and a 3ft male to male 3.5mm audio cable, both of decent quality. The headphones themselves appear to be made well. One thing I noticed immediately is the line connecting the ear pieces has a nice amount of slack if you need to adjust the size and is even covered with braided cloth instead of just bare plastic covered wire.All in all these are fairly nice and I have no regrets about purchasing them, especially considering the price as I've noted before. I would recommend these to family and friends looking for an inexpensive but good quality. option. In fact I would buy these again myself if I lost or destroyed them somehow. Please don't take my criticisms as a rebuke of the product itself. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "No, they might not equal higher-end headphones, but I think most people would be happy with these; my spouse and I are. The sound quality is excellent; the fit is comfortable, even after wearing them for a few hours; they fold up to occupy less space in a suitcase or tote bag. They come with a cord for plugging into a computer jack and they\u2019re also programmable for Bluetooth settings. I use the plug-in feature on my laptop; spouse goes with Bluetooth. Sound quality is excellent, and I can hear just fine with a lower volume. The color changes are kind of funky, too.",

                "reviewText": "The sound was great quality and the ear pads went fully around my ears which is what i wanted. The biggest flaw i experiemced was in the bluetooth connection. I would experience an audio \"chop\" a couple times per song where it would.momentarialy stop for maybe a half second. Not a huge deal but when i wear headphones while working i can have them on for a good 6hr+ at a time and that can get extremely annoying.One other small annoyance is with the \"led ring\" lights on the ear pieces. I wanted to turn this off to save every bit of power i could since these only had a 20hr battery... once you turn the headphones off and back on the setting will reset to be on so you have to switch it off every time.My suggestion... spend a couple bucs more and get the picun B8 headphones instead... no dropout, 100hr battery, and no \"led ring\" light to deal with. Far superior headphones imo.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok so I already own Gen 1 AirPods but they aren\u2019t worth anything in the gym so I ordered these so I could be completely immersed in my music during my workouts.Pros: super loud for $20. I think if someone was screaming in my Face I would hear them but since that\u2019s not the societal norm the sound is great compared to the price. Great bass! At one moment I was like ok where\u2019s the bass but I think maybe it was the song I was listening to. Siri responds and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because she can hear me through the phone or the headphones but hey whatever works. Little buttons on the side are conventional and functional, a little hard to press but still great to have. They Came charged, wore them about 3 hours right out of the box! But they are Easy to charge.Cons: they aren\u2019t super noise canceling but enough for me compared to the price so I wouldn\u2019t even really say a con. Just a note.They are a little chunky, like big. The muffs included which made my face hot and even more sweaty in the gym. They slide just a little also during sweating but my head is a little small BUT I also have THICK hair still and slides a little.Not sure how to turn the lights off on the side. Instructions on if that\u2019s an option aren\u2019t included so I assume you can\u2019t turn them off however this doesn\u2019t bother me also so just another note.Will update In 3 months. We know how long I\u2019ve had GEN 1 Pods, will these stand the test??? Mwhahahaha",
