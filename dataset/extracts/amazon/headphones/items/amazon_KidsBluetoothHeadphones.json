                "reviewText": "Cheap and definitely not the best. My son wore them once and the entire cushion came off the ear piece. After about 2 days the entire right side fell apart. You get what you pay for I guess. I used to think Amazon was awesome bc the prices were great and the products are always really good! At least they used to be. Lately, I have found that Amazon isn't worth my money and I can get more on discounted websites like TEMU than to continue shopping on here. I only shop on here to get something I need, quick, fast and in a hurry.",

For my 3 year old I feel this can be dangerous as he's unable to hear important directions. In addition they are to loud on level two. This cause me to ve concerned about hearing damage",
