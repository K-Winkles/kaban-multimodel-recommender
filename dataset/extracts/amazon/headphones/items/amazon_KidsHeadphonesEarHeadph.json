                "reviewText": "My son absolutely loved these headphones! They were super comfortable and actually kept volume levels at appropriate levels no matter what my son's LeapPad decided to do volume wise. They also seemed to have good sound quality. He is almost 6 with a fairly large noggin and he still had plenty of adjustment available. I particularly liked how flexible the band was, as it left me with no worries of snapping like many kids' headphones tend to.Unfortunately, they did stop working through no product fault. My son is a chewer and I didn't catch him in time once which caused some of the internal wires to sever from him popping the cord in his mouth.If these were available in wireless, I'd buy them and an adapter in a heartbeat (his LeapPad doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities). Heck, if we could get my son's chewing stim redirected, I'd happily buy the wired ones again! I highly recommend these headphones.",
