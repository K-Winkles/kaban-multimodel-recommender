I ordered on Monday, and it got here on Friday. Camera is pretty good quality. Even came with a nice little carrying pouch, (though I'm not sure when I would ever use it; it's still nifty to keep my glasses in or something). One thing to consider with this model of camera - you aren't going to get the results you see on youtube unless you have good lighting, so I would also recommend getting a light to put behind the camera. That isn't to say that it is bad without a light, it's still a really good web cam, but it's not what you see on some YouTube reviews without it.",

                "reviewText": "I teach media production online and needed a camera that could handle 4K and green screen. This camera does the job. I'm extremely happy with it. The image is crisp, and the chroma key is spectacular. I love the 3 different POVs to choose from and the separate software to control the camera. Logitech went all out for this model. Of course it was expensive, but you get what you pay for. I'm happy I made the investment.",

Comprei para filmar em 4k e acima de tudo tirar fotos com boa defini\u00e7\u00e3o ao mesmo tempo -> miss\u00e3o cumprida. \u00c9 uma c\u00e2mera cara, mas para mim valeu cada centavo. Sim ela esquenta um pouco, mas nada que chame a aten\u00e7\u00e3o como alguns aqui j\u00e1 reclamaram. Al\u00e9m disto o corpo dela \u00e9 de alum\u00ednio, justamente para ter boa dissipa\u00e7\u00e3o de calor. Muito boa e suave para abrir e fechar a tampa de privacidade. O cabo \u00e9 bem grosso e meio emborrachado -> gostei. Vem at\u00e9 com um saquinho de veludo para transporte daqui para l\u00e1. Sim \u00e9 poss\u00edvel destacar a base de pl\u00e1stico para ter acesso \u00e0 rosca para ser presa em um trip\u00e9 de rosca. N\u00e3o achei surpreendente a c\u00e2mera, mas \u00e9 muito boa e anos luz acima/melhor do que sua irm\u00e3 C-920.",
