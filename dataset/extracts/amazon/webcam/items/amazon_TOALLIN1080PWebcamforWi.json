The mic sounds ok, however, had some difficulty between the sound drivers on my PC, but that is a softeare issue as I have multiple sound driver applications installed. All in all, this camera works perfectly for video calls, Windows Hello Log in (saves so much time typing in every time), and sets up very easily. The price, compared to models with the same specs/functionality, is so much cheaper. You cant go wrong here.",

                "reviewText": "! ! Update: just weeks after purchasing, today after booting up my PC, the facial recognition feature seemed to fail because I let my facial hair grow out too long. So I used my password and logged in and attempted to improve accuracy in windows hello. This is where it got very interesting, because it wouldn\u2019t do anything. Instead I noticed a glitch in the camera feed every half a second or so. I was already becoming concerned when I noticed that my PC started crashing, freezing and I even got blue screened a couple times (BSOD) in the days leading up to this. I wondered if that was because I used a different USB cable than the one that came with it, so I swapped it out for the one supplied, and now this. I knew it had nothing to do with the USB cable, this camera is just overpriced junk that I 100% will be returning. ! !(Old review) It is nice if all you want to do is login using Windows Hello. So far, it does that better than the USB Fingerprint reader I was using before. The fingerprint reader would fail sometimes if my skin was dry, dirty, or damaged or the scanner got dirty, dusty or oily and would still end up requiring my password/Pin after a random number of failed attempts it seems, and that was extremely annoying. That's why I got this, even though it is definitely more expensive, like 3 times more.I would even say too expensive for what it is honestly. I'm a college graduate, majored in computer science and engineering, including security, and let me tell you something! Biometrics are way overpriced! NONE OF THIS technology is new! Consumers are totally being played and ripped off for these little things while companies who can afford to buy in bulk like Samsung and Apple get them for pennies.That is why I just can't give it 5 stars, and I can't even give it 4 stars at this price because it's only 1080p, that's almost 20-year-old tech. This is 2023.. I was able to rationalize giving it 3 stars because it is plug and play. I appreciate not having to deal with searching for, downloading, and installing sketchy drivers.If it stops working, I'll update the review and take stars away (I did, see above!)",

I stay stuck at the initial setup phase, I look at the camera straight on for over two minutes and ever only see the Cancel button. I'll be requesting a refund. I should have known better than believe such a cheap webcam could actually deliver on its promises.EDIT: I didn't get a refund and kept the webcam in a drawer, tried it again in January 2024... and it now works for facial recognition. Who knows what changed between when I purchased it and now, but everything's good. One star left removed just because of the mystery.",

The picture quality is good (far in advance of my old non-HD camera), and the mounting makes it quite secure sitting on top of my monitor; it can also be screwed into a little camera stand if you prefer, but that accessory is not included. I can confirm it works with Windows Hello for facial recognition. Just remember you need a PC that supports Trusted Platform Module (TPM} as well, my older laptop does not so no Windows face recognition is available there regardless of the camera. Lastly the camera has a sliding privacy shutter too, so all in all it does everything you could want in a reasonably priced camera.",
