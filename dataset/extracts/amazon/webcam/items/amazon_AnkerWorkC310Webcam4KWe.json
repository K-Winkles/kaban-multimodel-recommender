                "reviewText": "Just received my AnkerWork C310 Webcam and I'm beyond thrilled with its performance. Here's what I absolutely adore about this product:Superior Call Quality: During my video calls, everyone kept pointing out how crisp and clear my camera feed was. The 12MP 4K display genuinely enhances my video conferencing experience by delivering true-to-life images.Seamless Integration with MacOS: I've used multiple webcams in the past and often bumped into compatibility issues. But the C310 was plug-and-play with my MacOS without any hitches.Decent AI Features: The AI functionalities are commendable, especially the AI autofocus and the AI noise canceling mic. While I'd rate its AI capabilities as moderate, it gets the job done and enhances my video quality and audio clarity.Thoughtful Design Additions: The built-in privacy cover is a simple yet significant feature that ensures my privacy post-meetings. It's reassuring to have this small but essential protective barrier.Value for Money: For the price point, especially with the current deal, it's a steal. The performance and features you get out of this are easily comparable to high-end models in the market.To anyone in need of a solid webcam for both professional and personal use, the AnkerWork C310 is a no-brainer. Definitely elevates my meetings and livestreams to the next level!Would highly recommend it! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Anker PowerConf C200 2K version for quite a few months now and the 2k one was such a bang for the buck that I had to try the 4k C310. It was obviously better than the 2k one but I can also confirm that it is so much better that it is worth the extra amount to spring for this one if you can. This is saying a lot because the 2k one was already better than my previous experiences with Logitech's Streamcam, c920, c270, and Razers Kiyo Pro.Now the c310 (4k) only came out a little over two weeks ago, and I've only been using it for a few hours but there are only a couple things that I think they can take care of with some updates.1. There is a small issue with the auto settings, I can turn them all off but the camera tries to still auto adjust for things even though the settings are off. This could be the issue that some people are having with the focus but this should be easily addressed in a firmware update and it hasn't been that big of a deal in my use case. As a matter of fact the auto adjusted settings work better on the c310 versus the c200 in my use cases. Just needs the option to have it not adjust anymore after I have it set to off.2. There is no step between 1080p and 4k. This isn't really a necessary thing for most people but I think it would be a great \"to have\" for this camera. If it is possible having that step at 2k 60fps (or 45) between the 1080 60fps and 4k 30fps would be that extra icing on the cake especially with Lossless. Having that extra versatility would make this such a well rounded camera for multiple use cases.",

                "reviewText": "Nel corso degli anni di pandemia le webcam sono state tra i prodotti pi\u00f9 inflazionate al pari quasi delle mascherine. Se ne trovavano poche perch\u00e8 la domanda \u00e8 balzata di botto e quindi quelle che c'erano sono andate via come il pane. Dopo 3 anni le cose sono cambiate ed i produttori si sono concentrati non solo su prodotti dalla scarsissima qualit\u00e0 ma anche su prodotti di un certo livello. Anker fa prodotti che da sempre mi danno sensazione di qualit\u00e0 e li preferisco se li trovo, specie in offerta, in particolare powerbank ed accessori. Ho comprato in offerta la webcam in questione a 86 euro che pu\u00f2 sembrare molto per una webcam ma dipende dall'uso che se ne fa, non la sfrutto ovviamente in 4k perch\u00e8 uno stream del genere necessita di parecchia banda ma in 1080p fa tutto il suo effetto. In effetti potevo prendere anche il modello inferiore che a 49 euro secondo me \u00e8 un affare. Nella valutazione ho tenuto conto della futuribilit\u00e0 dell'oggetto perch\u00e8 un domani magari mi riuscir\u00e0 facile sfruttare anche il 4k. Menzione speciale per i microfoni che a detta di chi ascolta sono veramente cristallini. Futuri aggiornamenti firmware faranno la differenza, c'\u00e8 ancora qualcosa da correggere sulla luminosit\u00e0 e l'esposizione. Sono andato anche in diretta su una tv da collegato ed i tecnici si sono complimentati per la qualit\u00e0, quasi non si avvertiva che fossi fuori studio. Per un passo successivo ci vuole solo una buona fotocamera Sony collegata in ingresso al PC, allora si che la musica cambia ma per i prossimi 4/5 anni questa qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che ottima.",
