Now five of us around the table can be seen and heard without passing around the laptop, being a contortionist or shouting to be heard. Clarity is great on all fronts for the group at the table and those joining remotely. The thing looks really cool as well. Bought one to try for the business meeting and now got a second one for my personal use. Did I mention how easy it is to set up and get running? It is really simple and straight forward.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the wide view for video, much better than my computer. Very clear video! And that\u2019s the extent of the positives I\u2019ve experienced. The speaker and mic are not as great as it seems in the reviews. I have two separate ones for two different groups (5-8 people and 10-15people) and those who are virtual are constantly saying they can only hear when people are standing next to it. The speaker on full volume is really quiet. The cord is not long enough for a conference room and presentation setting. Having to plug into the computer, it\u2019s great if it\u2019s being operated remotely but if that\u2019s not an option, the speaker can\u2019t be seen in addition to all meeting attendees. It would be nice to have a longer cord or a wireless option so the presenter can operate the computer/presentation and position the camera so they are still seen in addition to meeting attendees. Overall this is a great camera for family zoom sessions with only 2-3people. Not a conference meeting setting.",

I need to unplug and plug the unit in to make it work. I need to do this a few times a day. Once it is working, it is fine. It is at the beginning of the meeting when this happens.",
