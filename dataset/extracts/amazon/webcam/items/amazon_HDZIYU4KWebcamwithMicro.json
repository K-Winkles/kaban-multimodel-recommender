It's noisy and pixellated and there's a fish eye effect from less than a foot away. I wanted to record myself painting and it looks horrible. I can take better videos with my Galaxy S3 phone that's eight years old. There's no way this is 1080p. To give you an idea, the images of the camera were taken with my Note 5. The fuzzy, blurry image of my painting is a still from a video I recorded with this webcam. Needless to say, it's going right back to the store.",
