                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a better webcam to replace my laptop\u2019s camera. When I saw the ideaCam by BenQ, it caught my attention and I know this is what I am expecting for. Connect through USB port so it is very easy to activate it. At my workstation home, I plug into my surface Dock 2 and it automatically detects it; no software installed needed. Compared to my built in cam, the camera quality is much improved. I look much brighter and clearer on the screen, and I won\u2019t worry I look dark when having a Teams meeting with my colleagues. The autofocus function is how ideaCam distinguishes itself from other competitors. You won\u2019t feel or see any image lag when you move yourself and quality stays the best.If you need to present your hand sketches while in a virtual meeting, this webcam allows you to maneuver easily to show the sketch on your desk. The autofocus function plays an important role here. You won\u2019t need to worry the image is fuzzy when you move the webcam around. There is another function allowing you to focus closer. My guess is for the jewelry designer, who sometimes need to show the details normal eyes couldn\u2019t see. They also provide you EnSpire for more advanced functions such as flip your image vertically or horizontally. You can even rotate your image without rotating the camera, which is amazing to me.If you rely on much interaction on the virtual meeting, this webcam is definitely designed for you. If you need a better quality of webcam to replace the lousy built-in webcam, this is also for you.",

                "reviewText": "Bought a BenQ monitor - always of the highest quality, I have another one and always been very impressed. Because this time I was replacing an Apple Cinema Display I no longer had built in iSight so needed a webcam. Even though it's pricey I felt assured that a BenQ camera would be just the ticket. How wrong I was!I can't fault the build - looks really smart. A neat light added on the camera too. Packaging lovely (as if that matters but worth mentioning as it's packed very professionally). The whole thing from the outside screams of a premium purchase.But there's 3 main flaws.1) Auto-focus - Really woeful and the main gripe. Even when well lit the camera is constantly hunting focus and gives a breathing effect every time you move. I could almost, almost put up with the other complaints, but this above all makes it unusable for me.2) Quality - This was really surprising. You can get a decent image when well lit, but let's be honest unless you are a streamer or podcaster etc most of the time you won't be setting up lighting for Zoom chats or Facetime. The image has a flickering effect which is terrible and on my 4K screen the image looked really poor.3) I spent the extra money on the Pro version which comes with a bluetooth controller. It LOOKS amazing. Tremendous build quality. It has options for adjusting focus, taking photos, freezeframing, zoom, etc etc. BUT, you can only use these (and the rest of the features) if you download a program called EnSpire. So you are left with the poor image and focus problems on a normal zoom/Facetime call.Additionally the camera is really for PC's not Mac. It seems Mac compatibility is a bit of an afterthought. They don't advise using the desktop version and instead say to access it through a web browser. And even then there are limitations for Mac users.Some other problems I found - there's no way to adjust the image to be mirrored like you normally see on most webcams. This will be fine for others, I guess I'm just used to seeing my reflection moving the same way I am, even if things are back to front. I also tested recording audio through its microphone on Quicktime and the resulting video was out of sync to the audio. Didn't do any further tests, but just straight out of the box that didn't work for me.Positives - the little zoom attachment gadget is quite nifty, not sure when I'd use it for though. The microphone apparently has noise reduction. The light is a good addition. The build and everything about it prior to hooking the thing up looks very professional.But all the problems I mentioned make this webcam completely unusable. It certainly is a case of 'don't judge a book by its cover\" - the cover is The Divine Comedy, the contents are Michael McIntyre's Guide to Comedy.Disappointing.",
