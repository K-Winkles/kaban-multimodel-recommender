Answer: The low voltage indicator light on the front side of the lens, and the charging indicator light on the back of the charging port. If the charging indicator light flashes, it means the battery has not been activated, and the battery is using too low voltage protection; Please charge slowly and for a longer time to see if you can activate the battery. When fully charged, the flashing light in front will return to its original state. Question 2: Can you tell me under normally circumstance how long does it take to charge the camera if the battery is completed depleted? Answer: Fully charge the item need about 4-5 Hours(1.5-2.0A, DC 5V output ), and webcam should last up to 9 hours playtime.",

Previously had a logitech c270 that I didn't like because it blocked my screen and I could not adjust the view. Not the case here. This cam (Gsou 2K 5MP Zoomable Web cam) sits above my screen gives solid video quality and had lots of options so you can get the perfect view. I love that the zoom and focus are manual so I can dial it in like I want it. When in google meets I can tap the zoom to get the perfect crop that I want. I know it has some upgraded models like bluetooth but my pc supports that so this base model with all of its viewing flexibility was perfect for me. I turn it on, pop in my bluetooth ear buds and I am ready to rock.",

The built-in microphone is fairly sensitive and works well enough.",
