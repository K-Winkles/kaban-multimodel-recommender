                "reviewText": "So I haven't done any sort of survey of dedicated cameras - I can't say if this is the best of its type (though it was recommended to me as such by someone I trust). But I can say that it's a dramatic improvement over the cameras that are built in to my latest-generation MacBook Air and my several-year old Mac desktop. The resolution is radically better. The light balance and low-light performance are far better. And the focus and depth-of-field handling are far better. I am on zoom calls typically 5-6 hours a day, these days. (Ugh, right?) I find that being seen clearly really helps my participation and impact in meetings. Mostly, it's about enabling the other people on the calls to more easily read my facial expressions. It actually makes a difference. If you also have a zoom-heavy job, make the investment, upgrade your camera!",

                "reviewText": "Bought my EagleEye Mini to use primarily in Zoom meetings to work remotely (bought elsewhere). Poly's website talks about 4x zoom & pan feature....but it must be very app specific as it doesn't appear to have that functionality in Zoom. Talking to Polycom's tech support for this camera is amazingly weak given that tech support for their Plantronic's headsets is actually very good. Camera is good unless you want that zoom function.",

                "reviewText": "The video is great quality but the mount is pretty useless. The camera has limited range of motion (up/down only) so if you want to rotate the camera left or right, you're out of luck. I was trying to hide closet doors in my background and the only way I could do it was to bend the mount and use some tape. Neither the mount nor the camera offering physical panning which seems really strange to me.Other reviewers mentioned zooming. I was able to get that to work in Windows 10 by opening the Camera app and zooming in by using Ctrl + or Ctrl + wheel up on the mouse. I also turned off the autofocus there to avoid the constant refocusing. Once I have it the way you want, simply close out of the app and open Teams/Zoom/whatever and it should be tuned the same as it was in the Camera app.",
