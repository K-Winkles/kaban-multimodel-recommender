                "reviewText": "One of my peers started using this camera for our team meetings, and for months I assumed he was using a DSLR for his webcam, because his image quality was *that* much better than anything I had ever seen. One day my curiosity got the best of me and I asked him, and I was floored when he told me it was this sub-$20 webcam.Under natural light this camera far exceeds even the best Logitech webcam I have. It is truly amazing how this low-priced, unassuming device can deliver such amazing performance, but it does.There is one flaw with this webcam which I will cover that later. But first, let me tell you all the good things about it...The camera's native resolution is 1920x1080 pixels (1080p) and a 16:9 aspect ratio. Video conferencing apps can and sometimes do crop video to a 4:3 aspect ratio but this camera's native resolution is full 1080p.Unless you're Bigfoot, the sweet spot for this camera is about 20\" away. At this distance your head and torso will fill the screen fully. Any closer and you'll crop your head or torso, and if you're more than 36\" away you will look like a miniature person. The camera has a fixed focal length: there is no optical zoom. Apps may allow you to \"zoom,\" but they accomplish this by cropping the 1080p image, so your image will get fuzzier the more you \"zoom\" in (unfortunately, the \"infinite zoom\" technology showcased in movies like \"Blade Runner\" and on TV shows like \"CSI\" has yet to be perfected).Sharpness and color balance are good, while color intensity is low. Motion blur is minimal at 30fps, which is fine for videoconferencing unless you're one of those who flails your arms when you talk, and even then you should be fine over a good network connection. But seriously, let your words speak for themselves and reconsider your need to flail. :)This is a USB device and setup is easy: plug it in and let Windows or Mac OS detect it, then choose it for your camera when you join a video call.This camera has one MAJOR shortcoming. Its image sensor is VERY sensitive to pulsating light from LED light bulbs or virtually *any* LED light source. This will manifest as wavy horizontal lines that slowly move up the image. If you use LED light bulbs in your home it's very likely you will experience this. Here's why...LED bulbs are powered by pulsating electricity. Circuitry inside the bulb's base converts alternating current (AC) from the electrical outlet to direct current (DC), then pulses this direct current on and off rapidly at a rate and duty cycle necessary to produce the desired level of brightness for the bulb (this form of power delivery is called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), if you want to learn more about it).Light from LEDs pulses in sync with the current that powers them. This happens so quickly that our eyes don't detect it but the sensor on this camera does, as it's sampling each of the 1080 lines that make up one frame of an image--some lines will be sampled while the LEDs are pulsed on and will be bright, while other lines will be sampled while the LEDs are off and will be dark. As the camera samples 1080 lines 30 times over one second, you get a mishmash of light and dark lines that our eyes see as wavy horizontal lines that appear to crawl slowly up the screen.ALL LEDs use PWM to power them because they would burn up if we applied a steady direct current at the level necessary to provide the desired intensity of light.My strong recommendation is to purchase a LED light source made for webcams, such as a ring lamp or LED array. These are engineered with a shorter pulse width or a randomly changing pulse width that eliminates the wavy lines. I purchased a rather inexpensive LED light that sets atop my monitor and illuminates my face and torso nicely, without the wavy lines. I can even fine tune the color temperature on the light to give my face a little more color on camera.Despite its sensitivity to LED lighting, I highly, highly recommend this webcam because of its amazing image quality and low price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this webcam to replace an older Logitech 720p webcam that was at least 10 years old and had no compatible drivers for Windows 11. I use my webcam for work Zoom and Teams meetings 95% of the time. It\u2019s extremely rare I use it for personal. My work provided me the old crummy 720p webcam. I plug my webcam into a USB hub that plugs into a KVM. This allows me to quickly flip between my work laptop and home desktop seamlessly while using all the same peripherals such as keyboard, mouse, monitor, webcam, USB drive, and a smart card reader. My work laptop runs on Windows 10 while my personal desktop runs Windows 11. The old webcam was still working fine on Windows 10, but no longer worked on the personal computer since I upgraded it to Windows 11. For these reasons I knew I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot on a webcam, and I needed a webcam that could also easily work well with my setup.I installed this webcam the minute it arrived on my doorstep, and I must say I couldn\u2019t be happier with it. This was on sale when I bought it for only $16.19! I plugged it into my USB hub/KVM, and both computers saw the new device with no problems, and native Windows drivers set it up automatically on both computers. I was up and running in less than 5 minutes, and I didn\u2019t have to do anything other than plugging it in.I\u2019m impressed with the quality. At 1080p I could see an improvement over a lower grade 720p webcam. I have a bookshelf behind my desk, and before with the 720p webcam you wouldn\u2019t have been able to read the text on the spines of most of the books. Now with this 1080p webcam you can see the text on most of the spines just fine. The color and contrast balance is good too.The only drawback of this camera is it\u2019s 30 FPS, but I knew that before I bought it. It\u2019s not really a criticism of the product itself, as that\u2019s normal for a lower budget webcam. Just something to be aware of. Unless you plan on running or dancing in front of your webcam having a higher FPS really won\u2019t matter that much.The webcam also comes with a privacy cover. It\u2019s very small, so be careful not to accidently overlook it and throw it away with the packing. I put it on mine, and I do use it when it\u2019s not in use. The camera does show a light to indicate when it\u2019s active anyway, but I still like that extra reassurance of privacy.The webcam also comes with a small instruction manual that includes a link to download the EMEET software. I went ahead and installed that software, but subsequently uninstalled it. The software was extremely basic, and in my opinion unnecessary. It has options to adjust color, brightness, etc\u2026, but those are all things you can already do from within the Windows Camera app, Zoom, and Teams.I\u2019m also an avid Linux user (Linux admin by day), and I confirmed it works on Linux just fine as well. I tried it on Ubuntu and Rocky (RHEL) Linux.Overall I think this was a great deal. Other similar big brand webcams would have cost much more.",

My only complaint is that it doesn't have a little cover to put over it when not in use. Realistically is it going to magically turn on and start a Zoom without my knowledge? No, of course not. But I liked that physical barrier on my laptop webcam. But it does angle all the way up, so I just tip it to point to the ceiling when I'm not using it. So not bad for the price.",
