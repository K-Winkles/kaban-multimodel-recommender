It is fixed focus but what do you want for the price. It's small enough to throw in you luggage and take it with you when traveling. I didn't need a camera with a lot of bells and whistles. Just a camera for occasional video calls. Only issue on the installation was I expected an icon to pop up on my desktop or apps list. I had to get into my device list, find the camera and turn it on before it showed up in my app list. (Windows 11)Would I buy this camera again? Absolutely. If you're looking for simple, compact, inexpensive, great image, this might fit your bill.",

I was hoping for a little more tension to be on the arm that opens to help wedge the camera onto the top of the monitor frame. It's really just balancing on the top, so if you adjust your monitor of bump the cord, it shifts out of position or falls off. Not great for someone who has a desk or monitors they like to adjust and need the camera to stay put.",
