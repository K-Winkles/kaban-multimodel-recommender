If it held either the light(which I have a separate stand) and/or the microphone (which I have on another separate stand) my desk would be less cluttered, but the stand for video, by itself, for the price is a good value and does what it is advertised to do.",

I've been making technical products for over 30 years, and this stand is solidly built, perfectly stylish, very adjustable, saves desk space and has no tripod style legs that can block your monitor view. The base is also heavy, which is excellent for avoiding sway, vibration, etc. I strongly recommend this stand!! \\n/ :) \\m/",
