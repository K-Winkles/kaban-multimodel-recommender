                "reviewText": "I bought three of these cameras for use live streaming church services. They work very well for this purpose as I needed to get a closer view in a large room and a regular wide-angle webcam would not work for this need. The cameras have a metal body and lens housing, are relatively heavy and look to be well made. They also produce the 1080p 30fps video I need for the OBS software that I use.The cameras have a 1/4\" thread mount hole on both the top and bottom, which allows them to be \"stacked\" in a fixed mounting set-up, taking up a pretty small footprint.Both the zoom and focus adjustments are touchy (very little movement makes a big change), but these both can be locked in once the desired setting is achieved. There is also an aperture adjustment. The cameras work well together in the OBS software along with a standard webcam and a video capture card (which captures video from a camcorder).The white balance looks slightly different between the three cameras I purchased, but I was able to adjust this in the OBS software.Overall, very pleased with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This is actually kind of a neat little camera.The first thing I noticed what that it has some \"heft\" to it. It doesn't feel like a cheapie webcam with a lightweight plastic or tiny sliver-of-glass lens. This thing has a real lens and a solid metal case. The lens is interchangeable too, so if you want to get a different field of view, you should be able to find a replacement.It has manual zoom, manual focus and manual aperture. It's \"varifocal\", which means as you zoom, the focus will go out and you will need to readjust. Don't expect to use it as a quick-zoom hand held camera. It is intended to be mounted permanently and just use the zoom to set the frame. Once you get it set the way you want it, the zoom and focus can be locked in place with the screw knobs.What I didn't expect was the range of focus. This thing can essentially function as a macro, with the focusing down to less than an inch (description claims 5mm) when zoomed out and less than a foot at it's longest zoom. This allows for a field of view as little as 1-2\" across. Neat if you wanted to use it to do some extreme close-up shots.It comes with quite a long cord, which for this type of camera is good. I have it attached to a monitor which is mounted up near the ceiling quite a ways away from the computer it is plugged in to. There is ample cord to get there. I didn't measure, but it has to be at least 10' long, maybe more.It has two standard 1/4x20 threaded holes - one in the top and one in the bottom. The curious thing though is that it comes with a package of screws and plastic wall anchors, but no mounting bracket of any kind. It seems like there should be some sort of bracket, but the box doesn't seem big enough to even fit one so it's a little bizarre that they include screws. Fortunately I have a pile of miscellaneous GoPro parts laying around so I ended up using a 1/4x20 to GoPro adapter and a standard GoPro stick-on mount.Note: There is an allen key for removing the lens in the package with the screws so don't just throw it away!The image quality is decent enough for something in this class. Nothing to write home about, but much better than the cheapie cameras of a few years ago. The adjustable aperture lets you tailor to the environment you are in.I think the best application for this kind of camera is probably for video conferencing where you want to set up multiple cameras each pointing to a specific seat around a table. This is where the zoom and relatively long focal length comes in handy. You can mount it on a wall across the room and zoom in on a particular seat.All in all a decent little camera for the money.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the version of the camera with the OV2710 sensor and 5-50mm varifocal lens.Using 64bit Windows 7 Pro, with no special drivers, you can plug this camera into a USB port and \"it just works\". However, if you fire up Zoom, Discord, or Microsoft Teams and look at the live camera image, you may be disappointed. Low resolution and terribly underexposed (dark) even with the lens aperture all the way open.The camera is capable of much better performance, and fortunately, there's an easy fix if you have this disappointing experience. Get a copy of the free OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) application. Start it running, create a scene and use this camera as the video input. Then create a virtual camera in OBS. In Zoom, Discord, etc., select the OBS virtual camera. Wow! Higher resolution, wider frame format, and proper exposure.I am not expert on USB video protocols, but I believe the camera is coming up in a default \"works with anything\" mode, and the typical videochat app doesn't know how to command the camera into its more capable modes. OBS does whatever is needed to get a nice image out of the camera. In other operating systems, or more recent versions of Windows, it's possible that this is handled by the OS. But if you're stuck with Win7, there's this easy and free way to get nice video from this camera.",
