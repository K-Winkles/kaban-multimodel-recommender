                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a sliding camera cover in order to enhance my privacy while using my device's camera. While the product does an adequate job in fulfilling its intended purpose, I must say that I was rather disappointed with its overall quality.The sliding camera cover is made of two flimsy plastic pieces with sticky tape on the back. The simplicity of its design is both a strength and a weakness. On the positive side, it's easy to install and use, simply sliding to cover and uncover the camera. However, the materials used are noticeably cheap, and I'm uncertain about their long-term durability.In terms of functionality, the camera cover effectively blocks the camera's view, ensuring privacy when desired. It does what it's supposed to do, albeit without any additional features or improvements. If you're seeking a basic solution for camera privacy, this product will suffice.One aspect that stood out positively was the seller's service. They were responsive and helpful throughout the purchasing process, with no issues encountered. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised by the speedy delivery of the product, which arrived earlier than expected.Overall, while the sliding camera cover serves its purpose adequately, it falls short in terms of build quality. If you're looking for a more durable and high-quality solution, it may be worth exploring other options on the market. Nonetheless, if you're on a tight budget or prefer a simple and fuss-free privacy solution, this product could be a viable choice.",

The price is very low for these - I get it but they are basically useless so take that for what it\u2019s worth (nothing).I was given a similar product for free at a trade show as swag from a tech company and that one worked great. I had it in a laptop that I no longer use but it goes to show that some companies are making decent versions of this design. Just not this company. Save your money and look for an alternative. That\u2019s my two cents.",
