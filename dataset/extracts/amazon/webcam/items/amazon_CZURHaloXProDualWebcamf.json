It has two cameras that can work separately and point in different directions, which is something I haven't seen in a webcam before. It is very easy to set up and use, as it does not require any driver installation or app. It just plugs into my PC's USB port and works. The video resolution is 1080p, which is clear and sharp. The microphone is also decent and picks up my voice well. The webcam also has some cool features including picture-in-picture. The webcam also comes with a long USB cable that gives me more flexibility in positioning it. The design of the webcam is sleek and compact, and it does not take up much space on my desk. It also has a privacy cover, which is handy and gives me extra peace of mind. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a webcam.",

It was much better than most of the other 67 participant\u2019s images.It took a while to set up, but eventually my previous experience won out. The instructions are limited. (I do not find video setup presentations to be worthwhile.)My biggest issue was the mistaken assumption that it would work with macOS. This is still unclear, since virtually every current webcam is supported on macOS.After a mad scramble to find a Windows laptop at the last minute, the setup was successful.I recommend this item for you if you are using only Windows.",

                "reviewText": "This dual webcam is great for setting up two different settings for your video meetings. I like to keep toggling depending if I am standing or sitting. Both works good and easy switching. The quality for both cams is consistent. It also looks sleek and clean. I liked the way it kinda blended with my monitors and keyboard. I would surely recommend anyone looking to add better camera for their home office.",
