                "reviewText": "<i>\"Anything that links to the Internet can be compromised. Modern computer security isn't about keeping people out. It's about detecting them quickly once they get in.\"</i>I'm fully aware that as I am writing this review, the tiny inconspicuous camera at the top of my laptop is staring right at me. The camera is always off. (At least I think it is.) With today's technology, any person anywhere in the world can turn on my webcam and enter my life, and I wouldn't even know it. It's a scary thought, and it just goes to show, it doesn't matter how careful you try to be on the internet, there are always ways around your protection. I will continue to be amazed and baffled by the amount of personal information people put online. Especially after reading this book.I have come to expect the macabre, twisted psychopaths that Kilborn dreams up. And The Snipper killer is defiantly up there with his most colourful creations. You're probably wondering why this maniac is called The Snipper. It's because this maniac has an affinity for eyelids. Or lack there of. With bodies stacked to the ceiling - or stuffed into barrels - and fear mounting in the city of Chicago, lovelorn homicide detective Tom Mankowski and his partner Roy are on the case. That is if their girlfriends aren't busy whinging about their long hours and moaning about the lack of alone time. Honestly, I was rooting for those two to be killed. Especially Joan, she had it coming.The killer is targeting webcam models. Specifically girls named Kendal. Not their screen names. Their real names. Again with the frightening Skynet style computer hacking, The Snipper worms his way into each girls life and gets knife-happy. The girls deserve Penance. They are sinners. And the only way to atone for their sins is through pain. Sorority girl Kendal Smith is next on The Snipper's list, but with her paranoid delusions and OCD counting habits, she doesn't know if she's in danger of a killer or of losing her mind.This is a thrill ride from start to finish. I can't tell you how much I've missed the gore-fest that is a Kilborn novel. And with an open (terrifying) ending, the door is open to more Snipper fun. Because there are so many more sinners in the world. All waiting for Penance.By the way, I have covered my webcam with masking tape so if any crazy killers have any ideas, find another hobby.",

                "reviewText": "If you've read Kilborn's other works namely \"The List\", then you'll be familiar with the main protagonist here. Tom Mankowski is back and investigating the mysterious deaths of webcam models, ones particularly named Kendall. Each victim is tortured and mutilated and it's up to our favorite detective to solve the case.The book is full for suspense and mystery. It had me guessing who the real killer is and I love the plot twist in the end. Each page is a turner, and the more they get closer to solve the mystery, the more they get setbacks. I also liked it how the author gave insight in Tom's relationship with his partner and how they try to keep their relationship going despite the challenges they face due to Tom's job. Full of sick and twisted imagery, this book is a must for Kilborn fans.I gave it a four star because while it's creepy and scary, it didn't get me at the same level as his other books. I also highly recommend \"Afraid\" and \"Endurance\" to read to experience the horror this author can write.",

The killer is targeting women named Kendal, and anyone else who gets in the way is fair game too. The body count rises.

There is a brief tie-in with Joe Konrath's (aka Jack Kilborn) recent novel Rum Runner and with Ann Voss Peterson's recent novella Watched Too Long, but knowing their stories is not necessary to enjoy WEBCAM.",
