The clamp could be much better though since it just relies on leaning against the back of your monitor as opposed to actually gripping on, so it will fall off if bumped. The ability to turn the camera off with the flip lid is also great for added security.The image and mic are both clear and I have had no issue so far.When you preview your image it will only show your image as mirrored and there is no way to change that view however, when you are actually using it, your image is not mirrored.Lastly, the booklet doesn't tell you, and it is actually quite hard to find, that Logitunes is the Logitech program that is compatible with the Brio 300 if you want to sync it to your email or calendar and even then it can only be connected to Outlook. However, that isn't a feature that seems necessary.",

                "reviewText": "Technical folks might appreciate this detail.I own many Logitech peripherals and will continue to buy them. This Brio 301, like all the others, is well-designed, well-made, and works great, \"plug & play\" out of the box. It's just overpriced IMHO. I have some $20 generic 1080p cameras that produce an equal or better image.I needed a USB 3.0 camera and did not want to pay 2x for the Brio 4k. At the time of this review, there really only a handful of true USB 3.0 cameras out there, and the Brio 4k is actually one of the cheaper ones.The need came from the traffic on my Thunderbolt-3 Dock. I have repeated this test on Dell & Lenovo docks, and suspect it would recur on the others. A lot of dock traffic goes back to the computer on the USB 2.0 lanes--not just your keyboard & mouse. Most folks don't notice a performance degradation because it usually handles it pretty well. However, add a HD video stream to the traffic (any make/model HD webcam) and eventually the video stream becomes unstable. If I switch to a USB 3.0 camera like the Brio 4k or Dell UltraSharp 4k going into the dock, I get a crisp 4k image with no freezing or dropped frames because there's more than enough room on the USB 3.0 lanes back to the computer.Plug this Brio 301 into a root USB 3.x port on your computer and run USB Tree Viewer. You will see it is not a USB 3.0 device. The Type-C plug is just a plug, and while it does have much higher power & speed capabilities, few peripherals that use the plug actually use the USB 3.x speed. To be fair, outside of storage and video devices, they really don't need to and that keeps prices down. 1080p cameras generally perform just fine on the USB 2.0 bus, and the Brio 301 is no exception.I was hoping this would be the first true USB 3.0 1080p webcam for under $100, but I was let down. Logitech's description and answers to questions here should be corrected.",

J'aurais normalement pris la Logitech Brio 500 (disponible en rose \u00e9galement) pour son profil un peu plus petit, mais la brio 300 \u00e9tait en sp\u00e9cial et la dimension de la cam\u00e9ra ne justifiait pas les 70$ suppl\u00e9mentaires pour la brio 500) Tr\u00e8s bon achat!",
