                "reviewText": "I've been making Youtube videos for a while now using an old Logitech C920 I picked up for $60 a few years back. Wanting to upgrade, I checked out a ton of reviews and found this webcam. Not disappointed.The resolution difference is astounding. Not only is it so sharp you can see the car hair on my shirt (great), the wide lens is covering twice as much area while doing it. The color and shading is also better than my old cam, although I can't quite get it to look ideal. Some reviews complained about the color quality, which is maybe not totally unfounded.It's a solidly built little sucker, part hard plastic, part metal. Probably the single most \"duh\" thing about its design is that the head itself rocks around on a ball joint to allow you to fine tune the camera's position, a feature missing from most even quality webcams. It also has a detachable USB-C cable which allows you to swap out a longer cable if needed. A lot of subtle decisions were made here that suggest they really thought it all through.There are some limits and downsides. It produces heat when in use, maybe a little less than an old 40W incandescent bulb, which is bizarre. It's thirsty for light too, which is where the bulk of the complaints come from. Slap this thing on your PC in your dimly lit WoW man cave and it's going to look grainy. For me, I'm using it in a studio lighting situation with softboxes so it's zero issue. There's also no zoom whatsoever, which means if you want to change shot you have to physically move the entire unit, nor is there any ability to manually focus things. You get one fixed focus, no frills.Basically, this thing fills a very specific niche highly effectively. You want a wide angle, high detail, stationary webcam in a well lit area and you don't need a lot of fancy zooms and options, you've found what you want at a price that is very cheap for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very high quality webcam that gets about as close as you can get to a DSLR while still having the simplicity and affordability of a webcam. Some early negative reviews were due to the fact that the early firmware in this camera required studio lighting to get a good quality picture. Recent firmware updates have dramatically improved camera performance in more typical lighting conditions although lighting can significantly improve picture quality like is the case for all cameras. I purchased this to run on my Linux system running PopOS 20.10, a derivative of Ubuntu. While you'll want access to Windows or MacOS to run the firmware update utility since the recent firmware updates profoundly improve the camera's performance and picture quality, the camera works flawlessly in Linux and is plug and play with no driver installation or special setup required. I would highly recommend this camera for people wanting a webcam capable of top tier image quality. I had also considered the logitech brio and the razor kiyo pro. While I haven't tried these other options, from what I gather reading and watching reviews, this camera is sharper and crisper than the brio although the brio has better color accuracy so consider which is better for your use case. The kiyo pro provides the best performance in lower lighting conditions. Additionally the kiyo pro reports a slightly wider viewing angle but suffers from a fisheye effect making rhe AVerMedia more desirable at a wide field of view. The AVerMedia does not have autofocus, which makes for a better experience for presenting so long as you're staying a normal distance from the camera. The logitech autofocus performs reasonably well although any autofocus can be annoying for typical use cases. The Kiyo Pro has terrible autofocus at time of release, but it can be disabled. The microphone quality on all of these seems reasonable, but I don't see the point of putting a microphone in a high-end webcam. I can't imagine that anyone would spend over $100 on a webcam and not use an external microphone.",

                "reviewText": "I've never had a webcam before, so I chose the PW513 as my first one seeing how it was being touted as the best product for the price. My first impression of the PW513 was not great. The quality out of the box was awful, but I sort of knew it needed to be fine tuned to get the best image. It took me hours to adjust and learn what some of the settings CamEngine (AVerMedia's webcam software) did to get a great image quality. After the latest drivers are installed, and the webcam is properly configured based on your environment/skin tone, and most importantly, provide proper lighting, you will get an immense improvement over stock settings and come out with outstanding image quality (enough to justify its price tag). I recommend this to anyone who's able to sit down and willing to go through the process of fine tuning the webcam. I should note, like any camera/webcam, the picture quality will be grainy and look terrible if you do not have PROPER LIGHTING regardless of any amount of tweaking you do. I think many of the negative reviews stem from not having adequate lighting, but if you do, then you'll be able to enjoy what the PW513 has to offer.",

The CamEngine software works great for fine tuning image and the virtual cam is awesome for Zoom calls, Streaming and video recording. I was looking at this vs. another major brand with a higher end webcam with a \"920\" in the name, glad I went with the AverMedia 513 instead! Yes, you will be better served by having some external light sources as it does make a big difference in image quality, but that is not the fault of the camera, just the price of raising your game.",
