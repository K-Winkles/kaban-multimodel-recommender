                "reviewText": "I bought this camera to upgrade the one I bought last year that I though worked good. However the dual microphones on this model are super sensitive and voice recognition is insanely accurate even when I whisper. The wide view for video conferencing is amazing. The only thing I miss from my old model is the green light to show when the camera is active. The built-in ring light works like a touch lamp. It has 4 settings not 3 as described. OFF, low, medium, and high. I was worried the light would always stay on but that isn't the case. The swivel is a huge upgrade from my last camera. It also has 360 degrees of motion and can tilt left, right, up, down, and whatever angle you need to show other things in the room without lifting the camera off the the stand. Highly recommend this product as it is a great value.",

This thing is exactly what you pay for. 4K my butt. I'm a professional photographer and videographer, so I promise you I know what I'm talking about and this \"webcam\" is all wonky. The focal length is very odd. When you sit at a normal distance from your computer (15-20\"), you are too cropped in the frame and out of focus. But what IS in focus is whatever is 2 feet behind you. Tried it in both Zoom and Teams and the quality is awful. Returning this immediately. Will it do if all you care about is someone seeing you out-of-focus on a video call? Yes. But if you get even slightly annoyed by out-of-focus video, this thing will drive you crazy. Don't buy this. You get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "It's fine for a cheap camera. It is a fixed focus camera, however, so understand what that means. For me, this means I cannot use it to take proctored exams for online classes because it cannot focus on my ID to verify my identification. Anything that is closer than about 3 feet will be blurry. The fixed focus actually seems optimized for things even farther away, about 6+ feet. Not good for most web applications.",
