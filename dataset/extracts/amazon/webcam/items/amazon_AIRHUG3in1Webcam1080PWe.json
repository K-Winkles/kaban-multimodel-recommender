                "reviewText": "This Airhug camera has practically everything you need for a video call. As most cameras come with only a microphone, this one comes with a speaker too, making it a complete package for a video call. Having said that, this speaker makes it a bigger package than I have expected. It definitely has a presence on the desk which I like less. It also comes with a little tripod as a second option to the monitor mount flap.It looks like the intention behind the design was a compact traveling kit, which I kinda don't get since if you are traveling you are with a laptop that has everything built-in already.The quality for all feature is very good.The privacy shutter is a great addition.Over all, it's a good product, just a little big.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this portable communications/video conferencing solution from AIRHUG. It is lightweight and compact but well made. I often see camera/microphone combinations, but rarely do I see an embedded speaker as well. This device produced great quality pictures and sound. The microphone also picked up sound well without any distortion. It has a built-in privacy cover, and it comes with a handy, two-piece tripod. It connects via USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C adapter cables both of which are included. The whole system including, camera, tripod, and cables, fits easily into the included carrying bag. This is the type of technology I would depend on and use frequently as a travelling professional. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This works great! I am pleasantly surprised due to it being an \"off-brand\". The camera quality was fairly nice. Don't get me wrong, it's not like crystal clear, but there are not many webcams that are crystal clear. It is very good quality when meeting with people online. It is as clear as any other webcam I have used. i like the \"mute\" feature where you can slide a cover over the camera lens for added confidence and security. The speaker works well too. I had no trouble hearing the person on the other side. Setting up is very simple. Once I plugged it into a USB slot, my computer immediately recognized it and I was able to use it right away in my meeting software. Also, it basically sits on top of my monitor and is supported by an adjustable flap on the back. It doesn't actually grip onto the monitor as I thought it would, but it rather uses the flap to fight against gravity and keep the camera from tipping off, if that makes sense. You also have the option to place it on the desk or wherever. You can also place it vertically if needed. It's very versatile. It also comes with a mini tripod which is a nice feature/option. I think this competes with the name brands on the market.",
