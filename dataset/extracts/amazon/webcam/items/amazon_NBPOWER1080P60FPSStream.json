The image is clear, the light is a nice feature, and it's super easy to setup. It's very affordable compared to the logitech of the same specs and really I see no reason spending more than double to get the same performance. I think this works well for entry level streaming and content creation and would be even better for office/teams video chatting. Small disclaimer if my streaming does take off I will upgrade to a Sony mirror less camera but this does great for now.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hear me out. Not near the qualily it claims but its not that bad.Let me start out with it is false advertising. On the box it states 60fps at 1080p. It is no where near it and reeks of china knock off. It does shoot in 1920x1080 as claimes however is unbearably slow at 15fps causing anything in the videos to have trails and streaks, its absolutly no where near 60 even on a good day. The video also comes out extremely bright so well lit rooms are a no go, mild to low lit rooms work best. I mean all in all you get what you get for the price, its not horrendous and will work however if you online game streaming or live selling or anything where the 60 fps and good quality is needed then this isnt the camera keep going. For video calls, zooms, and meetings, amateur streaming, basic videos, ect, it will be just fine except the brightness issue. I will be returning mine and buying a different one worth my money because i need quality video over fancy lights, which by the way. The rgb lights are random, do not sync, and have no contols, and the from facing lights have 2 brightness with an off switch and it illuminates the video well and looks good.3 stars because it still works well, easy to set up, decent quality besides the frame rate, and will work for most people and their needs.",
