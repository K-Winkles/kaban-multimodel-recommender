                "reviewText": "It today's world with so many of us working remotely, it is important to have a good reliable camera for those meetings. I was tired of setting up lights every time I had a zoom meeting so I decided to try this camera with a built in ring light. I was glad I did. The camera performs perfectly and with the ring light, I no longer have to fiddle with multiple devices when it is time for a meeting. The picture quality is amazing as well. Far superior to the built in camera on my laptop. The remote is a handy device for adjusting zoom etc without reaching. All in all, a great device. It has a built in mike, which I have not needed to use as I use a wireless mike during my meetings, but if it is of the same quality as the rest of the camera I am certain it works great. There are cheaper cameras you can buy, but this one ticks all the boxes and is worth a little extra",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent camera for the price-point, but there are two, possibly three, improvements that need to be made.1. Privacy shutter is hard to see.There is a tiny slider switch on the camera itself that you can move in order to engage the privacy cover. This switch, and the privacy cover itself, are difficult to see. This makes it hard to tell if the privacy shutter is covering the lens or not.I think they should paint the switch and the cover (or even just the cover) a much lighter color in order to let you easily tell whether it is engaged or not. It's a small change, but would greatly improve the camera.2. The ring light switch lacks a stopper. You rotate it and it goes from off to dim to fully lit to off to dim...etc... This means that if you are trying to turn the light off, you can't really tell if you've turned it off or just dimmed it. It also means if you try to turn it off, you are very likely to rotate past off and into fully bright light blasting you in the face when you least expect it.There should be a full stopper or even just something that provides tactile feedback letting you know the light is off. It's another small change, but would really improve the product3. Autofocus. Don't get me wrong, the autofocus works decently, but depending on the room lighting, it may constantly refocus. I found I have to have a decent amount of room lighting and not just the camera's ring light, in order to avoid it continuously refocusing.Those are just my three suggestions on how this product could be easily improved (well, the first two at least).Don't get me wrong though. It's a good camera for the price. You get a built-in light that is dimmable (with a lot of flexibility and not just two or three stages of dimming). You also get a remote that will allow you to zoom in. The remote even lets you temporarily shut off the video, sort of like a software privacy shutter that resets whenever you restart your recording/web conf session.",

I HAD TO GET AN USB EXTENSION TO WORK FOR MY DESKTOP WHICH WAS HARD TO FIND LOCALLY (WLAMART DOES NOT CARRY THEM ANYMORE). I TESTED THE DEVICE WITH 2 PEOPLE. ONE WAS LOCALLY AND ONE ACROSS COUNTRY. BOTH THE VIDEO AND AUDIO WAS HIGH QUALITY PER THE RECIPIENTS. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE AUDIO SINCE THE SOUND GRAPH IN THE DEVICES AND PRINTERS IN THE CONTROL PANEL ONLY SHOWED ONE BAR ON THE GRAPH WHEN I WAS TESTING THE DEVICE. BOTH OF MY RECIPIENTS SAID THE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE AND CLEAR. THE CAM IS MOUNTED ON MY MONITOR WHICH IS ABOUT 24\" FROM WHERE I SIT AT MY DESK. THE REMOTE WORKS FOR ALL FUNCTONS. NOTE THAT YOU DO NEED TO REMOVE THE BATTERY COVER AND BATTERY TO REMOVE THE PLASTIC PEICE TO ACTIVATE THE BATTERY FOR THE REMOTE. I WILL REPORT IF I HAVE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER, IT WORKS ON DEMAND WITH MST VIDEO CONFERENCING. THIS IS ON A PC NOT A MAC. IT'S A LITTLE PRICIER THAN A LOT OF OTHER CAMS BUT A LOT MORE FUNTIONS. THE LIGHT SETTING IS MANUAL BUT OKAY ONCE SET WHERE YOU LIKE IT. THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THE DEVICE OFF ACCEPT THROUGH DISABLING IN THE CONTROL PANEL, DISCONNECTING THE USB OR TURNING OFF THE COMPUTER. THE LENS SHEILD IS MANUAL AS WELL. IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS AN ON/OFF SWITCH AT THE DEVICE. IN SPITE OF THIS, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS CAM SO FAR.",

The software program that comes with it is hard to figure out and it must be activated, which is stupid and a hassle. Also, the software program is pretty lame and you can't edit your videos or pictures. Actually, the only good features of this camera is the built in light and being able to change the field of view. Shop around. I'm sure you can get a better deal than this. I'm going to keep it, but I regret buying this particular camera. The main issue is the poor software.",
