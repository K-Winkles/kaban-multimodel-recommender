The picture quality is great, I've gotten multiple comments from co-workers that they could tell right away that I had a new camera and that the picture was great. Maybe a little too clear for some days :)Very easy to use. I like the open/close feature so that I can ensure that it is turned off when I don't want to be on-camera. Also, the indicator light on top that is on when the camera is turned on is very helpful.The rubber grips on the top and side also make this easy to reposition to make sure you get just the right angle.Very happy with this camera overall. We actually have 2 of them, one for my husband's computer as well.",

I\u2019m so paranoid and it\u2019s not as hard as you think for people to get back door access to your camera when you don\u2019t realize it.Anyway, admittedly the picture quality of the camera itself in full screen isn\u2019t the absolute best but for the price it\u2019s pretty darn good.As a VTuber, I use a lot of face-tracking software to make my avatar come to life. Every camera gives me occasional issues with tracking software and I figured it was just normal, because of the software, or because I have darker shin. NOPE. I started using the Poly cam which is less pricey than my other cameras and and the tracking is impeccable. I never lose tracking unless I\u2019m in a really weird position & I can leave them come back and resume perfect tracking.",

                "reviewText": "I had to replace a webcam I purchased only a few months ago because it died. After reading several reviews (and asking my very knowledgeable son-in-law), I decided to buy the Poly Studio P5 and spend a little more than I had figured. It was well worth the extra few dollars! The camera was simple to install (with one exception; read on below). Downloading the Poly software from the website was easy, and the camera was working fine within a few minutes. The image is sharp, and the auto-adjust works quite well in bright, dim, and in-between lighting. If you're not using a green screen, you can eliminate background items you don't want on the video by using the zoom feature to crop the image. I've been told by those with whom I've used the webcam that the built-in microphone is also quite good and my voice was clear and easily understood. Three additional nice touches are the built-in privacy shutter, the hidden USB port at the bottom rear of the camera (under the removable shell), and the magnetic latching system which allows you to remove the camera from the mount if you need to show something specific.I would have given the Poly Studio P5 a five-star rating except for one thing: the length of the USB cable, which is all of 1.3 meters/4 feet 3 inches. Most webcams have a USB cable of 5 feet, and the 9 inches difference made the cable too short to reach my computer tower. While Poly does not recommend using an extension, the half-meter extension cable which I had was just the right length and works perfectly.Other than this one \"shortcoming,\" I would recommend this camera without any reservations!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new camera with mic for infrequent but quite extended Zoom presentations. Hence why I did not want to make a huge investment as my laptop camera and mic frequently encountered problems especially when I needed to be connected for an extended time. I found this camera to be extremely easy to setup and use. The picture quality and sound quality was very good. My audience also thought the picture and sound were very good. It was super easy to adjust all aspects of the picture quality as well as adjust the camera on either the top of a laptop screen or separate monitor. I used mine on the top of a 28 in monitor. I loved that the camera did not clip tight on the top of the monitor as during the presentations it was necessary for me to move the camera from the top of the monitor to highlight smaller items I needed to show the audience. The camera comes equipped with a way to cover the lens when not in use. Since I will use this infrequently, I can quickly take on and off as needed. It plugs in via a USB port. Those who may need to keep it attached to their monitors may find it may move around if you move your computer equipment around since it does not clip tightly. That was the only downside I saw from my \"I just need a better camera\" scenario.",

The Poly Studio P5 Professional Webcam picture quality is CRISP and a huge difference from my built-in computer webcam (which is slightly grainy). It is so simple to set up, as shown in my review video. Also, I love that the camera itself has a cover for people who prize their privacy when they aren't in a Zoom meeting or on a Skype date. WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!!!",
