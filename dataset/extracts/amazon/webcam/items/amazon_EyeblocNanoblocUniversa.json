This for the bill. You can see how thin it is in the photo. Neither my iPad nor my MacBook use face recognition so I pretty much leave it on all the time. I didn\u2019t put it on my iPhone 12 because I do use face recognition there and I was concerned that it might come off from sliding it into my purse or pocket.It doesn\u2019t have adhesive but it\u2019s made from a special material that feels like a very fine knit fabric and it somehow \u201csticks\u201d to the screen surface almost with a suction like mechanism. But it\u2019s easy to remove. And as instructions say, if it stops sticking simply rinse it off and that renews the technology.I chose the camp design because I wanted something I could see to remind me it\u2019s there if I was going to do FaceTime or a Zoom call. But they have several designs and solid colors.",

These, on the other hand, are much narrower and fit perfectly. In fact, you could trim them down with a scissors if you wanted to. These are also a perfect fit for apple products like the iPad. They don't slide, you have to remove them and stick them to the side then put them back when done using the camera. However, the \"nano\" suction cups work very well and they seem to maintain their stickiness. Instructions say to simply wash them if they start losing suction. I have these on 2 devices right now and plan on using them on more.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars My worst purchase of 2021",
                "reviewText": "I bought this product because I was fascinated by the product description that this sticker can be trimmed as I want and can be easily reused when it loses its stickiness.But this description is half right and half wrong. It can be trimmed, but one side is a material similar to double-sided tape, and the other side is a something like soft cloth. One side is sticky and the other side is mushy. Trimming was not easy.I wasted two stickers to make a small dot to cover the front camera of the iPad, and after that, the stickiness of the sticker disappeared in the process of making it. So I washed it with water and dried it as described, but the original stickiness won\u2019t come back, and only small enough stickiness remained to barely stick to the screen.So, I tried using a different unused sticker to do the same experiment, but the result was same. Once it loses its adhesion (most likely happened when you remove it from the screen once), original stickness strength does not come back even though you wash & dry it. I would say only 50% of original stickness comes back.I spent some effort to make the dot sticker which perfectly fits on my camera, but it became useless since it lost adhenshion. It fell off so easily. Then I had to trim double-sided tape and attached on the other side to use it.It seems like I ended up blocking the camera by using trimmed double-sided tape. I can't return this product because I've already used 2 stickers, but for those of you who haven't ordered this item or just placed an order, there's still a chance. Do not waste $10. Just get the double-sided tape that works better.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s amazing that such a tiny item of very little material and weighs virtually nothing, is priced as high as it is. If I saw this item in the store priced at $10, I would not purchase it. I could have purchased a foam sheet at Dollar tree and cut out these tiny little shapes and stuck them on with adhesive dots.Update: been using for several days now; it works great. I\u2019m happy with this purchase and feel that the price I paid for it, was definitely worth it! Changing my rating from three to five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I love the soft touch and easy placement. I went to use my camera and forgot where I put it only to find that I left it right next to the lens and it came off with ease. I used it again and tested the adhesive to see if it left any residue or lost it\u2019s sticker like backing and it\u2019s holding on like a champ. Will update if it comes off in the next few months. I am using this product in my iPad mini front and back camera as well as my iPhone XR (old I know) but it still works and it fit so well. Just have to center the long camera blocker so it doesn\u2019t cover up facial recognition option on phone otherwise it covers the front facing camera \ud83d\udc4cUpdate:This is not reliable on front facing hand held phone cameras. But it does work well on the rear facing lenses. It adheres better with heat from finger to prevent it from falling off when taking it off and on multiple times.",
