Why: To keep the camera cover overall thickness at 0.03 in without affecting the closing of the laptop, it is necessary to optimize the connection groove between the slide cover and the base. If the groove is too deep, the sliding cover is not easy to separate or remove, but the overall thickness will increase. So: If the sliding cover is accidentally separated during installation,you don't worry, you can easily install it back. Notice; 1. Be sure to keep the screen clean when installing.2. Do not peel and stick repeatedly, it will reduce the stickiness of the tape.3. Gently press for 10 seconds, the paste is firmer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pack to install on our laptop computers for camera privacy / security. They were very inexpensive and they cover the camera so that no image is shown (completely black). The problem I have had is that they are so thin that it is sometimes hard to slide the cover easily. The other problem I had was that it is very sticky and tough to line up with the camera, so I think i may have placed too close to the focusing lens and my camera often appears slightly blurry. I think this is likely user-error, however it would be nice if there were instructions or some sort of template to help you apply it accurately and level.",
