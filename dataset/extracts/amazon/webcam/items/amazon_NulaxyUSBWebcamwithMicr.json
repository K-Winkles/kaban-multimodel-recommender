                "reviewText": "I wanted to replace my aging Logitech Orbit MP, as the resolution on the Logitech wasn't cutting it anymore. I felt I could compromise on some of the features of the Logitech such as motorized zoom, pan, tilt, and tracking since we usually stay stationary during a video call and I didn't want to break the bank.Installation was as simple as plugging it into the computer. Picture quality was generally good and it was a definitely an upgrade in resolution from my old Logitech. I never had an issue with audio. The built in privacy cover was a plus and the LEDs that light up when it is in use is also helpful. Overall, for the price, it's a good webcam that I'd be happy to purchase again.Few notes: This is a wide angle webcam. It's great for skype with the whole family. It's fine for just one person so it captures pretty wide, but with the background replacement functionality, it works well enough. There is no internal hardware zoom. It swivels left and right, but there is no tilt up and down. You can adjust the tilt by hand and it stays pretty well on my monitor, but I would have liked to have it tilt up and down (with the clip staying stationary) versus messing with the clip that holds the camera to the monitor. The webcam stays put on my monitor, but it's not the most positive feel. It will move if you bump it. But, because of how I'm using it, I felt these were all things I could live with, especially for the price point. Also, many of the webcams in this price range have the same \"features\" i.e. no tilt, similar clip, etc. My expectations for a webcam in this price range were met or exceeded.",

                "reviewText": "Like many of us, I have been working from home for almost a year now and I'm making enhancements here and there to improve my WFH experience!I use a Macbook Air. I often like to just use my big monitor and close my Macbook, which is called \"clamshell mode.\" However, when I'm just using my monitor, I no longer have a webcam! I unfortunately need a camera for Zoom calls where I need to turn on video. Thus, I found this webcam to attach to my monitor! Now I can continue to enjoy using my monitor and not have to worry about opening my laptop just for the webcam.The camera quality is good. The camera is a wide angle lens and it's adjustable, which is nice! I have mine just perched on top of the monitor. And it's very easy to just literally plug and play! For programs like Zoom, you just need to select the new camera as your video output under the video settings. I also really like the sliding cover so I don't feeling like I'm being watch by the man when I am not on calls!Finally, the mic is handy as well. It is also easy to switch to the camera as your audio setting as well.For a great price, you can get this great camera and enhance your WFH experience!",

                "reviewText": "This is a very decent camera, but there are two things I dislike.First, the color is sometimes whited out. As mentioned in other reviews there is no native software for this thing. Any control of the picture quality is dependent on the program the camera is being used by. With Skype, there are changeable settings for the camera, but none of those got rid of the whiting out I experienced. Adjusting the brightness either made everything too dark or my skin and other lighter colors too white. None of the other settings helped, either.Secondly, I don't like the focus/field of view. With this camera I can see myself, along with 15' of my back wall and everything else back there. That is, the field of view is too big. This is with the camera 2' from my face. If you look at other users' pics you'll see what I'm talking about. That might be nice if you're trying to get the whole family in on the session, but if it's just you this camera doesn't seem ideal. I just turned it back on and moved closer to see what happened: with my face 16\" away I filled 1/3 of the screen, but the other 2/3 on either side was quite visible and actually in proper focus, unlike my face. 2' away seems to be where the focus starts to sharpen, but then I'm only filling about 1/4 of the screen.I will say I do like the mounting clip, it works perfectly on top of my monitor. I also like the privacy shutter, but I just unplug my camera when not in use.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first webcam purchase and I am amazed at how small and lightweight the unit and camera are and how securely it sits on the monitor. The USB cord is a generous 4\u2019 10\u201d in length and is an easy reach from the computer tower to my monitor. The installation instructions were very clear and made it easy to plug into the computer USB port and position the camera on my monitor.I am amazed that it is just plug the camera into into a USB port, access a teleconference site and I was ready to go. Very easy. All of the people that I have been conferencing with have commented on the outstanding picture and sound quality. After tinkering with the camera stand and mount, I was able to adjust the angle and rotation so I was perfectly positioned in the picture. The camera cover is a great feature that provides some peace of mind that I am not being recorded when I don\u2019t want to be.After using the Nulaxy C900 Webcam in several web chats I am amazed at how easy it was to set up and the tremendous quality of the product. I wonder why I didn\u2019t purchase a webcam years ago.",

                "reviewText": "The Nulaxy C900 Webcam is a great overall webcam especially for the price. The Nulaxy C900 Webcam produces a better, sharper video for my video calls. I had to upgrade my camera as my webcam on my computer always produced blurred images. However, the Nulaxy has crisp video quality that easily surpasses my laptop\u2019s existing camera. In addition, the clip on the Nulaxy secures the camera to the top of my monitor. I have had no issues with clipping my camera to the top of laptop. In addition, its design allows it to be easily removed when I need to transport my laptop. Also, it was very easy to install. I would recommend this camera to anyone needed a new webcam.",
