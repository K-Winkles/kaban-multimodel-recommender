                "reviewText": "I was in a bind when my external camera that I use nearly all day every day just decided to die. My laptop camera wasn't going to cut it because it sits at a strange angle (ah yes, the realities of having to create a makeshift office in a guest room lol). This camera just worked as soon as I plugged it in and I didn't have to do much of anything to it. It anchored on my monitor just as well as my other camera, had a long cable which was very helpful, and did what it should. It's also pretty compact if you need to move it or take it with you somewhere.I use headphones when on calls so I didn't test out the mic. However, the picture quality was fine. Was it the absolute best ever? No, but what do you expect at this price point? Frankly, I think a slightly lower quality webcam is better these days as it hides the fact I didn't put on a full face of makeup and may have some blemishes. haha The lighting in my makeshift office changes from good to terrible throughout the day (I generally don't turn other lights on if I can avoid it) and this camera seemed to handle it with minimal issues. Any camera is going to struggle with weird shadows and overly dark areas but this one performed similar to others in that department as well.The main thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a lens cover which I wasn't a fan of. It didn't claim to so I'm not knocking it for that but that would be a great feature and pretty much make it perfect if you're looking for a basic set of features on a budget.",

The quality is horrible, the image is very pixelated, doesn't pick up accurate colors, and obscures colors and images. Either too bright or too dark, and even when focusing the image, it is not as clear as my previous camera. Sending it back.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works on Windows and Ubuntu, but product description seems inaccurate",
                "reviewText": "Works immediately after just plugging it in. Tried both Window 10 or an Ubuntu 16.x machines, no issues. For the image quality, please check the attached picture, it was taken while the camera is on top of the monitor about 2 feet in front of me. The default image size captured is 640x360. I could not find a way to adjust anything in the default camera applications. I also made video recordings, they are:- Vp8 encoded- resolution of 640x360- frame rate of 25- BT601 color range- Audio is Mono 44100, 80kb/s.I did not find any ways to make the resolution any higher, while the device description states 1080p, that should be 1920x1080, while I only get 640x360. The camera applications should be able to adjust the resolution, but the only listed value is 640x360 on my side.The audio is described as dual microphone, that seems false, it only records mono audio. I could not find a way to adjust this either.The other incorrect detail in the listing is: \"This external webcam includes a 5ft USB-A cable - uses USB-C connection\". The cable is attached to the camera, the other end is USB-A. There is absolutely noting USB-C on this device.The focus is manually adjustable, works well. All in all, this camera works better than my previous cheap webcams, the image had wide enough angle, the brightness is fine. I would be only disappointed if I was looking for a camera based on the description, as the text seems to be inaccurate about the details.UPDATE:On Windows, I can adjust the options in the camera application to increase the resolution to up to 1080p 25 fps. Adding back the 4th star of the rating. Unfortunately, I could not find a similar solution yet for ubuntu for my team meetings.",
