The camera end has a string multidirectional swivel with a standard 1/4 inch threaded male end for attaching any camera with a threaded female mount. I use it with a Logitech streamcam to place the camera exactly where I need it to do green screen web streaming. I am a school principal and needed to shift our morning announcements to a home studio during the corona virus. This flexible camera mount Was the final piece that made the morning show work flawlessly.",

I also needed the ability to tilt from time to time and move from desk to desk as this stand was perfect...Cons: it could be a bit more stout, as the usb cord to the camera can pull it out of the perfect angle when I\u2019m recording, as I wish that the mechanism that mounts the camera to the stand could have been designed better",

When I opened the package I was surprised at the weight. My ring light is only very light, but I could see how it could accommodate something more substantial.The gooseneck is flexible, but sufficiently stiff that it holds in place comfortably and doesn't jiggle about with my movement.The clamp has a good screw mechanism - long enough to get leverage for a tight fit, but adjustable so that you can slide the lever out of the way as you turn.All in all, this is an excellent unit for the price.",
