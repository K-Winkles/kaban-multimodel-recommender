                "reviewText": "This was a replacement for my Microsoft Lifecam, which I had since about 2012. I was looking for something that would give me a crispier and clear production for my live stream podcasts. I was jealous of other YouTubers who seemed to have Hollywood Studio cameras. This little camera was definitely an upgrade over the Lifecam, but I'm still not where I want to be with quality, BUT I think this is good as I can get at this price. What I really like about the camera is that you can turn off all the lights in your office and just use the ring light and it gives your background the perfect dim, while highlighting your face perfectly. Although, the quality does look better with some light in the background. When it is completely dark, it tends to keep wanting to adjust and the coloring is inconsistent. I was unsure about its sturdiness on a Smart TV that I'm using as a monitor, but no problems. It holds great, except for those times that I kick the cord with my feet. I don't know how that's all going to end.",

But don't let the \"HD\" fool you, just because it has a high pixel resolution doesn't mean it's a high quality image. I can't think of a single streamer that would use a camera of this low quality. It's probably fine for Zoom meetings, but don't try to make a YouTube video with this thing.",

Wish it had a capability to frame the shot (zoom in and out), but other than that, I am very pleased. I did not test the microphone because I have a separate Yeti Blue so I can't speak to the mic. The light feature is a great fill light at about 20\" from camera. It supplements the room lighting very well. I have had several people ask me about my camera since I started using it, and my Pastor now has one for Streaming Worship Services each week. I continue to recommend it. Set up was very easy.",

                "reviewText": "Had this for over a year and used it only a few times.Really my only complaint is that the cord is too stiff so it gets in the way, and if you try to move it the camera will topple over. The cord needs to be more flexible so it can just dangle but it gets in the way and seems to only want to stay put in one direction.The cord, combined with the camera and mount, are altogether too heavy for the small tripod. The tripod legs are cheap plastic and weak, there's a lack of stability because there's no weight. So it can easily fall over if you move the cord or accidentally bump your desk.The camera itself is fine but quality doesn't look 1080p. I don't know what the resolution is but it doesn't take up the whole screen. The outer ring light is okay I guess but for me unnecessary because doesn't make much of a difference.The auto focus isn't the greatest. It often can't make up its mind about what to focus on unless you're stationary I guess. But doing crafts and if there's lots of movement it will go out of focus a lot and try to adjust itself. Which makes sense I guess but just be aware. And it's not like a phone you can press on the screen to focus a specific area.",

                "reviewText": "March 2, 2022 The autofocus seems to work well, but I haven't had it long enough to get feedback from others on the receiving end. I'll report back.The seller says: \"Background Replacement Please download Chromacam-2.2.1.14 on Windows. Register after installation, then you can change the background in a very simple way.\" Alas, that ONLY works if you have the hardware to support this feature, which isn't dependent on the camera but on the computer running the camera. I have a slightly older Intel i7 which doesn't meet the requirements of this feature and I have a not quite as old Intel i3 laptop which barely supports it.So, if you want background blurring or a replacement background, which I think is really neat, then first visit Zoom or Chromacam to see if your equipment meets the requirements of what is needed.Update March 16, 2022 Yesterday I was on an important Zoom call and, at first, the lighting was perfect and this was without using the ring light. Alas, the great lighting soon disappeared and it never returned notwithstanding using the ring light. So, when the seller says: \"Automatic low-light correction provide true-to-life video even in dim lighting conditions.\" take this with a grain of salt. Fortunately, I'm still within the return period, which is what I'll likely do to find a webcam with more consistent lighting.",
