                "reviewText": "The camera works the way it should. You plug it in, it makes friends with your computer, and then they work together like nice neighbors are supposed to.It is a decent camera. It will likely be an upgrade for you if you're using a Windows 10 Laptop. If you're using a Windows 11 laptop, then no, this will not be an upgrade, and I can only imagine a Windows 11 user buying it to replace their built-in camera that doesn't work any more.I do like that it is an HP product. People bash HP, but when you really think about it, if computers were gladiators, HP and Apple are always the last two left standing. Android be sittin' on the side trying to squeeze in more memory.If you don't like the sound, there are simple fixes for that.Videographers will always tell you; record your video and audio separately. There are easy programs that will sync the audio and video together from two separate sources, and it will match your audio to your video perfectly.Of course, the live, on-air version of this philosophy would be to use an external mic of decent quality, paired with this camera, using the proper lighting for what you are doing.Let us consider lighting further. You can always find a camera's magic zone with the right lighting. If you want to maximize how you look, get more than one lighting source, and move them around yourself. See which angles are most pleasing to you.You're gonna start thinking you're a cinematogropher! You'll be feeling yourself.Don't rely on a single light pointed directly at you. This makes you look flat and less dynamic (unless outdoors. Then you absolutely Need a filler light in front.).Some conference calls may call for an overhead light, some might look better with a light on either side of your face.I like a strong, bright light overhead if you want to intimidate, especially if your eye sockets are deep enough to make dramatic shadows. Only do this if you're the boss though.In general, one filler light in front, and a light on each side will do you good for pretty much anything.Stay conversational my friends.",

In my testing it was simple to use and the picture quality was great. The mics work well, but I wouldn't say this is the best sounding mic's on a webcam I've tested. They certainly would do the job for a Zoom call or something. The webcam does have a privacy shade you can use when the camera is not in operation that protects you from the camera viewing you should you ever get any \"visitors\" on your network. Most cameras don't have that, huge plus.What I didn't like:Mics could be a tab better, for general use though, this will do the jobOverall I really like this webcam, no matter the lighting it will adjust to give you the best quality. You certainly can find better cameras with even sharper picture quality and better sounding mics, but you pay a premium for that. For general use and work, this works really well and gives you good bang for your bucks. Would certainly recommend this to others!",

TL;DR; An OK Webcam that has adequate video and decent sound.Pros:- [ ] Built-in Privacy Shutter- [ ] Lengthy Cable- [ ] Works with Windows, Linux, Raspberry PiCons:- [ ] Image quality on a Raspberry Pi 4B isn't the greatest- [ ] lengthy cableThe Full ReviewFor my use case, this webcam is not the greatest. I am using it with OctoPrint to create timelapse videos and it isn't the easiest to setup with a headless configuration in Raspbian. Couple that with Windows 11's lack of HP specific software, I have had to resort to 3rd party apps to attempt setting the 430 to get the best possible image. As such, I have it configured in a generic manner at the moment and the quality is ok, but no where near as great as the advert promises.For the price point that this webcam is currently, $60 at the time of this review 4-Feb-24, it might be better to look at other options specifically for the Pi if OctoPrint/Raspbian is the intended platform of use.",

                "reviewText": "I tested this HP 430 FHD Webcam, hooked to a Windows 11 Lenovo laptop, and it worked perfectly as soon as I plugged it in. I tried it with a zoom session and the picture and sound quality were notably better than the built in webcam and mic included with the laptop.Everything is pretty much automatic, it gives a sharp focus that adjusts if I move closer or further from the camera. The physical privacy screen is a nice feature as well. Move a lever on top of the camera body to close or open the shutter.I also tried it with a 10 year old HP Elitebook laptop running Windows 10. The built in camera and microphone on that laptop are very noticeably inferior to this new external model. If you want to give a huge upgrade to the quality of a remote session with an older laptop, this camera will do it.Other features included are compatibility with Chromebooks, Google Meet as well as Microsoft Teams. This webcam earns a solid five star rating from me.",

Both have good video quality and color (the last picture is a sample from the HP 430), and very good microphones. But for a small increase in price, the Airhug includes integrated speakers, which gives it an advantage when using the device for conversations.The HP 430 is small with a good length cable, so it works well with both desktops and laptops. It folds into a fairly small size, which makes it good for traveling. The build quality feels a little better in the HP than in the Airhug, but both are good.Overall, it's very good for the price. If HP managed to fit decent speakers that eliminated echo when used on a conference call, this would be close to perfect.",
