                "reviewText": "This web cam produces extremely clear audio and video, is perfect for 1-3 people, and is plug-and-play with my MacBook.My workplace recently placed an emphasis on video conference calling given the increasing number of remote employees (of which I am one). The EyeSight camera built into my MacBook is very good, but it's placement on my desk in my home office faces a bank of windows, leading to constant contrast issues. I purchased this webcam and boom it in closer by attaching a 25 inch Flexible Jaw Long Arm Swivel Clamp Clip Mount Holder Stand for Logitech Webcam C925e C922x C922 C930e C930 C920 C615 to the back of my monitor stand and booming the camera about 10\" closer to me. I do this because I have a 34\" Dell Ultrawide monitor pretty far back on the desk and this camera has a relatively wide field of view, so having the cam be so far away was less than ideal.Video is always bright and vibrant regardless of lighting conditions. My home office can vary in lighting between \"bathed in sunlight\" and \"dimly lit speakeasy\", but the \"RightLight\" tech in the C925 does a great job of making it appear as though a pro lighting rig is in place.Audio from my computer plays through a 5.1 Yamaha home theater system, which I was worried would cause echo or feedback through the camera's stereo microphones, but unless I crank the audio to unnecessary volumes, I never have echo or feedback problems. The off-axis rejection from these mics is impressive, as my dogs have been barking elsewhere in the house and my co-workers were not able to hear them.The built-in on-air light is green and very bright. I also appreciate the built-in lens cover. Call me paranoid (I have a slide-over cover on my MacBook web cam), but I like the ability to physically block the lens.If you can swing it, the Logitech Brio is incredible. I don't think the video quality is necessarily better than this one right now, but it's a degree of future-proofed being 4K and the audio would likely be better with a large group. Otherwise, I recommend this version. It's reliable for clear audio and video",

                "reviewText": "For those looking for a setup for a laptop that is secure I would look else as the system used to stabilize this camera on the back of the monitor isn't the most stable if you are constantly adjusting your laptop or moving it. Now past that I use this for my work desktop and home desktop and constantly bring it home. The picture is great it has no problem focusing. The thing the stood out to me most was the mic on it is quite good as some of my coworkers were still able to hear even from the distance as I went to get a glass of water. While also not so sensitive as to hear air condition turning on or my old refrigerator humming not far away. Overall it works hasnt failed and made my work life alot easier. Also the camera is a little bit wider then some past webcams I have used so I am very happy overall with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using my iPad for Zoom meetings. It was clumsy and the picture was small. I asked my IT consultant if I could use my computer instead. He said all I needed was a camera. We are loyal users of Logitech products so it was easy to make a choice. This one arrived in two days and took minutes to set up. I like the slide on top that covers the lens to give me privacy and to keep the lens protected. I've used it several times and it beats my other option. The microphone works perfectly as well. My only regret is that I didn't make the purchase sooner.",
