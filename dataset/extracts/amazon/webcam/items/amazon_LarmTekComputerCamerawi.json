                "reviewText": "I have used this webcam for a number of meetings and it works great. The image quality is better than expected and very good if you have adequate lighting. The built-in microphone is ok and gets the job done well. The included tripod is a little stiff at first but works great after playing with it a bit. The included privacy shutter works great. It comes separate so you can choose to use it or not. It is easy to attach but does slightly block the power and signal LEDs but it's not an issue.Overall I think it's a great webcam and you can't go wrong with the price. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing I didn't like about this product is the widescreen lens. It's probably not going to be a problem for anyone, but I bought it for the purpose of tabletop gaming through services such as playEDH and I'm not the biggest fan of the wide angle lens. It can make the field look weird and make it a little hard to follow what's going on for the other people playing, but that's more of a nitpick than anything else.It's a great deal for the price, and if you're also looking to buy a webcam for some webcam tabletop gaming or something similar, you can't go wrong with the price. I would also recommend, if you're going to get this for that specific purpose, get a stand for it because the stand that comes with it is not very good for tabletop gaming.Again, all just nitpicks, it's a very nice webcam for the price. Audio quality on the mic is great, picture looks great, it's definitely worth picking up if you need one.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the most inexpensive webcams, and one of a very few with relatively narrow angle field of view of 75 degrees. Most other options cost 2-3x more and have a ridiculously wide angle of 110 degrees, which means the world sees your whole room. This makes no sense when 99% of us are just one person on camera for work/school, not a huge conference room, warehouse surveillance, or YouTuber showing off their studio (and those latter \"pro\" users would spring for a better cam anyway).BUT... but compared to 2 other webcams we got, the image quality on this one is pretty bad. Specifically, there are 3 problems: (1) lots of grainy noise even with reasonable light; (2) the image is a little blurry regardless of the resolution, it's the lens that matters, not the megapixels, and (3) the image is badly distorted on the sides so that a door frame looks bowed. Judging by other reviews, most people don't care or don't know the difference, and just want something that works.For just a little more, there are many other choices in the $45-75 range that are noticeably better quality, with none of the above problems. Unless you're a pro, you don't need to spend more than that. We are on camera all day long during the pandemic, so we wanted an alternative that wasn't distractingly bad.If you like a very narrow angle, more like a real camera or human vision field of view, check out the Looca \"Webcam 4K HD Computer Camera - 8MP Microphone PC Web Camera, Full Widescreen Laptop USB Webcams with Privacy Shutter and Tripod, for Mac Desktop Notebook Video Calling Recording Webcam\" https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B4X2BRL/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_epeLFb9PKPZDV",

Both recognized it immediately. I am a media director and use various broadcast programs but thought I would test it with programs that regular people might use. I used Zoom and OBS to test both image and audio. It functioned perfectly with both programs. The mic audio was clear and clean. The image was so much better than the onboard camera on my laptop and was a nice clear HD image. I was even able to use the virtual background feature in zoom. It functioned as I would expect a webcam should and at a reasonable price. I am extremely pleased with this camera.",
