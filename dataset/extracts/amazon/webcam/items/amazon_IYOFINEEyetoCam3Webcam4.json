                "reviewText": "This is a great device, it really helps create natural eye contact. Here are my tips: 1) make sure you push the suction down firmly. The first time I used it it popped off and then your camera goes all whacky and who knows what they can see. After pushing firmly have not had any issues have been on calls for 3+ hours. 2) it really is not distracting it is so small that you just get used to it. Fantastic if you want to read a document and look natural. 3) Make sure to play with your camera settings on your computer. At first i thought the camera quality was poor, all I had to do was go play with my camera settings. It is not quite as nice as the camera on my Brio but I am using it more frequently due to the above great features.",

However, you have to be comfortable being on a conference call looking like a cartoon. The image and video quality is horrendous, just totally awful. Stick with a real webcam from a reputable company, and just live with the required camera angle. The product is a joke, only it\u2019s not funny because of how expensive is is for what you get.

                "reviewText": "Bottom line\u2014I\u2019m keeping this camera, and recommend this camera to others.It\u2019s miles better than the laptop camera found even in high-end laptops. Macbook Pro, I\u2019m speaking to you. This is 4k and wide angle. Before complaining about wide angle and no zoom capability, know that this framing means you look more at ease rather than staring at your eyes close up or up your nose. For business purposes, this is the difference between poor video that you think your sales prospects have gotten used to vs. looking crisp, clear and fun to chat with.I bought some lighting equipment for the room, a Smith-Victor LED 13\u201d disk with a tripod. (Pricey but worth it - no glare, no bright light eye strain). Now, I don\u2019t look like I\u2019m in a cave or tent but instead my own Zoom room. It looks pro.That out of the way, let me express some gripes, which are not deal-breakers but which the company should fix with more accessories. As some other commenters have said, the suction cups don\u2019t always stay on the screen. It\u2019s already happened to me once. I cleaned the screen and the suction cup with screen cleaning fluid and a microfiber cloth. I also positioned the camera and pushed in on the suction cup firmly, and the camera didn\u2019t dislodge, and the call lasted an hour. So, problem solved? Sort of, but I wish for an accessory that allows the camera to hang from the top of the laptop\u2019s monitor. Or even a desktop arm that allows for fluid positioning.But as I repeat, this is a great product and worth getting.",

                "reviewText": "This such a great web camera, it is so tiny, I can stick it to the screen of my 32\" curved lcd monitor and not even notice it there. This thing might make a blogger out of me yet. It is nice that it is portable too. You could put this almost anywhere to use as a spy or nanny cam due to it's size and long cord just need to plug into a USB outlet for power. Ireally like it is in 4k as well so you have a great picture as well. I'm not sure how low of a light source you can use yet but will guess pretty low due to the resolution and frame rate, I will have to try that out in the near future.Overall this is a really useful product for anyone in need of a great ultra tiny camera for whatever reason, be it blogging, spying, or just watching your pets while you are out, I highly recommend this camera, simple to set up as well. If you really want to have some fun stick it to your forehead when you play with your little ones, you'll have a blast watching them crack up at their silly parent with a camera stuck to their head and you'll get some priceless footage you can keep forever.You know you want one so just go for it, you'll be happy that you did. Yes, I do give this one kudos for all around fun and versatility.Reviewed by,Michael Jamed Fox,Beavercreek, Ohio",

As someone who does a significant amount of interfacing using a webcam in Zoom meetings, the quality and color of my image are crucial. I set up the camera, downloaded their software's most recent version, and ensured the specs on my computer met the standard. I first tried it on my laptop, and the image was grainy and looked close to black and white. I played with the lighting, and it did not help. Then, I went to work to try this on a more powerful computer, and the results were the same. I did reach out to their customer support through their \"chat\" option. They were NOT helpful. Their comment was that their engineering team said it was fine. (I'll assume the brevity of the whole conversation was due to a language barrier). I really wanted to like this. Not worth the $110 I paid for it. Sending it back today.",
