That was accidentally damaged, my own clumsy fault.So I purchased a new one, presumably the exact same A05020 model. The first replacement had poor autofocus. I sent first replacement back. Amazon replaced it with a refurb, but I figured I'd try it anyways.Autofocus still defective, but now the sound was weirdly muffled. Inspection revealed that the sound holes (microphone grate) were no longer the same style and not even in the same position. Before, a six hole array near bottom of the front panel; now, fewer holes and near the top on one of the replacement and near the bottom on the other. The new holes do not line up with the location of the microphones on he circuit board in the original model. I assume the mic location did not change and Also, newer model not recognized in the same way as the old model by certain of my software. Definitely been some redesign, and it did not work out well.AND, for good measure, the supplied refurb was missing the privacy cover.",

I bought this to upgrade my webcam on my 2012 Apple Thunderbolt 27\" monitor built in camera. I have it plugged into my 2020 M1 Macbook air, but I keep the lid closed so I never use that one. Anyways, the Codi was the worst out of three. Built in isite thunderbolt camera, a $22 Vascam webcam I bought on Amazon a year ago, and the Codi I just purchased. Forgive the mess in the pictures, but you can probably see the detail on the mess and how bad the codi is. Also the Codi is SO close. They were all on the same monitor about 2.5 feet from my face.",
