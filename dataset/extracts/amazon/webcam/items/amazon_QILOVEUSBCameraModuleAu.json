It may be configurable to capture at different resolutions, but that was what I was able to capture straight out of the box without using any software. The manual mentions software for Windows, but I don't have access to a Windows system to try it.The module is about 1.5 inches square and about 0.5 inches deep.The autofocus works well in my testing and the picture is quite sharp.
