Great mounting options: a small threaded tripod (legs a little stiff to menauver), and a monitor \"hanger\" as well.I would Not recommended for use on Xbox consoles, as it does not have continuous capturing and shuts down during stream. Image quality is good, but not very sharp. The camera picture quality is affected if there is additional lighting being used in the same room, or in your backdrop. Recomend a green scene be used.",

It's pretty disorienting to reach up and adjust my glasses or try to move my hair and see that it's not on the side I thought it was. I wish I could change that but there doesn't seem to be a way.",
