                "reviewText": "The first webcam I received was used and had fingerprints and dust all over. I tried to plug it in and the picture was very grainy and had a washed out blue hue - this was under regular office light, it made me look like a zombie. So I requested an exchange and the replacement item is even worse. I plugged that in, and it's not even the same widescreen view - It's more like 720p NON wide-angle and even though my face was 2ft from the camera, my face was zoomed in and filling up the whole window. Buy at your own risk.",

All I needed was the standard 1080p, and this was ideal\u2014it was affordable and convenient. The product and the packaging both worked perfectly. Its design is convenient and it can be placed almost anywhere. I use a ring light that I happen to have on a base, but you could use it on my table if that's more convenient. Anyone looking for a quick and inexpensive solution without having to worry too much about what they're buying should definitely consider this.",

                "reviewText": "I got this webcam to replace my faulty built-in camera on my laptop.A very easy to use camera, definitely a plug-n-play model of webcam; it gets the job done for a good price, no drivers necessary. I was able to plug it in, change exposure, and attend a meeting within 5 minutes of plugging it in for the first time.It does have HIGH exposure, though. Everything is very bright; this is meant for florescent light use, not for use at a window or in the sun. Image is also sharp. The audio is \"sharp\" but not too harsh. The privacy cover is an extra component to stick onto the webcam, so it's nice to choose both whether I want it there or how it's oriented. To prevent the privacy cover from also unintentionally covering WiFi/Power indicators, I placed mine perpendicular to the intuitive orientation.I was worried the mechanism to place it onto a screen would be finicky, but it has not yet slipped or unintentionally shifted since setting it up. The tripod is a great accessory to have in case it's needed. The webcam does swivel 360, and it does have an up-down swivel. The style somewhat hits like a 2008 webcam, but I don't much care as long as it works.I didn't expect to appreciate it, but the plastic protective cover that comes on the webcam does not also cover the lens or microphone. This means I can keep the protective cover on the webcam, keeping it cleaner longer while being able to use it. The lens and microphone were fine on unboxing: no scratches or damage to them.",
