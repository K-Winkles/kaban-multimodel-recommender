The quality is significantly better, especially in lower light conditions. It mounts easily on my external monitor although be aware that the clamps are long enough for large curved monitors (I am using a 34\u201d Curved LED). The camera can still perch on the monitor so it\u2019s not really an issue. Installation was a breeze. It auto detects in Windows 10 and shows up as an external webcam. This works well with WebEx and Teams. The included physical privacy toggle is a nice feature. Overall I\u2019m happy with the purchase and am enjoying a better web conference experience.",

The cord is long, and it connects to the desktop or laptop with a standard USB connection. The driver is built-in, so the camera comes up as an option on your computer, along with any other built-in camera. This is a high-quality camera at a good price.",

Considering that I am not very tech savvy, I was surprised that I could hook it up myself, just reading the directions. The quality seems quite good, especially for the money. The two folks I mainly Skype with commented favorably on the improvement in picture and sound (I was replacing that was about 20 years old, and while still working the picture and sound quality were not very good). This picture is very clear. The only thing I can't comment on is, of course, longevity. We'll have to see on that. The turn around time on the order was very short--two days and I am pretty rural.",

This camera has all the functionality and a better image. The mount is what really made me like it. It seems much easier to swivel around and get pointed exactly where I wanted it and it says in position. Came with one of the better desktop tripods I've seen also. Also a built-in lens cover, that's a must have privacy feature.",

It was very clear and no lagging Also the auto focus works great.The only thing I was deceived a bit is they tell it has the option to add background features however to get it, you have to pay for it .Overall, its a great bang for your buck!Hopefully it will last for a long time.",
