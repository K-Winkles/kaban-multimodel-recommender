I finally decided to go with this one, an \"Amazon Choice\" and am so pleased with it. It sits very steadily on my monitor. The picture is excellent. The color is fabulous! And it is easily adjustable as it sits on the monitor to focus straight ahead, down or up! I seldom write reviews, but when I find a product that really is effective, I'm delighted to do so! In addition, there is a sliding \"door\" over the camera so when not it is not in use it can easily be closed. Great product!",

The resolution is incredibly sharp, most definitely better than my on-board webcam that my laptop has, and the auto-focus works quickly and well as I move closer and further away from the camera. The microphones do a great job picking up sound and I'm heard clearly by others. I would highly recommend this device.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a webcam and decided to stick with the brand my sister purchased. Apparently this was the latest model from the one she bought. The setup was simple however the quality was grainy and it took some time for the picture to become focused. My son put a blue candy in front of the cam to show my sister and the video became temporarily blue. The older version seems to be better than the new one. However, I liked the look of this smaller one compared to hers. I may have got a defective one but plan to send it band and purchase a different brand due to quality of picture.UPDATE: After writing my initial 1 star review I can gladly say I\u2019ll change it to 5 stars. Immediately following my review their customer service contacted me for details. They offered a full refund but I decided to take another chance on it so they send me a replacement. Definitely was a faulty camera I received but this new one was exactly what I expected. Thank you!!",

This camera did not disappoint.I use it with MS Teams and the picture quality is clear, no lag, properly colored/saturated, crisp. For legal reasons, I cannot provide a photo of this being used live on Teams. Apologies on that.Install was plug and play. Teams recognized the device immediately. Super easy. My monitor has a rounded back, and while it wasn\u2019t a flush fit the camera does mount securely.The cord on this is longer than expected, but it came w a nice, velcro cable tie so it was easy to keep it tidy.All in all, I really like this camera and will continue to purchase products from TeckNet.",
