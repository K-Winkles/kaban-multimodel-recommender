                "reviewText": "The YZNCAM webcam has a usb-c interface in its back and comes with a four foot long usb-a to usb-c cable (of course, I think you could replace this with any usb cable with a usb-c interface for the webcam). There is a twist ring privacy shield on the camera (my webcam came with this enabled, just twist the ring to the right to open) and a very sensitive touch button on the top that turns the light (bright white by default) to warm yellow and then to off.The base of the webcam has a quarter inch tripod mount (which is very convenient for me since my primary application will be to have this mounted on a tripod for when my writing group is meeting in-person and via zoom for remote participants). The base also opens up to allow the webcam to be balanced upon the opened laptop screen; and the rubber coated foot on the front of the base swivels, to allow for a (relatively) secure perch.I tried the webcam out with google meet and it appeared to work okay (I ran into some glitches from my iPad Pro, but it is possible that these are Safari browser issues and not related to the webcam since I then tried it from my Pixelbook (Chrome browser) and here it worked without any problems).The ring light is bright, illuminating a nearby face. I suspect that it isn\u2019t as effective as a larger diameter ring light, but this is probably a reasonable compromise to deliver some front lighting without making the webcam cumbersome to transport.[2024-01-14 Update] After using this as my regular desktop webcam for a while, I have a few more observations:* the provided light is very close to perfect. I don't need to have any other lights on; it nicely illuminates me, making the use of virtual backgrounds work better.* I wish there was a visual indicator of whether the privacy screen was open or closed (e.g., if they made the iris cover red, so I could see at a glance, that would be helpful)",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great design and specifications, but performance is a little disappointing",
                "reviewText": "I love the DESIGN of this webcam! It is quite small, has a nice little ring light built-in (with touch control on top), and even has a built-in mechanical privacy shutter. It also has good specifications: autofocus 4K UHD with \"Dual Noise Reduction Microphone\" for the audio. Unfortunately, it does not quite deliver as promised.The highest resolution I can get out of it is 3264x2448 -- technically, that is pretty close to 4K resolution's pixel count with 7,990,272 pixels, but it is NOT the standard 3840x2160 for 4K UHD which would give a different aspect ratio with 8,294,400 pixels. Accepting the weird image size, stills shot with it at 3264x2448 look excellent, as you can see by the color test chart shot lit only by the built-in ring light. However, it also can't sustain 30 FPS at that resolution, maxing out at 25 FPS and showing pretty obvious rolling shutter artifacts. It works nicely at 1920x1080 with 30 FPS, although there is some cropping giving it a narrower view angle.The autofocus is also mildly disappointing. Autofocus can go from your face to a close-up of an object held near the lens in a fraction of a second, which is great. Unfortunately, it also has a habit of having focus search a bit if you shift your face from the center of the frame for a moment, and that's annoying.The most disappointing thing by far is the microphone. The audio sounds like it is trying to suppress my voice as if it were background noise. At least using Zoom on my Linux desktop, the audio was NOT of acceptable quality.I also was a bit worried to discover that the back of the webcam says it can draw up to 1A at 5V, which would be a big ask from some computer USB ports. My USB power meter never saw it exceed 0.34A, so it's probably OK.In sum, this is a very likable little webcam at 1920x1080 resolution and the built-in light is more than sufficient to act as good fill-in lighting to soften shadows on your face, but for Zoom you'll want to use a better mic -- and even the built-in mic of a typical laptop is better.",

                "reviewText": "The YZNCAM 4K Ultra HD Webcam showed up in good order in easy packaging. The product consists of an HD webcam with a lighting ring, clip, and (supposedly) a USB cable.A rocky start with no USB cable or instructions in the box. Oh well. Next steps please. Installation and operation of the camera started out well, and the ring light did indeed do what - lit up the area of focus very nicely. Now, as to focus: A longer-term meeting found this camera slipping in and out of focus fairly persistently. It clearly was responding to my movements, but....a quick separate test with a stationary poster instead of me in front of it demonstrated exactly the same focusing behavior. Truly odd, and very, very distracting for those watching me present material. The positive of the lighting is outweighed by this.A camera can be great value for money if it actually works well. Sometimes this one did, sometimes not, thus almost any price point would be too costly. I can't suggest this camera at this time.Rating : 5 stars! Superb, buy now! 4: Solid, few flaws, good value. 3: Most common. Good product, fair value. 2: Flawed, poor value. 1: LandfillDisclaimer: Amazon Vines, product provided at price of US taxation, not gratis.
