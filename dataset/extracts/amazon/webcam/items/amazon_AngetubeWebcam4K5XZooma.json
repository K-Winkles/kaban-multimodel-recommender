                "reviewText": "I teach online classes from Chicago. This is my full time job, so I demand *a lot* from a web camera. This review is intended for my fellow educators or those IT departments looking to upgrade their office conference rooms.Last year, I purchased the Logitech Brio 4K as the answer to my need for the highest quality video at the lowest comparable price point. The Brio seemed the gold standard for web cameras in 202x but after using the Angetube 4K camera for the last few days \u2014 I think that Brio is both overkill and overly expensive for those of us in education and office environments. Here\u2019s why.Physically, the Angetube 4K comes ready for dual placement. The threaded base for tripods/arms is easily accessible as part of the monitor edge grip. The Brio forces you to choose between the grip or the threaded base. To access the threaded base, you need to pry off the Brio\u2019s grip leaving you with a piece of plastic to keep track of. The A4K comes with a USB-A jack though also includes a USB-C adapter. This is a considerate inclusion for those with newer MacBooks.The one annoying detail (it actually made me groan) was that the USB cable was permanently affixed to the web camera. This is a very strange engineering choice for two reasons: 1) any accident to the cable or plug would make the entire device unworkable and 2) it unnecessarily limits the length between the camera and the computer. I really hope that Angetube\u2019s engineers re-design the future models to accommodate swappable cables. The Brio allows for swappable USB-C cables, allowing a maximum distance of 18 meters between the camera and the computer.The base image of the camera without any software changes makes the camera worth its price. I was impressed by the wide angle itself and then the clarity of the image in its entirety. In repeated videos made around my house, the A4K video was of excellent quality. I had to really look for evidence of any blur/noise and found very little. The camera kept focus on my face even while I walking around my home classroom. That really impressed me given that no software for programming such a feature exists. On that note\u2026The A4K does not come with external software. The software as such is built into the camera which you can interact with via the included remote control. The options are basic but effective: Zoom, brightness control, and sound muting. For a web camera intended for conference rooms \u2014 and online classes \u2014 these are all one really needs. The A4K\u2019s ability to zoom up to 4x was impressive because of its maintaining of a crisp image. The brightness levels were also pretty intelligent. Even in the darkest room of my house, I didn\u2019t need to use the maximum brightness setting. The software-via-remote control worked as advertised within the popular apps that I tested: Meets, QuickTime, Teams, and Zoom. There was one exception: OBS Studio. I mention this because I often make instructional videos for students and OBS is my preferred application. The A4K didn\u2019t respond to any input from the remote control while active in OBS. I tried on both 2020 MacOS M1 Mac mini and 2020 MacBook Pro Intel. No go on either. In contrast, Logitech\u2019s HUB is a powerful image manipulator for the Brio so if that\u2019s important to you then keep it in mind.The sound quality was also pretty good. I spoke while walking around the home classroom, moving between about 2.5 meters from the camera to within an arm\u2019s length of it. It was obvious from the resulting recording that I was moving at distances but the audio quality remained solid.Wrapping up my review, I want to return to the Logitech Brio. It\u2019s a very good camera. But, like I said, it\u2019s overkill for most people. Are you a streaming star or TikTok video maker? Then go for the Brio, which as of 31 March 2022 costs double that of the A4K will give you a lot of software control.So \u2014 for my fellow teachers and office folks back in those enclosed conference rooms \u2014 I strongly recommend the Angetube 4K camera. It absolutely works in all of the ways that are advertised. It\u2019s a device that does its job without additional software. Plug it in, launch your preferred app, and that\u2019s it. The price tag makes the A4K an even more obvious choice. $83 USD buys a camera that absolutely works and should be supported by modern computers for a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really solid camera. It has an very wide picture which you can adjust view width (width of the area the camera captures) with an included remote (awesome touch! And you can also use to adjust brightness and mute/unmute). The first few times I used it I got to a perfect width so my the whole area behind me didn\u2019t show, but after a few days it didn\u2019t limit the width to the level (really strange) I needed so my whole background wasn\u2019t showing, and that was an issue for me (as I don\u2019t want everything behind me seen). The picture quality was really good and I was surprised how good the lighting capture was even in a relatively dark space-I thought that was really excellent considering it didn\u2019t have a light ring. I tried it on multiple computers and got same results. It also very easily clipped to my screens whether laptop or large desktop screen. I also thought clarity of picture to be really good. I have another camera from this manufacturer and because it has a more narrow field I will be sticking with that, but if I wanted a wider field I would definitely use this. This is definitely a great camera and would recommend. If I could give half stars this would be 4.5 out of 5. Please note, I was provided this camera as a tester, and this was my honest feedback.",

                "reviewText": "As a Linux user I have to be selective about my hardware and software choices. I needed a video camera for work-from-home video conferencing and purchased an Angetube camera a couple years ago. I was invited to review this new model and jumped at the opportunity. It was not a disappointment either.As before, I simply plugged it into a USB port and was up and running ... in Linux. Works perfectly with Zoom and Teams and guvcview. Picture quality is well beyond my needs without extra lighting. The wide angle lens is really nice but the view can be narrowed down easily with the (remote control) zoom. The remote also lets you adjust the brightness and mute the audio. At first I'd questioned ever using the remote but, when you are in a video conference, not having to dig around in menus to change these simple things, makes you appreciate the remote. Turns out to be a real convenience. And it is completely independent of your computer and the software that's running.The microphone quality is quite good and as good as any product out there that is not designed for a recording studio. The only very slightly negative comment/suggestion is that it seemed to me to have a very slight muffle when used for video conferencing. Cutting the bass a bit and boosting the high end helps make speech more intelligible. Maybe something like this could be added to a future product? Anyway, this is far from being any kind of show stopper. This product is a very good buy.Compared to some of the other cameras I've tried, this has been the best value and least trouble of all. Setup only takes as long as it takes you to remove the velcro cable tie and plug in the USB cable. Really!",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple of these webcams that have the remote with 3 options and I love the fact that it provides 4k picture quality, you can zoom in and out, which was a very important feature I needed in a webcam and also I love the fact that you can adjust the saturation of the image from lighter to darker. I had an issue with the remote of one of the webcams that all of a sudden just stopped working and I contacted the seller because it was still under warranty. I received great customer service. They contacted me via email and DM me on Instagram so we could communicate in real time to first try and troubleshoot the issue. When that did not work they went ahead and reissued me a new upgraded version of the webcam that came with the remote that has more functions that just the three my previous version had. The new webcam came fast and the company contacted me to ensure I received it and that it works properly. I appreciate the great customer service and recommend you to give this webcam a try if you are in the market for one.",
