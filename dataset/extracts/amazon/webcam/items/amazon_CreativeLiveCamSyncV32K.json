                "reviewText": "Was looking for the best bang for my buck, middle of the road cost, preferably from US company, webcam for my wife's office PC. I had previously purchased a Creative \"Live Cam V1\" for the home PC when webcams were in short supply. Although the cost of both were similar, this webcam \"Live! Cam Sync V3\" is a far superior to the earlier one. Upgrades (and why I like this one) include much better light control (much less affected by backlighting), a hinged lens cover (older one was a rubber one with a tether), a touch button on the top of the webcam that toggles through 4 zoom levels. This allows it to go from fairly wide angle (think multi-person view) to basically a tight head shot. It was plug and play in Windows 10 as we didn't want the \"extra\" software features. Its primary use is for Zoom meetings. Very happy with the purchase. If you want really high quality/resolution you will want to ante up for a higher quality webcam, but for most home and work from home use cases, this is ideal, and highly recommended.",

It does not have autofocus but if your sitting in front of a monitor this will have you in focus quite well. Got this one after returning a logitech C615 which would not focus on my face and was quite blurry always, this is sitting around 2 feet from the camera. The clarity on this is so much better.The colors are a bit more muted compared with the logitech but if needed you could use OBS or something and make it pop. The logitech also corrects for more variations of lighting in the image compared to this one. But overall logitech is too soft and blurry so it was bad for me.The image does show a lot more noise when its dark compared with the logitech which just smoothes everything out.Overall if you use it in decent lighting for meetings its quite good and beats the logitech hands down. Just needs a bit more tweaking if you plan to use it in challenging lighting cause the auto lighting on the camera is not as good as logitechs.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:The camera swivels (main reason I purchased this).It has a privacy cover that is attached.It adjusts the amount of background visible.Cord is a long enough to accommodate if your video isn\u2019t near the computer or docking station.The front lip of the camera is small enough so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the window tabs on the screen,Great price point.ConsThe clip holder works best on monitors that have at least 1 to 1.5 inches in depth. It is very challenging to get it tight on thinner monitors. And because the 4 views of the camera are adjusted by touch, when you have to try to tighten it then the file changes. When you turn the camera sideways, then it loosens the holder and changes the field view. So it\u2019s a vicious cycle and takes a while to get it adjusted. Because I bring it back and forth from work and work from home days, this is a cycle that I don\u2019t wish to go through, so it will be returned. If you can set it and leave it, it should be ok. The picture is fine, but didn\u2019t see much difference between it and my old Logitech 615. I haven\u2019t tried to use the microphone in it, because I use headphones for my microphone.",

I got it for meetings and streaming.Easy to mount on my monitor with the clip/folding leg apparatus on all webcams or by screwing the base onto a tripod mount.Definitely would recommend. The touch to zoom feature it SO nice too. Just tap on the top of the camera housing to cycle through the different magnification settings (I think its actually just changing your Field of View, at least for the first two, so you don't lose video quality).You also don't have to search for software to download to get it up and running.

Nothing excellent or anywhere near the camera quality of your cell phone but clean enough for most uses like zoom meetings. Most webcams look awefull because they have microscopic sensor paired with bad lenses. This results is grainy, distorted and blurry picture quality. This webcam is not much better but probably better that the camera already in your laptop and you can change the zoom angle which is a big practical advantage over a fixed wide angle. The more you zoom in the more you lose in resolution because its not a lens (optical) zoom but an image crop. Better than nothing.",

The picture quality is OUSTANDING! but alas, the software isnt available for mac. I swapped the two and my friends love the picture quality. I already have a dedicated microphone but when I tested the built in one, it sounds just as good. I would definitely recommend this one for anyone looking for a decent webcam to use at around $50 CAD (as of time of writing).",
