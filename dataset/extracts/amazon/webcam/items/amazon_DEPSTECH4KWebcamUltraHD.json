This has a nice crisp display and the sound quality is superb. it was easy to set up and use along with my video program and has 2 options for mounting. either on your screen or via the mini tripod. I will attempt to connect this to a 55\" monitor in the very near future for conference calls and will use the tripod as well. The convenience of the remote was nice to make the needed adjustments to zone in on sound and picture. Overall, if you use video calls often, this is a worthy purchase.",

I like the fact that the webcam is plug and play, as I'm restricted from installing software on my work computer. The cable is sufficiently long for my applications (approx. 70\"). Decals are included but are not very useful if the lens cover is installed. Picture is ok, but as others have noted, it can be a bit washed out. Much better with good light and can be improved using controls on the remote. Compared to my current set up, which lacks a tripod and is glitchy with some applications, this webcam is a huge improvement.",

                "reviewText": "The box seals were already broken on arrival so if this had not been a \"Vine\" review product I would have sent it back as having been tampered with. Fortunately, everything was intact and complete and the camera was plug-and-play. My monitor is 4K so I can confirm that this 4K camera does deliver very crisp, well-produced images for my video conferencing which is mainly in \"Zoom\". Autofocus was unable to make it's mind up when the camera was sitting on top of my monitor but this can be switched off from the very nicely featured remote control which does not come with batteries. The remote gives control over zoom, colour saturation, brightness, microphone mute, image on/off, mirror, and contrast. There is also a tripod included, along with a lens cover if you want to use it although my security software deals with webcam access. The only compromise is that this is running at 30 frames per second rather than 60. 30fps reduces the data load required. This is understandable when you consider that this is designed to send images in real time over broadband but 30fps is at the bottom end of the human eye's perception of image flicker. Not that you can see it I hasten to add. The camera's field of view is just right and my head and shoulders filled the frame beautifully - the advantage of having a zoom facility. I am told the microphones are outstanding too but I can not personally verify that because I was not on the receiving end but I trust the source of that comment. A Sony chip is running things and they know about video from their range of SLR cameras and camcorders. Recommended.",

                "reviewTitle": "A very impressive 4K webcam",
                "reviewText": "This 4K webcam from DEPSTECH supports 30fps video and the video quality generated by this webcam is very impressive, the picture is clear and crisp and very vibrant. A remote control is also included, which is a nice touch, and this enable the control of functions such as the 3x zoom.A feature that sometimes gets overlooked with webcams is audio quality, and I'm pleased to say that this webcam captures wonderfully crisp and clean audio thanks to its built-in dual noise cancelling microphones, which makes a big difference.The webcam uses USB-C but also has an adaptor for the older USB-A connections, which is useful. Overall this is a very high quality 4K webcam.",
