The camera was wrapped up and placed in a cut up piece of USPS plastic shipping bag taped up. The front of the camera itself is scratched all to hell. It looks like someone dragged it against a cement sidewalk for a couple of city blocks.Since the camera 'appears' to be working (like I said, haven't tested the audio yet) I will probably keep it but I am shocked that this would be up to Amazon's 'Renewed' quality standard (if they have any). I've purchased used items from private Ebay sellers that looked practically new, this looks like it was used (and packaged) by some teenager who abused the hell out of it and couldn't care less.",

The FOV is too narrow, I have to sit back from my computer screen to be at a reasonable distance, any closer and it's all forehead. Microphone quality is meh.

Highly recommend.",
