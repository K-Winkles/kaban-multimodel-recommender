We have 1gig internet and there are never any issues with lag, voice not matching stream, or any other issues. The only complaint with this camera is it does not have a shutter screen. Sounds weird to me as I thought that would be standard. But thankfully it\u2019s in a room by itself and we close the door when not in use. Yes you can put a piece of tape or paper over the screen, but it seems silly to spend $100 and then do that is all. We also bought the white one because it was $40 cheaper than the black version. It\u2019s a little odd on black screens, but nobody sees it and was worth the savings to us.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First, apologies that my video isn't the most amazing. I wanted to show some information on the camera that I couldn't find in current reviews on here, but I am not the best speaker.Day 1 Review (I will only update if something goes wrong):EXTREMELY disappointed to see that the camera is clearly used. If I wanted a used camera, I would have paid a cheaper price for a used one. The box was torn up, and everything inside was pretty dirty. The sticky bit that covered the camera was barely sticky and had dust and dirt completely underneath it. Be wary of the fact that I am very much not the only person who has reviewed this stating they clearly received a used product.The StreamCam itself. Fantastic. I do suggest downloading the Logitech Capture software to get the most out of the cam, although I only had to make very little adjustments. The only light I have directly on me is my monitor, and I feel the cam looks really good with and without a bright desktop. The built in microphone of the cam actually doesn't sound that bad if you needed to use it and I would compare it to some of the \"cheaper end\" gaming headsets I have bought. Overall, I am very satisfied with the camera itself, but I am absolutely peeved that I was sent used product.To be clear, this does not come with a tripod. This does not come with any sort of privacy cover either. Personally, I bought a stand that I can swivel and move around. In my video review, I have the camera right behind my monitor to give an idea of field of view.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the camera because it supports 1920x1080 at 60 fps, something I need for video capture software development and image processing using Direct3D 11. The Amazon page mentions the only video format at 1080p for 60 fps is MJPEG, but it turns out that the camera supports 1080p at 60 fps with NV12 format. The fastest you can get with YUY2 format is 30 fps.Although I am pleased with the camera, I have a complaint about Logitech USB devices. I have a Logitech K850 keyboard and an M720 mouse that use a unifying receiver. I have to plug the receiver in a USB2 port, because if I plug it in a USB3 port, the receiver fails intermittently. I will be typing on the keyboard, but there is no response. The white-button \"1\" LED blinks as if the keyboard has to re-establish its connection with the receiver. When I additionally plug in the StreamCam (USB-C connection), the failures occur more frequently to the point that I have to unplug the camera in order to type on the keyboard. The same behavior happens if I plug in my Logitech Pro C9 camera, but the failures are less frequent.This behavior is not confined to a Microsoft Windows machine. The same problem occurs on my Ubuntu Linux machine. I keep hoping Logitech can solve this problem and fix it. I like the keyboard, mouse and both cameras, but constant plug/unplug of the camera just to be able to type slows down development.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because my work Dell laptop camera seemed fuzzy and had trouble with low light situations like morning and evening meetings, or bright situations when the sun shines directly in at golden hour.This camera is super clear, has great color, and was super simple to install and start using on my Windows/Dell. It was also easy to hook up to my MacBook when I tested it for podcast/Zoom stuff.Mounting arm to hook on the back of the screen works really well too. Note that it sits on but doesn't clamp to the screen.There's an internal mic so be sure to tell your computer or video chat software if you want to use the mic in the camera or on your computer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought my first Logitech StreamCam right at the start of the pandemic and it worked PERFECTLY to get our church broadcasts through the tough times with streaming.Post-pandemic it lives on my office Mac and works beautifully. But, for my office PC I had an Elgato FaceCam. That FaceCam constantly locked up and froze when on video calls. I replaced it with a second StreamCam and it works just right, no fuss ever.Also, don't fret over the 1080p image. The image is clear and has good color and exposure. I've seen 4k webcams with worse images. The higher frame rate helps the look as well. I'd take one of these over a cheap 4k camera any day.Can't recommend this camera enough.",

                "reviewText": "Die Webcam liefert in verschiedenen Programmen ein super Bild. Es ist klar und fl\u00fcssig. Im dunklen R\u00e4umen verschlechtert sich die Qualit\u00e4t logischerweise (wie bei jeder anderen Kamera), aber sie liefert trotzdem noch ein gutes Bild, trotz schlechter Bedingung. Durch die Logitech software hat man auch nochmal verschiedene Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten.Der Autofokus funktioniert sehr gut. In der Regel fokusiert er einmal und muss danach auch nicht mehr neu fokusieren. Sollte man dann irgendwas anderes als sich selbst in der Kamera zeigen wollen, fokusiert die Kamera, nach meiner Erfahrung, sehr schnell (1 Sekunde). Das funktioniert in der Regel auch sehr gut, sodass die Kamera schnell erkennt, dass was anderes fokusiert werden soll.Die Kamera l\u00e4sst sich leicht via \"Klappklemme\" auf dem Monitor befestigen. Dabei h\u00e4lt sie sich unerwartet gut. Zus\u00e4tzlich kann man diese Klemme auch einfach schlie\u00dfen und sie auf den Tisch oder sonstiges stellen. Man kann die Kamera in alle Richtungen drehen und positionieren.In meinem Fall ist der PC auf der rechten Seite und die Webcam links auf dem Tisch. F\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich ist das Kabel ein wenig zu kurz. Zus\u00e4tzlich d\u00fcrft ihr nicht vergessen, dass die Kamera einen USB-C-Stecker hat und ihr somit entweder einen USB-C Anschluss oder einen bestimmten Adapter ben\u00f6tigt, um diese anzuschlie\u00dfen. Ich habe zuf\u00e4lligerweise einen USB-C-Anschluss und es funktioniert alles einwandfrei. Ich habe die Kamera auch einmal mit einem Adapterkabel an einen herk\u00f6mlichen USB-Platz angeschlossen. Dar\u00fcber hat auch alles ganz normal funktioniert.Wer eine Webcam braucht, kann mit dieser wohl nichts falsch machen.",
