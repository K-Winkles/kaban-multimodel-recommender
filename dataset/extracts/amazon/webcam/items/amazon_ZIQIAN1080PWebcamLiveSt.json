No luck.When writing this review, there\u2019s no option to rate the quality of the audio, only the picture. It\u2019s like they knew it was bad and purposely removed the ability to grade it. That should tell you something.I end up using my headset mic instead, which is unfortunate because I was hoping to simply use the webcam and the built-in mic for meetings.

                "reviewText": "Well, this camera isn't entirely bad (I'm giving it a 2 out of 5 star rating. It's not horrible enough to receive a one star and it's not abysmal enough to have me ranting and raving that it's a zero, but it's not that good either and it's only getting a 2 out of 5 from me).I plugged it into two Chromebooks (I also own a very high-spec gaming laptop but that thing already has a great high quality cam attached to it, so this camera was meant for my Chromebooks which have very grainy, low quality cams) . One of those Chromebooks is a first generation Acer Chromebook (one of the oldest Chromebooks that came out SEVERAL years ago). Good news is that it WORKS with all the Chromebooks, even the oldest Acer Chromebook I have (to activate this cam, plug in the USB, go to your normal webcam on your Chromebook and turn that on, then at your normal Chromebook webcam you will see a circle in the lower left hand corner (might be in a different location for you). Click on that and it activates and switches to your new external webcam. Pretty cool... except for a few VERY significant problems:1) The lighting is HORRIBLE on this external webcam!!!! Yes, the overall picture quality is much better (well, at least the parts you can actually see) but the lighting is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE in comparison to the severely much brighter cam that's already built into the Chromebook (even my oldest Acer Chromebook's built in cam that is almost nine years old has far superior lighting). You will need to supply EXTRA light in your room for this external webcam to match the lighting supplied by your old Chromebook camera. Without supplying extra light you are left with A LOT of darkness to the point where you can barely see your own face a few inches away from the external webcam.2) When you do supply extra lighting (and you are going to need a significant amount of extra lighting. Your windows open during the day WITH extra lamps), while the camera quality looks nice at first (it is better than the Chromebook's own cam since it's not as grainy, ignoring the far superior lighting the Chromebook's built in cam already has) if you try to have the camera focus on something that requires high definition (like words on a piece of paper) you will notice that it will NOT be clear and will be blurry / out of focus in most cases (which strongly puts into question whether or not this cam is truly 1080 p).Due to these two major flaws, I have to give this cam a 2 out of 5.IF you can get extra lighting (whether through putting several extra lamps in your room OR if using a PC you can use a program of some sort that somehow increases the lighting) and you only plan on using this cam for general use (EX: you do NOT plan on focusing on anything like words on a page because if you do it's going to be out of focus and hard to read for whoever is viewing your cam) then it's okay.But if you have the extra money, definitely pay up the extra money and get a better cam that's truly high definition.This cam is cheap and is currently only about $20 for a reason.Save up money and get a better cam, even if it costs you more.You get what you pay for.As a result, I give this webcam a 2 out of 5.",

It serves the purpose, definitely would not fork out the crazy prices for the logitech cameras out there, this is perfect for the intended purpose.Also i was concerned with it intruding onto my monitor, but it's perfect and works well.",

The pictures make it look like the base is either heavy enough, or the hinge is stiff enough to lock the camera in place on the top of the monitor. It's not. It can't be used as an anchor as the pictures suggest (though admittedly that isn't specifically stated anywhere). But it's well balanced enough that a bit of double-sided tape is all it needs to remain solid. Simple set up. I didn't actually have to do anything other than plug it in. Windows 10 did the rest. Works like any other inbuilt would. The lens cover is a handy addition to avert any paranoia about someone taking over your camera and trying to blackmail you in a poorly written bulk English translation mailout.",
