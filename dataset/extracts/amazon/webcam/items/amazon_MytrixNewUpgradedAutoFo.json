                "reviewText": "Not sure why many other reviews focus on the price, but don't buy this for over $60. I've been using this since April 22nd for reference to time of usage before review. Also, it is plug-and-play, so I added no software or drivers; using Windows 10.Looking at this overall it is 5 stars for the price. I've used this for streaming, the 1080p recording comes in clear when using OBS. Using this for Microsoft Teams, the picture was clear and the audio was also clear and my interview went smooth.There is only one place thus far it isn't performing perfectly, and that is within the website Roll20.net which is where I play group DnD sometimes. The video performance is clear, but issue is that it is slow, perhaps 15fps slow, which isn't an issue for this use case, but I had to make sure it was known it isn't perfect.Given that during the stay-at-home orders Amazon is sold out of many products, this was on prime and came quickly. Certainly a worthy knockoff of Logitech webcams to use when you cannot find any Logitech items for sale.",

This one was one that I could get in a few days as opposed to the regularly priced ones that would take two or three weeks to receive. I paid $166 when two weeks later the price was dropped to $60. There's nothing that I can do about it, I just had to let myself get robbed. I don't think that I'll be renewing my prime membership.",
