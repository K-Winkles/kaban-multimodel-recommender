                "reviewText": "Hi folks,I got this camera a week ago since my old laptop's internal camera was like 0.3 megapixels and the video image it was recording was just terrible. So I decided to come here and get some nice camera for a good value. Reviews were different, good and bad... And guess what? I've got it, hook it up to my desktop computer (just on the top of the monitor), the good thing is a plug and play out of the box for windows 10 and I was surprised about the picture quality. It's just awesome! I really love it. So clean and crisp.I'm using this web camera on a daily basis for my work (remotely now lol). It works with all apps I've tried it, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, GoToMeeting, you name it, works with all apps just fine. All people on the other end of the call immediately mentioned that the quality of my video calls greatly improved. It also has a built-in microphone, so you don't have to worry about getting an additional one. The USB cord of the camera is pretty long. It helped me a lot since my desktop computer's case sits next to my desk on the floor. The camera has a pretty good engineered holder, so you can attach it to practically any possible monitor, but even in case if not, it comes with a mini tripod, which you can attach to the camera's holder. Oh, another very important future that the camera comes with a mechanical privacy shutter, which you can close when the camera is not in use.Overall great value and quality for the price. Absolutely recommend if you are having daily video calls, meetings or just web chats.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this camera a few months. The install went pretty well. I had to reboot a few times to pick the camera up, but once it was recognized, that has worked well. The camera does not clamp securely onto my external monitor. I fixed that problem by getting a separate flexible arm that clamps onto my desk and holds the camara. I love the physical lens cover so I can easily control when the camera is capturing an image. The picture quality is great. I love having an external camera instead of relying on the one on my laptop so my laptop can stay connected to the docking station and I don't have to try to get it moved over to the center of my desk every time I have a videoconference. Unfortnately there there are two remaining problems that are making me now decide to look for another camera:1. Echos: When using this camera, is it causes an echo on videoconferencing that others can hear. I cannot hear it. It is so annoying to others that immediately people start talking about it and asking if the call can be done using some other audio. It definitely happens on Microsoft Teams calls as others have said in the Questions section for this product on Amazon. I can't remember if it happened on Webex videocalls also. Others have said switching the audio source solves that problem.2. Wide View: This may be standard on these cameras. I'll find out when I shop for a new one, but the view is much wider than my native laptop camera. I can't find any way on the camera to \"crop\" it so that it shows only the person during videoconference and not a lot of what is to the right and left of the person. I solved that problem by installing OBS Studio and the OBS virtual camera. OBS allows me to crop the picture and then uses that video as the \"camera\" in Microsoft Teams. That works very well to get a good cropped video, however, the image quality went way down and it freezes up sometimes, so it is not a great solution because I end up not having smooth starts to videoconferences with all the troubleshooting I have to do to get OBS, the webcam, and the conferecing software to all work together.I hope I can find a camera that works seemlessly so that the now much more frequent videoconferences, thanks to the pandemic, will go more smoothly.",

My computer tipped back sitting on my bed, so the webcam didn't even fall it slowly leaned about 10 inches until I was resting on my bed. This one started glitching too!!The camera quality is good, but it is not worth it if the smallest bump or blunder is going to render it useless.",
