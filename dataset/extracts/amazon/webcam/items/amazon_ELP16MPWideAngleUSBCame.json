                "reviewText": "I've been using Lightburn for over a year and have wanted to add a camera to the setup for some time, but the Lightburn cameras were a little too pricey for my taste, esp. knowing there were better options. After doing a lot of research I finally landed on this little guy and I am not disappointed. The camera has a very wide 118 degree angle of view that allowed me to mount it under the lid and still be able to see the entire 20\"x28\" work area clearly. The unit ships as just a tiny camera mounted to a tiny PC board, so knowing it needed a case, I decided to use my skill as a 3D artist and 3D print one. It turned out perfect, its about the same size as a business card, and very easily mounted to the lid using high quality double sided tape. Once I had it attached, I ran the USB cable to the PC, plugged it in and the camera installed all by itself, no problems and no driver, it just worked. So in Lightburn I selected the option '16mp USB Camera' in 'Settings' and went through the calibration process and within about 20 minutes I was up and running. It really is great being able to accurately place materials on the cutting bed and locate them visually in the interface. I think next I'm gonna have to install better LED lighting so that will allow features like the auto trace to work too, bit for now I'm happy with this simple and overall fairly inexpensive upgrade to my system. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a nice camera. High resolution, decent frame rates, very wide angle. You'll probably want some sort of case for it - I designed and 3D printed one. If you don't have access to something like that consider the environment you're putting it in and whether it will be OK as a bare board. Nice camera and I'm happy with it.However, I mainly I picked this up to use with LightBurn in my laser enclosure. It probably works fine with Windows and Mac, but I'm using it under Linux and had some problems. In general it works great with Linux in other apps (e.g. Cheese, a simple webcam app). But as I understand it, LightBurn on Linux is still a 32bit app. I was getting errors in the console when running that there was an allocation error. Long story short, LightBurn on Linux can't handle this camera's max resolution, and it doesn't have a way to selected a lower resolution. I found a workaround that mostly works if you check the LightBurn forums. Be forewarned if you're considering this camera for the same application. You may want to look for a lower resolution model. I think anything 2K or lower works fine.",
