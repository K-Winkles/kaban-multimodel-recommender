                "reviewText": "The cable connected into the camera back is now loose which results in \"Matrix\" effect . Was good camera while working but 2 months is just way too short.Bought another one first as replacement but was disappointed w/ replacement resolution quality.So I bought this one again it has hold since for about 6 months. So this time durability is better.Bumping up the stars from 1 to 3, if it endures more than a year will bump it up again.",

                "reviewText": "I am stuck with this worthless piece of equipment because of the lack of technical support offered by this company. Assuming the problem was with my computer, I kept trying to solve its lack of functionality, which took me past the 30-day return time. I boosted my ram, I called in a computer technician, and I roamed the web looking for solutions (and clearly many other people have struggled with this web camera). I am extremely disappointed by this product and would urge anyone looking at this line of webcams to go elsewhere.",

He has no issue for the conversation even from a distance. Virtually no setting up to do, automatically hooks up to your computer and the mic is a nice touch so that I don't have to buy one separately.",
