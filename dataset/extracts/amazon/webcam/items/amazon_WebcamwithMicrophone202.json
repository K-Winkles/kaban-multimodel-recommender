The quality of the camera is amazing for the price I got it for, the microphone is a bit buzzy but still there and works fine. Setting it up was a very simple process. Plug it in via USB port, open whatever application that utilizes a Webcam and you're done! The kit comes with a screen cover so you can physically block the image from being shown, the stand is pretty good but I would suggest using the mounting feature as it is in a good position and out of the way . I used it to live stream a video game and was quite pleased with the results, probably good with live video calls like zoom, 1080p and everything. Overall I'm very happy with this product, it's a great budget Webcam that has all a Webcam should provide.-",

Most webcam's these days show your entire room or really give off the fisheye look if you're in a small room. This is wide enough for your face & a little extra but not your entire room. Great for all the Zoom meetings we're having now. It's plug n play, so no problem with installation. The clarity is much better than my default laptop camera. And it works well in low light as well. Comes with a little tripod too!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 4 different webcams in October 2022 to evaluate which one provided the best picture in a webcam under $35. The Despatach provided the best picture, particularly in low-light, of the cameras I tested. I used this camera on a MacBook Pro running Mojave, a PC running Windows 10, and a 13 year-old Netbook running Linux Mint. It performed well in all three operating systems. Apparently, it is not yet ready for Windows 11. When work upgraded my laptop to one running Windows 11, I can no longer get video (the picture) to work with it, just a gray box. Using the Windows 11 troubleshooter didn't work. Windows 11 cannot find an updated driver and indicates it is working but no picture. If you are running Windows 11 now, you probably need to look for an alternative camera.",

However, I just could not get the right color balance. I even tried two different ones, and on different computers--but the same problem remained. I looked pale as a ghost, no matter what lighting I was in. I put a lightweight pink cloth over my desk lamp to warm up the tone, but that was very annoying and also a fire hazard. I compared my image on zoom with all the others, and I was the only one who looked so faded out. I returned it and ordered a slightly more expensive Logitech, which is working well, with proper facial color.",

( I did explain all my troubleshooting steps etc upon contacting them!)The replacement camera came in and works flawlessly! Support followed up and made sure I was happy and working!There are many \"high end\" devices that don't provide this level of support. I'll be preferring DSPTech for all future purchases!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Great value for money webcam, well-constructed and seems robust. The fixed focus camera has a fairly narrow field of vision which is ideal for online meetings where you don\u2019t want participants to see the whole room. The camera performs well in low light, artificial light and daylight. Tested the webcam with Microsoft Teams and Skype and no issues; the camera is plug and play straight out of the box. Also included is a mini tripod and privacy lens for the camera, although there is a light on the front to indicate when the camera is in use. The only negative is the quality of the inbuilt microphone isn\u2019t great; it\u2019s fine for online meetings but it\u2019s not the loudest or the highest quality. See the video which was made with the webcam to give you an idea of image quality / sound (aware that amazon compresses videos so might not be a true representation). Overall though it should fit the needs of most users for the likes of online meetings and video calls.",
