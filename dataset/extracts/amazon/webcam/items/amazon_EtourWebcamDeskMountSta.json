I'd looked at some of the small cameras that \"center mount\" on or in front of the monitor, but they all had mixed reviews about quality of the image. The Etour webcam desk mount stand let me use the camera I was already using but lets me place it in the center of my monitor screen with minimal blocking of my view. It lets me adjust the camera height quickly and easily, and has made me feel like much more of a direct participant in on-line meetings.",
