                "reviewText": "I've owned this product for a little over a year now, and it's treated me quite well! Having used it casually for streaming on Twitch or calling friends on Discord/Skype, it's never failed me in any way.It's a 720p 30fps camera, which I can't complain too much about considering the price tag. The camera is noticeably worse in bright environments, as you end up losing visibility in details.The microphone is subpar, but I wouldn't recommend using it for anything professional. It catches almost every sound in that respective room, and especially captures an echo in the audio if the room you're recording in is spacious. Keyboard and mouse clicks are commonly heard along with any subtle noise you'd hear in your day to day life.",

The clip is flexible so I was able to position as needed on monitor.The video quality is far better than the built in laptop camera. The downside to that is it shows when I haven't shaved before my early morning meetings :)",
