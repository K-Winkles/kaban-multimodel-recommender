                "reviewText": "Setup was easy once I found the proper software for the camera. Unfortunately they dont really give you any information with the amazon renewed version of this product. The link to the software that they had on the little paper it came with was a dead link and the cam didnt try to auto install when plugged in. After poking around online for a couple minutes I found the program I needed and got the thing setup initially. It updated firmware and than started showing up. Once it was setup and updated everything worked smoothly. At that point I connected the cam to my btt pad7 and input my url/ip settings. I can now use AI to monitor my prints while I am away or check in on them myself from anywhere (using mobileraker and octoanywhere). I do wish there were a way to manually focus it while its attached to my klipper pad, but the image is pretty good for using autofocus all things considered! Personally for 30ish dollars, I think its a great deal. Camera was in great condition, still covered in plastic wrap. The box it came in was a reprint, but I expected that. Honestly the only thing that would have made it better for me is if they had included a current software url link or qr code you can scan to take you to it. I could see some less experienced pc users having a little touble figuring out what they need to install because of the dead link. Its a good cam overall and I have no real complaints!",

                "reviewText": "What I really like about this camera is that the microphone has about a 270 degree pickup. That works nicely in a recording a presentation or lecture to record questions or input from a lot of people. What I'm not so thrilled with, is that it does not do well with mixed lighting situations. For example, a powerpoint display and a presenter who may adjust light levels. I find that once the light level saturates, it takes some effort to get it to reset and pick up the display again. I know that I'm asking a lot of a moderate priced camera for something that my institution should be handling as part of the infrastructure rather than foisting the expectation on employees, but here we are.",

Perfect timing for a pandemic to hit and shift the world to on-line meetings.The logitech webcam was a winner right out of the box. Initially I plugged it in and was disappointed because it didn't blink or beep or do anything to act like it was more than a dead lump of plastic and glass. But when I linked into the first meeting, it arose from the dead and worked brilliantly. Good sound, good picture, perfect. Most pleased.",
