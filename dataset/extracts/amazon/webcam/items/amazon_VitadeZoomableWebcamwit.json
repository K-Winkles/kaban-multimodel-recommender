                "reviewText": "Nice packaging on this webcam. It came with a remote which is extremely useful!I also have the Logitech C925-e which is my comparison point on how much I like this camera.Here are my take-aways from first week of use: - It worked as soon as I plugged it in - I needed the usb-c adapter for the cable, as that's all the MS surface had available to me, so that was crucial in setting this up- I have a very dark office with a dark background and the ring light did a good enough job to light up my face- I use this primarily for MS teams and those on the other side saw and heard me just fine (I had a coworker compare it to the logitech and the audio was just as good according to them)----- What I loved! ------What I really loved about it was the remote! I don't have to go into settings (like I do with the logitech) to adjust the zoom, focus, auto brightness or pan left and right. It does it all from the remote. I can even do the digital option for turning on the privacy function and making my video go dark.The physical features of the camera are also great: - I can adjust the ring light from dark to bright and off by turning the outside edge clockwise or counter-clockwise. - It is continuous: so you can go brighter until you get to the brightest and then it turns off as you continue to go, and goes back through that cycle as you go clockwise. It does the opposite if you co CC so that it goes from brightest to dimmer until it goes off and back through the cycle again. - It also has a physical privacy lens cover that you can switch with your finger - It clipped easily to both my monitor and my laptop screen and seems secure enough with all the options to swivel and tilt as neededAfter a week of use on MS Teams, this camera works great. I've found it very useful and working just as well as my other webcam in terms of quality for both video and audio. What makes it better for me is the use of the remote that puts all the controls at my fingertips rather than hidden in some menu within Teams that can't be adjusted unless I disconnect from my call.",

                "reviewText": "This camera is certainly an upgrade from the fairly traditional webcam I had in the sense of its features. I dare say the image quality may look a tad better, but what I really bought it for was to be able to zoom in on my face during Webex meetings and not have everyone seeing my background as my current computer system does not meet the requirements for a virtual background. Not that I like the virtual backgrounds, too wonky and I prefer the reliability of the physical screen I currently use. I was not, however, fond of the wide angle view. This little bugger takes care of that with the nifty remote (which I haven't lost yet). It also has a light, which may or may not be enough for some, but it doesn't hurt to have it if needed. You control the light \"temperature\" from the back of the unit (not a fan) and you can turn the light up or down in brightness by turning the actual \"knob\" of the light ring. You can also adjust how bright you look in the image from the remote as well as shutting off the video feed. I do really like that it has a physical shutter right on the unit when you really want to be sure no one is watching. I also appreciate that you can move it side to side and not just up and down. This is very helpful for repositioning it on my curved monitor. Because I use a dedicated headset with mic, I cannot comment as to the sound quality, but the few times I did not use the headsets, I had no complaints. I'm sure it is no worse than my last cam. I did get a deal on this so that is a plus. Is it a 5 star camera? Nah. I will give it a solid 4 stars though for meeting all my current needs while fitting my budget.",

                "reviewText": "I am shocked and pleasantly surprised at the quality for the cost of this camera. I do sales calls on zoom so I needed to step up my game while keeping my budget pretty decent. I purchased this one in particular based on the camera quality seeming better than my laptop and price was good, especially with the coupon.First picture is from my ~2019 macbook pro. Looks like I am taking a picture on an ipod touch from 2008 or something.Second photo is with the VITADE camera. You can see the difference for yourself.I love that the light has different warmths as well as a built-in privacy shield. The remote is the icing on the cake. The zoom and move features are so helpful, and you can adjust the brightness level from the remote as well.",

There's no indication of a warranty or anything, so I guess i paid whatever I paid last year not to own a camera, but instead to just rent it for a year. Bad deal.",

I could not zoom in on my image. I sit at a desktop with the camera about 2 feet away. They were wide angle cameras and I tended to be a small part of the frame.This camera resolves that issue with a zoomable lens. I use a Yeti microphone so I cannot comment on the mic capabilities. The ring light is easily adjusted and I can slide the privacy switch to prevent the camera from uninvited snoopers. It's more that I would have preferred to spend, but my frustration finally got the best of me. I'm happy.",
