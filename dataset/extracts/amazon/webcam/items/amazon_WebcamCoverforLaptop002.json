When open, the picture is perfectly displayed. The cover slides easily, but open or closed, it stays put. Now, when installing the cover, I did need to be very careful about framing the camera lens, but overall I found installation quite easy.",

I constantly take my laptop carelessly to and from work in my backpack and the cover has not budged at all. Even if it did, there are 2 more in the pack! It is super handy now for working virtually as well because I no longer worry I'll join a meeting with my camera on accidentally. I also have a fear of the camera randomly turning on during these things (even though it won't happen) so it has cleared this fear for me! Even if I lose it or the whole pack I'd buy them again",

That is very much not true.If you are like me and value your privacy covering cameras is something I am very well attentive to. These thin little devices securely mount to your laptop camera or your cell phone camera. It covers very close to those tiny little lenses, but slides open and out of the way.I placed a picture of them so you can see the actual size compared to a normal desktop web cam. They are too small for the desktop web cam, but fit nicely on a laptop or cell phone.Great little security addition for the price. I will be buying more and I knock these around and eventually fall off.",

                "reviewText": "I like about this product is that the cover fits in its spot. I have a surface pro 7 and it fit perfectly. The only thing that is also covering is the white light, but that doesn't bother the camera. It indicates that the camera is on. I set it up where you would have to slide it to the left to close it because if I set it up to slide it the right then its going to cover the red light and then my tablet won't recognize me if I'm there or not. Easy to install. It kind of moves a little bit. It doesn't have that strong glue on it, but once its on its pretty much stays there. They are also really thin which is neat too",

I bought this for my new MacBook m1 after reading horror stories how other products cracked/broke MacBooks (particularly) because of the stickiness on them and not being able to be removed, and I have to say I am so happy I went with this one! I read reviews how they\u2019re not super sticky and are thin, but they are everything I wanted. They\u2019re not to a point where I feel like I can wipe them off but they are sticky enough where I feel comfortable keeping it on until I want to change colors without a ton of force. They\u2019re also thin enough to comfortably close my computer (the photo may look different but I also have a case on my computer). And no, they\u2019re not see-through.",

When it\u2019s on, some light does come through (since I have the light pink color), but I would suspect this wouldn\u2019t be the case with a dark color, and regardless you still can\u2019t see anything through.
