A1: The zoom function only works at 1080p resolution and 30fps framerate. Please note: if you are using a video chat app (e.g. Zoom /Skype /Microsoft Teams /etc.), the software will automatically set the camera to a 30fps framerate and typically you will not be able to adjust this in the program. Q2: Why does my resolution drop to 1080p when running at 60fps, or while using the zoom function on the webcam? A2: This webcam is not able to maintain any combination of 2K resolution, 60fps, and/or the built-in zoom function. At 2K resolution, the frame rate will be set at 30fps and the built-in zoom function will not be able to be used. For 60fps the resolution will need to be set to 1080p and the built-in zoom function will not be able to be used. The built-in zoom is only usable at 1080p resolution and 30fps. Alternatively, you can use a program like OBS to create a virtual camera running at 60fps or at 2K resolution and use the ability to manipulate the image in their program to zoom the image in. For assistance with OBS, please visit the software\u2019s website.",

                "reviewText": "As a student I am required to utilize a webcam frequently, I also work from home and zoom has become. a frequently used app in my workday. Finally, I enjoy video chatting with friends who have moved to other countries so I find myself using a camera a lot. This camera delivers on all counts and produces clear video that transfers well to the recipient and very easy to use.I am working on several platforms and devices including an iMac, MacBook Air, and a pc laptop. This camera had no issues with any platform. The added remote control was also a useful tool for those meetings where I was presenting away from my desk and I was able to zoom in to the focal point of my presentation rather than run back to my desk. The zoom quality is ok and is probably more dependent upon room lighting. One complaint is the privacy shutter that is included which you must attach or remember to use instead of the shutter being a part of the camera figure like their recent camera with ring light , another great item. Why cant they make this included as well? If you are needing more lighting in your web meetings then go withtheir ring cam, another quality item, This one is equal in quality with the remote and zoom feature great selling points. As promoted, it did work well with zoom, I had some minor connection issues with other web based video platforms, but was easily remedied. The Nexigo web cam software allows for camera modification and there are other apps as well available for Mac users. There are cheaper cameras out there, for these specs, but you are not getting the support, quality or ease of service that comes with this brand.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this! It took me \"Mrs Not-Technical\" some time to figure it out! The manual is pretty useless for first timers like me AND the print is TINY!!! Even my friend with good eyesight borrowed my 2.0 readers;)))) More time needed to search out the manual online for bigger print and therefore ease of reading!Anyway, regardless of what the manual said, I tried and tried but couldn't find the Nexigo on my laptop once I plugged everything in. I could see the APP but when I opened the camera APP it was always the HP pre installed one... very frustrating!! Then I tried all the GOOGLE info but none said the following... \"Disable the pre-installed camera APP\" I took a chance with some common (not technical, sense) and disabled the pre installed camera on my HP laptop. Yay!!! There it was! The NexiGo camera !!I also downloaded the NexiGo software (consider myself a professional now:) and played around with that too giving me some nice color/light options etc... Without this software tho the camera is great, but just some nice extra touches from the software and you can save the different settings too.The remote is a great idea! It is very responsive and I LOVE the zoom in and out feature. My patients don't need to see my cats walking behind me:) which I know they always do, and I am able to get a good fill of my head and shoulders in the screen.I would have loved it to be a clip-on webcam... I find the way it attaches to my laptop feels somewhat fragile and does not leave many options for position or raising. I will be taking the webcam on and off as I am remotely working in different places with my laptop so putting it on and off leaves me a bit nervous as it doesn't attach very securely and takes some time to replace in the right spot every time.All in all Im going to say I'm happy. Im a clinical mental health therapist and will be using a video platform for therapy sessions so wanted something with serious options and clarity. This fits the bill so far. I have yet to use it for business as this review its just after I managed to install it and do some self positive psychology therapy on myself after all the frustrations of installing it... ha! Of course many reviews say it's easy to install and use, so I'm going to admit it's highly likely \"lack of new user technical knowledge\" that being me:)Go ahead and try it. I find that technology is never a one size fits all so regardless of other and my review try it for yourself!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing camera, but not quite five stars.",
                "reviewText": "As a creature of habit, it's very hard for me to try new things but one thing that was sorely missing from my older webcam (logitech) was the ability to focus on objects which drove me nuts every time I wanted to show something close up. After reading the reviews on this camera, I decided to give it a try and here's my experience.First off, I want to say the image quality on this camera is outstanding if you're using video conferencing programs like Zoom or Skype. However, I did notice at \"full screen\" the quality claiming to be 4K is very \"noisy\" or grainy even in plenty of light, which was a bit disappointing. I rarely do things full screen or in 4k, so it's not really a big deal. It is something you might want to be aware of though.Secondly, the zoom feature is OUTSTANDING. I love being able to adjust the view of the camera without touching it, via the remote control. It really is extremely useful for getting yourself perfectly framed, or making on the fly adjustments and being able to zoom in without having to show your messy living room or office like other fixed position \"widescreen\" webcams do, or touching the camera itself. While I don't need it, you could very easily perform a lecture from across the room and still appear close up on your conference videos, controlling your zoom or framing via the remote.I can't stress this enough, you absolutely NEED the remote to do any adjustments with this camera, even if you're just sitting in front of the computer. You also need to go into your \"camera settings\" on your computer (at least once) to get other features to work properly before you start doing any web conferences - DO follow the suggestions in the instruction booklet included with your product. It is very important you read the manual on how to properly set this thing up.Out of all the webcams out there, I'm very impressed with the features this one delivers, even if they're not quite worthy of five stars, which I'll get into next.Third, let's talk the autofocus. The autofocus does what it needs to, but I find it has trouble finding a spot to focus on if I don't put my hand behind whatever object I'm trying to show on camera (especially if it's shiny). Also, you have to hold the object fairly still and higher up for the camera to focus on it, which can make it harder to see what you're doing on screen.The autofocus is crisp and clear, when it works. It feels like it doesn't move with your camera view though, which is a shame. So if you're framing yourself in the middle, you still have to either obscure your face out of frame, or hold objects higher to get the camera to focus on them clearly. It does work, but it takes more effort than I would like.Set up was a breeze. Easy plug-in-play and as previously mentioned, make sure you follow the instructions. If a feature isn't working, it's probably not activated yet via your \"camera settings\" on your computer, outside of your conferencing program.The \"privacy\" lens is a bit of a joke. It's literally a tacky looking sticker you stick on the camera that has a little tab you can slide back and forth. Personally, I just leave my camera unplugged when not in use and call it a day. If privacy is important to you and you don't want to remember to unplug the camera after use, you may find the \"lens cover\" useful though. They give you an extra one as well.Lastly, the sound. Well, near as I can tell it's pretty good. I'm no audio expert, but thus far I haven't had any complaints and no one seems to hear me typing or doing other things and I don't have to lean in close to the mic for anyone to hear my voice in Zoom meetings. So I guess it works like any other webcam mic would and that's good enough for me.All in all, I'm very happy with this product. I wish some of these things could be better (thus four stars) but if you're willing to put up with a few little annoying adjustments, this camera will give you the flexibility you're searching for at a price that won't break the bank if you're serious about your webcam presentation.",
