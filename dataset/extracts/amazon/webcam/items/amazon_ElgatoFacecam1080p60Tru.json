If you want the full effect of the camera, make sure that your PC can handle it. I use it for livestreams with OBS software and it works great. It includes the USB-C to USB-A cable, a monitor stand and camera lens cover for privacy. Please note this camera DOES NOT include a built in microphone like most other webcams include, honestly if you're using this for content creation, you're probably going to have an external microphone anyway. If you're looking for a high quality webcam for less than a fraction of a DSL-R, look no further than the Elgato Facecam.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using one of the most popular webcams on the planet for the last few years from the leader in the industry for working remotely as well as streaming and it's been fine but I was always frustrated with the software to manage its settings as well as a little underwhelmed with the quality, even after upgrading my lighting.I was most sold on trying the Elgato Facecam because you can save the settings like white balance, etc., to the camera directly so it doesn't get reset when you restart your computer and all. This feature alone has been exactly what I wanted and made it worth the jump. However, the quality over the most popular webcam on the planet is indeed noticeable. The 60 fps capture looks brilliant but most meeting apps limit to 30 so you won't see that unless you're capturing or streaming at 60.The increased lens size does significantly improve image quality if you've got a good lighting set up. I still would love to have a proper mirrorless look for a natural bokeh, but it's hard to ask for more out of a webcam. I use a dedicated microphone so the lack of a built-in mic isn't a problem. In fact, I'm glad Elgato left that out because it's one less device for Windows to accidentally switch me to!",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a stellar webcam, but points taken off for serious issues. As other have mentioned, the Hub software has many issues... freezing, crashing, refusing to open on another screen etc.In my case, I had an ongoing issue where I could only use the camera once per reboot. After it turned off for the first time, it fully disconnects from the PC, no longer even showing in Device Manager. Tried different cables, power settings, USB ports, but nothing fixed the disconnect issue.When it's working, the image quality is stellar. I'll give the company a little time to refine the software issues, I'm sure this will be a fantastic product after things get ironed out.",

                "reviewText": "I went on the gaming websites and discovered the reviews on this Elgato Facecam and decided to get it. I am so glad that I got it. It has DSLR lens inside of the FACECAM and excellent focus. I needed a Facecam where I could control the focus so it was not doing the \"autofocus\". I needed \"focus\" only. I do sign language translation work and this FaceCam did the trick. I had a Logitech Brio 4K Pro webcam and it was just terrible - the video quality was very poor and it was always on \"autofocus\" which was very bad especially if you are signing in ASL. Also the APPs were not friendly with MAC OS. FaceCAM came to the rescue and I was able to download the APP onto my desktop and now I can do Zoom in, light adjustments, set to focus or autofocus, and many other options and features. It is wonderful to have that with the MAC OS and also have DSLR features in the webcam without having to pay for a DSLR Camera. Excellent quality videos. Price is right and worth it. I have been using mine everyday since I bought it and for several hours a day without any issues. It is very good quality. I bought two of them for using on my different devices.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as an upgrade from the Logitech C920 webcam. What a huge difference!The Elgato has a crystal clear image and a massive amount of control over the picture. ISO, contrast, warmth, noise reduction, zoom, frame rate, you name it! The software enables an easy preview as you make adjustments so it's very easy to see the results of any adjustments you make, even if you're unfamiliar with some of the technical terms.My only small complaint is that the supplied stand is a little impractical. I found that when you screw it in, if you keep it tight as possible the camera is not positioned to the front. Facing it front makes it a bit loose on the stand. I wound upgrading the stand with the SMALLRIG Super Camera Clamp Mount and now it fits perfectly with my set up. The camera is attached to a post off my desk and I can open and shut my laptop without disturbing the camera at all!Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "For the past 2 years, I had been struggling with a Logitech C920. Lighting was either too bright, too dark and trying to trick the camera into focus was an ongoing pain multiple times per day. The fact that settings are not stored in that webcam made it tough. I was constantly having to tweak OBS and the Logi software which wreak havoc with my green screen settings.The day I plugged in this Elgato Facecam, most of my related stress disappeard. This camera is so good that I can even use it without any additional lighting. It has to get pretty dark in the room before the picture gets grainy. I love the quality of the picture when compared to my C920. It is like night and day.Note: This does not have a built-in microphone. Not a problem for me but it is still something you should be aware of.My only problem with it is that it does not work when plugged into my USB docking station. It only works when plugged directly into my laptop - which is kinda defeating the purpose of a docking station. Based on my research of the issue, I suspect that my docking station just does not support enough bandwidth, even over USB-C. However, there are faster docking stations available which are compatible.If you are looking for a webcam with a good quality picture but don'thave the budget for a more expensive DSLR or mirrorless camera, you will likely be very happy with this camera.I am very happy with this purchase.",
