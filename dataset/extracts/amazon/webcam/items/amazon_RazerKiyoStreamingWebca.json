You can configure your zoom and picture settings in windows and it saves/carries the settings when using with my MacBook. Additionally there are third party apps which allow full control on the Mac also. I tested a few other cameras but when set this apart was the attractive build with no UGLY branding and build quality. It has soft padding which a tilt feature which is extremely useful for positioning! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My general Zoom/webcam space is very dark with not a lot of natural light. After bouncing back and forth between the Kiyo Pro and the Kiyo, I decided the cheaper option with the ring light was the best purchasing choice for me. Right out of the box, I was impressing with the compact size and quality of the camera. However, when I plugged it into my computer, my hopes were dashed very quickly.I tried this camera out at about 6 PM in the evening, so the sun had disappeared, leaving me with just the lamp by my computer. I am rarely ever using a webcam at this time, as most of my activity is for meetings during the day. As an avid gamer, I like the Razer brand, which is how I discovered this product in the first place. So, I began my configuration in lighting that I'd rarely ever use (my mistake). However, I did notice some important things.1. The ring light is way too bright if you are using this on a laptop in low light. Since I sit relatively close to my laptop screen, the ring light was a foot or so away from my face, and boy, it was not a pretty sight. I had to move far away from the laptop in order for the lighting to look remotely normal.2. The auto-focus in low-light wasn't that great.So, I moved to another computer (a desktop) in a brighter part of the house and plugged the camera in to see if I was totally out of luck. I was cheered by the fact that the camera looked great in a well-lit area. Great image quality, good reaction time, and the lighting looked wonderful. My hopes were restored! But I can't zoom from my desktop, due to sharing an office space with my partner. I needed to make this work for my laptop desk space.Well, I waited until daylight and reconfigured the camera using the Razer Synapse settings. Although I still had issues with auto-focus and how the ring light interacts with my green screen, the camera picture was much, much better during the daytime. The ring light also isn't as glaringly obvious with natural light helping it along.I'm content enough to keep this webcam because, with the right lighting, the picture/image quality looks great, although if the Kiyo Pro wasn't such a huge price jump, I might be tempted to give it a try to see if the sensor works better than this ring light...",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a Logitech 720p camera. The Logitech made me look like terrible for reasons I still cant figure out. It was grainy despite being 720p and it highlighted flaws.I thought lighting was the issue and rather than buying a \"selfie light\", I thought this would be better as it is integrated.It was pretty much plug and play and I can't believe the difference. The light is strong on it, adjustable mechanically by just turning the dial. It has a separate light to show you it's on, so you know when it's on. The quality of the image is super clear, and highlights not the flaws of my face, but the rest of my face. It's not grainy. The autofocus works great.I can't say enough good things about this camera. I know little about Razer, but I'll be keeping an eye out for their other products given how good this is.",
