                "reviewText": "This is an inexpensive but quality camera. It is plug-and-play (Windows 10). I needed it for my docked notebook. Replaces an older one that (different brand, same shape and dimensions) that had a separate lens cover that broke but that I can use for a travel-meeting camera. Looks like an upgraded version of my old one, but with the build in shutter and a better mount. Only used it once, but very clear HD image is fine for my home office and should suffice for the office environment.",

                "reviewText": "I was thoroughly impressed. For the price I was not expecting the highest quality but I must say this product definitely surprised me. Easy installation and setup. Using this for zoom/webex/teams/chime calls. At 1080p 30fps and the wide angle lenses my image was much clearer and sharper than my previous webcam and the built in cam on my laptop. I was told on last meeting I sound very clear versus built in mic on laptop which is a plus because before I was having to speak much more loudly than I normally do which made presenting awkward for me. Now I can do so more naturally. Great product for the price , you will not be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "The Nuroum web cam is a fantastic option for those looking for an affordable camera with good privacy features. It was easy to set up and integrates well with OBS, making it a great choice for content creators on YouTube. The wide angle lens is a nice feature, allowing for a wider field of view in video calls and recordings.While the quality of the camera is not exceptional, it is certainly adequate for the price point. The only downside is that the camera seems to struggle with adjusting color and white balance, resulting in noticeable shifts during use. However, this is a minor issue and should not deter potential buyers from considering the Nuroum web cam.Overall, the Nuroum web cam is a great value for the price and is a solid choice for those in need of an affordable and reliable camera for video calls or content creation.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this webcam after my Logitech C920 finally died out after 7 years. So I was looking for improvement in my video quality for my Youtube video content, and livestreams. However, I didnt have the budget to spend on a 4k DLSR setup. So off deal hunting I go! Well, this came across my search, and honestly I was just looking for a 1080p 60fps webcam. Well here are what the pros and cons are for this one.Pros- Price- 1440p 60fps (only says 30fps in listing shows up in OBS as 1440/60)- Privacy cover- Plug and Play ( I can only speak for its use in Linux (Garuda) specifically, but if its working there you can pretty much expect it to work in any OS)- Wide Viewing AngleCons- Default settings (Oh boy, so the short version, especially if you are a content creator, in OBS add color correction, and a color key filter to the source. For my case, it leaned really heavy to the blue end of the tint spectrum, so the image looked really dull, even with proper even lighting. Once that was adjusted the the image quality was good compared to even my Razer Kiyo I have as well.)- Wide Viewing Angle ( Can be a con for those looking for tighter focus)So once you get past the default settings and tweak them a bit you have found yourself a very capable webcam with some nice added surprises like 1440/60 that arent even advertised!",

Can;t go wrong here the cord however isn't very long maybe 3 feet so that works well for laptop but you would need a cable extension for to connect to the back of your pc.",
