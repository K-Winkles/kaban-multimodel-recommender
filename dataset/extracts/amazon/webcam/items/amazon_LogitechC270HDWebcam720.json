                "reviewText": "Pros: Cost, picture quality, ease of use. Plug-and-play with excellent picture quality.Cons: Picture quality is 720p and not 1080p, but this is hardly noticeable for most users. Can't beat the quality for the price point compared to other webcams. The mount is also not particularly secure when clipped to the top of your monitor, but not much different than with other webcams.Review: For the price point, it's hard to beat this camera. It was plug-and-play right out of the box, and has functioned excellently with zero issues or disadvantages while participating extensively in numerous Zoom meetings. It has very effective auto-focus that intuitively focuses on your face. Be aware that this auto-focus will automatically focus on the face of any newcomer who walks into the room within the scope of the camera though. If you're working from home or attending class in an area where people may be coming through the room next to your or behind you, the camera will focus on them when they come in range.This camera is only 720p and not 1080p, but this is not likely going to be noticed by most users if you're using this to attend Zoom meetings and participate in work or school online. The picture quality is crisp. The camera's mounting clip doesn't seem particularly secure or stable and it's easy to move the camera around. If you're not bumping into your monitor though, this shouldn't be much of an issue. It doesn't seem particularly worse than the mounting situation associated with other webcams. This webcam provides excellent quality and is a fantastic value at this price point.",

If you move around a lot, you may want a different cam and wider FOV. Some small \u201cfingers\u201d and gravity hold the camera on the top of the monitor. The camera can be adjusted up or down about 20-30 degrees. A microphone is built into the camera and gives decent sound. Bottom line: excellent value If all you need is a basic camera and microphone.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have a Logitech c920 for work that I absolutely love but I was wanting to add something to my 3D Printers for remote monitoring and timelapses that balanced simple, low cost, and good quality. After looking around the internet, this camera had a strong \"starter\" consensus so I chose to get one for my new setup. I have always had good luck with Logitech products so I wasn't too worried about the quality.This is a pretty standard webcam. You get it out, plug it into a usb, and you are on your way. Everything worked fine for my application but I was having some issues with the focus. This camera did not have any manual focus options so I had to search for a solution. Luckily, since this is for 3D printing, someone had created a manual focusing adapter that I was able to install on the camera to give it the additional features that I was looking for in order to create my timelapses. Once installed, this has been a dream.Overall, if you are looking for a first webcam for monitoring your 3D Printer, this is your choice. I have it up and running on Octolapse and have had zero issues with the camera.My biggest issue with the camera is that it has 720p resolution, but that's what you kind of get at this price point and I knew that going into it. At some point, I will probably upgrade to a higher resolution option but this will hold a spot in my 3D printer lineup for as long as its working, which should be a very long time!!",

I love how it allows me to focus on my main screen. The default settings work great for me, so no need for adjustments. The sliding privacy shutter is a big plus \u2013 super convenient and great for privacy, especially with the indicator light showing when the camera is in use.The built-in mic, while convenient, may not offer the best sound quality compared to external options. Personnally, I disabled the built-in mic to use my microphone. Highly recommend for anyone with a similar setup!Additionnally, It's worth noting that the 1080p resolution is just alright. It provides decent quality for meetings and streaming, which works fine for everyday use. However, if you're looking for that high-end, professional YouTube video quality, this might not hit the mark. It's more suited for standard video calls rather than for content creators seeking exceptional video clarity.",
