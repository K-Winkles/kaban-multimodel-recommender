I work from home in my basement without much natural light so my video quality on Teams and Zoom calls tend to be either washed out or dark. I saw this camera with the built in light and I thought I would give it a try. When I first installed the camera and used it in a Teams meeting I received several comments about how crisp and clear my video was coming through. I think the built in adjustable light has alot to do with it as my background is no longer dark and I don't have to try an overcompensate with overhead lighting. This is a very good camera for the price point.",

Also, sometimes is hard to position a laptop built in camera. This camera works great! It has a strong clamp, can be positioned where you want it, it has a pretty good lighting and it's really good quality.

The image quality was extremely grainy, would need a lot of lighting assistance, even with the attached one included. Very limited wiggle room to adjust the image as well. I personally did not test the mic, so I cannot comment on that.",

My laptop has a built in camera but the angle isn't the greatest - I clip this one on top of my monitor which positions the camera at a more flattering angle. It was really easy to set up and easy to make adjustments to mirroring and other settings. I definitely feel I'm getting a great value for the low cost.",

USE. IT'S. MIC. (It no good)",

Only complaint is I have two taller monitors and for where I want to put it, there's no space due to my set up. Thats not their fault but if it were smaller and compact, maybe I could have the ideal set up where I can work on other things while looking like I'm paying attention during meetings that should have been an email.",
