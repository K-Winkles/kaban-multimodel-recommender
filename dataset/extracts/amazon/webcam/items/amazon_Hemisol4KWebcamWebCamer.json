I don't do a lot of video meetings, but I had a couple on my schedule, and I wanted something that would do the job. This camera was a surprise out if the box, easy to install, easy to use and the picture quality is exceptional. The built in light works but don't expect too much from the light. A number of people on the other side of the video meeting have asked about my camera as it is so much better that some very expensive cameras. Buy this, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I hate this product and wish I could return it but its too late.1) The camera & light turns on by itself, and its very hard to turn off once it is on. After about two months of purchase it has been turning on every single night by itself when I am not using the computer. Makes me worry if someone is able to watch and listen.2) The little door feature that covers the camera isn't constructed well and looks sloppy as it doesn't latch closed in place, even when its supposed to be closed its always slightly open and looks messy.Since I can no longer return it I will likely throw it away and have to buy another one. I don't like the camera being on when I don't turn it on. Even if the door is closed I am assuming the mic is running too.",
