I purchased this camera after reading the favorable reviews. It came right on time, packaged well, and works wonderfully. I simply plugged it in, and used the handy tripod to position the camera the way I preferred. It works great- I have received comments about how clear the image and sound are. I really like the shutter that shuts the lens when I don't want the camera on. Additionally, the service provided is great. The instructions and information are minimal, and the seller provided additional info for those with questions. Even though I didn't have questions or any problems, it is good to know how conscientious the seller is in supporting the product. Highly recommended; great value.",

                "reviewText": "Started streaming about 5 months ago and i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this camera. At first it might be really bad, but with the proper lighting and applications on your PC that can control the settings of the camera (brightness, saturation, etc etc) it can get really good. I just took a screenshot of my stream which means its not really that good because in order to stream, the video gets compressed and the quality would be lower but nonetheless, out of stream, it looks very good. A lot of people have asked me what webcam I used and was surprised that it was only 20-ish bucks.. I really took a a chance on this and i\u2019m glad I did.I ordered another one for a dog cam for my puppy bc i love it much. For the record, I did get both my webcams on sale. AND without proper lighting the camera wouldn\u2019t look like this.I also don\u2019t know how the sound quality is because I wouldn\u2019t want my stream\u2019s mic/audio coming from a webcam but instead an actual michehe if any of my twitch viewers are here lmk if you see this \ud83d\ude02",
