Unfortunately this product doesn\u2019t fit very well with my setup and therefore doesn\u2019t get used. But it definitely holds up to what it says it does. My only complaint is that for the webcam I was using there was no real way to MOUNT it to the stand. It just kind of sat on the cushioned top Mount (but I may not be doing it right and may be using it improperly)",
