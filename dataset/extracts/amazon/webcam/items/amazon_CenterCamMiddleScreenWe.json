He and his fellow interns transitioned to remote-counseling using video-conferencing technology, but the young men they were working with were distracted by the tech. No one knew where to look. The rapport they had built fizzled out in spectacular fashion. Ian knew there had to be a better way. He realized that screen-edge webcams create a focal dilemma, where in order to create eye-contact, you had to ironically look away from the person you wanted to talk to. A search showed there wasn't a webcam on the market that was small enough to go in the middle of the screen, even if he could position it to create on screen eye-contact. Throughout 2020 he began developing prototypes and when he was satisfied with the quality of the camera, he launched Center Cam. The impetus for Center Cam has always been connections, and we're happy to share this new possibility with you!",

The flex arm that supports the camera has great adjustability and moves easily. I am able to set the camera at eye-level in the center of my 49\" curved monitor and the cable still reaches to my laptop that is setup on the side.Installation was easy; thread the cable through the clamp, set it where you want it, and plug it in.The quality of the picture is pretty bad. Not only ever so slightly fuzzy, but the brightness seems to be set on ultra-max or something. I can't install teh camera software on my work computer, which is the only place I need a web cam, so I cannot make adjustments there. Also, being bald doesn't really help me.I was able to get the brightness tolerable by setting my wallpaper to a black image (so it doesn't case much light), minimizing all windows (except for the Zoom window), closing the curtains in my office, shutting off the overhead light, and increasing soft light around my desk. This makes my work environment gloomy and unpleasant (for me) and I really don't want to go through these steps every time I need the camera. The attached image is after taking all f those steps. With my normal working environment I look like an over lit lightbulb.Yeah, definitely sending this one back.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Camera is very small and still provides clear video!",
                "reviewText": "Background: I manage a team of 14 technical resources and I often facilitate internal courses that have up to 40 students. My main monitor is a 55\" 4K curved display. When I am conducting 1x1s with my team members or facilitating a class, it is important for me to be able to look directly at the camera. With my large main screen, a camera below the screen tends to look up my nose and a camera above my screen focuses on my nearly bald head. Neither of these is acceptable. I have tried a couple of standard webcams on narrow stands, but both the stand and the cameras blocked significant sections of my screen.Positives: The camera, itself, is very small. It is very close to the size of a US dime (and smaller than a US penny). The camera is not visually obtrusive. Even with my big monitor, I am able to position it near the middle of my screen. The video quality is very good. It works well in moderately low light and works exceptionally well with ample light. I do not use the built in camera mic, so I cannot speak to how that performs, but the camera, itself, has exceeded my expectations. Other small cameras that I have tried were larger than this one and tended to provide a \"fisheye\" distorted image. I use this camera dropped from the top of my monitor. The provided clip feels like it is secure (no tendency to unclip or move) and still does not hold so tightly that it impacts the screen.Constructive: The stiff cable sleeve that goes from the clamp to the camera is about a third the width of the camera, itself. This is actually more visually impactful than the camera, itself. A narrower sleeve would improve this. The camera comes with a 62 degree lens. This was a bit too narrow for my purposes. The 80 degree lens is an option that I wish that I could have chosen when ordering the camera (instead of getting the 62 degree default lens). Better still, it would be great to have the option of having both lenses included.Bottom line: If you are using a large screen and need to be able to both use that screen and look directly into a camera that is level with your face, this is absolutely the best solution out there. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who's on calls and conferences pretty often, I thought this little gadget might help me up my virtual communication game. The promise of eye contact in a virtual setting? Sign me up!I was really hoping this would be a game-changer. In theory, a middle-screen webcam sounds like an excellent solution to the whole \"looking off to the side\" problem we've all faced in virtual meetings. But unfortunately, my experience didn't quite live up to my expectations.The main issue I ran into was the video quality. It was... well, not great. The images it produced were grainy and the overall quality was low, which made my calls less than professional. It was like going back to the early 2000s when webcams were just starting to become a thing.Don't get me wrong, I love the concept - it's innovative and aims to tackle a genuine problem in our now virtual-centric world. But when it comes to execution, there's a lot left to be desired. It's a shame really because I was really rooting for it.So, in the end, while I loved the idea of seeming like I'm making real eye contact during my meetings, the quality issues of the Center Cam Webcam were a significant downside. I was looking for a balance of connection and quality, but it seems like this one leans heavily into connection at the cost of visual quality. It's a great concept, just not quite there yet in practice. Maybe with a few tweaks and improvements, it could be a real winner. Until then, the search continues!",
