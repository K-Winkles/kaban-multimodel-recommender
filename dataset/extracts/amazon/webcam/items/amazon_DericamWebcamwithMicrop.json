I was looking for a good 1080p webcam that isn't expensive and now that most people are working from home, a webcam is necessary. Easy to install, just unbox, mount it where you want on top of your monitor or use the tripod with 3 adjustable arms and plug it into an available USB-A port.The 1st one I purchased arrived without the tripod and when I plugged it into 2 Windows 10 desktops and a Windows 10 laptop, it was not recognized in any of the computers. It did however come with the privacy cover. I contacted Amazon and they shipped another one immediately. The replacement worked straight out of the box and came with the tripod and privacy cover. Appreciate the support from Amazon. I have been using it for months and confirmed it works with all applications and the quality is amazing.Ordered this 2nd one Monday, 1/11 and received it Tuesday, 1/12. Worked straight out of the box and included everything.",

                "reviewText": "I got the camera faster than expected, and I was very pleasantly surprised with both image and sound quality. It can easily stream at 30 fps (if the computer can accept it). Unlike my Logitech C310, it does not produce error messages in OpenCV; I was very happy with that too. Sound worked fine under Windows 10, but couldn't get it to work under Linux (Kubuntu 18.04), but since I got it for video only, I didn't spend any time trouble shooting it there. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the camera doesn't indicate when it is actually sending video over the USB - the indicator LED is only indicating power - not video streaming. I consider that a privacy risk - I want to know when the camera is recording when I look at it. Another thing that would improve the number of uses would be a tripod thread (1/4\" x 20) in its multi function bracket. Since this bracket has a metal core, I could easily cut one in myself, and I am showing two of the use cases this would enable. At any rate, if this camera had a \"video on\" indicator LED instead of a power on LED, I would recommend it without any hesitation to everybody.",

                "reviewText": "Bought an Amazon open box special in a pinch. At this particular time it has been difficult to find a low cost webcam that could be had within a few days and this fit the bill - sort of. It was supposedly check and certified by Amazon as a working unit. With all of the video conferencing happening I needed a cam and mic for my office desktop and found this. Cam quality is acceptably good but the mic is distant. I have gone thru all of the comp and app settings and have everything maxed out. It's not worth the time and effort to return this cam so I will probably give it to my son to use for streaming, etc where he uses a dedicated audio headset. I will be looking once again for another cam to cover my own needs- probably one from a Logical brand that I have found through past purchases to be great quality.",

Well after trial and error with looking into installing drivers, etc., I realized I only needed to click on camera in my start up and it started to work. TIP: Do not pay for and install drivers. It was so simple. The quality is great, the sound is great and it was easy. I love it so far. Get investment for me and I am a first time user of webcams. The picture quality is better than my laptop. I can also connect it to my laptop and my desktop. I think I need a second one.",

The picture quality is great for the price. I prefer that my image be closer in, tighter, rather than the wide room angle so this Deri Cam is perfect. Sound quality in the built in mic is just okay. Set up is easy. Plug in, find your camera feature on your laptop or desktop so that it recognizes the webcam and you're done. The fact that you have a cord visible from the camera to the desktop is ugly to look at but for the price and ease of set up it's fine.",
