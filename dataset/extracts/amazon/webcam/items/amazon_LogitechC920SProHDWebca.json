                "reviewText": "ordered as renewed. Works perfectly. But the camera doesn't move on a pivot point, you cant change the side to side angle of the picture if you mount the camera on top of a monitor.Heck, my old Logitech camera that was at least 10 years old swiveled. I thought that this was a given.Other than that its fine. only 4 stars though because of the design defect. Unless it is supposed to swivel and the renewed people put a different mount on it. Comments?",
