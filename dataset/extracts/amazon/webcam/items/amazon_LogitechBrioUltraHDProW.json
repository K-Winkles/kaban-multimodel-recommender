        "description": "Look your best in most lighting environments as you work from home, attend business meetings, and stay in touch with family and friends via Zoom, Teams, and Skype with the BRIO Ultra HD Pro Webcam from Logitech. With a resolution of up to 4K Ultra HD and frame rates up to 90 fps, you'll be streaming crisp and smooth video, while RightLight3 with HDR helps create more even exposure in low light, direct sunlight, or high contrast conditions. A glass lens with a 5x digital zoom further enhances image quality and fine details, while dual omnidirectional mics with noise cancellation technology ensure that your voice is center stage. A field of view of up to 90\ufffd creates a wide-angle image that can accommodate more than one person. When you want to safeguard your privacy, engage the included privacy shade. To facilitate a more hands-free experience, an infrared sensor allows for login via Windows Hello. Compatible with Windows, Mac, and Chrome, the BRIO Ultra HD Pro connects to your host system using plug-and-play USB 3.0 Type-A, which is required for 4K video. It is backward compatible with USB 2.0, but you'll be limited to 1080p and 720p. It may be mounted using either the included clip or tripod mount.",
