You can place this center table and everyone is capable of being heard and seen without the unit itself or it's function become a distraction - looking at you PTZ cameras. PTZ's are great for streaming training or whiteboard presentations, but for a sit down smaller group video conference call, this unit is great.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: it can respond to where the sound/ movement is coming from and the camera will switch to focus on that person.Cons: video on mine wasn't very clear, especially compared to a much cheaper Webcam I have.Sometimes the video doesn't switch to the correct side very well. There's 4 cameras around the the top. At first it wouldn't focus on me from one camera, the only area I was showing up was from half of two different cameras (so the two made one complete picture). The only issue is there was a blurry line down the middle of the screen because of the gap between the two camera lenses.Also the audio was actually exceptionally poor.I was eventually able to get a single camera to focus on me, but still it wasn't the best picture and the sound is still bad.I would not recommend this for the price",

                "reviewText": "I got this camera to use for business meetings and like how sleek & modern it looks. The camera system is well made and feels solid. I thought the camera would rotate to face whomever is speaking, however, there are 4 camera at the top and they are able to detect who is speaking and focus on that person. There are 4 different modes of view, which includes a 360 degree view of the room. If you are just one person, you can set the view to Focus, which is similar to a webcam view.The system is plug & play and easy to use. The picture and sound quality are both good. At the time of this review, the camera was priced at $500 with a $150 coupon. I feel the sale price is reasonable if you are buying this for a conference room or need to accommodate 3 or more people in a room. However, if it's just you, I found the webcam built into my laptop works just fine.",

                "reviewText": "In our office we have a conference room camera system (eponymously named after a large-eyed bird), though I can't just take that with me to a different office or when traveling. This Toucan 360-Degree Video Conference Camera is an intriguing alternative. Out of the box, I plugged it in with the included AC adapter and USB cable and it just worked. My laptop recognized it and Teams selected it as an available video and audio source. I prefer that the controls are on the hardware, and do not require any software installs, since it makes for a more consistent experience when moving between computers and locations. The buttons on the top of the unit are capacitive (not physical) so you'll probably have to look to see what your pressing, though they do seem responsive. It's easy to switch between the difference views (split, focus, grid, and panorama), and the \"focus\" setting can lock onto a single person if they're using this as an independent webcam.Some small considerations (@Toucan - are you reading this?): when exiting out of a video meeting the camera will remember the mode I was in, but not the view, so focus defaults to the camera at the 3-o'clock position rather than over the LED indicator light; this is a small thing, but when I start a meeting I have to wait for the camera to focus on me and they use the button to lock the view again (rather than the unit just remembering it's last setting). The camera head comes off (and there is even an included plug to cover the connector on the top of the unit) but the Toucan didn't come with a carrying case. It's about the size of two soup cans (with the camera head removed), so while not large, it's still more than I can just toss in my laptop bag. I'm actually using a soft case for a telephoto camera lens, and that protects the body of the unit perfectly.So is this a good buy? For easy and portable video/audio conferencing it's a compelling choice, and for use in conference room where you don't have to pack it up and transport it, then it's a very competitive option. For solo use, I don't think the cost outweighs the webcam already built into my laptop.",
