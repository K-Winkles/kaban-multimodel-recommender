                "reviewText": "Due to COVID-19, web cams are priced 3X their normal price and my application for a camera is OctoPi so I can keep an eye on my 3D printer, I don't need sound. So I opted for this camera. Horrible quality. Also, OctoPi isn't able to reduce the frame rate and I had to add `additional_brokenfps_usb_devices=(\"32e4:9230\")` to `/boot/octopi.txt` in order to get it to work at all. The picture has green, horizontal lines that flash in and out at random places. Ugh.This rating form asks me to score its \"Sheerness\". Not sure what that is, so, average, I guess. The circuit board is pretty thin though, so, I guess 4 stars for \"Thickness\", lol.On the plus side, I tested it on Mac and on Linux and in both cases, no additional drivers were required. The fisheye lens adds a lot of distortion, but in my case, it allows me to see nearly the whole print bed, so, that's a plus.I literally would not use this camera for any other application and, TBH, once the pandemic passes and WebCam prices return to something resembling sanity, I'll likely replace this.",

I just tried on a different Linux computer with more up-to-date packages (Arch) and it worked much better. I haven't tracked down which V4L2 parameters to use for the improved behavior yet.The camera handles low light better than most other webcams I've tried. The picture is pretty sharp, but the colors seem less vibrant than most webcams. Maybe the typical webcam is software correcting for that, and this is just truer to the real sensor output? There is a lot of fish eye effect, and moving the camera seems to cause more distortion than you'd get on a high-end webcam. (but it's way better than a low-end webcam)",

I have a few of these cameras, and on some the screws were loose making getting a reliable focus difficult until I realised what the problem was.* The latest hardware does not match the image shown with the lens mounting being slightly longer and does not have a lens locking screw. The lens is 'fixed' in position by a waxy material that resists movement in the screw but still allows the focus to be changed.That means that if you need to change the lens (as I do) then you will need to source some more of the 'wax' or devise some other means of securing the lens in position.",
