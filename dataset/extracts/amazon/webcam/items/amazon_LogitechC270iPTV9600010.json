                "reviewText": "I have a multi-monitor, multi-laptop setup. Both laptops are kept closed as much as possible. For video calls, I was pulling one of the laptops out of its tucked-away location to use its camera, and found this cumbersome early on in the 2020 pandemic. Unfortunately, I was late to the game and all of the Logitech cams sold out quickly. I like the Logitech brand, I've been using their multi-device keyboards and mice for years with no issues related to the devices themselves (just older laptop issues). This camera is better in quality than my older 2012 MacBook Pro (which is my personal laptop). The one on my 2018 MacBook Pro (for work) is probably slightly nicer, but I still prefer to have the camera be external.The picture is a really great value for the money, it works in moderate to low light better than expected, so if you don't want to invest in video cam lighting, this is the way to go.",

I mounted it on my home computer monitor so it is up higher, and I can plug it into either my home computer, or my work laptop, and sit up straight during meetings. It also has a built in microphone and people can hear me perfectly. A great find, and much cheaper than some of the models out there, and still great quality.",

                "reviewText": "The picture quality is usable but not good. I was hoping for an improvement on my laptop built-in, but it's worse.The dynamic range is shameful in 2020 - if I am not careful with lighting then the entire side of my face with *indirect* window light falling on it is fully blown-out. I haven't seen this sort of pathetic dynamic range for years; for $40 in 2020 I expect more. This is what I'd expect from a no-name $15 camera.Beyond that - the physical, its designed for a screen bezel 20mm wide or more, otherwise it hangs down and obscures your display. I have to mount it with tape or putty to get it to sit higher and not block the screen. Its clamp also is designed for a deep monitor and *barely* manages a steady mount with a modern slim one.Overall, I'd say look elsewhere. I chose Logitech to get a solid product from a name brand etc.. Wish I hadn't, and feel like a sucker.",
