It has great quality and I'm able to adjust the brightness to whatever I need it to be. It's also nice that it can zoom in a fair bit, so I don't have to sit as close to my monitor. It has a cover as well, which is handy.It doesn't hold tight to the computer, but works fine if you don't move it around much. It comes with a small travel bag which is handy for hybrid work and always having a good quality camera.",

                "reviewText": "After watching youtube reviews I was honestly surprised. Was surprised that this is made from metal, and has some weight to it. Its not a cheap plastic webcam. Video quality when you get it setup stands out as professional, and not \"webcam quality\" The video quality is very sharp. It looks more like DSLR, or Front Iphone camera than webcam. Low Light performance in poor lighting is excellent. When I turned on a video light it was phenomenal. Color balance is great. Saturation is just right, and not over saturated. Auto Focus just works. Auto white balance just works. I had a mix of light from 3 LCD Monitors, natural daylight coming through windows, warm ish ceiling lamp, and a cool video light. Noise Cancelling mic is excellent. I could hear myself clearly with a box fan running next to me. The wide field of view and quality of auto focus would make this ideal for recording a room such as a meeting, gathering, etc... The only drawbacks are that you really want to be using it with the built in logitech capture app. That takes an extra step of setup in apps like zoom. But its worth it because the video quality is way better if you use the logitech capture software as a source for zoom etc..",

                "reviewText": "The camera, as a video camera, is good. Video quality is better than my previous Razer camera and with Windows Hello support it makes system access a breeze. My only gripe with the camera? The privacy shutter is terrible. It comes off way to easy and is just not what I'd expect from Logitech.The privacy cover just clips on (poorly) to the top of the camera and has a little flap/door you swing down to cover the camera. Logitech, you really couldn't just add a privacy shutter and switch?Other than the privacy shutter my only other complaint is with the cord. It's too thick and stiff and makes it hard to position the camera without the cord forcing unwanted movement.Aside from those grips everything else about the camera, you know the camera/video stuff, is great. Logi's software is intuitive, video quality is top notch and runs without a hitch. I really like Windows Hello and that is supported on this camera with it's 3d face supplemental camera.All in all it's one of the top \"streaming\" cameras on the market with good reason, especially for Windows users with support for Windows Hello.",

                "reviewText": "The Logitech Brio will put you in a good light. :-)Like many, I work remotely and often video conference with clients. The Logitech Brio was a vast improvement over my built-in web camera. There was no lag in meetings, and the video was always smooth.The Logitech Brio has a friction clip that allows easy and secure attachment to my monitor. It looks good next to Miles, Elvis, Prince and Moz! :-) The setup was easy: I downloaded some software and plugged in a USB C cable.The Logitech Brio comes with a standard thread in the base for a tripod.Three adjustable fields of view to allow you to select from headshots to room views. Focus and lighting can be controlled automatically, and I\u2019ve found no need to adjust the camera lighting manually. I use dedicated lighting when Zooming, and the Logitech Brio adjusts to that instantly.I use a dedicated boom mike and headset in a Zoom meeting, but I tested the Logitech Brio microphone, and clients had no trouble understanding me.The included software is intuitive and allows you to tweak your settings during a meeting. It\u2019s also the portal to update firmware.There is also a security flap to block your camera when not in use. I\u2019m probably paranoid, but I\u2019ve trained to flip down the camera cover whenever I\u2019m not using the webcam.In conclusion, the Logitech Brio is an affordable feature-packed camera that will improve the quality of Zoom meetings and other video-based communication. Once set up, it runs seamlessly in the background, showing you at your best.",
