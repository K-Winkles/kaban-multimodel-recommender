                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Value - DEPSTECH 4k Webcam - Designed for Hybrid workers!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've done a fair amount of reviews for webcams over the past 3 years in particular given in my profession I lead several project teams leveraging audio/visual technology where I can in order to enhance the virtual meeting experience to the same level as a live in-person meeting. There are many pros and cons of each and many depend on staff's technical level of knowledge.The new DW-50 4k Webcam with Dual Noise Cancelling Microphones is the consummate webcam that in my experience leverages the best experience that both a meeting facilitator and/or participant will have that makes sense focused on the practical daily application for those primarily that work both at home AND in-office with the same equipment. This means you need portability, practical features that can be used in both environments, and affordability. This webcam exceeds in all of those core categories.Portability: Small formfactor design that easily attaches to any monitor screen, back of a conference room chair, and even a tripod. Weight of webcam is negligible weighing about the same as a Parker ballpoint pen.Practical Features: Wide angle is perfect for individuals only or an individual flanked by 2 co-workers on either side of conference room sitting position. If camera is placed on nearby conference room furniture and nearest meeting participant is at least 2 feet away, this camera will capture everyone in highly necessary HD or even 4k detail making it probably the most practical camera a hybrid worker should have in their office gear.Plug and Play - This designation is critical. This means that the webcam itself and all of its features will function attached to any desktop PC or laptop (both Windows and Mac) and functions completely without installing a single software application. This is essential for the worker that participates or leads meetings in-office whether full time or part time. Organization Security restrictions on restricting the ability to install software is critical and necessitates almost all business's to not allow employees to have administrative rights to install untested software. This camera will function completely soon as it is attached to the computer.Remote Control of Webcam is ALSO plug and play. I've only seen a small handful of webcams where the remote control doesn't require a software to be running on the computer to effectively control the camera. This remote control works directly with the webcam allowing intuitive control over: Brightness, Contrast, Zooming in and out, Auto-focus, and even color saturation WITHOUT the need to install software. This makes the webcam useful without having to work with your organization IT team to test and review the software which can be a lengthy process. It will simply work. I work in a highly secure environment protecting millions of PII and PHI information that even detects whether anything inserted into a USB port that contains storage will alert Information Security and immediately blocks the computer from the network. Though this webcam has many controllable features, it does not require or have the capacity to function as storage whilst offering incredible control over how the camera performs.Affordability: Whether you have only 1 webcam or 20 (I love my gadgets), this should be the first one. I have never seen a camera less than a 100 with half of these features and the price with coupons brings that price down by much more (looks like $59). That is crazy cheap for a reliable, well built device offering features typically found in cameras above $200 US.Verdict: Must have for its dependability, sound clarity, and practicality for anyone needing a mobile solution that works with desktops or laptops that they have no control of with regards to installing their own software. I fully endorse this product manufactured by Depstech and as sold by Botan Direct. Depstech has been consistent in every product I have reviewed and Botan Direct as a reseller ships quickly on Amazon (received 2 days after ordering). Being a prime eligible purchase, test it for yourself. You have 30 days, no questions asked (or at least required), if even after use you decide it doesn't work for you and you will be refunded upon return (at no cost to you). Great job Botan Direct AND Depstech for excellent service and build quality.A+++++",

                "reviewText": "Great camera to supplement built in cams. I bought this to be an additional option to the built in cam on my laptop. I have a multi monitor setup and I don\u2019t like having to look toward my smallest display (the laptop) to have \u201ceye contact\u201d during calls when I have two 32\u201d monitors next to it. So I perched this on top of my middle display and it works great.There were no install issues. Plugged in the USB and it showed up as an option in seconds.The quality is definitely better than my built in webcam. That\u2019s nice but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m filming movies. 99% of the time it\u2019s my face on work calls. Doesn\u2019t exactly require 8K :)The remote is nice to have but I bet I won\u2019t use it that often. Cool to be able to adjust settings on the fly (like brightness, focus, camera and mic on/off, and flipping perspective) but I\u2019m guessing once I get the settings fully dialed in, it\u2019ll start collecting dust.Overall, great camera for the price. Comes with a fun little tripod too in case you don\u2019t want to perch it on your monitor.",

I have made several teaching and informational videos for various uses using this camera and I have appreciated its crisp quality and stable performance. I've even used it for a videoconference with a large audience and it worked very well. The mic is adequate, but I normally use a desktop one that gives me a more rich tone.

The housing itself is wide to accommodate the mics but well balanced, and the camera swivels and can be adjusted on the mount and stays in place once you get it set. It has a physical internal slide cover built in for privacy. The mics pic up just enough sound and the remote makes it easy to make quick adjustments (Zoom, focus, lighting, mirror, etc..), though it's rather large for a camera remote (not a downside, just an observation).The tripod it comes with is sturdy and telescopic, making it easy to adjust for varying heights.. The top monitor mount is adequate and it holds.Easy setup and overall very happy with the product.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this webcam for just over a month now and I must say I am very impressed with the picture quality and the 4K resolution.The camera has a remote which allows you to adjust settings such as brightness, contrast and saturation etc. It takes two AAA batteries (not included). The remote also performs other functions such as autofocus on/off and muting the microphone. The camera itself has dual microphones which provide a good quality sound, with noise cancellation.Also in the box you will find a tripod, which seems quite well made and could also be used for other cameras as well as it has a standard screw fitting.There is also a USB-C adaptor and instruction book. The instruction book is multi-language, clear to understand, but could have had bigger print. Having said that the camera is pretty straight forward to use and plug and play. I had mine up and running, in use without any issues at all. The camera works on all versions of Windows and Mac operating systems.The camera has a privacy shutter for when not in use and a good study clip if you want to use it with a laptop or similar device.I personally think this webcam is a great value for money. And a good quality product. Ideal for video streaming, conferencing, Skype, Teams and anything else you need a webcam for. I highly recommend it.",
