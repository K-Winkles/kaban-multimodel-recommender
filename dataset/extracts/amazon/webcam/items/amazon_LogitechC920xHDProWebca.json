I just needed something simple for work and apple FaceTime with my family. I couldn't be happier. I'm using a 2023 Mac mini running Mac OS Sonoma 14.2.1. I just plugged it in and it worked perfectly. I did read elsewhere that for the best connection, you should plug this webcam directly into the Mac mini and not into a USB hub. Not sure if that's true. Mine is plugged directly into the Mac mini with no issues. Hope this helps with us Apple users!",
