A replacement was sent out and it worked the way I expected it to along with additional control features that the previous did not have.

So this camera really helps me. I don't want to invest a lot because I don't use webcam a ton. The quality of this webcam is surprisingly good!! It has super clear vision and showing my face (hahaha) accurately. Very easy to use, just plug in and you can use it. Def will recommend this to my friend.",

I can't lie it doesn't have the greatest quality, it's kinda grainy but for school or zoom meetings this works wonderfully. 9/10",

I think if you were in a studio setting with perfect lighting it would be okay. But if your just setting it up for simple plug and play I'd look elsewhere. These two pictures are with the Zoom app running and Zoom auto-blurring the background. Most light is natural from a window on my right.",

The microphone on it is kinda mediocre - it picks up bassy lows very well, but not higher pitch. Also, the privacy filter is a good feature, but it's just a rubber cap made of a material that attracts dust and debris super easy. Would have preferred like some kind of sliding mechanism. I do really like the aesthetic design of the camera too.Overall though, if you just need a camera, this is a really solid choice. If you see it on sale, I definitely recommend it.",
