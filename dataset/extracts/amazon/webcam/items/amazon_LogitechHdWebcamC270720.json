It provides good enough quality that I look clear on camera, but not super high definition to the point where everyone can see every pore and blemish on my face. It was easy to use, just plugged it in and it worked with both MS Teams and Zoom. I like the status light on it because it makes it clear when my camera is in use. I did put a standard sliding cover over it and it stuck no problem and covers the whole lens area. The camera support is a folding assembly designed for a laptop so if your monitors don't have a flat back, it may be angled. This wasn't an issue for me, but I could see it causing some people trouble since it does not swivel from side to side, only up and down.",
