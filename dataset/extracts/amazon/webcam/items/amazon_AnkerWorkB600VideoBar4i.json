Though you will be disappointed if you were expecting bass for music.- Picture quality is very strong, and it does fairly well in dimly-lit conditions.- After initial setup it has been 100% dependable on my M1 Mac running MacOS Monterey across Zoom, MS Teams, and Google Meet.Cons:- It's a chunky thing and not something I'd use on a laptop screen and/or travel with.- Takes up a USB-C slot if you want to run it without the power cord. Not a huge deal, especially given that it replaces both a webcam + speakerphone.- Expensive. The use case here is really \"I want one device to handle both audio and video.\" and _not_ \"I want a nicer camera.\" If it's only video you're after you could do cheaper.- Built-in light isn't especially useful.All in all it's pretty easy to recommend if you want something to replace your speakerphone and webcam as it does both audio (in/out) and webcam quite well. It's pricey though, so if you don't need the combined functionality you could definitely find something cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "I received this product, and it feels like an Anker product quality. I Currently use it during my daily meeting. Originally I wanted to buy a Webcam to assist with my WFH, but I stumbled upon this product and tried to buy it. The image is clear, sharp, and natural. The thing that surprises me the most is the voice. When communicating with my co-worker, they said my voice felt very different and clear. I am using a mac, and I feel like the sound quality is better than my mac. But in terms of connection, I researched for a while and found that this product needs two cables to connect (a data line and a power line at the back of the product. It is relatively close). I have to say that the device is heavier than I expected. I don't think this product is suitable for placing on the laptop. I put it on my monitor. Overall, the B600 did improve my WFH efficiency, and I am still very satisfied with this product and its Worth it. Due to the arrangement of my desktop, I chosed a 20W charger from Anker and found that it works perfect :)",

So I have to stand my laptop up and put it behind the monitor.Well, space saved, but the voice from laptop speaker become remote. So I have two option.1, use monitor integrated speaker.2, buy a speakerYet, none of the above is a good option for monitor speaker is no quality at all. And my desk has no space for a set of speaker anymore.And Just in time, I found this all-in-one cam + mic + speaker. It fits my space requirement perfectly.As I opened the box, this product is definitely nicely packaged. So I will have another really good small goodies box at the end.And the cam stand is strong and fit even on my big thick new monitor. And very thoughtfully of the manufacture, they provide power plug for all area internationally. Apparently I have no use to.And the cam come with a light to suite for the needs of night conference.Eventually, after I hook up, the sound is crisp and clear, very nice quality. Definitely worth the price in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "This is a sharp camera that adjusts well to lighting conditions. Unlike most webcams this integrated mic sounds good - clear and natural. Many mics not on a headset will pickup keyboard clicks and so does this one- even way up on top of my 32 inch monitor. The built in light is okay and offers some color changes which is nice- it\u2019s just not that effective. However since the camera is so good you will probably not need the light much anyways\u2026. so in the end the camera has a good image which is what matters. Few cameras have speakers - this one does and they are pretty good for calls. They do make the unit heavy and bulky.The extra video features like zoom and tracking are great if you can install their software- on my work laptop that\u2019s not possible so the camera zoom, light control, etc do not work. This is not unique to this camera and with the on camera buttons you can at least turn the light on. For me having the narrower field of view was desired to keep the background of my room out of view and that\u2019s not possible without the software.I\u2019d say if you don\u2019t have or won\u2019t use headphones on your zoom/teams/skype calls this is an excellent step up- camera image, mic, and speakers are way above your built in. Most cameras have a very muddy mic pickup- this one is quite good. Without the software it may not be a high value vs cost option and the field of view will be wide. Get a longer usbc cable. If blocking the camera when not using it is important to your privacy then the built in way (rotating the light bar) is cumbersome and requires quite a bit of fiddling- for a high price camera that was a miss. Probably unrealistic to do that more than once a day.The price was a bit high and I was hoping for a bit more selective microphone pickup so I returned it. There are parts of this that work quite well though, including excellent image quality and a nice sounding mic- so this may work for you especially if the price doesn\u2019t bother you.",
