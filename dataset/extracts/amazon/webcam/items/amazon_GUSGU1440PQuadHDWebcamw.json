                "reviewText": "I wanted an external webcam for my MacBook Pro so that I could use my larger, external monitor instead of the MacBook's camera. I really like this webcam. The image quality is great - in my opinion it is better than my MacBook Pro's camera. One metric I am using to make that judgment is how well it handles isolating me when using a virtual background in Microsoft Teams. I usually wear a headset with a microphone boom when I am calls with my co-workers and the MacBook's camera struggles to isolate it, usually completely cutting off the microphone. The MacBook's camera also struggles to find the edges of my head, even though I have extremely short hair.This webcam can properly find the edges of my head and can also isolate the microphone on my headset easily. The lens is wider than the MacBook's camera and I like that. The webcam was completely plug and play. I just plugged it into my laptop and it was detected and available for use in Teams and Zoom. I also plugged this into my Windows 11 PC to see if it would just run and it was the same way. I didn't need to download any drivers or software. I just plugged it in and I could detect/use it in Teams and in the basic Camera app.I also really like that the camera can be closed and the lens is completely covered. There is no way that the lens can see anything when the camera is closed. Definitely nice from a privacy standpoint. The LED light can be switched on and off as needed. It doesn't provide much light in my environment but it's not bad if you need it.I recommend this webcam if you need a quality, affordable external webcam.",

The microphone works really well and I don't longer need to use my headsets as I used to with previous webcam.I was also very impressed to see that you can order free accessories and I like that the company is helping the environment by asking the users to request the ones that needed only. Excellent initiative !Also, thank you to Catherine in customer service as she was very nice and helpful with my request.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a high quality webcam.",

It was a plug and play on my computer, didn't need to download anything. Works great in OBS after fixing the settings. Definitely recommend buying this one folks.",

                "reviewText": "Estaba buscando una c\u00e1mara X porque solo la quer\u00eda para hacer pruebas con otras cosas (face tracking para simuladores) y no para video conferencias.Vi esta Gusgu 910 y se ve\u00eda muy buena para ser real, incluso todos los comentarios tiene una leyenda con \"recibi\u00f3 el producto gratis\" lo cual no daba tanta legitimidad. Pero la compr\u00e9 porque, de nuevo, no la quer\u00eda para algo serio.La calidad de construcci\u00f3n no se siente barata (comparado a su precio)La calidad de v\u00eddeo es impresionantemente buena, a la par de los mid-range de Logitech. Muy buen lente y se ve muy bien.Tiene un area touch para cambiar la luz y su intensidad. (Baja, media, alta para o luz azul o luz naranja para proteger los ojos).La \u00fanica cosa mala es que el cable es peque\u00f1o, talvez metro y medio.Viene con adaptador a entrada type-C pero no detecta la c\u00e1mara en Type-C (el adaptador funciona pero no con la c\u00e1mara (en una PC de escritorio))A\u00fan as\u00ed es 5 estrellas de 5. Sorpresivamente perfecta no s\u00f3lo para m\u00ed uso pero para todo.SI Compra esta web si necesitas una BUENA c\u00e1mara web.NO Compres si necesitas una TREMENDA c\u00e1mara web - algo como 4K o 60 fps.",
