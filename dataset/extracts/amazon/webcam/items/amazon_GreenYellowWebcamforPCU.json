Panicked, I quickly went to Amazon to find a replacement that was cheap because I didn't have much money (hence the looking for a job, folks). I was beyond worried because cheap rarely means good so I was very worried I made a mistake. Much to my surprise, this camera is amazing. Amazing camera quality (better than my laptop's!) And it was insanely easy to use. My laptop has a lot of stuff on it so I was worried I would have to install some random software and register it or something to use it this one time but it didn't require anything. It was ready to plug in and use within seconds. No installation, no additional software. Nothing. Immediately connected and ready to use on the software I had to use for the interview (Webx). Seriously the best value for the low price tag.",

I have a very old Logitech C720 and wanted to compare as this camera is listed as 1080p versus the 720p of the logitech. While it does do 1080p, the actual image quality(from the sensor size and processing) is about exactly the same even when its of a higher resolution. On the plus side, the cost is extremely low. A new C720 is still 25 and I got this for less than 20. So similar image quality, higher resolution and lower price. For a budget camera its a great deal, but don't expect any miracles. Sadly just because a webcam has a higher resolution it doesn't mean the image will have good quality. The sensor sizes are just too small to catch enough light.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a cheap camera and works as advertised. However, after a few weeks of using it people started saying my microphone was acting up and it looked like I had a black eye. Camera would start being glitchy and voice would cut in and out. For a cheap quick setup that you occasionally use it works; but if you need something for everyday use spend a few extra bucks and find a better camera.",

                "reviewText": "I hooked this up to a Surface Book 2 running Windows 11. Plug and play all the way. Picture looks great and my first video chat appeared to go off without a hitch. I was told that my audio/ video was great. Highly recommend! At this price, i am ordering a second to keep in my camera bag. Please note, it does swivel up down, but not left to right. The moni clip and a tripod mount allow you to adjust it sufficiently, and it has a decent 90 degree cam angle - so definitely not a game changer. BUY!",
