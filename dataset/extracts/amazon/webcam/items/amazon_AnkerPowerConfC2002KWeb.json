                "reviewText": "I bought this when my logitech cameara started to die. I love the zoom and quality of it. Great quality, especially when zooming in. However, I wish Anker's software allowed for video recording. You have to find a 3rd party software to record video, unlike Logitech.I love the built-in camera lens closer as well. The privacy function is great.",

Kollegen im Chat bemerken die deutlich bessere Aufl\u00f6sung als die Laptop interne Kamera. Wirkt somit in Konferenzen deutlich professioneller. Hilfreich ist die Software von Anker mit der man die Aufl\u00f6sung, die Art des Weitwinkels etc. einstellen kann. Einfache Montage und Ausrichtung am Bildschirm m\u00f6glich. Typische Anker Qualit\u00e4t. Lediglich der Autofokus reagiert manchmal tr\u00e4ge, wenn man sich stark in der Tiefe bewegt. F\u00fcr mich aber kein Problem, deshalb trotzdem volle Sterne.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this unit based on positive reviews. Arrived in pristine condition, couldn't tell this was a renewed product.Installed it on a desk mounted stand, updated the firmware and installed the AnkerWorks software (without it it has a really wide viewing angle that I find unsuitable for videoconferencing. If you're getting this to elevate your Zoom, Teams or Viber calls kame sure your IT allows the installation of the software. My corp environment does not allow it, so I can't avoid the wide angle.On my personal computer was faced with an issue that requires me to return the camera. During a video call there is an annoying ticking noise that is heard both from my side and from the other participants.I do hope that this is due to the fact I got a renewed unit (failed to notice that to be honest).In terms of image quality it was a very nice webcam with good contrast and accurate flesh tones.If you can get the software installed and you can switch to a narrower viewing angle, and your unit doesn't suffer from the ticking issue, all in all, a very capable webcam.",
