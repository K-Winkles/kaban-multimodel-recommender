                "reviewText": "I was hesitant at buying this camera, at first, because of the reviews, but I chose to do so anyway. Some of the complaints say that the camera doesn't work when you plug it in. Well, duh, no camera does until the software is downloaded and the window opens that actually shows video (like Zoom, skype etc)!The second complaint I seen was that the picture quality was blurry. Once the software is downloaded, there is an area that resembles an stereo equalizer where you can customize the brightness, contrast, clarity, hue, etc. to create the perfect picture that you want. This same area also controls video recording and picture capturing.There is also another software that comes with the camera for uploading and sharing.The reason I say that you must be techy is because you have to take time to read the manual that is provided to know what website to go to, to set up your camera properly. This camera has way more features than I expected, especially the video record. So far I love it!(I also think it is unfair to give low reviews when the person is the problem and not the product).",

                "reviewText": "Camera works great! Love the ring light feature, it is very bright so it works perfect in all types of settings. Obvious it's a small light so it can only do so much with lighting. I've seen some reviews complaining that it's not bright enough in a pitch dark room & I don't think it's meant to be. It's small but bright enough for you to be visible on camera.I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars because as other people have commented, there is a very slight wiring high pitch noise that you can hear on video playback. I mainly use this camera for work meetings on Zoom & my coworkers have told me the video quality is great and they can see me clearly but not sure if the noise is heard when you're using the cam live. My niece used my camera to record a project for her music class, and when playing back the video you can clearly hear the high pitch noise. It's minimal but for someone like me who notices the small details it definitely bothered me and was not happy about the video playback quality.Other than that the camera is great, has a long cord giving you enough length to mount the camera wherever you'd like. The grip is easy to apply to any monitor or laptop screen but it does take some time getting used to it. Overall I recommend for teens or for adults who plan to use this just for webcamming. If you're looking for high end quality video playback, look somewhere else.",

Have to order a new camera and retake my assessment plus pay for the retake!!! Frustrating. I tried it multiple times after and the same thing would work for 5 or 20 minutes then shut down blank screen and nothing... very disappointing I really wanted this to work cuz I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a camera but should have realized that it was worth investing in a reliable camera. Glad it's worked for other ppl",

Very satisfied with the image quality. It can easily mount on lots of types of monitors and also the conventional tripod screw mount.",
