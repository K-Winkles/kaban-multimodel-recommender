Doesn't affect the functionality at all, though, as this webcam works perfectly otherwise. Shows up in Device Manager as a genuine Logitech webcam of the expected model.",

                "reviewText": "Tried two different model cheap webcam brands before this one.... they worked, but it was impossible to get the right lighting conditions for them to have proper exposure.This camera auto focuses and auto exposes light conditions to provide optimum clarity to the subject.Don\u2019t waste your time, like I did, buying cheap options... spend a few more dollars and get a product that works perfect for web streaming right out of the box.",
