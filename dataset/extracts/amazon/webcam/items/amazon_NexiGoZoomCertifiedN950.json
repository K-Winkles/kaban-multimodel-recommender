                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Solid Camera for Remote Work",
                "reviewText": "With my usual remote-work setup, my laptop's built-in camera isn't an option, as I use attached monitors instead of the laptop screen. That's really no loss, as the built-in camera is...let's go with poor quality to be charitable. But that means I'm in need of a decent webcam and a light, as my workspace does have a window that faces me, the daylight can be obscured by the trees outside, the shadow of my monitor and plain old clouds or darkness.While I'm not so sure it's necessarily a good thing for my colleagues that this camera/light combination is good quality, as they're stuck seeing me relatively clearly, it does provide a professional appearance that's a step up from the older, lower quality webcam I had been using. With the light built in, it also saves me space atop my monitor, and a USB slot since I need only one.For some context, my most usual conferencing service is Teams, and I use a separate headset/microphone. With that in mind, I've found this camera to be reliable, easy to use and capable of delivering a high-quality video call. I also use a portable green screen behind me most days so that the background feature in Teams works a little better, and this camera is far better than my previous one at making the background look smooth--few weird bits of my room/screen tend to show on the screen, just me and the backdrop.The 1080p quality is noticeable, and that's the step up from my older 720 camera. I look...less fuzzy, for lack of a better term. I can still soften the focus with Teams's filters. I always looked a little harsh on the previous camera, now I look more \"real,\" without the odd sort of jagged edges. The built in light also helps with that, as it directly surrounds the camera, instead of needing to be mounted next to it, and angled awkwardly, creating an inevitable \"Phantom of the Opera\" type shadow effect on my face. I also wear glasses, and while I do sometimes see some reflection of the light with this camera and light, it is nowhere near as bad as the annoying circle of light I would see reflected in my lenses before, with a fairly standard ring light setup. The light has three modes (I usually prefer the cool mode) and you can control the brightness by holding the button at the top of the camera (a light tap switches mode, a press and hold changes the brightness).I'm also a fan of the somewhat narrower field of view on this camera, 78 degrees. While still considered wide, this is, to me, far better for a single user than the 90+ degree cameras out there. Those tended to make me as one person on screen look ridiculously small relative to the background. It also might be better to have a narrower field of view if you want to keep people from having too much of a look around you at home.Also easy to use is the built-in privacy slider. In lieu of an obvious cover over the lens, you simply slide a lever and a red disc slips over there camera letting you know it's covered up and should slide it back before trying to go on camera.All things considered, I'm quite happy with this webcam/light combination. It's been an improvement to my remote working, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Nexigo webcam. I have the N940E with ring light that I use for work at the office, as my office is dark. I got this one to use at home, where the light changes all day long. Today I had the opportunity to run the webcam through a variety of lighting environments and to test it under all-day use. I on Zoom all day one day a week, so I was just itching to give it a go. I fiddled around with it for a few hours yesterday to get used to the remote and familiarize myself with the settings. This camera is different from my other one but they use the same software. Interestingly, my N940E doesn't give me the option to adjust the hue, gamma, or backlight comp, or to set gain, focus or roll, the Nexigo software does not allow me to change the hue or the roll. I wonder if different cameras have different customizations. I will do some more research on that at a later date. As far as this particular camera goes, I find the customization adequate. I mostly want to be able to soften my face and use a couple of Zoom filters if I don't feel like going full makeup and I was able to do that today. I like the remote control a lot. It is very responsive and it has a number of functions, including 2 presets. I saved one of my favorite setting configurations today and it was quick and easy to do. All in all I have to say I really like this webcam. The 5x Zoom is awesome. It works well and does not distort the view at all. I have included some shots from today with different settings. I like the last one best, as it is the most realistic, but the others are softer and gave me a little more color, which I can always use. The one shortcoming I am still trying to figure out is that when the lighting changes significantly, the camera does not seem to adjust for that. I had to manually change settings to compensate. It's very quick and easy, but it would be great if the camera automatically adjusted.If you are on the fence about this camera, I would say go for it. I got it for $20 off, I assume because there is a newer version just coming out, and that was what tipped me over the edge. I feel like it was a smart purchase for as much as I am on Zoom these days.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera both for work and for discord calls with my buds. This camera, overall, is a mostly high quality product and is definitely an upgrade over my previous webcam. Hardware-wise, the unit is very solid, with mounting solutions for both on monitor and a hole on the bottom for a tripod, which is a nice touch.Installation was completely plug and play; worked within seconds on my Windows 10 machine.The picture quality is excellent, and definitely a testament to the value of upgrading to a 4K camera. The automatic backlight compensation (activated by a button on the remote) works well, and helps since I\u2019ve got a bright window right next to my desk. Speaking of the remote, it\u2019s super handy to be able to adjust settings on the fly, rather than having to go into software each time you need to change something.The microphone built into the camera is decent, but you might be better off having a dedicated mic. However, the active noise cancellation used works quite well, eliminating any background noise from my stream.Finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, the manual for this thing can sometimes be unclear, not really explaining the function of some options. However, with a little messing around I found it pretty easy to figure out. Another snag is that when you switch between some options on the camera, such as turning the backlight compensation on/off, you have no indication whatsoever on the camera itself, so it\u2019s hard to gauge what options you have enabled. Another reviewer mentioned hitting the home button when you turn it on, which sets everything back to default, and THEN activating the buttons. I\u2019ve found this method to be my go-to.",
