                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been doing Zoom physical therapy and personal training sessions since the beginning of the pandemic, and got tired of constantly repositioning my laptop with its built-in camera so the therapist & trainer could see me as I moved through the exercises. I knew PTZ cameras existed, but they were prohibitively expensive. When I saw the 1080p version of this camera, I figured I might as well try it\u2014but didn\u2019t expect much, because it was a fraction the price of other PTZ cameras. Turns out it works shockingly well. Setup was pretty much plug-and-go. I did download the app so I could choose the settings that worked best for my use case, but I think even that is optional. The video quality, according to the therapist and trainer, is very good, and the built-in audio is good enough (I think it works with external mics too, but haven\u2019t needed to try one). Its optical zoom range is not quite as long as some of the more expensive PTZ cams, but it\u2019s enough for my purposes. It does a great job of tracking me as I move around: the only times it has stopped tracking are when I\u2019ve been flailing around with my hands during the exercises, probably unintentionally making the hand motion that instructs the camera to stop following. All in, the earlier version of this camera has been one of my best tech accessory purchases. So much so that when I needed to set up another location with a camera, I bought this new 4K version. Works exactly like the 1080p version, but with even better video quality. Even my husband\u2014who is very much NOT a gadget freak\u2014liked this camera so much he now uses it for his work Zoom meetings.",

                "reviewText": "I gotta share my thoughts on this Webcam \u2013 it's seriously changed the game for my video calls and streaming setup.First things first, the video quality is off the charts. The 4K resolution makes me look all sharp and detailed, and whether it's a work meeting or a livestream, this webcam makes me look like a pro.The PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) feature is like magic. I can adjust the camera angle and zoom in or out without getting up. It's a real lifesaver when I want to switch things up during a call or stream.But here's the real star of the show: the AI-powered tracking. This webcam can follow me around, keeping me right in the center of the shot. It's like having a personal camera operator for my streams \u2013 seriously cool.Setting it up is a breeze, and it works with all the major video software I have used. Plus, it's compact, so it doesn't hog my desk space.The built-in mic does a decent job, but for the best sound, I'd still recommend an external mic. That's a minor hiccup considering how awesome the video quality is.In a nutshell, the OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K Webcam is a must-have for anyone who wants top-notch video quality for work calls or streaming. It's like a pro-level upgrade for your setup that's surprisingly easy to use. I'm loving it!",

                "reviewText": "I don't really use the AI tracking or gestures, but having present camera positions and zoom for sitting and standing are nice. Most of the \"Beauty\" settings are stupid gimmicks that you'll never use, the background blur being the only one of interest. It works ok but it's entirely CPU based and thinks a couch behind me is a chair headrest so it never blurs it. I just end up using other background blur options. All in all the App is ok, only use 5% of it's features but they're on several different tabs, it would be nice if I could consolidate them to one screen and hide the junk.That said, the camera quality is excellent in all conditions. My office has windows to the east and west so in the mornings I'm backlit and in the afternoons I'm front lit, in both cases the camera performs exceptionally. It also works well in low light situations.You always know when the camera is on or off because of an LED on the front and the fact that it physically looks down when it's off. When you stop using the camera it will automatically turn off and look down after a couple minutes so you don't have to go digging in the App. Similarly it will wake back up when accessed.I haven't had any issues with it yet and it works reliably. I'm very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Reviews were very good but I was skeptical that this camera would actually do what I wanted to do. I have a 1200 square foot gym split up into two separate rooms with a division in between. I have a 55\" screen that can be seen in both rooms at around 90% from anywhere, but my Logitech 4k camera cannot see everything clearly from one location. In order for a stationary webcam to do with this camera does, you have to move it manually when you move from one room to the other, major pain, especially when you're in the middle of training intensely.The whole purpose of the setup is to be able to train with my trainer working remotely. I tried several different spots with with the Logitech 4K stationary cam, but nothing worked. And those cams don't have automatic zoom, or gesture driven zoom. They are similarly priced to this one but video quality is not quite as good.I installed this camera, set up motion tracking and hand gestures for zoom, as well as my maximum desired zoom level, and it gets me everywhere on every single machine during every exercise. Using the motion tracking feature, which is one of three ways to have the camera track you as you move, is as slick as having a camera man there. It's continuously moving subtly while it's tracking you.The only other option was running an app that would allow me to run two cameras, and even that wouldn't work as well as this, not to mention that it's a nightmare trying to get webcam apps to run more than one camera at a time. This was the perfect solution, with no caveats. I tested it using the camera app in Windows, and I used it in Skype for my training.I used the USB 3.0 port, as that's all that's available to me on that particular PC, and this thing runs at 4K perfectly on a 10-foot cable. I've never seen a webcam with all this functionality at a price even close to this, and it does everything it purports to do, perfectly. I wish my security cams would do with this camera does!",
