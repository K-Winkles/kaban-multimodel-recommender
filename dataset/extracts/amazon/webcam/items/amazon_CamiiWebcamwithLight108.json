I found this one with very nice specs and a great design, and I had to get one to try. I was not disappointed; this one has worked out great. First off, very easy to install. I like how this one is just plug-and-play. I also like that my streaming software is compatible, and the video and audio drivers are also picked up automatically for that. Secondly, it works great. I like how crisp the picture is and how well the focus is in the foreground and background at the same time. I also like the true-to-life built-in microphone with no audio loss or distortion, and it syncs perfectly with the video output. Hard to show how nice this one is with just pics, so I did a sample video to show. Lastly, the light. I like this ring light because It is soft and bright, has little reflection, and provides an amount of light for the face with no shadows. No cons, it worked out great for me, and I am very happy with the purchase.",

Just plug in the usb (also comes with an adaptor piece) and open from settings or with a video app. The tripod is small on only a few inches in height. The tripod screws in and out easily and the lip of the base sits properly on the laptop. I got because the camera on the laptop is not great (cuts out randomly) and I hate how I look on video calls/meetings. No more issues with the camera cutting off, which is really important. Perfect for on the go use. The picture quality improvement was not enough for me. Even with the backlight on the rim, there wasn\u2019t much difference. A lot depends on the other lighting in the room, which usually can\u2019t be significantly adjusted unless you are at home. It\u2019s good for video calls and meetings but I wouldn't recommend for recording videos for work or business purposes.",

                "reviewText": "The best part is how easy it was to get started with it\u2014literally plug and play, which was perfect for someone like me who isn't too tech-savvy. It also comes with a handy privacy cover, which is a simple but appreciated feature for added security when the cam isn't in use.The adjustable ring light was a standout feature, especially for those late-night Zoom calls, giving my video feed a much-needed boost in appearance, although it's not quite strong enough to light up a room. It's definitely a step up from my laptop's built-in camera, offering clearer video quality, but it's important to temper expectations. The picture can still appear grainy in lower light, even with the ring light on, which suggests it won't rival the clarity of newer smartphone cameras.I found it to be decent for daily work calls and the occasional streaming. The inclusion of features like the privacy cover and built-in light adds value, making it a worthwhile option for those looking to enhance their video call setup on a budget. Just keep in mind that while it improves your video quality, it's not going to blow you away if you're comparing it to high-end equipment. Overall, it's a practical choice that strikes a good balance between functionality and affordability.",

                "reviewText": "So lets get one thing clear. This is a 50$ webcam. So don't expect high quality video or pictures. But it does have better dynamic range and frame response then my old 2015 iMac's webcam.The build: This is an all plastic product with the exception of the small metallic lens accent peace and the tripod mount. Witch is made of a pliable hardened polymer. The camera's resolution is only 1080p. There is a small ring light that helps to eliminate harsh shadows caused buy poor lighting conditions. There is a long usb-A cord and a usb-A to C adapter dongle. That is included in the package.The picture quality:The images produced are comparable to an iPhone 6 at 1080p resolution. Although the images look similar with grain and video noise. The dynamic range is slightly better overall. Giving you a more complete picture with slightly better contrast. Don't expect high dynamic range, or high fidelity skin tone reproduction. Don't worry you won't look terrible but. It just cannot compare to the latest phones and tablets on the market.ring light:The thing that sets it apart is it's integrated ring light. But this feature lacks in overall brightness. Again it does mitigate the harshness of shadows and can act like a softer * fill light. But it can't even compete with ambient lighting in a room. So it might be better used in a late night chat session with the lights down low. To see an overall change in picture quality. The ring light has capacitive touch dimming with 4 modes. You can change colour temps from warm to cool. But warm would be your best option, since the white balance can get thrown off with the cooler colour temp.The mini tripod:This is a cool little addition that i found to be really nifty. It's an octopus style tripod made of ( flexible polymer ) that can be positioned and attached on different structures. It does give enough steadiness to the overall product to be a useful addition. It screws on the bottom with a traditional mounting point.Final thoughts: If you are looking for a cheeper webcam with an integrated ring light with capacitive touch. Then this little unit might be the right one for you. Even with it's flaws it does offer a nice package that has some really great ideas That sets it apart from others within this price bracket. My overall rating is a 3.7 out of 5.",
