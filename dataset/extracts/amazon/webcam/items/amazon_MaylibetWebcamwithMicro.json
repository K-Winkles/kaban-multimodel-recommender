                "reviewText": "Cameras, like keyboards and mice, are often a personal choice for nuanced reasons. Let's be clear, this camera is not the sharpest optics out there. The audio is okay, but I wouldn't memorialize anything I do with this.If you needs are zoom, teams, and facetime then this camera is fine. If you're filming demos and want production quality you're probably going to need to find a different option.I use this as the second webcam in my setup, really for use when I use my work computer with my home setup and don't want to use the built-in webcam on the laptop because of the angle (and because corp IT won't let us use our built-in webcams with teams for some reason). Anyhow this works fine. It's absolutely comparable to my built-in webcams, and in addition it has a nice cover so I can close it when I'm done and know I'm not inadvertently being spied on.Like most other comparably priced webcams, the mount on this sucks. You place on top of your monitor and move a hinged piece to \"secure\" it by friction. Yeah - lousy design and no one seems to have improved upon it, but it works if you don't move your monitor around too often. Audio is \"iffy\" as I have mine on top of a 27\" but am often speaking into its sister monitor. I guess that makes for bad optic karma anyhow as it looks like I'm probably doing something else during my calls, but well... anyhow as I said the camera is fine, but the optics are not sharp and the mic isn't the best, but for the price and for non-professional use I think its just fine. No need to replace, and wouldn't expect any improvement with any other device at this price point.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars About what you might expect",
                "reviewText": "Unboxed the camera and saw it listed as Full HD 1440 - which is two different standards. Full HD is 1920x1080, or 1080P. QHD is 2560x1440, or 1440P. The listing said this was 1080P, which matches the Full HD portion of the label, but I thought maybe they were underselling it. Spoiler: they weren't. It is indeed 1080P, so that is just a slightly confusing label on the box.Next step; I am one of the very very few people in this post-pandemic world who has not yet had or used a webcam on my desktop computer. Nope, never. So, I pull out the very brief instruction 'booklet' (a single small page folded in fourths), and I find that it has nothing at all addressing how to mount this to your monitor or laptop or what have you. There's a foldy-part which is padded inside, and had a little 'lip' on one edge, so I figured it must somehow clip onto the top inside that area. But there is no tension or spring action, and while I could get it to rest there fairly successfully, it fairly easily just fell off behind my monitor. There's also a strip of thick foam in the box, which I have zero clue what it is used for - I'd guess it relates to mounting it, but I am in no way sure. However, the foldy-part can angle the webcam up, so I can sit it on my desk and aim it at my face. Which I am currently doing. Giving anyone I might chat with a view mostly up my nose. I kid - it is not THAT bad. But it does seem to me to be a bit of an awkward angle.So next I went to webcamtest.com and onlinemictest.com to verify this webcam is up to spec. I had no idea those sites existed before, but I googled how to test a webcam, and they came up.The first tells me that this is a 2-megapixel 1080P webcam, and it is roughly in the average range for quality, I won't post every single result to bore you. I will mention it came out at 17 FPS, which is NOT the 30FPS promised in the listing. The second site had fewer details, but it had a constant running FPS display in the top corner, which I saw hit mid-20s a few times, but typically hovered between 16 and 19 (more 16 than above) - so the overall average is likely the same, 17 FPS. I don't know if that is a big deal to anyone else, but it is not a big deal to me. Just figured I would share for those to whom it might matter.All in all this is the best webcam I have ever had. It is also the only webcam I have ever had. And the worst webcam I have ever had. But it seems to me to be average or better in most every way I can tell, so I am giving them 4 stars.",
