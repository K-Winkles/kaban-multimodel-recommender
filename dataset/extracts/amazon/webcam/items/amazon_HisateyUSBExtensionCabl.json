                "reviewText": "I have only had this cable for two or three days, so be guided by other reviews on durability. That said, it's been a lifesaver. I got a new computer with three monitors. I put the desktop tower on my desk, and the monitors are BETWEEN the tower and the keyboard/mouse. My keyboard and mouse are a pair controlled by one usb chip-thingy that plugs into the tower's USB port. Even though my keyboard and mouse are about TWO FEET from tower, they were performing poorly, apparently due to the monitor blocking the signal. I had to put them up on the desk and close to the monitor, contorting my arms and neck for the whole workday. I decided to buy a cable like this, to allow the USB chip to dangle down the back of the tower to a point where it was below the monitor in the hope that that would solve the problem. I was worried that 1) it wouldn't work and 2) putting a cable between the USB chip and the tower would ALSO degrade the signal and cause the keyboard and monitor to be unresponsive. Well....I'm happy to report that my fix worked completely. There's no lag or anything. A complete fix. So if the cable lasts, I'll be completely satisfied.",
