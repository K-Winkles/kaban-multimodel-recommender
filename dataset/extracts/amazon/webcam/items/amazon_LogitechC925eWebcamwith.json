                "reviewText": "Since working from home due to the pandemic, I began using the Logitech 930e in order to keep my laptop closed and allow me to work on my two monitor setup. Now in hybrid mode, I wanted to do the same for my work location. This time I chose to try the 925e since it still has the H.264 hardware encoder like the 930e but in my opinion looks a little more modern and I also like the built in, sliding, lens cover. Th 925e has a narrower viewing angle than the 930e but since it only is covering me during the meetings, it is a non-issue for me.Overall, I am very happy with the 925e. The video of me is so much better balanced and higher quality than the built-in webcam of my HP work laptop. It installed just as easily as my 930e without any need of additional drivers (on Windows 10) and the Logitech Tune software allows me to adjust the camera angle and picture settings easily. Highly recommended.I wo",

Easier for anyone to setup and go.",
