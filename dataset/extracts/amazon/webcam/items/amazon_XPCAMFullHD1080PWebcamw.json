                "reviewText": "I bought this camera so I can keep my MacBook Pro cover closed to save room on my desk and make use of my large, curved monitor. As a pure camera, it works great and the set up was simple. I use Zoom and MS Teams for most of my video calls, and this camera was easy to find/configure with both of those apps. My only negative is the sound quality. When you use the camera, it also forces you to use the built in mic. I'd rather use my MacBook mic, but it won't let me when I use the camera. And the sound quality is a lot thinner and tinny. With Zoom I could enhance the sound a bit, but it's less quality than the MacBook provides. A nice addition is the flip cover, so you can maximize your security and blind the lens when you don't want it operational.",

                "reviewText": "Generally, this webcam has worked fine when using it for about 30 minutes at a time, but after that it either is marked as \"USB device malfunctioned\" or the video starts strobing and being completely unusable. After this happens, I have sometimes been able to fix it by unplugging the USB and plugging it back in, but more often than not, it just doesn't work at all as a video source. Also worth noting is that when I took the privacy cover off, it would take a few seconds to shift the lighting away from being a deeply purple saturated color. I am also not convinced that the video is 1080p, as it has nearly always been grainy enough that I could easily see the pixels especially around the edge of my face.The microphone is low enough quality that I have been informed nearly every time it defaults to being the audio source for my computer, and I have to manually change the source to my headphones which have a reasonably good microphone or built in computer audio when on my laptop. The first comment I got after getting the webcam was that it sounded like I was underwater.The microphone has been an issue since day 1, and the video worked for probably a month or 2 before starting to malfunction, being used at most once a week. The main redeeming quality is that the price was low enough that I don't feel terrible for having wasted $20 now that I'm going to buy another camera.",
