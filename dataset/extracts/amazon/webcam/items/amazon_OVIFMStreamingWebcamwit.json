I noticed another use review that said they used this camera with their printer and decided to give it a go. I am not disappointed.Everything worked out of the box and I've had no crashes or issues with it being plugged in and on for a few weeks.The picture isn't 4K, but I didn't want/need 4k. The images in low light are a bit grainy, but turning on the camera light allows me to get a solid view of whats happening even if the light are off. (I've included 3 images from the camera under different light conditions full sunlight, overhead indoor lighting, and camera light only). Overall I think the camera quality is good, the build quality is solid, and you really can't go wrong with this device.",
