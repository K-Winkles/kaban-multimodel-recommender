Upside down. And was having difficult time, reading the descriptions, determining which one to purchase.While the description of this Angetube 967Pro camera does not mention rotating the image, I was impressed by the reviews, the resolution, the zoom feature allowing Field of View changes, and the integrated ring light.All of which perform extremely well.Bonus is the fast auto focus, and the easy to use resident control panel for contrast and other video qualities.Have not evaluated the microphone as I have a dedicated one for my system.Very satisfied with this product, would buy again and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "ORIGINAL REVIEW: WOW - this webcam exceeded my expectations. It looks and feels high quality. It's solid and doesn't feel like it'll break if you look at it wrong. I love how it perches securely on my laptop lid (no suction cup or clamp needed). The cord even comes with an attached velcro cord wrap.I wasn't sure if my work laptop would accept the hardware, but it worked immediately once I plugged it into the USB port. No lag, no problems.I thought the quality of my laptop's webcam was good, but holy cow was I wrong. This webcam is so much better. I also thought my room was just dark and/or shadowy and that a ring light would fix it. However, I think that I just needed a better webcam, because the lighting is tremendously better even without the webcam's ring light on (see photo - left is my laptop's webcam, right is this webcam wo the light on). Serious difference in quality and lighting.I highly recommend this webcam.UPDATE after 3 months of use: Still works great. Still love it. My husband bought one for his office and they're loving it too. I had the chance to try the Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam and was shocked at how poor it performed compared to the Angetube. It struggled to focus on my face, the picture was much darker, and it gave everything a weird tint. If it was the first webcam I tried, I would have been really disappointed and probably gone back to my laptop camera.UPDATE after 1 year and 10 months of use: Unfortunately, this little camera is no longer so great. The hinge on the stand/clip bit is so loose, that it falls open 3\" before it catches itself. This makes positioning it on my laptop screen really hard. It falls off very easily now or gradually opens wider and wider, until the camera is pointed at a weird angle. It's really easy to trigger the ring light when I'm trying to fix its position (and I still never use the light, so it's a pointless feature for me). The video feed has also started failing occasionally.",

Buono il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo.Questa webcam \u00e8 l'evoluzione della Angetube 967.A differenza della sorella \u00e8 di dimensioni pi\u00f9 contenute e ha uno zoom che raggiunge il 5x e un microfono stereo.Qualit\u00e0 eccellente per la facia di prezzo (lo vedete nel video).Con un tasto sul retro si pu\u00f2 switchare da HDR Fullhd 60 fps a HD 3o fps, funzione molto utile quando in video conferenza si soffre di poca banda in upload. Senza dover spegnere la webcam puoi abbassare la risoluzione e rimanere visibile.Rispetto alla 967 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 veloce nel mettere a fuoco e nell'adattarsi alla luce.Dichiarato che usa un sistema di codifica H265 quindi permettere di trasmettere in alta qualit\u00e0 usando meno banda rispetto ad altri sistemi di compressione meno recenti (da confrontare con alte telecamere per fare valutazioni su questo fronte)Lo zoom \u00e8 impressionante, arriva a 5x senza perdere di qualit\u00e0, la consiglio per chi ha monitor lontani o comunque non voglia avere ingombri vicino alla postazione di lavoro.Ha il supporto per qualsiasi cavalletto. Io uso un treppiede (octopus) ed \u00e8 molto stabile una volta montata.La luce ad anello si pu\u00f2 regolare di intensit\u00e0 \u00e8 \"dimmerabile\"Non ho capito perch\u00e8 abbiano introdotte un pulsante fisico per regolare la luce quando lo puoi fare premendo in qualsiasi punto della parte frontale.Non ha la regolazione della temperature della luce ad anello che rimane abbastanza fredda. Non lo vedo un problema perch\u00e8 comunque la qualit\u00e0 dell'obbiettivo \u00e8 buona e i colori sono sempre naturali.Da migliorare:Speravo di pi\u00f9 dal microfono stereo, c'e' un leggero fruscio di fondo ma \u00e8 comunque migliore di un microfono da laptop non top di gamma.Il coperchio fisico per chiudere l'obiettivo un po' \"rigido\" . la telecamera si muove quando lo chiudi , devi quindi tenerla ferma con le mani se \u00e8 appoggiata al monitor",
