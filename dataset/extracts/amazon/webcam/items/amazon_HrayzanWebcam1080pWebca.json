                "reviewText": "So, I had an old Logitech 720p camera and wanted something better for video conferencing during the shelter-in-place. When I installed the Hrayzan, I had both video AND audio problems. Read through all the Q&A and reviews and didn't find an answer that would work. AUDIO: It turned out somehow the microphone had gotten muted. Just opened the Sound Settings (right click on the sound icon) and ran the Troubleshooter. It un-muted the microphone and haven't had a problem since. VIDEO: The picture was great but I was getting a jumping garbled picture that was fairly random. After almost tearing out what little hair I have left, I finally just tried a different USB port and the problem instantly went away. Now the picture is perfect. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars on picture quality is because of the fish-eye distortion around the corners of the picture. But, I guess that is reasonable with the wide field of vision this camera provides. I would have rather had a narrower field with less distortion, but it works for me. I went ahead and gave 5 stars for \"easy to install\" even though it was a pain. But I don't think the issues I had could have been avoided in any way by the camera manufacturer. It was plug and play.",

                "reviewText": "I am totally new to this type of product, so I chose this one on the basis of other reviews, the price, and the privacy cap. It arrived very quickly. I will say I was disappointed in the shipping - the camera was shipped in a padded envelope, which seemed pretty risky!I put it on top of my desktop monitor and plugged it in. It has a little red light when it is plugged in. At first, that light blinked, and when I looked at hardware setup, my computer didn't see it. I had used an unpowered USB hub. When I switched to a USB port directly on the computer, the light came on steadily. I have since gotten a powered USB hub (powered by a wall wart, that is) and it works fine with that. Lesson - this needs more power than a hub that draws power from the computer can provide.Then I Googled \"webcam testing\" and tried a couple of sites, neither of which saw it. The second site I tried, however, provided some advice, and I was able to change my privacy settings and then it worked. I also had to change the privacy settings for the mic.Then I scheduled a test Zoom meeting with my brother, who told me that the picture was clear and the sound good, and there were no issues when I moved toward or away from the camera, the picture remained clear. I was concerned that it wouldn't be able to focus except in a limited area because it does not have auto-focus, but that didn't seem to be the case. He said the picture was equally clear for items behind me in the room as for me.I will say - the perch on top of my monitor seemed very iffy. It just sits up there and you fold the back part which is supposed to apply tension to hold it on the monitor. It didn't feel secure, and I move my monitor around quite a bit on its arm. So I put a bit of Velcro on the monitor and on the camera and now it is secure, but still removable.The little tripod seems like a waste of space, but I'm not discarding it. Perhaps if I'm trying to demonstrate some kind of craft, it will come in handy.So I'm pretty happy with it. There are more expensive cameras with more bells and whistles, but this works for my purposes. Taking a full point off seems a bit harsh - but the instructions were really poor and I never would have gotten it set up if not for info from the Internet, not specific to this camera.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a HD webcam / mic for conducting computer training classes on Zoom. The Hrayzan for under $50 met all my expectations and has performed reliably for over a month. To install on Windows, just plug it in to a USB port - no drivers needed. It works great on Zoom. The automatic exposure adjustment is great; it compensates for suboptimal lighting. The HD makes my image much sharper for other participants. The USB cable is about 3 feet long, but that's plenty for mounting the camera on top of my desktop monitor. The stereo microphone is quite powerful, on Zoom I've set the volume level to about 25% and I'm still loud enough for others to hear.My only ding is that the 110 degree viewing angle causes some spherical distortion at the edges of the image. That doesn't affect video-conferencing, but might impact still photos or videos taken with the webcam.Since I only do web conferences about twice a week, when I'm not using the camera, I unplug it from the USB port to minimize the chance of being viewed or listened to by an external hacker.I'd definitely recommend this webcam.",
