It may be useful in a very dark room, but I have not tested it under those conditions. The microphone also works very well. I had no problems with installation., plugged it into the USB port on a Windows 10 desktop and it was recognized quickly. Have been using mostly to teach using Blackboard and have been very happy. I am able to put documents up to the camera and the autofocus will focus on the written text or images that I am trying to show. I also used it on a table tripod to show documents on my desk and the autofocus woks well.",
