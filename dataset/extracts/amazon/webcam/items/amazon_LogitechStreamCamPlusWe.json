After trying out both, I used the kiyo for work, and the streamcam for the rare times I needed a webcam for personal use.The autofocus and 60fps never quite compensated for the grainy picture the streamcam gave even in optimal lighting.Then, about three years after I bought the streamcam, it stopped working altogether.Webcams are something you expect to last a long time. Three years is not very long for such an expensive webcam, especially when the $50 razer kiyo outperformed it in all ways except fps.",
