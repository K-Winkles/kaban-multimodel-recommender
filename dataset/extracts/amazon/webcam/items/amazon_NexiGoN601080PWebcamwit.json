It has a red LED on the left indicating power and a green LED on the right indicating when the camera is on. It does not need additional software for basic functions. Nexigo has a downloadable app that allows further fine tuning of settings. Works very well with Cisco WebEx and Microsoft Teams. Very attractively priced. What\u2019s not to like?",

The video quality is pretty good but it does tend to come out dark on youtube videos. The 2 biggest issues are all about the cord for me, the cord is short, keep that in mind and there are a lot of times that when I activate the camera to record a video or stream it shows that it is on but does not actually start recording, then it has to be unplugged and plugged back in and reactivated to get it to actually come back on. The camera also does on occasion just freeze but you have no sign it froze unless you actually look at what is being recorded on your program like OBS.",

The instructions were clear and to the point, making it easy to find the camera and get it up and running.The picture quality is excellent. Gets a little furry in low light conditions, but by using the optional free software, one can make the needed adjustments to get a decent view in any reasonably well lit environment.Speaking of the software, it was easy to find and download. It gives you additional control such as adjusting contrast, brightness, zoom, tilt, and others. It even allows you to save and store presets so you can recall settings that work in different locations.The only reason I didn\u2019t give five stars is because the adhesive is so thin on the mounting pads that they don\u2019t make very good contact on a monitor that doesn\u2019t have a perfectly square, flat profile. Furthermore the privacy cover just kind of flaps around loosely and doesn\u2019t stay put in the closed position except by gravity. I would like it to snap into place, but it does the job.",

La calidad de la c\u00e1mara y los FPS van GENIAL, incluso en entornos oscuros no se nota casi nada el ruido de la imagen. Por este precio merece mucho la pena. El micro no es lo mejor pero es lo esperable de una webcam.En definitiva, lo recomiendo, no te arrepentir\u00e1s.",
