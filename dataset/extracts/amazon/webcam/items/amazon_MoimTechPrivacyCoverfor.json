                "reviewText": "My new employer sent me a new 1080P camera, but I didn't like the fact that the new camera has such a wide viewing angle. So, I continued to use my old Logitech C270 which is 720P (plenty for Zoom meetings) and has a narrower viewing angle.The new 1080P camera had a built-in cover, but my old Logitech C270 does not have a cover.I bought this cover and it fits perfectly on my old Logitech C270 camera. It snaps on and stays in place.I like the fact that I can see the LED indicator when the cover \"door\" is open or closed.Other reviewers have complained about the price of this item. It appears to have been 3D-printed, so I understand that the creator spent a lot of time developing a 3D print image, and plenty of wear and tear on his/her 3D printer. I think this thing is worth the price.The sliding \"door\" was a little tight. I trimmed it with an X-Acto knife. Now, it works almost perfectly. It's a little tight when I slide it all the way to the left, but I think a little silicone lubricant will fix that.Overall, it's perfect for my needs.",

Plus, The Price Is Right! :)I ** DO INDEED ** recommend this product!",

It is scary how easy for hackers and kids with some programming knowledge as well as governments and others you wouldn't want to be able to see what you are doing in your own house. I had just bought a Logitech webcam not too long ago and the next model up had this cover on it for a good deal more so I got the one without the cover. Then I saw this cover online for cheap and I got it. It snapped right on and I now have the piece of mind that I have not opened up a digital window for the world to expose me doing innocent or not so innocent things. I simply slide the cover over the lens and voila. If someone has hacked into my system, they may be able to activate the microphone, but they cannot see me or take video or stills of me for nefarious purposes and turn my life upside down.It's an invaluable investment for such a small price.",

                "reviewText": "This camera cover works but I only foresee this camera covering working temporarily. It covers the camera however, the fit on the camera itself is very loose . I literally had to tape the top and the bottom just so the cover would fit. Needless to say, I probably would be better off just using a piece of paper like I was doing before because the camera cover really doesn\u2019t serve a purpose at this point because it doesn\u2019t fit unless I use tape and it only covers the camera, even though the camera includes a speaker also.",

                "reviewText": "This slips over the top of my Logitech webcam easily and fits a little loosely. However this does not impact sound or picture quality at all. I have not had any issues with the slider sticking like some other reviews mentioned. This does the job perfectly, even if it's not the sleekest looking option. Exactly what I needed, and glad this solution exists so I didn't have to buy a more expensive webcam with a built in cover.",
