                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this because I started participating in a YouTube Livestream and wanted a decent setup. I got this in and I was surprised. Setup was easy and the video quality was great. It also had a screw in socket for a tripod attachment if you are wanting to tripod it instead of putting it on your computer screen.So far, the webcam hasn't disappointed me. It was easy to set up and it performs well. Construction quality is good for the price, and it's so small as to be easily mounted in a variety of settings. If you are a gamer or web room chatter or a vlogger I would personally recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "Here's what you need to know when you want to buy a cheapy webcam and my thoughts on this Vitade 682H Pro HD - what a name. I have tried a couple of these lower-end, bargain bin webcams and they seem to share the same trait: they do deliver on the resolution and frame rate promised but there is always a caveat. If they have an auto-focus lens, you better have your lighting at studio quality like you are shooting a soap opera or it will focus in and out every 2 seconds. If they have manual focus, you won't have that problem but the auto-white balance may be whacked like this webcam. Too much light and the footage starts flashing and flickering all over the place like you are watching a found footage horror movie. I was wearing my wedding ring while recording some tabletop gameplay and the reflection from the ring caused the feed to start flashing as if it was having a seizure so I had to remove my ring. At least with this weird white-balance problem, you can always reduce something that you have in excess. The other problem with auto-focus? Good luck with that unless you are friends with Michael Bay. So this cam falls into the better cheapy webcam category. It's not going to replace a high end Logitech, but it's usable and serves its purpose.",

It hyped a great image, but after recording multiple videos with it in moderate lighting and then again with studio LED lights - the quality of the finished product was awful either way. How awful? It was embarrassing to share with others. It made me look unprofessional. Grainy, pixalated, like you tried to record with an old VHS camera in dim light. I had to re-record all the videos afterwards, wasting a lot of time and resources.Furthermore, the camera kept disconnecting while in use during Zoom meetings. It would just turn off on its own. I'd have to re-plug the camera into the USB to get it to work again, for a bit, until it turned off again - once again making me look unprofessional during meetings. I plugged other tech into the same USB port with no issues - only the camera keeps disconnecting.So I can't use it for my training videos and I cant even use it for a meeting - its just an overpriced paperweight. One of my worst purchases to date. Look elsewhere!",
