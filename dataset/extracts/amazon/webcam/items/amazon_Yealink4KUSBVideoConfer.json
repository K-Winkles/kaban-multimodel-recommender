                "reviewText": "We got the Yealink UVC34 soundbar style camera for use in a small meeting room with a PC and 4K TV. We chose this brand and model due to features and cost with basically no reviews so here are some initial impressions. The setup and testing only took a few minutes, simply plug in the power adapter and usb cable and a Windows 10 PC recognizes it as a camera and mic. Both cables were long enough to allow the camera to be placed in various positions but a shorter USB cable can be used. The USB connect software was easy to find on the Yealink website and installed with no issue. We checked for updates but there were none available. We chose to leave the other settings at default.We tested in google meet, zoom, and the Windows camera app and everything worked fine. The camera AI adjusted based on people in the room and movement and cropped and zoomed accordingly. This seems to work as well as other cameras we have tried with similar features. The mics picked up well with no complaints from other meeting participants anywhere from 2-12 feet away. The sound is loud enough and clear at below half volume for a small meeting room with multiple people speaking.Overall we are giving it 4 stars for several reasons. There appear to be several features (such as microphone port) that are not active yet. The mounting hardware could also be better. There is a single point on the bottom to screw it down and nothing on the back. We are also concerned with longevity as this is an unknown brand for us.",

                "reviewText": "I had been thinking about getting a webcam for my home computer for a while, ever since the rise of virtual meetings out of necessity and then convenience. When the opportunity to review this webcam came up, I jumped on it. Yealink is the brand of the desk phones we use for my work, so I assumed their webcam would be a good product like their phones.I picked this up for home use, primarily for Zoom meetings, and it arrived in time to test it out for that purpose. Prior to participating in a live meeting, though, I pulled up the built-in Windows camera and voice recorder programs to test it out. The photos were of decent quality, like any other webcam I've used. Using the sound recorder, I recorded some test audio from my chair with a low to normal speaking voice and then from across the room with a normal to louder voice. The audio came through clearly in both situations and I'm really happy with its performance. I went back to the camera program and tried to record a video. It was incredibly blurry at first and I'm not sure why. I start a Zoom meeting to test it, since the focus had been fine before, but it was the same. I closed and re-opened the built-in shutter; that solved the problem, so it must have been an autofocus issue. (I don't fault the webcam on this; if you want a camera that will maintain focus over a broad range of distances, I think you have to accept that at times it'll be off and need some help. Plus, I only sat in my chair, and I wouldn't be surprised if I just needed to step back for a moment to catch the focus again.) With the focus issue resolved, I was happy with the quality of the video. (Note that I did not use Teams, since I don't use it at home, but I have no reason to believe there would be any issues with it.)In an actual Zoom meeting, the webcam worked perfectly. The video was crisp and clear and the microphone picked up what I was saying clearly without me having to speak louder than a normal voice.I really like the autofocus. It has plusses and minuses, of course, the focus error mentioned above being one of the minuses. Gone is the ability to quickly back up and blur away into the background -- sorry, remote workers, but you'll need to wear appropriate pants to your work meetings in case you have to step for a moment! :) -- but with autofocus I was able to back away from my desk and walk 15 feet away without being blurred, yet Zoom still kept the rest of the background blurred. The autofocus is a nice feature to have in case I want to be really close or really far away from the camera and still let people see me if I have the background blurred. My experience is that the autofocus has been very smooth and seamless. Unlike the blurring error around the edges of my head and shoulders, the focus was perfect at all times. I have yet to run into a situation where it was really off and grabbing onto something other than me.I really like the build-in shutter. So many webcams lack this feature, but from a privacy perspective it makes so much sense to build in. The shutter slides very easily. (See the attached picture; it shows the shutter halfway open so you can see the contrast.)I also really like the light indicating when the camera is on. Rather than just being on or off, the manual shows that there are multiple colors and states (flashing or solid) to indicate the camera's status. This is a nice feature.Stepping back a bit, the webcam and its packaging are nicely done. (See the attached picture.) The webcam comes with a soft pouch for transporting it. While I will keep it on the top of my desktop monitor, the pouch is a nice added touch for those who will be carrying the webcam around. The cord is a good length (about 3 feet?) and, while everyone's needs will be slightly different, it easily reaches from the top of my monitor (which is on a 3-inch riser), over to the hole in my desk, and down to the USB slot on the back of my computer. The webcam has built-in adhesive sections for attaching it to a monitor, and on the back piece there's a movable, rubberized foot. That foot is a really nice touch that I haven't seen in other webcams; it provides a nice contact to the back of the monitor. In addition to the webcam and pouch, you get a short manual and a little quality inspection card.Getting started with the webcam couldn't be easier. I plugged it in and then, with no setup or lag, started using it on Windows 10.I'm really happy with this webcam. It's compact, nicely featured, and easy to use, and most importantly it provides good video and sound for online meetings.",
