Overall at 50$ this is a stealCons are that assuming it\u2019s not on sale,It\u2019s QC isn\u2019t good. Had dust in lens(didn\u2019t affect image).Also mic has to be enabled first time you use with ms accessories app. Which makes this webcam teams uncertified.Camera sensor itself isn\u2019t as good as competitors. But actual footage has good color. Mb it has good isp and chips++This webcam doesn't have Windows Hello!",

                "reviewText": "I have tried so many webcams before now and only found disappointment when they weren't built into something like my laptop of phone.This one manages to be better than I could ever have expected. It captures a wide vista, making it perfect for family facetime or meetings, as well as presentations with a whiteboard. The picture is great and it adjusts well for low-lighting. It doesn't zoom in on you so that all they see is your face, but rather, lets you be visible from the chest & shoulders up.The base is tricky, and probably the worst aspect to the device, but I was able to position it stably atop my monitor. It works a treat with Zoom.I decided to try this one out after it got the #2 rating on Tom's Hardware for the best webcams of 2023. I was not disappointed. The slide-cover is easy to use.One other notable perk of this device is that it can be attached to a standard photography tripod, so if you want to use it for a presentation at a whiteboard or smartboard, or show a group, you absolutely can, without issue.It is as easy as plugging it in to any computer with a USB port.This gets my highest recommendation.",

After a lot of dead ends, I found one that said to go into Microsoft Accessory Center and change \"Webcam Microphone\" to \"On\" (it was off by default, even though I had a previous older, but working, webcam installed). Now it works with Windows 10, and can be used with Zoom etc.Why this is turned off by default is a mystery. I am a professional computer technician, this sort of thing would trip up the majority of people if it got me!",

                "reviewText": "This camera is advertised as being certified for Microsoft Teams. I realize this is a $60-$70 camera, so I'm not expecting YouTube quality videos. This is also advertised as compatible with MacOS, which makes sense because Microsoft Teams is cross platform (supports Windows & MacOS & browser).So this sort of works on MacOS. It's plug and play, but the video quality is just horrendous. It's just a pixelated mess that is no better than the horrible built in camera on a MacBook Pro. In fact, I think the built-in camera may be only slightly better.It is stated that you can use the Microsoft Accessory Center software to modify the camera settings to get a better video feed of your environment. However, this is only available for Windows, and not MacOS, so you won't have any controls on the video output. I even tried messing with the camera settings using OBS, but the quality of this product is so poor, OBS wasn't able to do much.Microsoft calls this \"Modern Webcam\", but there's nothing modern about it.1. Video output is horrendous on MacOS (not very modern)2. Control software is not available on MacOS, like MS Teams is, which is a \"Teams Certified Device\" (not very modern).3. It's advertised as 1080p at 30 fps. But by looking a the poor output, you would have though it was 480p at 30 fps. It's just that bad, even with fairly decent lighting.Microsoft missed the mark with this one by not making it truly cross platform, like many of their other products. It's advertised as \"Certified for Teams\", but only if you're on Windows. If you're a MacOS user and are considering this, don't. I certainly regretted this purchase and will be returning ASAP.",
