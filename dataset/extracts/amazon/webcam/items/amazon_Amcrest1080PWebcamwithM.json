                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality Webcam, Prices Right During COVID",
                "reviewText": "In reviewing the Amcrest 1080P Webcam (Model AWC201-B), I was very impressed. This camera came in at less than $50, and during COVID times to boot. Setup came with ease. All I had to do was plug this webcam into my Windows 10 computer. It was picked right up in device manager as an attached device, and I had no issues with detection.Upon first glance, I did like that it looked / felt professional. It didn\u2019t seem cheap. I also own a Logitech C920 1080P webcam, so I picked up both units, one in each hand, and observed similarities and differences. First, the Logitech did seem to have a smoother look to the plastics. A more polished look you could say. However, the Amcrest webcam didn\u2019t feel weak or cheap, it seemed to have a durable feel to it as well, just a more matte, textured finish to the plastic housing. Both had a mounting system underneath for a monitor, and the Amcrest seemed to hug the top of my monitor nicely.Both cameras had privacy covers, however I did like that the Logitech cover was removable. Not that I would probably ever take the cover off, but the Amcrest cover was stuck on permanently and I felt as though I had one shot to get it right. Not to mention, I felt I should treat it extra delicate after placing the cover on, as not to accidentally dislodge it.After plugging the camera in, I went straight to Microsoft Teams. I have been using Microsoft Teams for work for quite some time now. The Amcrest webcam was immediately detected and set itself as my default webcam / microphone. I performed a test call and noticed that the picture quality was great. In fact, I believe the picture quality to be better than the Logitech webcam. It seemed to have better color and lighting aspects. The Logitch appeared more washed out and over exposed, while the Amcrest did a good job of capturing the true color in the room, as well as balancing out the lighting. The mic quality was great too. Those who joined Teams calls with me did not notice any differences between the Logitech and Amcrest camera mic quality.The final feature I noticed was that the Amcrest webcam had an extra wide-angle lens. I found this nice as it gave me room to move around the screen without getting clipped off. A side by side comparison between the Amcrest and Logitech camera showed that the Amcrest field of view was undeniably wider.I used the Amcrest webcam for two weeks straight with no issues. I attended nearly 100 Microsoft Teams meetings during that time and had no issues with the camera. In addition to my use, my wife used the camera steadily for her school Zoom meetings. She too noticed the great quality / sound from the webcam and had no issues.Overall, I feel that the Amcrest camera is a great quality webcam for the price. Although the plastics didn\u2019t feel quite as polished as its Logitech competitor, the camera performed flawlessly, and I found no real issues in my testing. I also found it a bonus to find such a high quality 1080P camera available for under $50 during COVID times. It was delivered to me via Amazon Prime in just two days.I would have no issues purchasing additional Amcrest webcams both for my home and work environment. Before being given the opportunity to review, I was not aware of Amcrest webcams, so I feel privileged to now be able to consider it as an option.",

                "reviewText": "In the absence/reduction of face-to-face time during this health crisis period, people have become extremely reliant on proxy contact to keep in touch with one another. Having relied on their home security system for years, I was thrilled to learn that Amcrest also had a line of webcams, to connect to the outside world. I\u2019ve relied on my Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 since 2011 so I saw it fit to upgrade to and test out the modern and affordable Amcrest 1080P HD Webcam (AWC201-B).My old system\u2019s video quality maxed out at 720p (this was HD back in 2011) so I was eager to upgrade to a 1080p system for webchats. Out of the small box, the camera comes in a pretty simple two-piece set-up; a detached plastic material lens-cover and the webcam itself with an embedded 5\u20199\u201d USB2.0 power/connection cord. I would have preferred to have the lens cover preinstalled or integrated onto the camera instead of it being a separate piece. The lens cover attaches to the camera using a double-sided tape that is preinstalled on the cover itself. The face of the camera is a glass type construction split into three sections. The camera section is in the center with two LED lights mounted to each side of the lens. The microphone receiver is to the left of the lens and the right side just has the manufacture logo printed on it. The backing of the camera feels like a pretty common plastic covering. The stand/clip mount appears to be of the same plastic quality as the camera backing; there is an option to mount the camera on a tripod via a female 1/4\u201d connector on the bottom plate of the stand. The folding clip feels sturdy and the contact points are cushioned with rubber padding to prevent scratching or scuffing. Overall, it\u2019s not a bad looking webcam and it\u2019s all black color scheme will allow it to be integrated easily into any setup.Installation and setup of this camera is pretty straight forward on my Windows 10 system; it\u2019s pretty much plug-and-play. There is no on/off switch on the camera but the two LED indicator lights on the camera will light up when the camera and mic are accessed. The long cable allows for a variety of mounting positions. The camera itself does not have any software to manage it; instead, it is managed via whichever third-party app is used to operate it. Mounting the camera on the top of my computer monitor, it is only adjustable vertically. Horizontal adjustment is only possible by physically moving the entire camera to a different part of the monitor, standing it on the desk, or mounting it on a tripod. The video field of view is 70 degrees so it captures a decent amount of the environment; make sure nothing is in frame - that you don\u2019t want seen.Not surprisingly, this camera\u2019s video quality is an improvement over my old 720p device; but, it\u2019s really nothing to marvel over in today\u2019s world of standard 4K video quality. I tested the camera using the default Windows 10 camera app and OBS Studio. The Windows 10 app does not offer much of anything to adjust the camera settings with. Windows 10\u2019s default microphone setting does not allow for any audio setting changes beyond volume adjustment. OBS offers more but it\u2019s not something most users will know how to tinker with. I originally wanted to be able to use this camera for streaming or content creation but found that it is only really good for the occasional camera user. The video quality is not sharp enough or clear to be able to compete with today\u2019s 4K technology that can be had on most smartphones. The audio quality sounds muffled, does not filter out background sounds, and captures a lot of static wind/air noise. I found that a separate and dedicated microphone and video setup would better suit my needs. However, for webchats and meetings while at my workstation, this product is cheap and decent enough to accomplish those needs.Bottom-line, this is a simple product to use that requires no prior knowledge or experience. It\u2019s fairly affordable, decently constructed, and isn\u2019t too bad of a looker for most average desktop setups/users. Price to performance, I would say that this is a definite 4 out of 5 stars due to a lack of supportive software.",
