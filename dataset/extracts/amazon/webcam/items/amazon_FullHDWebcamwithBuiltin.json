You don't need to adjust lighting or focus manually, it does it all automatically. It came with a small tripod but it also has a rotatable clip to put on a monitor. I have not used the microphone since I own a headset and I recommend you do the same for calls or streaming. Overall I highly recommend you try this webcam out whether its for streaming, video calls, or videos in general. You can't beat the quality for that price. 5/5",

To the quality of use and seeing others specifically when they move their is no lagging. This was awesome and the fact it\u2019s on a rotating tripod so I don\u2019t have to reposition it when I move but just turn it was awesome. Obviously it doesn\u2019t move on its own so I mean you don\u2019t have to pick it up and move it when you move. Great quality and such a steal at the price you pay. No complaints here and definitely recommend.",

The cover for the camera is awesome for when I am caring it around with me. The sound canceling works awesome. This camera has a very wide view and captures more than others I have used. This is definitely worth the money. I have already recommended it to several people once they seen mine they wanted one as well..",

I'd rather be able to zoom in so that I'm filling up the frame.",
