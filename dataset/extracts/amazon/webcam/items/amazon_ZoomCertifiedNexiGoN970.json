You can press and hold the menu button on the remote for at least two seconds to mirror the OSD menu. Can I control multiple cameras with just one remote? Our original remote has multi-cam functionality which supports up to control four N970P webcams. If you prefer the original version, please feel free to contact NexiGo Support Team. What are the ideal distance range and microphone pickup distance for the N970P? The microphone pickup distance is up to 20ft away, but our recommendation for the n970P is to set it up less than 10ft away for the highest video quality.",

Straight out of the box and plug'n played seamlessly with Windows PC, laptop, Apple Mac and Android TV. Remote operates well and auto framing works but good to be able to stop the function as and when required. Had it a month now in Australia and have used it 8 times with no dramas. Unit was shipped from USA and arrived in good order and slightly ahead of schedule. No hesitation to recommend as a great product.",
