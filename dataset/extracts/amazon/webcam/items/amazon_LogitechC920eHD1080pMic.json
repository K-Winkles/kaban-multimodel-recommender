                "reviewText": "Works great for online school work. 1080p image is noticeably better looking than another similar Logitech webcam that only had a 720p sensor. The image isn't perfect by any means, but what do you expect for a name brand webcam that's less than $60?The microphone is disabled by default (this is noted as such in the product description!) and can easily be enabled with a one time update with the Logi Tune software from Logitech. Once the microphone is enabled is stays that way even if the device is plugged into a different computer.You might ask why would Logitech sell a webcam with the microphones disabled? Some corporations and government agencies require the microphone be disabled by default for security or IT related reasons. It's very easy for the average home user to enable the mic via the Logi Tune software and once the mic is enabled the software can be uninstalled from the machine.",

I do need to point out that the camera is basically unuseable for me in Microsoft Teams (Mac user). The camera immediately has a significant lag and locks up the application. This does not occur when testing the video in the settings, but only when on a \"live\" call.Overall Assessment - Great Camera unless you really need it for Teams.",
