The two microphones pic up audio perfectly with no distortion. I love the 360 degree rotation with 90 degree articulation up and down. It allows me to have the camera where I want it and point it in an exact location. The front of the base is slightly notched and does not block the screen like other webcams do. The picture quality is great as you would expect from a 1080P webcam. A low light function is a must, and this camera delivers. The wider base and tighter joints than most webcams allows you to set it on you desk or shelf and be confident that it will stay pointed where you want it to. It has standard mounting for a tripod as well, so how you utilize is 100% up to you. It is truly plug and play, with USB 2.0 type A for a wide compatibility range. Lastly and probably my favorite thing, THEY INCLUDE A CLOTH FOR CLEANING THE LENS!!!",

I greatly appreciate the customer support department of Redragon, which identified a dissatisfied customer quickly and made reasonable efforts to remedy the solution. While my rating and opinion of the product itself is has not changed, the responsiveness of the customer service was great.",
