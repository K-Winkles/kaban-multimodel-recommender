I had purchased it for my college classes as many people do, and my professors could not even see a clear picture of me. It was never clear in the beginning and the sound does not work! Do not purchase!! A total waste of money, in my opinion. If you are wanting to speak to people through a webcam or even for a class, do not purchase this particular item. This camera doesn\u2019t work at all as to how it is supposed to. An entire one star review! \u2b50\ufe0f",
