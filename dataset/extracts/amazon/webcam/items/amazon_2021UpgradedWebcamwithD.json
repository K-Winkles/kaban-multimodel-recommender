                "reviewText": "I've been using this camera a couple of weeks now for Zoom. It's all good except for the lack of its handling of white point. Neither the automatic or manual Zoom controls or filters can give good skin tones and I always have a ghostly face whether it's daylight or artificial light. Since I'm not using the camera for any glam meetings it shouldn't matter that much. But it's kind of weird that my face is the only one that is glowing so bright in the Zoom grid.A few days later >>> I'm now bumping this one up a star. I compared it to the AverMedia 313 webcam which I just got at Costco. The AverMedia also gave me a washed out look but not as much. It turned out that my monitor's white light was causing it. I changed the monitor to night mode and it was a lot better on both cams. Honestly, I feel like returning the AverMedia cam now since its base only allows the camera to swivel left/right but this Esthepro has a fuller range of adjustment. It also has a double hinged base to give a more secure feeling if you are placing it on top of a monitor.",

It's inexpensive, handy to move to any USB compatible device, small, does a good job, and is easily transportable. Plus you can slide the lens cover over the lens if you leave the computer. Excellent choice!",

It looks good, connects well with my PC's, came in good time and the microphones work great.Unfortunately, the auto focus is badly adjusted/set up. The image is badly out of focus, a good focus is only possible if I get within a few inches.It's a real shame, but if you need a Webcam I can't recommend this one.",
