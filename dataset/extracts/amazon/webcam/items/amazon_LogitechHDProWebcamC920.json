Yesterday, I shot a video and the lighting in my room was excellent. The video came out absolutely amazing! So to sum it up, this camera looks fantastic, just make sure you have an ample amount of lighting.Note: Camera seemed to shoot in higher resolution on my Mac than my PC with Windows (could be a setting I need to adjust?).",

                "reviewText": "I really like this webcam. I've used this on my not so great laptop (it's also like 5 or 6 years old) and my higher-end computer (maybe 2 years old but I add new things) and oh boy does it make a difference. With my laptop it seems less clear and overall like the camera already built into my laptop but with a few differences, with my computer it's amazing. I can wave my hand quickly and actually see a few of my fingers still, or have my dog run around in circles and you can still clearly see her! I took a picture with it inside my dim room and it's as clear as my phones camera when I'm outside. I should also mention that since I move around a lot while using it it does auto adjust a lot and it's definitely noticeable but not horribly so. Also while recording it still works great in low light settings. This thing is impressive. Now this is my first webcam aside from my laptops built in one so this has been a huge upgrade. It's worth every penny for me.",

                "reviewText": "This camera was hooked to a 2012 Mac Mini and was used to replace my Chromebook as a more permanent TTRPG computer. I play over video call\u2019s different TTRPGs like D&D, and Call of Cthulhu. The computers only job is doing video calls and pulling up book files. The camera was just a nice addition. I am not using it for audio input, so speaking about the audio quality is not making this review. Just note I have a BA in music with a focus in recording techniques and electronic music. The mic will work okay for a basic conversation, but not much more.I was just disappointed by the field of vision this camera has. My sister and I play on this computer and I think it was meant for a single person to be on camera. The computer is on the other side of a dining room table and we still have to sit close together to get us in view.The video quality is less than desired. My Chromebook you can see use very clear and even read the board games behind use without a problem. That is on a $200 Chromebook. This being just the camera not the case. We are not as clear in the picture. You can\u2019t read anything unless you hold it right up to the camera. I have to say very disappointing about the camera.",

It didn't however come with any instructions or software (other than some pictures of how to set it on your monitor). So if you're not good at looking thru support sites to find the downloads for a specific model product this may not be the option for you. That said its not that big of a deal, and it seems to work fine. At least it appears new unlike the other \"Certified Refurbished\" item I bought is the same order which was quite obviously well used and never \"refurbished\".",
