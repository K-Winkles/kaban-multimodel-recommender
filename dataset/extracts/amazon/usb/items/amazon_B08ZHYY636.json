I did not know these existed until I searched on amazon. I love this one! It even comes with small stickers for labeling each drive which is great since I usually mix them up. Very soft case and it is the perfect size.",

It came within a week, and I used a Amazon drop off location, that worked very well, with no worry of loosing the small package or weather damage.",
