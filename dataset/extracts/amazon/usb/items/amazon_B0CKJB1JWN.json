Therefore, I needed to purchase something for additional storage (I take a lot of pictures and videos). A friend suggested the 512GB Flashdrive. This is just the right size. It is small, and can be used both ways (C-side and USB-side). I have not tried the USB side, yet, but I did use the C-side for my phone, and then for my laptop. Works like a charm. It also has a little slot so I can put it on my keychain. I highly recommend this.",
