                "reviewText": "This is a decent pack of 5 flash drives at a reasonable price. It is USB 2.0 which ensures that file transfer rates will not be as fast as more current technology, but for my use (I primarily use them for documents, not for music or videos) they will come in handy. The exterior shell of each drive is stainless steel, so feel like they will hold up well. Since I usually have them in a pocket in my purse, I generally prefer that my drives have a cover over the end to keep dust/debris from getting inside the drive - but again, for the price and my anticipated usage, these drives will work well.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered a 2 pack, was sent a single package of one drive. Needed it for travel immediately, so rather than wait to go through the return process and get the correct pack of 2 items, I began using the first. Copied some files onto the drive, transfer speed was excellent at first, first couple of gigs of files went on with no problems. About an hour later I initiiated another file transfer of about the same size. I noticed the transfer speed slowing down severely as time went on. By the time it completes the transfer it was down to 10 MB/s.I was a bit concerned, but continued preparing my files for transfer. Half hour later or so I again initiated a file transfer of around 2.5 G.Transfer speed this time around began at around 20 MB/s. Every 30 seconds or so the speed lowered by 1 MB/s. At around 80 percent complete it was moving at a blazing speed of 1 MB/s, until it eventually stopped altogether and my file manager notified me that the transfer had failed.I opened the file manager, to find absolutely nothing showing up on the drive at all. Ejected the drive with the file manager. When I went to remove and reconnect so it would possibly reboot the drive and detect my files again, the drive itself was BURNING hot. Hot enough that the metal casing scalded my fingers.Needless to say when I reinserted the drive after it had cooled a while later, there were no files there. It lost all of my data, luckily I had only copied it rather than do a cut-and-paste operation.DO NOT BUY THIS \"HOT GARBAGE\".After only approximately 7G of file transferring, this thing almost literally caught on fire. Probably would have damaged my device if I had been doing a larger transfer all at once and had not been right there to oversee it.This is just one in a rapidly growing string of quality issues on items I have bought on prime lately. Quality of products has diminished immensely in the last year, and I am seriously considering uninstalling and cancelling my membership at this point. Sure, they return and replace items when stuff like this happens, but who has the time or the energy to keep going to the store to drop off returns, waiting for the new one, etc. If I had time to go to the store I would have just gone to Best Buy or Walmart. Why am I paying a monthly subscription for aggravation???Update. Three weeks later and I still have not received my refund from this scammer that Amazon is in bed with. I have returned hundreds of items over the years, and up until now I have never had to wait more than a few hours to get my money back.At this point I am done with Amazon. They have become 1996 eBay, full of inferior or even products and scam listings that do not correctly depict the items they will send you.Sad to see the empire bezos built from his garage falling apart at the seams like this. Amazon now prioritizes getting their cut of the sales from the seller, and now sacrifices the customer on an alter of greed rather than lose a couple dollars in revenue.Goodbye, GreedAzon. I hope as many people as you screw over leave and take their business elsewhere. I hope it gets to the point where your DPS system is unsustainable, and the whole thing collapses under the weight of the fat, slimy sleazebags running the show these days.",

I'm really uncertain why this would be such an old tech...2.0 came out in 2000 vs USB 3.0 in 2008 vs USB 3.2 in 2017...and it's 2023...almost 2024. Meh. 64GB for a semi-disposable USB drive is huge...It's functional.None of the drives arrived DOA.Lightweight, sleek designI didn't like the fact that there were no covers. I wish the proximal part was slightly bigger to permit a cap to be added...but I also get why people would have USB drives like this.Has a hole for attaching to your keys.Has a warranty with an unknown period.Unsure if waterproof, doubtful given design.Packaging was simple.1* off primarily because it's USB 2.0 and there's no cap, though that latter part is personal preference.",
