When I got it, I immediately tried to do so, only to learn that Samsung phones only accept drives formatted in FAT32. In 2023!I resigned myself to turning my 128GB drive into a 32GB FAT32 drive so it could work with my phone, and during the format, the drive suddenly went crazy, bricked itself, and now it doesn't work at all.So if you plan on buying this to use with your smartphone, make sure you search to make sure it's compatible with ExFAT or other modern file systems first.",

                "reviewText": "I mainly got this because it has both normal USB and USB type C connections. I like that I can get work done on my phone or a computer and save it to the drive instead of having to worry about sending it somewhere. The drive lights up red when a process is in action. The plastic hole to connect a Keychain or lanyard is super tiny and just thin plastic that I'm sure will break over time. I wish that loop was better but other than that I like this and think it's a good value. Also nice it has the covers but I could see them falling off/being lost over time.Edit: I still really like it but as I'd guessed, the little plastic connector ring broke (it took a month & a half). So now I just have to store it in a pocket or something because there's no way to connect it to anything. Kind of a bummer but saw that one coming. It's still a great flash drive though and has been convenient for me. Would still recommend but if being able to connect it to a lanyard or keychain is important to you....well that's not a lasting trait. Also, I wanted to mention because I'm getting a lot of Amazon's \"Can you answer this customer's question?\" emails about this item....if your phone has a USB-C port then yes it can be used with your phone. I have a Galaxy S22+ that I use it with regularly and have also connected it to an S10e and an A10e without any issues.",

Additional problem the USB c connector is Short making it necessary to re move your phone case when in use. unless your phone case has a USB c opening that is as big or bigger than the diameter of the flashdrive (which is just not going to happen), I plugged it in to my Motorola g play 2023 (phone) it started flashing red light then the red light just stopped flashing for a few minutes when repeated flashing and stoped again just stating all night about 12 hours. I was afraid that un-plugiang it may damage ether it or to phone (why I left it plugged in over night), I took the phone with the flashdrive still plugged in to T-Mobile and they did not know how to deal with it!! So I took it to the Geek squad at best buy. With the flashdrive still plugged in and even they did were not sure what to do. So unless you are a computer programmer I would NOT recommend buying one of these!! Not saying that they do work but when the Geek squad doesn't know how to work it. That speaks very loud to me!",

My PC recognized it and I would read/write from and to it (but it was not very fast). I tried many times to get y Firestick to recognize, format and use this drive. It never worked at all. I was able to us a 64G version from a different vendor/manufacturer with my Firestick so it does not appear to be a problem with my Firestick. I am going to keep it and throw it in by box of questionable but functioning USB drives and use it on my PC. Did not try it with my Android phone but it was a complete failure with my Firestick.",
