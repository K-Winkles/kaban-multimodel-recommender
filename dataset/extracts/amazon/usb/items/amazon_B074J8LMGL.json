These are now inexpensive enough to just load with photos and give away.",

Had about 200+ CDs on HD of previous can(s)) So, my music needs to be via phone or USB and bluetooth audio quality (in my situation) is inferior to USB. Bought a 5-pack of 4g Enfain drives; have copied to and used 4 and couldn't be more pleased.1) Like the \"feel\" of what certainly seems to be quality construction that indicates a long life; metal \"frame\" surrounding plastic drive body, solid swivel and simply impressive in regard to quality of the product.2) Same as many available, I like the color \"coding\"3) Convenient to label! With ample supply of labels re-labeiing will be possible...without creating some kind of mess.4) Drives came very well packaged in a plastic tray in a \"windowed\" box. Very nice touches, indeed.5) May not be needed, but a small info/instruction pamphlet is provided! With specs, FAQs and descriptions. Little things that indicate the concern the manufacturer/seller has for the consumer. I appreciate those things!6) If one desires, engraving on the metal \"frame\" is available.Have ordered another set of 5...and more in the future if necessary.",
