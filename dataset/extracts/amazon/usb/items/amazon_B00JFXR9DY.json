                "reviewText": "I wanted these to give to friends (as needed). So was looking for something cheap. Many laptops no longer have CD/DV so I opted for a low storage value USB 2.- flash drive. I finally settled on the slightly more pricey 1GB drives for 'future' larger files. I'm running Windows 10 Pro on an ASUS laptop with USB 3.0. (No problem) I spot checked several using Defender and Malwarebytes (Premium) and all were ok.They were FAT 32 preformatted with 958 MB available. I purchased the RED units so I could easily find them.I did do a slight mod\" I put a number with a black felt marker on the Red bump that the metal protector rotates on. That way I know if I see the number the orientation is right. You don't need to do any of that. These seem inexpensive as hard to find low value SD cards and not everyone has a SD reader. When you plug them in (these) glow bright red and flash with data transfer....The Silver metal protector rotates and can be easily popped off if you don't want it The lower storage values are Very inexpensive. Can even fit on a key ring...The Size in my case 1GB is marked on the bag but NOT the device.Company I purchased from was Fbsctech that sells other related computer devices. (always check the storefront w/3rd party suppliers)Very happy and would purchase again from Fbsctech...",

                "reviewText": "I work in a 10 teacher unit for students who have learning disabilities, and I find that amongst our 37 students, forgetting their flash drives at home is an ongoing problem. So, as the Senior Staff Instructor, I decided that some 2 to 8 GB flash drives that could be loaned out on a short term basis was in order. These have turned out to be a great buy. They've already been signed out by quite a few of the girls (it's a girls' private school-non-profit) and returned. They are an absolute necessity in our department, and the girls are wonderful about returning them. Each one is numbered, and the girls do have to sign them out and them sign them back in, but I've not had one go missing yet, and this is the second year I've used this system. They're great little flash drives and they don't take long to install the first time that they're used in one of our computers (we have 5 in our department, plus 1 that is dedicated to some extra work that I do with my students). In the previous year, I used different flash drives, and they took forever to install the first time, something for which my students have little patience since so many of them have ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and anxiety disorders, which cause the wasting of time to create problems for them. These install quickly and need installation only once on each computer. They work fantastically well, and I'm particularly pleased that their innerds are made of metal rather than plastic, which shortens the life of the flash drive in my experience. I installed matching lanyards on each flash drive which makes it easier for my students to keep track of them, and more likely that they'll be returned and not get lost. I'm very pleased with these flash drives as well as their capacity, which will last for years in our center. For myself, I have a 64 GB flash drive, but for these puposes, the 8 GB are just fine and do the trick.",

                "reviewText": "Received all 10 and they were all prefect and worked.. Most likely will purchase some additional ones for some variety in color. I see some people were having issues with some not working. I can safely report that i had no issues and all mine worked...I purchased these originally for some Legacy music Keyboards that have a floppy drive that was converted to a disk emulator similar to GoTek and FloppyEmulators. Reason for the small usb storage size purchase is when you use the emulators it portions your USB device into multi 1.44 mb partitions. If you use a larger USB drive then you just get about 150 mb usage out of the device you can use and the rest is wasted.. I purchased these small 256 megabyte thumb drives so i wasn't tie'n up my larger USB sticks.Worked Perfect. AND if you are using these for something similar to what i used my for (now you know).Other uses i found these to be good for:1) When giving in Assignments to teachers (sometime you don't get the thumb drive back as they are too busy to return it or just forget) At 1.80$ i don't care if i get it back.. so these were perfect for that too.2) Converted Music Equipment (From Floppy to USB)Honestly these are great little drive and good for Distributing School work, Use in applications where small storage is needed, or just all out School companions for small files.",
