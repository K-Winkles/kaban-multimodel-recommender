                "reviewText": "These are my favorite USB flash drives. I bought one about five or 10 years ago and it works like a champ. It has decent speed, is extremely durable, it just feels good in the hand. My mom had dozens of flash drives, but most were all plastic and cracked and falling apart, which is very common since most flash drive housings are very low quality. I bought her one of these, and she loves it. Whenever I go over to our house I see it please permanently on her the desk, no other flash drives in sight.Remember one time I had a thin metal 256GB drive. It slipped out of my pocket at one point (probably when I was getting into of the car, when I was pulling out my keys) and I ended up backing over it with the car. It\u2019s a thin metal shell was sleek, and minimalist, but the whole thing got crushed and was unusable after it got ran over. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever ran over my gorilla Drive, but with its build quality and thick rubber housing, I have a feeling it would come out virtually unscathed.There are plenty of other flash drives where you can get more gigabytes for your dollar, and with faster speeds but I trust the reliability of this thing. I like knowing it can be dropped, stepped on, etc. and survive like a champ. It has enough speed to meet my needs, so in my opinion, it\u2019s totally worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I work in IT and occasionally need to transfer data between computers on the fly. Plus I need something that's built to withstand the rigors of the day. GorillaDrives beat the competition hands down. They're very rugged and watertight. You can run over them in your car with no damage. The cap fits very snugly - it even clicks when it's on right. They come in different capacities and colors. But the real attraction for me is these drives are fast - much faster than the others (Sandisk, Kingston, etc). These GorillaDrives will transfer data 5 to 10 times faster than any comparable USB drive. I wish the cap had a small hole and a little thin tether, but I've never lost one so I'm not sure if that's a solution looking for a problem that I really haven;t experienced yet! Also, you can buy spare caps if it does become a problem. Good luck. And stay safe America!",

The drive arrived safely, and all of the data was intact. I have three of these drives, and none of them have given me any trouble whatsoever. They are reliable, in my experience. Easy to use, and they look darn cool on my keychain.",

I have used these drives forever and this was the first time I had one wipe out all my files.Taking that out, these drives are durable and stout and I have used them for many years. Hopefully down the road there are no more bad ones. It's too expensive to retrieve my data otherwise.",
