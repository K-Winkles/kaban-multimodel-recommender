We'll have to see about longevity, but I use a flash drive so seldom that I doubt I will have any issues. I doubt you can do much better for eleven bucks at this time.",

                "reviewText": "The drive is actually a solid drive and it does indeed store 128GB worth of data on it. Moving files to and from the flash drive works without a sweat but this is the first flash drive that I've ever had a problem streaming movies stored on it. When I load up 'any' movie and attempt to play it in a video player like Media Player Classic, VLC, or Windows Media Player the video will start stuttering and jerking, the audio will sound completely corrupted, and it will only play back around 3-4fps. I have brought this up with the Gigastone customer service and they attempted to tell me that my computer was the problem and not the flash drive. If it had been 2 days sooner I would have returned the flash drive because it's no good to people like me who like to stream videos directly from flash drives. I now have a drive I can only use for file transfers and because it's a refurbished flash drive I'm not exactly sure how long the drive will even last before it kicks the bucket. I'll probably use it for unimportant storage needs but I do not feel comfortable using Gigastone products any longer and will not be using them in the future.(P.S. This is the second Gigastone flash drive I had issues with. The first flash drive completely failed after 3 weeks which had very important data, and it had to be sent to a data recovery center to get the data removed from it. Luckily I only had to pay around $300 for a complete NAND extraction and recovery, but this final issue is the straw that broke the camel's back.",

With this little device, I can plug it into my CF-31 and leave it there as a hard-copy backup to all my work, without worrying about breaking anything. It's super tough and so I've no worries about it breaking and losing my data. I would recommend this product and this buyer to anybody.",
