                "reviewText": "My laptop started rebooting itself, in the middle of whatever I was doing. I am no computer geek, but I know enough that it shouldn't be doing that. One day, I got a message on laptop, saying that my hard drive may be corrupt. I had no idea of what to do, or why it was corrupt. At this point, the laptop was still turning on, but was taking 5 to ten minutes, to load each screen. Once I got to my program, it would work for a while, then reboot itself... all over again. Due to finances, rushing my laptop in, to the computer doctors, was not a priority. Something told me I better back-up, my 7 years worth of files. Searched Amazon, found this USB flash drive, because it was the cheapest, with decent reviews. The day this flash drive came, I started, painstakingly, copying my laptop files to this removable drive. It took 2 days, and many hours. This was due to only being able to copy so many files, then my computer would restart itself. By now, it's taking almost 30 minutes for me to be able to start copying files again. Each time I got started, I would check the contents of the removable drive. Yup! It was getting copied on the flash drive. I was so happy to see that the flash drive wasn't failing me, in my most crucial time. I couldn't afford to lose years, and years, of stuff. I made it to the last part of copying;which were my photos. Out of thousands, I made it to the last 1500. Anything I copied, more than 700, at a time, would make my laptop restart, taking longer each time it restarted, to do anything. Something told me to just go for it, and copy all 1500 pics at a time. I'm glad I did. At 89% of being complete, the laptop crashed. The next time I turned it on, it said my OS was missing. I wasn't worried about that last 11% of my pics. I had the SD cards, with the original pics on there, laying around the house. I felt so lucky, and excited, that I paid attention to my first mind, and purchase this flash drive when I did. Also, because I was able to literally get everything backed up. I was anxious though, I still had to check and see if all of my info made it on the flash drive...It did!!! This thing was a life saver. Whew!!!",

Then, trying to transfer videos from a Sandisk drive to one of these drives, it became corrupted and I lost all the previously added videos, and I cannot get them back using my recovery software!
