                "reviewText": "Others have stated that this will not work for Roku live TV pause, why? You must use the Roku formatting file system that the TV should prompt you to setup when a new jump drive is installed. The type or brand of jump drive makes no difference as long as it is 16MB or higher memory as Roku states. The flash drives usually only last for a year or two of using it this way (at least in my experience). If the TV locks up and/or act funny during live TV you know it's probably time for a new one. These are inexpensive so swapping them out with a new one periodically is no big deal.",

                "reviewText": "Dislike; as others have mentioned the \"cover\" is a very poor design. First of all, although it looks like it's supposed to slip off it's actually designed to slide back. As such it doesn't really keep and dirt and grime out of the contacts. The rotating type covers are much better. It's a cheap plastic housing that probably shouldn't be on a key chain anyway. But the worst part of the \"cover\" design is that after you slide it back you have to push hard to get it to actually slide ALL the way back. I thought I had two bad drives until I figured out that, with a fair deal of force, until you slide the \"cover\" ALL THE WAY BACK it will seem to be inserted in the USB port but isn't. It's even hard to close. I can't do it without putting the connector on a desk and pushing down.The complaints about slow are perhaps over stated. When I ran a speed benchmark using my system's over burdened 2.0 bus they were sslloooow (0.97 MB/s). To be fair this was through a Hub which may have been the bottleneck. On the systems 3.0 bus they reported a respectable 30 MB/s speed. That's half the USB 2.0 stated max through put but pretty decent for a jump drive. The only other old 2.0 drive I had clocked in at 18 Mb/s read and 6 Mb/s write. The fact that the PNY drive was equal for read and write was impressive.I bought these to create a recovery drive in preparation for moving my OS from the original HDD to my new SSD. For this purpose they are just fine. I've had good luck with PNY in the past and although this isn't a shining example of great design it was cheap and should do the job. I'm confident that once written the drive will serve it's purpose. But since I have two I'll create a duplicate. In the event I need one down the road at least one should work. I expect both will. But these really aren't large enough, robust enough or fast enough to use for much else. Really, if you want performance you should be buying a USB 3.0 drive. 2.0 should only be for legacy devices and/or a keyboard and mouse.Another complaint is the packaging. They are in a plastic clam shell double laminated in a cardboard frame that requires a knife to open. Money could have been spent on a reusable storage case and the frustration factor eliminated.",

If you have many smaller files, (I ran into this with an audio book in the car), you are going to have a long wait.I definitely learned a lesson: pay attention to the *write speed* when buying flash drives.
