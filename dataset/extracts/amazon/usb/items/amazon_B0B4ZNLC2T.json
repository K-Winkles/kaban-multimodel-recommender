The outlet was behind the couch and nothing was long enough to reach the table, where we needed the extra plug ins. This surge protector works perfectly with added features. I can easily turn off any unused side and it also supplies us with the needed USB ports and 12 outlets (8 more than we had!). The stand-up feature also frees up some space on the table.

The ultimate in surge protection control, if you over-worry (This unit surge-protects, too.) or unplug things when you are out. The built in USB adds convenient utility. I leave a cord in it so I can just walk up and plug my phone or tablet right in when I need to. It is 4-sided, so it needs a little space to use every plug. But you know what shape you are getting when you buy this. Works well in my late-50s kitchen, with it's limited receptacles. Could be just a little more 'solid'. 4.7 stars. \"For Traveling\" gets one star. (What a silly 'feature' to rate.)",

                "reviewText": "I hate clutter, and I detest a bunch of electrical cords on the floor. I bought one of these for my bedroom stuff (clock radio, lamp, cable TV/DVR, Roku, etc.) and it's sitting atop my console. All cords off the floor (had em plugged into a standard power strip before, and it drove me crazy getting under the cabinet, if I had to reset the Roku device, or reboot my DVR (spent way to much time on the floor!). NOW, everything's accessible!I liked the idea so much, I bought one for my office (wi-fi modem, lamp, lamp timer, voip phone modem, landline, etc.) and what a joy! The four outlet sides operate independently, so if you don't have to use all four sides of the tower, ya just don't turn em all on (I'm using only 3), and you save electricity. Great product. Got both mine in black. Loving the extra organization this gives me, not to mention, getting all my ducks (cords) in a row. :~) Wish I'd done this a lot sooner!",

I only use 2 or 3 plugs at a time (Don\u2019t plug space heaters into anything but the wall LADIES) and the usb ports are an amazing addition. I can\u2019t think of anything that would make it better, especially for the price. It\u2019s charged devices that others wouldn\u2019t, and I love that you can toggle the power off to the unit and to each side.",
