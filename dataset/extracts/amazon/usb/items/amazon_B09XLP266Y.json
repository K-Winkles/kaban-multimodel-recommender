Sometimes a product just does its job without fuss or muss. This is one of those times and I appreciate the ease and usability of the thumb drives.They are inexpensive enough for me to give, rather than charge for them when I give them away.

Several just needed the windows repair on them and one just plain wouldn't work. I would not buy them again too many problems using them for simple data transfer to share with others.",
