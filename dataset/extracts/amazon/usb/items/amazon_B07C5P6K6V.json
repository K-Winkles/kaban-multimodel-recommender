The Mac stated that the file was too big. This did not make any sense to me so my first thought was to return the flash drives. Well, I did some thinking and figured formatting of the flash drive was necessary. To make a very long story short, I tried several formats until I found (ex)FAT. My 21 MB file copied over quickly to the flash drive with no problems. Evidently, (ex)FAT allows the flash drive to be readable on both PCs and Macs.",
