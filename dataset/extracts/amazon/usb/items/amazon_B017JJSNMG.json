The only down side is that it is rather expensive for the capacity, but I figure you have to pay for design and small physical size too. While this one is great but expensive, there are a lot of drives that Amazon is blithely selling that have similar or larger stated capacities for a fraction of the price. The difference is that this one is actually 64 GB while the cheap ones are maybe 16 GB even though they claim varying but huge fake capacities.",

This drive is very sturdy, easy to plug/unplug (from various devices), and while playing 4k content, does not generate extreme heat (laptop or Roku).

                "reviewText": "I have no complaints to the seller or the construction of the device. It's simple and solid.I got this to replace an older one.Sadly it died after only one use. I have never seen a flash drive fail so quickly. The issue must be on cheaper parts used to make the chips. They are not user serviceable being the chip and the contacts are all one solid part, unlike older flash drives. Fortunately there was no data stored. This was meant to be a small ultra durable device to pass between instruments that collect data.",

                "reviewText": "I like the metallic construction, gold color and the engraved serial number, which makes it easier to keep track of multiple devices. However, there are 2 negatives:1. I speed tested my various USB 3 drives, and this was the slowest of them all. The miniature Verbatim Store 'n' Stay Nano performed the same transfer in 2/3 of the time of the Metal Executive. The Samsung BarPlus 256 GB was 5 to 6 times faster than the Metal Executive. (I format my drives with NTFS 4k clusters.)2. I bought 5 of these drives. 4 of them worked fine, but the 5th is not be recognized in Windows 11. After extensive troubleshooting, I contacted Verbatim, but they don't respond.Update 6/10/2023: Verbatim eventually responded, but it took 4 business days. They offered an RMA but want a photo of the drive showing the capacity printed on the case. I'm returning it to Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a few of these. Some are used as boot flash drives for different utilities like Win10 installer, Macrium rescue, Gparted, and Clonezilla. All work flawlessly in that configuration under a USB 3.0 or a USB 2.0 port and boot up just fine with whatever utility I need. One I used as an MP3 storage drive for my parent's car--in which said parents were aghast that it didn't come with a CD player. Being stunned as they were that CD's are obsolete it was easy enough to rip their CDs to this drive (with a lot of space to spare for future music for them), plug it into their car, and them having all of their music at their fingertips.Would definitely recommend if 16GB is enough for your use. It's small, rugged enough, and unobtrusive on a keychain.",
