                "reviewText": "I'm reviewing the 64GB version of the LINTYLE USB Flash Drive. For an inexpensive drive, my initial experience has been okay. It claims to be metal, and perhaps it is, but it feels like it has a plastic cover. Using Linux, I've captured the log data for the drive and also run some benchmarks. Both were done before the drive received any real-world use.The drive is small and does not come with a cover of any sort. You'll need to be careful not to get anything on the contacts. It has a handle like protrusion that is good for removing the drive from the port and can also be used with a key ring or perhaps a lanyard. The drive comes formatted as exfat. I needed to install support for exfat on Linux before I could mount it. I'll probably reformat it to something more appropriate for my computers.The Linux syslog shows it to be an SMI USB DISK (idVender=090C, idProduct=2000) with 122,880,000 512-byte logical blocks (62.9GB /58.6GiB). This appears to be a little smaller than the advertised 64GB. Perhaps some space is reserved for drive wear.I copied 36 files totaling 10.1GB to the drive. The copy took 608 seconds for an average rate of 16.6MB/s. This was just above the advertised 15MB/s shown in a product listing photo. That's about 1GB/minute so it's going to take over an hour to fill the entire drive. That's pretty slow for USB3. Copying the files from the flash drive to an SSD took 76 seconds at an average rate of 133MB/s. I would not be surprised to see much slower write speeds if the flash has to be erased when files are deleted.From what I've seen so far, this is a slow but decent, low-cost USB Flash Drive. I'm sure I have USB2 flash drives with similar write speeds. Buy this if you don't mind waiting for your files to be written to the drive. I'll use this more for long term storage than moving large files between computers.",

All metal and very lightweight. There is supposed to be a small ring so you can attach this to a chain or something, but there was no such ring included in the packaging. This plugged in smoothly and easily with no effort. This will work with USB 3.0, 2.0, and 1.1. I have an H.P. ENVY 360 Intel Core i7 laptop that\u2019s 8 years old, running Win 10 (USB 2.0) and it worked perfectly. I just plugged it in and started transferring the files I wanted to put on this drive. I like the odd shape of it, it makes it easy to grab and remove from my laptop when I\u2019m done with it. I have a label printer and the smooth flat sides on this make it easy to apply my labels so I know what is on them. 5 Stars I would buy more of these.",

                "reviewText": "This is a USB flash drive with 64gb of storage. The actual amount of usable free space appears to be closer to 58.5gb (see photo), but that's standard as hard drives never have quite as much capacity as advertised.The thumb drive case is metallic, giving it a nice, sturdy feel, and if you put it in a bag or in your pocket, you don't have to worry about it cracking. There is a hook on the top of it which would allow it to be attached to a keychain, but no chain is included with it.I've only just started using it, but so far no problems, and transfer speeds are just fine. Overall, a good USB drive that I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: While it does work in some machines I have found more often then not it will not be registered when plugged in. I tried both NTFS and exFAT formats and the problem continues. Not sure if the contact pins are inset to far back or if the chip is just faulty.Got this USB drive to replace my current SanDisk keychain thumb drive. Its more compact than my original one and feels more durable too. Fits perfectly on a key ring along side keys without binding up or causing issues.Speeds are on par if not slightly better in some areas to the SanDisk its replacing. (See Photo)The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I plugged it into a few different computers to see how well the fitment was to the ports and it was loose on one of my machines and would not connect right away. I tried 4 other drives in that same machine port and they all worked fine leading my to believe the fitment of this LINTYLE is a little more loose than others.Overall a great thumb drive for the price!",

You will see it has write speeds that almost equate to a class 10 U3 SD card and phenomenal read speeds for a USB flash drive that exceeds 98 MB per second. The test wrote data sequentially to the entire drive and verified the data was retained correctly.Well constructed with an entirely metal housing. This drive has a key ring loop built in so it is easy to carry around on my keychain.I think that this flash drive at a cost under $10.00 is an excellent price. This is a great deal in my opinion.I am happy with this drive. I give it 5 stars!I am VERY happy with this drive. I give it 5 stars!",
