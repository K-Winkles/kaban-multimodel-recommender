After about 3 weeks of copying data to this, one day when I plugged it in, my computer wouldn\u2019t recognize it. Tried several more times and on another computer and same result. So now I can\u2019t save any of my data, nor recover anything that I\u2019ve already stored on it. Going back to the big name storage devices. At least they\u2019ve never let me down.Update: Seller contacted me and offered a refund, even though the item was past Amazon\u2019s return window. So, I might give them another chance. Thank you!",

Before sending back, I test with my iPad and it did see it. This was the 1 tb model. I will update if I learn something new and would love for it to work.
