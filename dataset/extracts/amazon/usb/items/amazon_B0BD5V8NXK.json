                "reviewText": "I have many laptops and Mini PCs at home for our kids and my own use. I have to sometimes reinstall Windows on these laptops or Mini PCs but most of them don't come with installation CDs or USB thumb drive so I bought this bootable USB thumb drive for Windows 10 and Windows 11 and it works wonderfully.Please note that both versions of Windows is 64 bit and you will not be able to install this operating system on a really old hardware. I tried to install on a laptop that had legacy Windows Vista version but it didn't have matching drivers for old hardware but I was able to install it on laptop that had Windows XP.This is great for backup and recovery in case you have any hardware or software failure and needs to reinstall Windows 10/11 or if you simply need to wipe everything to start clean as this is needed when you have virus or if the computer gets too slow due to too many malware software. Highly recommend it.",

It supports both UEFI and Legacy systems, so it's versatile and can be used with a wide range of computers.In addition to password reset, the USB driver also includes a reinstall/restore function (get back to like new in just a few ^_^). This is helpful if you need to reinstall Windows or restore your system to a previous state.best feature - The data recovery tool is another useful feature, allowing you to recover lost or deleted files.",
