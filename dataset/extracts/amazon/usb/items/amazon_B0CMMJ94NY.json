USB flash drives are commonly used in various Android smartphones and tablets, iPad Pro and iPad Mini using USB-c port, as well as PCs and laptops. Using it, you can make photo sharing and file transfer between these devices very simple and fast. Precautions: The initial storage format of this USB C thumb drive is exFAT. If there is incompatibility on the mobile phone, you need to reformat it to FAT32 format. However, FAT32 format cannot store a single video or file with a capacity greater than 4GB. The capacity calculation method of the computer is different from that of the USB drive. The computer uses 1MB = 1024KB and the USB drive uses 1MB = 1000KB. Therefore, the display capacity of the USB drive on the computer is about 92% of the marked capacity. USB flash drive will generate heat when working. This is a normal phenomenon. Please rest assured to use it. Media Formats Supported\uff1a Music: M4A / AIFF / CAF / MP3 / WAV Image: GIF / JPG / PNG / JPEG Video: AVI / FLV / M4V / MKV / MOV / MP4 / RMVB Document: DOC / PPT / XLS / XLSX / PDF / HTML / TX Compatible Devices: - iPad Pro2019/2020 (under iPad OS system, the USB is in \"\"File Folder\"\")/iPad Air 2020 - MacBook/MacBook Pro/Macbook Air - All Android smartphones and reading devices NOTE: After some brands of Android phones are used, when they are used in Windows, the Windows system will prompt \"Repair\".

It tells the computer that it has 1TB of storage yet its storage capacity is much smaller. If you try to store more than about 60 Gb it starts erases previously stored data to accommodate the new data. I tried to store 900Gb on one or them and it showed all the directories as expected, but bad or incorrect files were in each of those directory. Data that should have been in one directory showed up over writing the contents of other directories. Some directories were completely corrupted. Tested the two devices I purchased on completely different computers with different data sets and got the same result. Do not trust your data to these devices. The earliest data stored on it will be overwritten with the later data you save. This will completely corrupting your data. Only purchase this device if you want to loose your data.",
