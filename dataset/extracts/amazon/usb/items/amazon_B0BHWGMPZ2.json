I suggested the MFi Certified 128GB Photo Stick and it's been an absolute hit for them. MFi is certified for Apple and it is so easy to use, capturing ALL of their photos and freeing up space to take more. Having this small, portable device means that they could easily save their photos, move them to a couple of electronic photo frames, the ones that change the picture every few seconds that they gave to the grandparents.Works great, easy to master, and easy to store. This is a great way to free up space on your phone and save everything. It stores in a small lock box, protecting these priceless photos for many years to come.",

All in all, this is a quick and easy way to move photos off the phone or transfer pics to a PC.",

When plugging it into the phone, it is simple to use the menu comes right up to download the app and you can download all your photos and videos or content like your contact cards effortlessly and quickly when needed.

The process of backing up crashed about 1/2 way through the backup. Software directions did warn not to backup everything at once. I tried to select photos by year but that didn't go well so selected everything to backup. My biggest disappointment was that it changed the file names so photos were no longer sortable by year and it didn't keep the meta data that went with each photo. The device is probably good, but not the software so therefore 3 stars.",
