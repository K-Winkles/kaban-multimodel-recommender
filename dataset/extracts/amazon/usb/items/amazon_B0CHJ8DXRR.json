                "reviewText": "This device, The Patianco iExpand 128GB iOS Flash Drive with Lightening & USB-A on either end with an additional USB-A to USB-C adapter is not plug and play. Of course, as we know iOS is not a completely open File System perhaps driving the need to download a dedicated app from the AppStore.The iExpand App is not very flexible and the enclosed directions in the user manual are very small print requiring a magnifying glass to read.I am pretty tech savvy yet have been unable to move anything except my Photo library to the iExpand Flash Drive. The device is very app reliant and the app is not well rated on the iOS AppStore due to functionality issues. It would be much better if I could backup other file types, ie. PDFs and entire folders, that I can access from the iOS Files App.So if your goal is to make sure that you can save photos while on a trip in case of a lost, stolen, or damaged iPhone without using data to do regular iCloud backups then this would likely suit your needs.",
