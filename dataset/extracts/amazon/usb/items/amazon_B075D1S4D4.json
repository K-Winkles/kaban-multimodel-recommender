                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Stores music, with playback over iPhone while charging, even over your car's audio system. But...",
                "reviewText": "This review focusses on the use of the Duo Link USB for music storage on iPhone as that seems to be a missing sector in the marketplace. First, it is a really nice product as it does allow easy storage of music files from your iPhone, and the DuoLink 4 app lets you play it back (using the iPhone) from the Duo Link USB while charging. Customer service with them over the phone or email is great if there are any problems. The USB with the app works well even over your car's audio system, with the music sent over bluetooth. I have about 3,000 songs in my music library and this allows all of them to be stored on the Duo Link with a lot of room to spare, and to be played back while traveling, which is great because music takes up so much space as to make the iPhone unusable for anything else (and no I don't want to get rid of some of that music). This unit provides the ready-access external storage that I needed for music. (Note: this works on iPhone 8 and up - except for the newest iPhones with the USB-C ports).The downside is that the Duo Link 4 App that works with this USB is not very sophisticated. Some examples of issues: 1) The music must all be copied into MP3 files initially. For all my files this took a couple hours, but was not a big deal and copying worked flawlessly. 2) The copying is done alphabetically by file name, and that is how the music files are then categorized - typically without the artists name or any other information. 3) Because the files are converted to MP3s, all the metadata that you may have added in Apple Music or other Music programming is missing. For example, the name of the file is there, but typically the artist is not (and the cover art, the genre, your ratings, etc are all missing). This means that you cannot use the app to play all your music of a specific genre or type, or any music from a favorite artist, unless you go in and manually select all that particular music and categorize it again into a separate file on the app. Otherwise, you have to manually search for songs and play them manually. 4) Voice commands using Siri or other systems do not work as the app is just not sophisticated enough. So, while driving you cannot request songs or use the phone hands-free to play music. 5) After playing music over the app, the control screen seems to disappear. So the only way to get out of the app (and stop music from playing) is to manually shut down the app.All-in-all, the USB provides excellent storage, and it does seem to be unique in that it allows you to charge the phone while playing (and even connect the iPhone manually via a USB data transfer cord). But the weak point is the app which is very poor. If the company, or even a third party could develop something that is iPhone compatible, that would really be a great thing. But as it stands now you get great storage but very few options for easy playback unless you want to spend hours/days re-categorizing your music files.",

                "reviewText": "Finally, an easy way to break the barrier between Apple products and the rest of the world! Easily transfers files between my iPhone/iPad to the USB drive using the Duo Link App, which can then be read and copied just like ordinary files on my PC. The best feature is the automatic decoding of the proprietary Apple .livp (live photo) format that most iPhone photos are stored in these days. The app reads the files on the fly as they are transferred, and for each .livp photo you get a thumbnail, the original Apple file, a short .mov clip, and a jpeg all stored on the flash drive. I can't even begin to describe how easy and time saving this process makes saving iPhone photos now!",

                "reviewText": "This was for my son to use to backup photos from his iPhone for archive without putting the pictures online on a cloud storage.He explained that cloud storage is not private ... it is up to the cloud owner to use the data as they agree to. Typically, the cost of maintaining the storage is born by the owner ... who seeks to extract information from whatever is stored ... metadata and identity of faces in the pictures, for whatever value can be achieved in the digital information marketplace.I want none of that. I imagined this device would allow my son to backup our pictures from iPhones and iPads easily and privately without sharing them on the cloud.This USB storage device is not like the one I've used with a personal computer; this PNY device will not function without the app.That is a design limitation which may be from iOS and certainly is from PNY.The iOS app is necessary to use this device, and has poor reviews. I could've seen this before I paid for the storage device. I hope this review provides insight/warning to other Amazon customers so the mistake I made is not repeated.1. The device will not function on iOS devices without the Duo Link app. That is its own problem -- a deal breaker for my son and for me.2. The Duo Link app is not easy enough to use.Apple products are supposed to just work. This storage device just doesn't work without the app, and the app is not easy enough to use.3. I believe this app wants to have access to the Duo Link server infrastructure on the network to function. That is not private enough for my family.I am very unsatidfied with the concept of requiring web access and access to anything on a company server (where? It's \"Made in China\"). for such a simple idea of backing up photos onto a USB device.This is suspiciously too complicated and connected (to what and where?) for my family to use it.Beware.",
