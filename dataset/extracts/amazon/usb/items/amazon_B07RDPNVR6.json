They look good and are unique, so when I give them out or share with my friends, they remember who gave it to them! I also like that I can stick one in an envelope with a letter, and it can be mailed easily with 1st class mail with the original stamp and envelope! I've purchased multiple sets, and only had one that didn't work -- the others have fared well, too. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to people needing basic storage for a great price.",

                "reviewText": "I wouldn't put any important data on these. However, they are great for keeping live-bootable OS images or installer images on them. Their color coding and size make them ideal for that. Plus, the key shape makes them pretty novel and fun to put on a key chain with any other USB drives you might have.Why not put any important data on these? Well, one of the five failed a quick size test using RMprepUSB with a usable size of 10GB. I did this test after trying these out and noticing their absolutely terrible read/write speed, even for USB 2.0. I ended up using Ubuntu to \"Erase\" the drives before getting any decent write speeds. The read speeds are and continue to be great though which is why I see these as perfect for live-bootables and installer USBs.At the end of the day, it was great value for my money despite the slight annoyance of having to use two Operating systems to erase and then format the drives. I essentially got four 32GB sticks for $20 which is a little better than SanDisk's 3 32GB sticks for the same price at Walmart. I wouldn't trust these out of the box with my main home computer, but after cleaning and testing, I trust them enough to hold some data. I still wouldn't put anything important on them as, with one failure already, it's both a lottery and a matter of time before another drive starts to fail and the bad one fails catastrophically.",
