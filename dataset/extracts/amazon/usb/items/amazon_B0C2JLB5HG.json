                "reviewText": "I bought this to use with a PC gaming handheld, a Legion Go. Already type-C, easy to use with modern mobile hardware. Can use it with iPhone 15 or Android phones without an adapter. I expected that there would be speed degradation in sustained loads that would saturate any fast cache on the drive. That would be fine as all I wanted was something better than overpriced microSD cards that drop to like 10MB/s under any load. This at worst is like 80MB/s.The early burst will sustain about 1GB/s for a bit but then drop. Then it'll go to some troughs and peaks. Just now in my testing moving moving about 100 GB of data, it's mostly at 130MB/s and random moments of 230-300MB/s. That is better than I expected. Okay now it's gone down to 60MB/s. Now with videos maybe average size like 8GB moving over 100GB in total at a time, this maintains about 120-200MB/s through most of it. Maybe it too hot. Doesn't feel too hot to touch like some NVME in enclosures that I've felt. Flash drives are inconsistent than an m.2 in an enclosure but we pay for the size and convenienceSo much better and consistent than microSD cards in similar price brackets. Random read/write on my 1TB microSD card sucks compared to this in CrystalDiskMark. I'm playing games off this flash drive that on Steam, have files that some total to over 100GB. My microSD card has little load time hitches in games. This flash drive, so much better than a spinning disk. The glory of good flash storage and random access performance. Sure there's going to be modern games with DirectStorage that aren't perfect, but I've watched videos of the PS5 Ratchet and Clank on SATA3 drives and it's still way better than spinning disk.I approve of this flash drive.
