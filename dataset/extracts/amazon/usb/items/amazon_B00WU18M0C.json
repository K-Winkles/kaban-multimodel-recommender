                "reviewText": "I once had trouble with flash drives that looked similar to these, but these were fine - perfect, in fact. As with *any* new data storage, I *always* reformat the device using \"not quick\" options in order to 100% test the entire data space; so I did that on each one. Never do a quick format which just \"book ends\" the data space without writing to every bit. After formatting, I run a USB testing program on each drive. For Windows operating systems, I like \"Flash Drive Tester\" Version 1.14 (it's free). Following the running of the tester, another long format is required because the tester destroys the formatting. After the 2nd reformat, I fill the drive slam full with data and run Windows \"Check Disk\" with the options checked for testing all the data while finding and repairing any bad clusters.So, all this may sound tedious, but it's not nearly the waste of time that loosing data is. If you find problems (and you may sometimes), you should throw the flash drives in the trash. Using a bad flash drive is like climbing with a rope that's half cut through - the only different is that the cut rope may actually work.Here are the results for these 10 flash drives (64MB):-All formatted fine-The flash drive tester found no problems anywhere-They reformatted fine a 2nd time-I filled them to the brim with data and ran CHKDSK. No problems found.I was pleasantly surprised. Off brand flash drives can be QA rejects or fraudulent. I needed some cheap \"able to give to my friends\" flash drives, so I went out on a limb for these. It worked out great.",
