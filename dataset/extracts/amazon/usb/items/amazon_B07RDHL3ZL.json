They read and write much faster than some Lexar drive I bought in the store, even though both are USB 2.0. I've written, over written, rewritten and many times and haven't had a failure yet. The the swivel feels like it were made of steel and make it feel heavier than other similar drives I've bought. I like it. These have been the best bulk drives I've bought so far. These came preformatted to FAT32, so they immediately worked on both my linux and windows machines, as well as a DVR type device that's a little picky. I haven't tried Mac because I don't have one.",
