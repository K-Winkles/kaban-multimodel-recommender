                "reviewText": "This flash drive is very small, probably small enough to get lost in your bag if you\u2019re not careful! The swivel design is rather unique, as most of my thumb drives are extendable/retractable with a slider on the side. The cat on the front is cute, and when it\u2019s rotated 180 degrees, the USB dongle is revealed, and when rotated another 180 degrees, it retracts. It doesn\u2019t matter which direction you turn the cat, it will still retract and extend the dongle if you turn it counterclockwise or clockwise.64G is a good size for a flash drive, although it could be bigger if you decide to spend a few more bucks. The transfer rate is fine, not too slow and not super fast like the more expensive name brand flash drives.There is a loop on the top end by the ears to attach a cord or keychain ring so you can put the flash drive on your keys or bag if you desire. Although the description says it is waterproof, I don\u2019t dare to try dunking this in water. It is probably water resistant to some degree and will survive a few splashes of water, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ll expect for that feature.",

                "reviewText": "Obviously, it's adorable. But, it's also functional with the design. The spinner on the front retracts or reveals the USB port. It is a pretty small size. Smaller than I was expecting. But, that isn't a bad thing for me. It has a place in the top where you could add a cord or ring if you wanted to keep it on a keychain or something. I tested it by putting a 200MB file on it and it uploaded in a few seconds. I've tried others that were excruciatingly slow. But, this one seems to work as expected. It is doubtful you will mix this USB up with someone else's. I didn't test it for being waterproof. But, as long as electronics are completely dry (or they will short out) before you use them, they can get wet.",
