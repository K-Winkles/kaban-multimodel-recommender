I see some folks got defective physical C usb connector. The 3 I have are not defective. I made Acronis rescue media and restored 40gb to my bitlocked laptop. I am happy with how fast it restored. I did have one device that windows 11 had trouble formatting to ntfs. That sort of scared me but it did format fine in another laptop. If the build issue still exists I don't see it any I have. Everything about it is in written form on the back. Maybe there are faster write speeds but not with the phone usb C support. This a unique product. Based on current 3.2 USB but that only means you can plug it to something 3.2 there aren't claims to support optimal 3.2 transfer speeds. I could not find another small device like this to go between machines with differing physical connections. I'm only worried about the one that was tricky to format.",

                "reviewText": "I really like how this flash drive has USB C on one end and USB A on the other end. I was able to transfer files for a recent trip from my desktop, which only has USB A connectors and later access the files on my Surface 9, which only has USB C connectors. It was very fast to transfer the data, which was a surprise as most USB drives start out fast then slow down when you transfer large files. This one seemed to keep the transfer speed in high gear the whole time. I did not run any metrics on it but it seemed to be faster than other drives I have used.",

Using this drive is an absolute hell, you can't simply stick the USB-C side in, since it retracts back due to an amazingly bad design and basically loose internals. You need to use unconventional angles and manually push on the other connection interface in order to use the one you need.I have no idea how this product came through all the checks of the brand like PNY, but I know that due to that 25$ flash drive I'll probably avoid PNY products in the future.",
