After using them for about six months I haven't seen any data loss issues. At the price, they're a good buy. Writing is not particularly fast as noted in the review headline. (Also if you have a laptop you can get four of these on a USB hub - effectively extending your storage space by a bit less than 1/2 TB.) I've even tried \"daisy chaining\" a hub and that seems to work okay provided you aren't accessing more than one at a time.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Buyer beware, this drive is as slow as many other \"USB 3.0\" drives (5MBps) [Updated]",
                "reviewText": "This is one of the first affordable 512GB USB flash drives I've seen, so I purchased 2 of them.Unfortunately, they are just as slow as the other USB flash drives I've bought from PNY, Sandisk, and Micro Center. Write speeds began when writing 168GB of data at about 100 megabytes per second, but quickly dropped to 5 megabytes per second which is what I've come to expect from basically every brand except for Samsung. The reason the write speed appears high at the start is due to it writing to a local cache on the drive (usually comprised of RAM or an SLC cache) and it drops to the true write speed once that cache is exhausted. The other thing to keep in mind is that you cannot disconnect the drive till this write cache is written to the storage otherwise you will lose all of that data as the write cache is volatile. So users that may not want to write as much will be stuck waiting for it to write at the abysmally low 5MBps write speed if they want to keep their files they just tried to write to the disk.It's truly a shame Teamgroup can't produce a drive with a better sustained write speed and I expected better from them after buying their SSDs for all of my computer builds. Very disappointed. Only good for an archive drive. Stick to their SSDs and buy a Samsung flash drive like the fit or the bar if you want it to be truly fast.[Update] I underwent more testing and figured out that these drives do not work well with NTFS and handle small files worse than my BAR drives. They noticeable worked far better with exFAT as the filesystem in my experience. The difference was major and immediate since switching over. I think the issue either comes down to the controller or the flash used. Regardless, take note it does function well, but only when using FAT or FAT based systems (FAT32/exFAT). Shame because NTFS is far more reliable in terms of recoverability so 4/5.",

But ONLY for reading - and you really won't get this kind of speed in real-world use anytime anywhere.The more disappointing reality is that the random read and random write speeds are both pretty horrible at (on my Crystal result) a little less than 4MB/s on read and around 1.5MB/s on random writes. Even the sequential writes take substantial hit from reads with the writes coming in at 38MB/s.Still, for this price and capacity, it fills a need. I've had good experience with Teamgroup products.*****",

Pretty fast delivery for an overseas purchase (I don't know if the delivery speed was affected by me being a Prime member though).Most important, though, is that the drives varies widly in performance (2 of them being dud drives with USB2 speed). Still a decently solid purchase for the price I paid I guess",
