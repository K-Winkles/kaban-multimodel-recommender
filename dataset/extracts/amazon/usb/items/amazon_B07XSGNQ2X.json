                "reviewText": "Just wanted to be able to store some photos and videos. Does the job, kinda wished I would've went with the 8gb but still fine.My LED light doesn't work which sucks, cause I don't know when it's finished transferring to eject.Lastly, more of a pet peeve, there's no locking mechanism for the cover. I knew it'd be 360 turning but I thought there'd be a little click- clicky mechanism (you know what i mean) not just out turning on a swivel. Makes the cover kinda useless.Hasn't degraded or corrupted yet so it's fine. Not my first choice but an affordable one.",
