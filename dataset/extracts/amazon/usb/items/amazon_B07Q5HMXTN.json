                "reviewText": "UPDATE: All my problems were related to the fact that Windows Format will not create FAT32 volumes bigger than 32GB. These USB drives come formatted as 128GB FAT32 - however as soon as you (or the Windows Recovery Media Utility) reformat them, the storage is limited to a 32GB FAT32 volume.I retested my USB drives. I re-formatted them as exFAT drives and they work as advertised.If you ever want to re-format a usb drive as a FAT32 larger than 32GB (like the way these come from the factory), you'll need to buy or find a free 3rd party format utility that will do large FAT32 volumes.I upgraded my rating to 4 stars; they are not 5-star drives because they are a bit slow (but they work as advertised).[Original Review]I had issues with the two I ordered not being able to store more than 32 of the promised 128GB of data.The first drive was used by the Windows \"Create Recovery Media\" tool. The tool formatted the USB drive, then had errors writing the recovery drive media. Looking at the USB drive afterwards it was formatted as a 32GB drive. I tried re-formatting several times - but it never showed more than 32GB capacity.I tested the second USB drive. It appeared to have the 128GB capacity when viewed with windows explorer. However, when I started copying a lot of data to the drive, it started having errors after I had copied approximately 32GB of data to it.Both of these USB drives had the promised 128GB printed on the drive. Seems fishy to me. They have lost my trust.",

I need to investigate 3rd party backup programs but just to get a size idea, a XCOPY of C: to the thumb drive left plenty of room (didn't copy Documents or Pictures - they each went to the other 2 thumb drives from this three pack). Not ideal since these won't boot or restore C: if it gets clobbered, but this looks like a viable avenue to investigate.",
