                "reviewText": "While I read mixed reviews and recommendations about the read/write speed for exporting tracks out of Rekordbox, this thing is blazing fast. Are there slightly faster drives? Yes, but this will get the job done in a matter of seconds regardless. Let alone, the difference between this and a Sandisk Extreme Pro is unnoticeable when loading tracks on a controller/unit.",

They are clearly double the cost or more of similar products in the same category. I've ordered both the 128 Gb and the 256 Gb devices. Both are solid and reliable. I very much like the protection their covers afford when transporting from place to place. Full aluminum outer casings with rubber seals and fast transfer speeds while using. Now, if only Corsair could lower the cost a little - really?!",
