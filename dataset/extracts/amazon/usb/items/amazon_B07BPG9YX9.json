                "reviewText": "Bought three of these Samsung BAR plus in 64GB, two for key chain use, one to have handy on my desk. Made sure Amazon was the seller to help avoid any risk of non-genuine Samsung parts. Just arrived and burned each one in briefly using CrystalDiskMark, so I could both be sure each worked and compare speeds between the units. All three tested within about 2% of each other on each benchmark. Importantly, the sequential read speeds exceeded the claimed 200 MB/s in each case, averaging 224 MB/s. Writes were all 34MB/s. All tests were conducted on my laptop, a Lenovo Flex5, on a USB 3.0 port. Clearly the sequential read speeds take advantage of USB3.0 bandwidth.Overall very pleased for the price and the key chain friendly stainless steel casing. Note I did put a cover on the USB end of each, using the covers from Honbay 40pcs Semitransparent Black and Clear Plastic USB Male Anti-Dust Plug Stopper Cap Cover . I wanted just a bit more protection when used on key chains from dents and the elements. These Honbay covers fit snugly yet come off relatively easily. These feel like TPR, which is good for grip and flexibility.Pros+Fairly fast overall for the price, and clearly very fast at sequential reads.+Good looking, tough stainless steel body+Great form factor for handling - only as wide as a USB port so they won't cause any interference with adjacent ports, a bit longer than the really small USB drives designed to stay mounted all the time, but therefore very easy to get in and out, especially with the raised end near the lanyard hole providing a nice grip.+Hangs just fine on my key chain, a Maxpedition Gear Keyper Maxpedition Gear Keyper, Foliage Green using a FREEkey ring, the absolutely most secure rings you can buy in my experience FREEkey Accessory Ring Spares, 10 Count Cons-wish for faster write speeds-gets warm but not so hot as to be a concern so farNo data yet on reliability, will updated if I find any issues.CrystalDiskMark results, below...-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 6.0.0 x64 (C) 2007-2017 hiyohiyo Crystal Dew World : https://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 bytes/s [SATA/600 = 600,000,000 bytes/s]* KB = 1000 bytes, KiB = 1024 bytes Sequential Read (Q= 32,T= 1) : 224.198 MB/s Sequential Write (Q= 32,T= 1) : 34.365 MB/s Random Read 4KiB (Q= 8,T= 8) : 13.355 MB/s [ 3260.5 IOPS] Random Write 4KiB (Q= 8,T= 8) : 13.147 MB/s [ 3209.7 IOPS] Random Read 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) : 13.285 MB/s [ 3243.4 IOPS] Random Write 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) : 13.377 MB/s [ 3265.9 IOPS] Random Read 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) : 12.632 MB/s [ 3084.0 IOPS] Random Write 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) : 12.593 MB/s [ 3074.5 IOPS] Test : 1024 MiB [E: 0.0% (0.0/59.8 GiB)] (x5) [Interval=5 sec] Date : 2018/07/03 4:03:29 OS : Windows 10 Professional [10.0 Build 17134] (x64)",

At the start of retrieving the files, it went really fast. But after a few files, the speed dropped tremendously. So I'm mired down for a while bringing the files over (see the file-copy image attached). I have confirmed that external hard drives do not perform in this manner, so it appears to be the behavior of this thumb drive. Perhaps it utilizes a read cache for short bursts, and it doesn't last through 79GB of data.",
