More importantly, it makes the dream of One-Connect-All come true. A stable and reliable way to expand the USB port is becoming more and more important. While the truth is, as the unregulated market growing, the All-In-One may become the One-Fails-All. To solve these fatal problems, LENTION published the advanced industrial standard Stable Driver to help customers buy products with confidence. Stable Driver solved 3 main concerns from customers: Non-interference between different ports (from signal interference to Plug & Unplug interference), Sufficient power supply to support the peripherals working normally, and Working under reasonable temperature to maximize the lifespan of the device.",

After others couldn't get it to work either, I reached out to the company.They were very responsive and had me try a couple things which didn't get the unit to function. After we realized it was a faulty unit, they immediately sent a replacement.The new unit worked great and is a nice addition. The multiple USB-A ports make it nice for connecting an external keyboard, mouse and external hardrive. The HDMI end allows for my external monitor so I can use the laptop with a complete workstation at either work or home. Plus, the price is at the right point.The unit is what it is, however it's the service I received from the company that gets me to highly recommend buying this product. We don't get much good service from companies anymore, and my hard earned dollars will go to the ones that provide that.",

The seller was very helpful and I did not realize that this hub has to be plugged into the wall as a power source to be used. Once I plugged it into the power source with a type C to usb, it worked fine for all outlets. I now changed my review.PRIOR REVIEW:This does not work. The only thing it does is charge my phone when plugged in but it doesn\u2019t even sync the phone to the iMac. I tried to get it to work with apple for 2 hours. It\u2019s definitely the hub. USBs don\u2019t work and neither does the type c or hdmi. Very disappointing. I waited a while for it to arrive for it to not work so now I have to wait for a refund before I can even start the process of purchasing another. Very inconvenient\u2026especially when it advertised it was compatible with my iMac m1.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 2nd edit to this review. Original problem has been fixed and everything works great on this device. I have to say the team at Lention has superb customer service. They helped resolve the issue I had with their device and went above and beyond in ensuring I was satisfied with the product. Im changing my rating to a 5 star, they did everything they could to help and Im blown away by the care for their customers. I highly recommend doing business with this company. Ill leave my initial review below incase others experience the same issue. If I may provide a tip to anyone with the same issue. Try plugging in a power supply and hdmi to the adaptor before plugging into ipad.Original review: I Initially gave this 2 stars because the hdmi connection wasnt working with my ipad pro. It still isnt working, however, i believe its more an apple/ ipad issue and not the adaptor. I have since tried it with my samsung phone and the hdmi port works just fine. I Bought this specifically so I could use the HDMI to TV ipad connection with a USBC charge pass through. My other intended use was to plug in keyboards, midi controllers USB accessories and SD cards. I can confirm they all work. Except when it came time to extend my Ipad display through the HDMI port. Would not work no matter what I did. Checked every setting possible on ipad and TV. Watched youtube videos and couldn't find a solution. One user said his multi port of different brand didn't work with his ipad either. He proceeded to use a generic hdmi only adapter with no other ports and it worked. I also had access to a simple hdmi only adaptor lacking the charge pass through and other plugins and lo and behold it worked first try. So for whatever reason, the ipad struggles to identify the hdmi port on this multi port adaptor but works no problem with simple adapters. Frustrating because I want an all in one port without needing to carry multiple adaptors. I thought this was the one, I like the sleek design and cable so it doesn't interfere with my case but sadly it does not do what I need it to do when it comes to HDMI.",
