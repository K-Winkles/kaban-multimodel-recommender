But I would not want to throw these USB drives into a backpack where they might get crushed or bang around. The USB transfer speed was also fine. Not super fast but comparable to other USB drives I have had. I usually transfer a bunch of files and then do other stuff while the files transfer, then come back to it a little later. Overall I am happy with these and would recommend them",

                "reviewText": "There are certainly faster drives out there, but for basic document/file storage for the price it's totally fine. This company's 32GB drives are way slower (like half the speed), but these 64GB drives seem much more reasonable if you need more speed/performance. By the way, it's normal for speeds to fall off as the size of the files decrease (as can be seen below or in the photo). You won't notice the slower speeds with tiny files because it's done in a blink of an eye. You will notice slow performance, however, if you copy LOTS (like thousands) of very tiny files (like txt files). It's not like this drive is big enough for it to really be a problem anyway.For the price and under the right scenarios, these drives will be totally acceptable.These drives come formatted as fat32, so the largest file you can save is 4GB. If you need to store larger files, be sure to use NTFS or extFat. The test results here are using fat32 format.Real world test of 3GB file takes about 2:55 to copy to the device. Their 32GB drives (from the same company) takes about 6:05 to copy the same file.How I would use these drives: Leave it in my laptop case (or car or desk drawer) for infrequent \"oh, I wish I had a flash drive\" situation. This would also be fine to store power points for presentations and things like that. Even if you don't need the extra space, these perform much better than the 32GB version from the same company.You would probably not want to use this model as a permanent bootable device but as an emergency bootable/recovery device, it would be just fine.Starting benchmark.Starting large file benchmark.

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Grest read speed. Slow write speed.",
                "reviewText": "Update (9/28/2023):I reached out to the seller. They responded quickly (< 24 hours). They offered to send me replacements. It's great that they do a decent job of supporting devices.If you are going to read a lot from this device, it's a wonderful device. An example is using this for OS installation or Live disk (where you boos to the OS). This is where you burn the image once and boot from it repeatedly.If you want to do lots of writing, where you back up a large folder all the time and keep it for an emergency, I suggest you think carefully. These drives are faster than most USB 2.0 thumb drives which tops at 25MB/sec and average 5-10MB/sec. These aren't crazy slow but they are at the bottom of the write speed.I ran the same test using 2.16 GB ISO image.For the second set of devices, the performance was consistent across both devices.READ: 25 seconds (~86MB/sec)WRITE: 1 minute 53 seconds (~19MB sec).The read speed on these thumb drives is close to the highest advertised speed of 90MB/sec. Unfortunately, the write speed on these drives is just above the bottom of the range between 15MB/sec and 80 MB/sec. In none of my tests, I've ever seen write really go beyond 19 MB/sec.I ran a couple of write tests with a 95MB file too. I observed speeds between 15 MB/sec and 20MB/sec. Very consistent with the 2GB file tests.Original Review:I used the same USB C docking station I evaluated earlier. The USB 3.0 port was benchmarked with an m.2 external drive that performed well beyond the thumb drive's specs.So the very first read/writes were slow. This isn't always an issue. (Not going to go into that.). So I threw those numbers out. Then I ran subsequent tests. While the read was overall better, the write on one of the devices is below minimum. As for the source of the files, I am using my Macbook Air M1 with 512GB of storage. The drive on M1 is known as exceptionally fast. I've also used it to benchmark the m.2 external enclosure as well.Both drives were tested on factory-formatted FAT32. The performance with 2.16 GB file operations.I saw a performance of ~25 seconds on both devices for the read. But for writers, while one of the devices wrote in around 2 minutes, the other takes nearly 3 minutes. I only ran one copy at any time and ran these tests multiple times with consistent results.As for other features.The unit has a bright LED on the top. It's either blinking or solid red. Normally, when you eject (other) thumb drives, the LED goes dark to indicate it is disconnected. But with these, the LED flashes for a few seconds and stays on solid. I waited for a minute but the LED never turned off.In short,The read speeds are on the upper end of what they advertised for performance. As for the write, it's either at 19.6 MB/sec or 12.7 MB/sec. The latter being worse than the minimum speed they advertised. I reran the write test with both devices several times but saw similar results. And it's not as if it wrote fast at the start and slowed down.If you purchase these units, I urge the buyer to run speed tests immediately and ensure they are performing as expected. You want to throw out the first few tests. But if you keep seeing issues, I recommend you reach out to the vendor or Amazon immediately to address your issues.",
