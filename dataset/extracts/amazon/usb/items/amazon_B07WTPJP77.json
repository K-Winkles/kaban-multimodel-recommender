But I am not going to downrate a product that's upfront with this at all. All came pre-formatted with exFAT. I changed some to NTFS but probably wasn't needed. I did run a full USB test on one because there are definitely bad actors out there that sell scam USB drives (usually USB) and for some reason Amazon doesn't police them like they should. But these are legit and as advertised. Size after formatting for 64GB is about 58.5GB in Win10.",

The only problem is that the yellow one seems to always have a problem. I have had to reformat it twice and it has failed to retain documents that I have put on it. I have used the Microsoft repair tool and it says that it is repaired, but twice now I've had to reload it. Because I can't trust it, I also have to keep that same information on another device. I don't know what happened to this one in particular or if its just a factory defect that will never be resolved. The others are working great and I love them. I love that they are color-coded to help me have a system of storage. I would recommend them in spite of my failed yellow one because I do think it is just a fluke that others may not experience.",

I used two of the five so far and they both work as they are supposed to. I'm very happy with the speed of delivery, the speed of the storage and I like having different colors so I can identify what I have stored on them. On my blue one, I store about thirty golf instruction videos. I'm transferring old VCRs using the appropriate software and a converting VCR machine that transports the old VCR onto my hard drive and then I'm putting them on my blue USB thumb drive. On my yellow one, I am storing photos from an old computer on to the yellow thumb drive. These thumb drives are wonderful for my needs. I'm also storing the golf videos on to DVD-R disks. This is a small company that would be happy to receive your orders at a very fair price. Try them, I think you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
