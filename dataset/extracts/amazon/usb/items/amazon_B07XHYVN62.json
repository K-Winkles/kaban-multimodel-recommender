The speed is good. When I copied a relatively large amount of data to it, it stumbled at a file of 7.2GB. I already knew that the original formatting has a stricter file size limitation. So, just format it and it goes smoothly - in case you need to write such a large file to the drive - it all depends on your needs (I used the normal formatting at Win 10). Either way, it works fine and the formatting (if needed) is easily done.",

ReliableCons: Very slow for a USB3 drive.There are better options available for the same or sometimes even slightly less money if your quest is for speed. If your quest is for ultra small size, this thumbdrive is about as small as they come. Not every use case has a need for extreme speed. If your primary desire is to have a thumbdrive almost permanently stuck into your laptop as you lug it around, with very low chance of bumping or snagging the thumbdrive and breaking it, then this one would be a great choice for that. It is so small that sometimes it can be difficult to get hold of to pull it out if there are others things plugged in around it. My thumbdrive never even gets slightly warm to the touch. But I do not do extended reads/writes to it. The most I ever call on it to do is to boot an operating system and load the entire OS into RAM. That takes roughly one minute (guessing) for 2Gb worth of continuous reading from the drive. So not much time for it to get warm even if it wanted to.",

There was ABSOLUTELY no comparison. This thing outperformed the Samsung so convincingly, I\u2019m thinking about trying to return the Samsung and get another one of these. I just got a new MBP 16\u201d and am now forced to use a multi port dock of some sort. I\u2019m currently using the Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter 4K HDMI, USB-C Pass Through, Gigabit Ethernet, SD/Micro Card Readers, USB 3.0 - Compatible. It performs pretty nicely as well, although it does tend to get a bit hot to the touch. Anyway, the Lexar is amazing. It\u2019s soooo fast, I just want to transfer large files/folders just to see it smoke, LOL. But seriously, this thing is fast folks. I don\u2019t really do reviews but this thing was sooo impressive, I thought to myself that I have to share this with people because I know how much I labored over what to get with all the claims these manufacturers make.There is a downside though. Removing this thing from the USB C dock is pretty challenging. I thought I was going to actually need to use needle nose pliers or something at one point. Do yourself a favor after connecting it......forget about it! LOLHope this helps.",
