                "reviewText": "This is a pretty thick thumb drive. It has a nice casing to be durable (scratch prone though). The material does make it warm up if you have it plugged in for long periods of time. It is not too light considering the material but it is still easy to carry. It has a pretty small loop so you can just stick this directly on your keys with much not much trouble but I would recommend just using a lanyard or something as the key ring can scratch it up. The thumb drive has good material quality. Everything feels like durable even the plug. It is not that small compared to many other thumb drives that are 3.2. For a usb 3.2 thumb drive it has pretty good transfer speed also because it has smaller space on it. For the amount of money this cost, you are paying more for security rather than memory size. In terms of fitting, the thumb drive itself fits pretty well into the slot and will not fall out easily. It does take a few uses before the thumb drive gets easier to pull out. I honestly just keep my personal files on this thumb drive. It does not take up too much space and I know it is secure. It is pretty easy to setup but REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD. There is no real way to get in without it. You will be out of luck if you forget the password. The software will install when you plug it in. It does not seem to have any kind of back door to get into the drive. It requires a password every time you plug it in. Overall this is very secure thumb drive but the memory feels a bit small for what you are paying for. The transfer speed actually work pretty well. It does not get any heat issues when doing transfer but it does get warm for long periods of time. The metal color is nice but that does make it more scratched prone.",
