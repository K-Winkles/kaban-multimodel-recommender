                "reviewText": "To be honest, I don\u2019t use USB drives as much as I used to since SSDs have become so portable, but there is just something about the convenience and price point that will probably always keep one or two in my tech arsenal.I liked the stylish look of this drive with the sleek metal casing; it looks more professional than the bright candy-colored silicone or plastic models that seem to be everywhere. The capacity (128 GB for mine) is also convenient \u2013 there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real cost benefit of going with a smaller drive, and I would opt for an SSD for anything much larger. Finally, having a legacy USB A adapter as well as the C is also incredibly convenient if you have any older devices that don\u2019t have a USB C port.The one area that I found a bit lacking with the drive was the actual file transfer speeds when compared to the listed read/write speed. The tests that I ran using flash benchmarking software did not reach the 20/60 speeds listed, and the times that I got moving actual files were much worse (about 4 MB/S with about 1500 small files and 12 MB/S with larger video files). That being said, those times were still nearly twice as fast as another USB C drive that my daughter uses for school so it is still respectable even if it is inaccurate.Overall, I really like the drive. If the read/write speeds had been a bit more accurate, I would have given it 5 stars, but as it stands with the slower speeds it is still a very solid 4.",
