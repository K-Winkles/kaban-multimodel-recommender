                "reviewText": "I was in great need of some flash drives for one of my laptops which was quickly running out of memory therefore I had to take appropriate action before the laptop destroyed itself. First step was to buy the flash drives & then begin transferring all of my files. It literally took 9 hours before the files were transferred to one flash drive. The next step was to begin deletion of \"most\" of the files that were on my laptop. Phew... that was quite the task. The laptop is still working & hasn't died on me yet but it still has some wonky issues, but without the flash drives my laptop would have been toast. I bought these flash drives in a 5-pack at a fairly economical price & each one will hold 65GB of memory. My sick laptop said I needed to delete 56GB of files!! Therefore, the one flash drive that I used should be good!! & I still have four remaining for some other emergency or other storage need.",

The set of five provides ample storage space with 64GB each, and the USB 2.0 speed ensures quick and efficient data transfers. These thumb drives are a reliable solution for storing and transporting files between my PC, laptop, and computer.One of the standout features for me is the convenience of having a multipack. It's not only cost-effective but also ensures that I always have extra flash drives on hand. I've found them particularly handy for conferences, where you never know when you might need to share or receive important files. The compact size and durability make them easy to carry in my pocket or bag without worrying about damage.Overall, the RAOYI 5 Pack 64GB USB Flash Drives offer great value, reliability, and versatility.
