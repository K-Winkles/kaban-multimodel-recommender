                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I originally said I was only getting half the rated speed from the drive. I couldn't figure out why writing to the drive was faster than reading. I decided that maybe it was corporate software installed on my system, so I repeated the CrystalDiskMark from my personal Laptop (Ivy Bridge era Thinkpad, Windows 10) and got much much faster speeds, both in reading and writing. I don't know if the tests are the same, but you can see a dramatic difference. It appears that the USB speed on my workstation is limited by the controller. I have updated my score to give it 5 stars.Original ReviewReceived the 64 GB flash drive today. It states (on the 64 GB drive version) that read speed is 400 MB, sec. I'm getting 170 MB/sec maximum. Curiously, I'm getting 213 MB/sec max write speed. It is the fastest writing (not reading overall. It is faster with random reads)) flash drive I have, but it's half of the rated read speed. Writing being faster than reading is curious. Is it using some type of ram buffer on-board?My computer (ThinkStation workstation running Windows 7) is USB 3.0 only (so theoretical max speed of 600 MB/sec). I have ensured it is plugged into a USB 3.0 port on the back of the machine. I've tested the drive empty and then after putting about 10 GB of files on it. With a 4 GB archive and a 4GB folder of about 1200 files, the transfer speeds were very fast (peaking above 200 MB / sec).Considering that I'm using this on a workstation that isn't connected to the internet to transfer files, I can live with questionable durability. I need something that is fast that won't corrupt my data over about a 20 minute time period. But I'm sticking to my name-brand USB 3.0 drives for data that I want to carry around with me regularly. It's too suspicious that write speeds are greater than read speeds, and the read speed is less than half of advertised.",

System and results described in screen capturesMy Extreme Pro USB 3.1 / 128MB was 416.5 read but only 127.0 write using same benchmarking program (Gnome-Disks).The construction is all-plastic and doesn't feel as nice as the Extreme Pro.So durability and quality of material is not yet determined. We will have to see how it lasts. I am hopeful and happy with it so far!!12/17/23 update:. It survived a wash in my pants pocket. Still works fine! Your experience may vary!!",

                "reviewText": "I have used a lot of different flash drives and microSD cards. One of my favorite brands has been SanDisk. I've had good success, relatively fast speeds, and decent prices. This drive is more expensive (although I was fortunate to get it on sale), but there is absolutely no comparison in performance.I've seen speeds in excess of 230 MB/s (sustained) when transferring large files. Copying my Documents directory (with a mix of file sizes), speeds vary between 80 MB/s down to 20 MB/s with very brief flashes (so quick you almost miss them) of speeds as low as 8-10 MB/s. Bu other drives I've had on a similar test would sometimes drop below 1 MB/s, sometimes for agonizingly long periods of time.Your mileage may vary, and I haven't had the drive long yet (a few weeks). So far I have no regrets and many good things to say about this drive. It feels sturdy and well made, but if it doesn't last like I think it should, I will try to remember to update this review.I should mention two minor points. (1) On my laptop with side-by-side USB ports, the width of the drive will prevent most other items from being plugged into the adjacent USB port. This will seldom if ever be a problem for me, but may be for you. (2) It does get warm--not hot, but more than lukewarm. Not enough to worry me, but worthy of mention. Neither of these two issues is significant enough for me to lower the rating.",

                "reviewText": "My dad wanted new flash drives that had an indicator light for the Access memory use. Plus be at least a 3.0 USB drive and good read and write speeds. He bought and tried Samsung and Transcend and they were ok, but these drives put those to shame by being 2-3x faster on both read and write speeds. The Vansuny are USB 3.1 and the speeds backs up that claim compared to the USB 3.0 drives he has. Just hope the flash drives last and they are truly real 128gb memory drives.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, i was waiting to get scammed on this one. Like some horror story you hear where you get fake memory sticks with fake capacities/speeds for really cheap. But no, not this one.For some reason, i bought two of them. And yes, i did pay for both, i saw the invoice and i bought two 128 GB ones, but i only wanted one... oops?.The first thing i did when i got them is use H2testw to see how badly i was scammed... and surprisingly, the full capacity was available for reads and writes! And HELLUVA fast too! 260 Mbps sustained read and 160 Mbps sustained write, on the H2testw software is really nothing to scoff at. Yes, it's lower numbers than advertised, but as usual i bet those are peak numbers and you can reach them in certain tests, but this is a full drive read and write. Not bad!For science, i opened one of my drives. I expected something a lot worse, but what i found was a flash UFS chip, the same ones that are used on mid to high end phones. I still don't think these things will last that long, the flash chip itself was partially lasered out so you cannot know which model the NAND is (but it was done badly enough that i could find it is a Sandisk UFS chip, model SDINDDH6-128G), but i bet these are NAND rejects that couldn't reach temperature or speed goals (hence the obfuscation effort) but still, it is not truly bottom of the barrel NAND like on truly cheapo commodity flash drives. It also has a decent UFS to USB controller (JMS901) so yes, you are definitely getting performance out of these.Only time will tell if they're as long lasting, but speed and capacity wise, these are awesome!",
