                "reviewText": "I'm not sure what kind of flash drives all the people leaving great reviews are buying but not a single one of my AVERAGE SIZED 30+ flash drives fit snuggly into any of the slots except the tiny ones at the bottom which are too small. In fact, the slots are so big that when I accidentally pulled the foam insert out, the flash drives slipped through easily and wound up at the bottom of the case. They also fall out if it's opened upside down or just turned over slightly. It's no wonder they had to print a gigantic logo on what is supposed to be the lid. In a small stroke of good fortune, the closed lid *will* keep the flash drives from falling out.It arrived with all slots filled with their foam cutouts. I'm not sure why they did this. The foam itself is nice and dense and should provide more than enough shock resistance to drop it off a highway overpass and survive. The outer shell feels a bit cheap but isn't anything to really complain about. The zipper with it's red teeth is a very nice, subtle accent.I am thoroughly disappointed about having to return this item. I'm also worried that other cases will be generally the same and that this is as good as it gets.",
