Pictures with her parents and their relatives, her sister and her family. It gives her something sentimental to look at other than just playing games. Memories. So this was perfect for what I needed it for. Pictures don't take up a lot of space, and this size was perfect for me. You can't go wrong with this product.",

While I didn't test speed/throughput, since that really wasn't a factor for me, here are my impressions.1. Flimsy plastic housing - normally the USB plug of a flash drive is metal and plugs into a metal port. This one is flimsy plastic (similar to the plastic on a plastic spoon) It flexes when pressed. In fact the entire housing is a thin plastic shell making it extra \"light\" but also not confidence inspiring. That said, I'm sure they tested these to stand up to constant insertions and withdraws. The case is contoured slightly to assist in puling it out of the USB port.2. Small - About the size of my thumb. Not the smallest on the market, but small enough to be called \"tiny\"3. Cheap - cheapest \"SanDisk\" brand name flash drive I could find.",
