So far it works great. It's really convenient for moving lots of large files to/from my laptop, my Galaxy S 10 Plus, my son's Motorola G Stylus, etc. If there is room for improvement it would be to have the USB C connector a bit longer, it works great with my son's and my phones, but only if we remove them from their cases.

The speed 2.0 is ok and works very well for my purpose. So easy to use! I will definitely get more of these.I encountered wherein 1 stick is not working. So I sent a note to the seller and got a quick response and gave me credit for the one stick not working. Great customer service! Thank you.",

I beat them up with a few reformats and read/write tests and they all tested good. These are used when I need to supply the recipient with a physical product. The 2.0 speed was not a concern, since the recipient would not be using this in a read/write environment. Perfect for use when the recipient can\u2019t work out cloud downloading a file. Sadly, I can\u2019t count on having these returned, so I\u2019ll be buying more.These are fully suitable for creating self booting win/nix media, however a 3.0 speed would be nicer as a live media device. They are also compatible with the usual encryption tools.",
