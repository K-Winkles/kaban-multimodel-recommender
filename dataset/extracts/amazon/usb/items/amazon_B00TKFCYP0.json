                "reviewText": "been using Cruzer Blades for years. I keep buying larger and larger ones as they become available. It's rugged because there's no moving parts. There's no retractable useless mechanism to lock, no stupid dust cap to lose because it's not included, and those don't matter anyway. You don't need a dust cap, stop it. They're smaller than the majority of other flash drives. They're perfectly contoured and shaped to fit firmly between your thumb and index finger so that they're extremely comfortable and easy to insert. When you push them in, they go in. When you pull them out, they come out. You'll be at least 50% less likely to insert them upside-down, and they just work.I use them for everything. It's the best USB stick I've ever had attached to a keychain with 2 huge truck keys, 4 other car keys, 3 tool box keys, 4 work keys, and 5 house keys as well as some rappelling gear. Years like this. I work every day, and my keys are always with me. They get banged around, have been inserted and ejected into dozens if not hundreds of Macs and PCs at home and at work and have never failed. I still have and use every one of them I've ever bought, and in every storage capacity available since they were first produced.They have hundreds of uses. Game storage, backups, installer media, bootable operating systems, automobile service records, presentations, desktop, documents, downloads, library, movies, music, pictures, sites, shared. All of the software I need to do my job, right there on the keychain. PDF service manuals for the equipment I repair go with me everywhere. I guess you could put stupid stuff like homework, or passwords on it, but I don't because those things aren't fun. It's more fun to plug your whole music library into one of the USB slots on your brand new, shiny, technology-packed, voice-activated 6.1 digital surround sound equipped loaded premium model 4x4 truck and tell your truck what you want to hear. It's safer, too. For you and everybody else. Of course the truck is optional, but if your vehicle is equipped with these technologies, please do this. You'll never be the distracted one. The Cruzer Blade is perfect for this in the hot summer and in the cold of winter. I know this for a fact. Years like this. Always available. It will even let you use your phone storage for more useful and practical things, or it could even allow you to buy the smaller, less expensive, less storage capacity model of the same phone saving you hundreds of dollars. If you wanted to listen to music on the go, everything everywhere has USB, and it's all louder and sounds better than your phone. Go out to your truck and get it. Problem solved. Phone stays charged.Pros: If you need a RED and BLACK, tough, simple, durable, stealthy USB 2.0 flash drive, then this is the best one ever made. Indisputable champion.Cons: The form factor hasn't changed over the years, WHICH IS FANTASTIC! Don't change them in any physical or functional way... but the microscopic painted lettering eventually wears away on both sides, so you don't know if it's a 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB or 128 GB? You just know that it's the red and black one. I wish like crazy these things came in a dozen different colors. Maybe even get creative and make one that glows in the dark? Or polished Aluminum? Woodgrain? Tortoise shell? Burl? Clear? Of course I have nothing against red and black... I'm just sayin... it's the only way it could be improved, I don't know that any of this qualifies as a con? I have zero complaints with the quality of this product and my experience with using them. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, red and black. Long live the red and black Cruzer Blade USB 2.0 flash drives!",

                "reviewText": "I just got this flash drive yesterday, and I am astounded as how good it is. I fiddled around with a few files that I copied and pasted, and it loaded up just fine. The real test was yet to come. The flash drive is advertised for videos, and I wanted to try to play some video games on it. If I am correct, the flash drive can \"ONLY\" have data going in at one time, or out at one time. With that in mind, i'm playing a high gigabyte data game perfectly fine. Best thing to do with a video game is download the entire file and updates all at one time, and don't try to play with it half downloaded in my opinion.This flash drive is very fast, and I recommend it for gaming, and anything else really. I have to admit, it may or may not be programed specifically for gaming, but it works fine. I have to admit, maybe my computer is a bit advanced, but I have no complaints.The only thing that is not making sense so much is that \"sometimes\" the game doens't load up perfectly, or fast enough, or at all which I believe is a software problem, not a hardware problem. Sometimes it may crash, but it's probably a software incompatibility because I AM gaming, and maybe it wasn't designed to be for gaming. The best way to solve this loading problem is just close out of the application, and reload it.Oh yea. If you have windows, you'll ALWAYS want to update your windows as much and often as possible because sometimes the software updates for the flash drive \"might\" be in it. It does require updated software to use if I am correct, but I just got it yesterday, so I cannot vouche for any software updates. Just in case, this software is from a \"Windows Update\" download, but it may stem from the flash drive company itself, and given to windows to distribute, but I am not their marketing manager, so I do not have any qualifications to say that, after all.Overall, 5 stars!!!",

                "reviewText": "My very first flashdrive was a SanDisk Cruzer. I lost it my junior year and was upset because it was given to me in middle school by a teacher who was very important to me. After I lost it, my other flash drives were various brands, mostly whatever I could find at Wal-Mart. They were always the kind with the cap that slid down or up to cover and protect the USB connector. I hated it because they were often very stiff and hard to slide and I am not someone who typically struggles moving or opening something. I was SO excited to find this on here and get my hands on another SanDisk! OMG I never realized how much I actually liked this brand, I always thought my bitterness towards other brands I tried was just because I lost the other one from a dear friend. It is so much easier to slide in and out, I love the familiar glow of the light, how easy it is to access not only my material, but also to go in and find out how much storage I have left. Other brands I usually had to look up on the internet how to access my storage because they didn't make it easy to figure out. Even using the vault to keep my files password protected (I'm a photographer and if I lose this, I don't want someone else to try to pass off my work as their own), it is extremely easy to set it up and to log in with your password and very easy to transfer files into the vault! All you do after you send from your computer to your drive is drag it into the vault! And the best part is, with the massive amount of storage space, I can super boost the resolution of all my pictures so I can make bigger prints, and I will STILL have plenty of space! And the price was so good for this amount of storage, I couldn't talk myself out of getting it! I am never using any flash drive that isn't a SanDisk ever again!",
