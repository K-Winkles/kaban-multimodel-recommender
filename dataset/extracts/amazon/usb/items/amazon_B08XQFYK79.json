                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Lexar 128GB USB 3.2 Gen 1 Flash Drive and I have been absolutely thrilled with its performance. This is hands down one of the best flash drives that I have ever used, and it has quickly become an essential tool in my digital toolkit.What sets this flash drive apart is its versatility and compatibility. The USB A and USB C/Type C dual drive OTG feature means that it can work with a wide range of devices, including both traditional USB ports and newer USB-C ports. This makes it easy to transfer files between different devices, whether I am using my laptop, tablet, or smartphone.The speed of this flash drive is also truly impressive. With USB 3.2 Gen 1 technology, I can transfer large files in a matter of seconds, which has saved me so much time and hassle compared to using slower, outdated flash drives.Another great feature of this flash drive is its build quality. The materials are high-quality and feel solid and well-made, with no cheap or flimsy parts. It is also compact and portable, which makes it easy to carry with me wherever I go.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Lexar 128GB USB 3.2 Gen 1 Flash Drive and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile flash drive that can handle all of their file transfer needs. It has exceeded my expectations in every way, and I can't imagine ever going back to using a slower or less compatible flash drive.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little drive. I was surprised by how small it actually is. It works really well, has lots of space, and gets lost on my desk all of the time because of it\u2019s size. My problem, not Lexar\u2019s! The only issue I have (and I\u2019ve had it with other cards) is the transfer rate from my iPad to the card is sometimes slow. I went from an iPad Air 3rd generation to an iPad 11 Pro 3rd generation and I think it\u2019s a IOS problem. It just cannot handle multiple or large files very well. It times out and I get a \u201cdisconnected\u201d error.As is usually the case, I find work arounds, such as using cloud services to back up to (and then download it from there), or compressing video files down to smaller (lower quality). I\u2019ve also learned to take more, shorter, videos than 1 long one. Filming a graduation? Find break points and stop recording, and then start again right away. This breaks up files into smaller ones that are easier to transfer.Anyway, back to the Lexar memory stick. Overall, it works and does what it\u2019s supposed to do. I would recommend it if you need extra storage space for a device with a USB-A or USB-C interface.",

                "reviewText": "h2testw has confirmed that it's a real drive that matches the advertised capacity and speeds.The drive gets incredibly hot during use though. At the end of the test it was so hot that I had to wait a few minutes to remove it from my laptop because it was genuinely that hot. But that test completely fills the drive and then rapidly reads every file it filled the drive with. So I'd expect it to get hot. In regular use it still gets pretty hot, but not scaldingly hot. But be careful if you're moving a +50gb file over. It might be very hot when it's done moving.I've attached a screenshot from h2testw which shows the verified capacity as well as read and write speeds. The read speeds are 212 megabytes per second and the write speeds are 60 megabytes per second. Both are well above advertised speedsIt's fast, compact, and works on my Windows Laptop, Android Phone, and Steam Deck. The materials seem durable and I like how it has the ability to be attached to keys or a lanyard.",

It ended up being a complete waste of money because it corrupted everything, and it wasn't even 2TB.It's fine, but one small trouble with it is that you cannot store videos larger than 4GB. So, don't look forward to moving those extra long HD videos or long 4K UHD videos to it.It's very small and out of the way.The other small, no big big deal, thing about it is it fits a bit too snug into your USB port, so it gets a little scratched. At least mine did.All in all, it was a very good buy, and I do recommend it. It transfers files fairly quickly, and you can connect it directly to your USB-C phone or other device.",
