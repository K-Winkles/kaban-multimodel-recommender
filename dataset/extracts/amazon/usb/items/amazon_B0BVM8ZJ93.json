                "reviewText": "If you dislike using cloud storage for a variety of reasons or simply like having a back up and need something that could be used to store photos and videos taken with a smart phone or something so they could eventually be transferred to an external hard drive with a superior storage capacity that plugs into a PC then this is the perfect product for such a purpose.Keep reading to find out why it\u2019s still a good idea to use old school methods of data storage.3 big reasons to use old school storage: Ease of access, Security, and Back Up Storage. The cloud is a network of servers kept up and running by cloud providers so you\u2019re trusting total strangers with your data. Using the cloud means vulnerability to data loss which could be due to human error, natural disasters, security breaches, etc., and while this may be unlikely it is still a risk associated with cloud data storage. With that being said it is wise to have your data backed up on a hard drive somewhere.People say encrypted cloud storage is newer, that it provides an extra layer of security to your data. This is true. Even if a hacker gains access or a secret government court orders a cloud storage provider to disclose your personal information, they still won't be able to read it. But hackers or a secret government can still break encryption to access the data using a number of different methods. The most common method is stealing the encryption key itself. Another common way is intercepting the data either before it has been encrypted by the sender or after it has been decrypted by the recipient. Just because your data is in the cloud does not mean you\u2019re totally immune to problems like theft and privacy violation.Also, a WiFi connection is required to access the cloud. Hard drives are easily accessible, they\u2019re literally in your possession so they can be used anywhere at any time without a WiFi connection. Having the hard drive makes you vulnerable to theft but it also means you don\u2019t lose your data forever in the event cloud data loss occurs due to one of the issues I listed earlier because you have a back up. My advice is to keep your hard drive hidden away locked in a safe when it is not in use.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased two of these flash drives. This pink one for my wife never worked correctly. Mine works fine. I plugged hers into her computer and it would cycle on/off over and over. So, I pulled it out of the port and tried to plug mine in to see if it may have been the port on her laptop. I could not plug mine in. So I thought something is in the port. Then, I got some tweezers, unplugged her pc and pulled out a little plastic piece with blue plastic and four prongs, but one prong was missing. I turned the laptop over and the little extra prong fell out. So then I compared her drive to mine and sure enough the piece that was stuck in her laptop was supposed to be in the flash drive. Since the device has two connectors, I tried turning it around and plugging it into the other port on my wife's laptop. And although it says the drive is there. It says no media. I tried to create a new volume and it again says no media.Update: Amazon put me in touch with the seller. After a few emails, they have promised to send me a replacement. I have not seen it yet. Still waiting.",

                "reviewText": "After buying this NEHEUI memory stick witch is 1 tb thinking I could clean up the memory on my iPadBut no luck after being on line and phone with Apple for a week or two and nothing was workingI had to take the stick to a computer shop and have it reformatted as I only have a iPad and a windows laptop and it wouldn\u2019t change to the format neededfrom exFAT WHICH IS a common format for photos But apple recommended ( APFS ) to be able to except larger filesWhile transferring the files on this device it took forever up to 20 minutes for some files only to discoverthey didn\u2019t work videos would pop up but when you click on them the only thing that popped up was the file numberThen back on line with tech and after moving a few thousand photos it stopped workingThe device says it had only used about 15 percent of available memoryWe tried all the tricks plug it into a reader plug it in directlyBut no matter what we tried it still wouldn\u2019t workI then visited the Apple Store and had a appointment with a technician there still no answerI then purchased a memory device from them it\u2019s a LaCie 2tb model it came with exFAT format that they changed to APFSIt works great and it works for everythingI now have transferred almost 10,000 videos and photos with out one issue and have only used about 25 percent of available memoryAlso your file transfer speed downloading from the cloud will be determined by your internet speed if you have over 50 megabytes itwill be fairly fast only a few minutes for videos 30 megabytes and a few seconds for smaller filesI will strongly recommend the LaCie memory device and they are available here on Amazon and for a little less than Ipaid at Apple",
