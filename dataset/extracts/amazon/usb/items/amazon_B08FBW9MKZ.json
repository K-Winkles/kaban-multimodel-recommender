The only problem I had was more my car's issue--it needed the drive to be formatted as Fat32 and these come in another format. Windows couldn't do it, but a simple, free downloaded app did the formatting nicely. Then, just drag and drop to copy files. It works great and I have four spares.",

Every single time I plug these into my computer the disk is corrupted and needs to be fixed through chkdsk.Please buy something else - anything else.
