                "reviewText": "okay so here's the thing, I bought these drives for just under $10 thinking they would be inexpensive for just simple use. No I didn't expect them to be rugged at all but the flimsy material that they were made out of made the electronics inside rattle while inserting the drive in any USB port the plastic clicked back and forth and the drive never Stay powered on for any length of time making it impossible to use. It was a two pack so I tried the other one and it worked fine except for after I removed it and then later put it back in a different USB port and then it failed as well the funny part about this is that Amazon will not give a refund for this item unless I send it back, and I see that as a waste of my $10 and the 799 they wanted to charge me for the return mailer. I'm disabled and I don't have a lot of money but when this drive fell apart see the second picture then it suddenly started working, it's my guess that the casing for the drive was causing the electronics to short out or something. So if I could give this zero stars yes I would. And I'm not going to return it unfortunately but I'm not going to go cheap on USB drives ever again.",

I dropped an audiobook in there to test it and it was faster than other USB that I have. My only draw back was I thought I was getting 500GB - Brand new it says that 1.12 MB was used which is understandable (its a fairly small amount) but where did a 32Gig chunk go? As you can see from the pictures I took it shows details brand new. I'm not a computer wiz but I think I got ripped off as its not as promised.Physically as you can see from the video, The USB is a bit loose from the cover its attached to. Its swing around. Hopefully It doesn't come lose or God forbid I lose it.All in all its a pretty good buy for the price. I'm happy with my purchase - Don't expect to get 500GB or you will be disappointed.I read somewhere on the internet that if you have PC - it calculates storage using an older calculation as suppose to Mac and other OS which uses the newer way to calculate the storage space. So that could be it. I don't know much about this stuff. I'm grateful for the 468GB that it shows.I still would recommend it.",

When I bought it I took the cover off and immediately thought it was not USB 2.0 compatible as it would not fit into the USB 2.0 socket! But it has two interfaces, both C3.1 AND USB 3.0. It's just two interfaces at opposite ends of the thumb drive. USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with USB 2.0. The speed just runs at USB 2.0 speeds in USB 2.0 ports. The greater capacity means a slower connection than USB 2.0. In theory, it is supposed to be 10x faster with USB 3.0, but in real-world conditions, it's around 4 or five times more rapid data transfer rates. I have USB 3.0 so it's great. The price is great too. In the first years of thumb drives, 64Meg cost \u00a326. This pen drive is 1000x capacity at a quarter the cost. Moores law strikes again!",
