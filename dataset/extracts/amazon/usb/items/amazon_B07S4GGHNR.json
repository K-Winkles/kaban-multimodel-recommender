But after using this for a little over a week, the flash drive constantly opens and closes on its own repeatedly anytime I put it in two different laptops. I've run various programs and scanners to check the disk drives on both, and zero errors show up, nor do I have trouble using other USBs in the same drives. It's passed the window to return the item, and I cant even register it with the recovery plan I purchased it because the manufacturer is not listed. I wanted something different, but since this one isn't working I purchased a SANDISK which Amazon damaged upon delivery and they have to resend me a different one (fingers crossed). Definitely learned to make these types of purchases in the store instead of online.",
