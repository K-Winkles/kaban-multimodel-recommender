                "reviewText": "For several years, I had to rely on my free iCloud storage and my already large storage space on my iPhone to save my pictures and videos. I had pictures of my kids, my husband\u2014 all the memories I had was on my phone. Eventually, I ran out, and I struggled to find options to save storage on my device. I had more than 15,000 photos and videos saved (accumulated over 8 years), which accounted to hundreds of GB of storage. I tried transferring it to my PC via a lightning cable, but found it was too tedious as I had to manually select my photos. Worse, at the times where I did successfully select a handful of my photos to transfer, the process would stop completely due to a copying error. I also considered paying for an iCloud subscription, but I realized I did not want to pay a pricy subscription that I would most likely need to upgrade in the future. This product solved all these problems. The thumb drive connected to my phone easily. The accessibility of the app and its ease-of-use allowed for me to transfer hundreds of my media at one time, which was so much easier than doing it manually. The one time price is well worth it, as opposed to paying hundreds of dollars over the months paying for a storage subscription like iCloud. What\u2019s more, its convenient adaptability of its connectors allows me to also use it on my PC, a device I use often, which makes this product even better. The only warning I have, which is not even specific to this product but all external drives, is that it must be kept safe! You need the drive in order to access your photos, but it\u2019s essentially the same as keeping your phone safe or not downloading viruses into your computer hard drive. Ultimately, this product absolutely worth it\u2014 the storage, price, and all the memories you save to make room for more are all positive qualities this product has that makes it worth buying.",
