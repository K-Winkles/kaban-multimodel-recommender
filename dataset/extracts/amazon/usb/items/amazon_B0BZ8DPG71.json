I decided to use flash drives as it would be easier for me to find particular files if they are stored on particular flash drives. These worked well for that purpose. They also came with a card of 16GB stickers and each one came with a strap in the same colour as the drive. I would recommend these to any teacher wishing to safely back up her PowerPoint presentations etc.",

                "reviewText": "I needed bootable pen-drives for linux system installation on a PC, and chose these as I expected each .iso to be between 1 and 4GB in size. After the purchase I was warned on linux forums that these low capacity pen-drives were obsolete and prone to failure, but I found the 2 I bought to work fine. I used Ventoy to format the pen-drives to bootable media, and have installed .iso's, used them, erased them, then installed different distros to try, all without any problems or signs of physical failure. For the way these are dependably performing, the price was fantastic. I'm very happy with these.",
