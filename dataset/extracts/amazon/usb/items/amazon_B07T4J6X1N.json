                "reviewText": "To preface, I like Micro Center a lot and have had a couple of thumb drives from them that I have got for free through coupons. I bought this pack so I have enough on hand for many purposes.A very good value pack of quality thumb drives that can be used for many purposes. I myself use a few of them to store individual ISO files and some with a multi-boot ISO program for holding multiple ISO files on a single drive. They work really well as individual boot drives and decently well as basic storage drives. It transfers small files individually pretty fast. But if your files are pretty large or you are transferring a very large amount of files, then it might feel a bit slow. But that is pretty much a given for most flash drives. Overall, great option for a pack of quality thumb drives that work really well for a handful of use cases.",

I installed Chrome Flex OS on the Micro Center unit, plugged it into my 13 year old Toshiba laptop and it booted and ran with great response time. These units also work better in my vehicles that play MP3s from integrated USB. I bought the ten pack of these now because the price has dropped over time.",
