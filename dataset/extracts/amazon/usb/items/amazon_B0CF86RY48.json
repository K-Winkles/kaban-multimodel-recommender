Screens are clear and smooth running but will be a bit slower in response time. Only issue I had is the USB C adaptor is a bit wide and I had to use it with a narrow USB-C male to female cable adaptor to allow my power cable to fit. Still have my tiny ASUS BR-1100 notebook screen running too. 3 extended mode monitors total.",

Scroll your screen down and you will see your product listed. Click on it and select windows version of your computer. Files will be downloaded. Once that step is done, double click on the folder. Two files appear, select x86 folder. Double click on the Exe file. Now connect the extra monitor with hdmi to the wavlink box and usb connector to your laptop. Wala!!! Now I\u2019m able to get two monitors connected to my older laptop (only had one hdmi port). This is a game changer for me!!! Please follow the instructions that comes in the box!! You will need to tell your laptop which screen is which(left, middle, right) so your mouse can get to those screens easily.",

                "reviewText": "This is A great Amazon shopping experience and journey. First, the product quality is excellent, the workmanship of WAVLINK is solid, and the touch and feel is extraordinary. I have used many branded or non-branded HDMI HUBs. After installing basically all relevant or irrelevant drivers, either there is no response at all, no signal, or one connection port can work, but the others cannot succeed. In short, you should have to doubt and wonder whether the desktop or laptop you own is compatible. However, this brand, WAVLINK is almost plug-and-play. As long as the driver is installed successfully, it can immediately be displayed on the external monitors smoothly. It is simple and easy to use. You don\u2019t have to worry about whether your computer is too old or whether your USB is too outdated. It lags behind, even when I connect it on USB2.0 instead of the required USB3.0, it works normally, which is amazing. Moreover, even the latest version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 already comes with related software driver packages, which is quite unexpected. Second, the customer service of this product is really great, almost all questions are answered and directly addressed, and very timely. It is more careful and conscientious than Amazon's own customer service to be honest. Long story short, After a period of happy use, I discovered a hardware Reset problem, so I tried to contact their customer service through Q&A Email. After receiving my question, the customer team not only inquired carefully about the situation and hardware environment, but also asked me to take screenshots as much as possible, because some key questions were easily expressed in inaccurate and vague language, and it was more intuitive for them. and conveniently start the technical analysis they need. One question from me usually will lead them to three or four questions and ideas, all honestly are more than I thought. This communication was great because finding out what the problem was was what they exactly wanted and it was their service attitude that totally earned my respect. In the customer service aspect, sometimes patience and professionalism are necessary, but enthusiasm and attitude are the most important. The Japanese god of management has a famous saying, that is, \"It is necessary to immerse yourself in dreams so that we can have the enthusiasm to make them a reality.\" Therefore By purchasing products from WAVLINK, you may be able to experience the high-quality products and the passion behind them",
