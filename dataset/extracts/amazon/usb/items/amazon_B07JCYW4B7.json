                "reviewText": "I purchased this INN\u00d4PLUS USB drive to store sensitive data for use with any future system I may have. It comes in a nice box with descriptive packaging, so it would make a nice gift. In the box are the USB drive, a cap for it, a lanyard, and an instruction manual. The USB drive and cap are surprisingly heavy metal. The buttons are clicky and responsive and just the right size. There is a button with a lightning bolt that doesn't click, and it's not even pictured in the instruction manual, so I have no idea what it's supposed to do. The other button has a key on it, and you hold that button down for 5 seconds to set a new password or press it once to enter your password, then press it again to confirm entry. Passwords must be between 6 and 14 digits and can't be consecutive digits like 123 or repeating digits like 000. It was very easy to set up and use, and the two different LED lights at the top make it clear what the USB drive is communicating. Most of all, it just works! The data is safe until you put in the passcode. If you lose your passcode, you have to contact the manufacturer with the serial number on the back, and they can give you a personalized code to wipe it and restore to factory settings.It worked with my Macbook, and I even tested it with a digital picture frame, and it worked! Overall, I didn't find any flaws with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs to safely store data. 5/5 starsIf you found this review helpful, please show some love by clicking the Smiley Face button below.

                "reviewText": "This item looked like the perfect device. I wanted something for long-term storage that could not be opened by anybody else. I put some stuff on it, and then put it aside since last November.A few days ago I tried to. open it. it wouldn't open. I communicated with the seller and got a \"dynamic key\" for use when a user has forgotten the password. I got it to go through all the steps so that it should have been ready to mount. It wouldn't mount. I used the Macintosh Disk Utility on it. The utility could see the drive even though it was not mounted.The seller was very helpful in getting me a dynamic password (on the assumption that I had passworded it and then forgot about it). When I tried the dynamic password it still would not work. After some extended email communication, they finally offered to send me a 16 GB device as a replacement. I got the new device, and so far it works o.k The good thing is that if you lose it, nobody else can open it. The bad thing is that if the unit fails, then you cannot get it to back-off your information.I don't know why they didn't send me the identical item. I didn't remember that the unit's box declared it to have a \"5-years warranty,\" so I thought they were being generous to send me a drive with half the memory.I have two StarTech encrypted HD cases (you supply your own HD to mount inside). I keep one on my desk and one in my safe as back-up. I periodically update the one in the safe. Except for the size, this setup is a better deal for me.NB. When in the mode where it doesn't have a password set, mine wouldn't mount the way a regular thumb drive would. I found that I had to insert the drive and then press the \"key\" button on its case.",

I have one drive that requires this without the physical keypad on the drive itself. It would be nice to have both. Kind of like having 2 factor authentication. When I put this in, it calls itself a mass storage device at 32 Gigs. I laughed.",

It worked great for a year, but last week all of a sudden it would not allow me to unlock it (the red light would come on no matter what I pressed). I figured it was a small error and I could contact the company for a master code to get back in. Nope. I contacted the company and while I appreciate how responsive their customer service is, I was ultimately informed that there is an internal error and there is no way to fix it without mailing it back to China to be looked at by their team (which I cannot do because it would violate privacy laws of my clients since it is storing their protected information). A year\u2019s worth of files are gone. Just gone. Please be cautious in buying this product.",

Fortunately, I could still save the files to the Backup Drive & save all my information to the current date.So, now I'm using my Backup Drive as my Daily Use Drive since my Old Daily Use Drive wouldn't let me write to it anymore.So, naturally you can see that I would still need a New Backup Drive. So, I messaged the Seller & told them about my situation & the IMMEDIATELY sent me a new flash drive. FOR FREE. I REPEAT. FOR FREE.You couldn't ask for a better seller.

Is there a digital users guide available? If not, is there a way to get the company to give me a code to reset it or something?Thanks much.As far as my review, it seems like a very well constructed (heavy) item that would be hard to lose, which is a huge bonus.
