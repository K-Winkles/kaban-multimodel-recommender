                "reviewText": "I needed a bunch of quick gifts. We had a 'brand name' board in the house, but it was a tiny first-generation one. I searched around, and found there are just a TON out there now. Looked at the smaller ones that were arguably even cheaper, and figured spending a few more bucks for a few more inches in size is worth it for older kids.- I like the size. It's about the size of standard sheet of paper. but really lightweight.- visibility is much better than first-gen board, need some light but not a ton.- I could do without the 'rainbow colors', but the kids don't seem to mind.- Amazon delivered essentially SAME DAY (ordered 1am, arrived near 9pm, fine by me!)- box comes with sticky-backed magnet strips, if you want to add to the board and hang on fridge or other surface- also in box is an extra battery. these must be insanely cheap to bundle at factory vs what it costs us to buy one or two or three after-market. Costs them pennies, costs me dollars apiece!- and an extra stylus in box as well, in the unavoidable circumstance your kid loses one.I can't yet speak to the longevity of the product, but if it makes it more than 12mos, I'd say I've easily gotten my money's worth.I hope in the future they can figure out how to add an 'erase mode' for the stylus, so you don't have to bulk-erase the entire screen, but that's same for EVERY drawing board of this kind and price range in the market (until you get to an actual android tablet).",

Product support people were responsive and helpful.IMPORTANT NOTES:\u2022 All pictures will transfer to the thumb drive and then onto your computer, however items which are visible in your photo library that are \u201cShared\u201d from some source will not appear in the EasyFlash Pro photo list until you go into the cell phone library and select \u201cSave shared photo/video to library\u201d. That option will be visible when viewing the photo/video in your cell phone library.\u2022 All videos will transfer to the thumb drive and display properly from the thumb drive on your cell phone. However, videos that were created with the phone in a vertical position will not be viewable on your computer using the standard Windows Media Player. You will need to get the \u201cCool File Viewer\u201d software from the Microsoft Store; it\u2019s free opensource code.Note that there is also a \u201cCoolle File Viewer\u201d which is not the one you want.\u2022 When you are done using the thumb drive on the computer, select \u201cEject\u201d on the top of the Windows Explorer window before removing the thumb drive from the USB port. I don\u2019t know if it really causes a problem or not, but it is recommended.",
