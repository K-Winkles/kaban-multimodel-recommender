                "reviewText": "Bought this as an inexpensive and cute USB drive for limited transferring of various files between PCs.Unfortunately I did not test it when I first received it.It sat in a package in a drawer for a couple months.When I tried to use it the first time it died after transferring a handful of small files onto it (less than 2 gigs worth).In the middle of writing files to it my computer could no longer recognize the USB drive. Unplugging it and plugging it back in shows a USB drive greyed out in My PC, but upon clicking it windows tells me to insert a USB drive. [Basically it means that windows detects the presence of a physical device, but can't read anything off of it to know what to do with it].Trying on another PC gets the same results. Other USB drives continue to work just fine.I cannot get a refund at this time as I waited too long to test it. Will not use this seller or this type of item again.",
