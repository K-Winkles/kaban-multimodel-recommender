                "reviewTitle": "Benchmark results may not be accurate (REVISED)",
                "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW: It turns out that file transfers through the command line have vastly different results so I'm willing to give the product the benefit of the doubt seeing how at least we know for sure the device is capable of better performance. It's reading and copying from rsync command in linux at 200MB (megaBYTES) per second using exFAT file system instead of NTFS, which is a much better result than I was getting through benchmarking 1,000x 10MB samples. It's definitely a solid a flash drive and good value at that speed. I'm keeping my review below for reference in case other purchasers run into the same mistake as I did.I'm attaching an updated screenshot using a gaming console backup of 110 gigs for this real world test scenario. This is absolutely fine performance, no complaints what so ever.Again, my review was not at all related to the seller, but rather the manufacturer.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW -----------------Performed 2 tests on this flash drive, freshly formatted to NTFS filesystem.Advertised reads 200MB/sActual reads: less than 43 MB/sAdvertised write speeds: 60 MB/sActual write speeds: < 5 MB/sThis is not a problem with the seller, this is Kingston's advertised and stated figures. There's always going to be a difference between theoretical speeds and actual speeds, that's not the reason I'm critical. The difference between advertised speeds and actual speeds is horrendous though. It's not even half... it's not even half of half. Try to imagine transferring 128 gigs at 5 megabytes per second - that's 25,600 seconds or 426 minutes or in other words OVER 7 HOURS!!!Kingston advertises this drive transfers at USB 3.2 gen 1 speeds, but in reality even USB 2.0 from over a decade ago could exceed that speed. I'm annoyed by misleading advertising and for that reason alone I would not recommend this drive to anyone. It's a lot of capacity for a cheap price, and the metal casing helps a lot with dissipating heat during heavy usage, and the speeds are in line with other cheap flash drives you'll find anywhere. I'm just constantly disappointed by these marketing schemes trying to find a drive that actually using better internal components hoping one day I'll find one that does what it says. SD cards can do it so I know it's possible, but flash drive manufacturers don't seem to have any pride or dignity what so ever. Even the cache size for short burst of large files which all flash drives has is absolutely miniscule even compared to other similarly priced USB drives from several other brands.While writing this review I'm reformatting the drive to exFat, it's now 19.7% complete with an hour and 11 minutes remaining... get a portable ssd instead if you want larger capacity and USB 3.2 because this ain't that. It's suitable for a boot disk or something, but might as well get a 16GB or 32GB instead of 128GB so you don't ever have to wait all day to format it. I can't think of a single use case for this 128gig drive at these speeds, the large capacity is almost entirely useless.",
