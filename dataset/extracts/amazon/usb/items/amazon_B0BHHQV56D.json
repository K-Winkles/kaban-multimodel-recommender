                "reviewText": "Don't get me wrong, it comes as expected physically but the storage amount is a lie. I bought the one for 30GB and I was trying to copy over photos + Video to the flash and it says not enough space. So I looked into it because I was only trying to 6GB. The drive is made and rewritten so it says \"29.2GB\" but when you look into advanced properties its only 5GB. Disappointed cause I obviously paid more for less",

I've already used my UNIX administration skills to try relaxing the permissions for the mounted drive at the command prompt, and they go right back to \"read only\". This is such a silly problem for a very nice looking wedding package; I now have to return this item and get something else. :'(",
