Tried this one and what a surprise the LED actually shows drive activity correctly. The cap also fits snugly so it shouldn't come off accidentally. Write speeds are a bit slow but for the price, you get what you pay for. I'm buying it for the LED activity light.",

I noticed they fixed the title, so perhaps this is no longer a problem, but be sure to check the quantity before you order.",

                "reviewText": "The per megabyte cost for these thumb drives is very good. But if you can't trust them it doesn't matter what kind of a good deal it is. I bought these in order to take on a vacation in the Dominican Republic. I had with me a 360 camera which creates incredibly large files. I needed these thumb drives in order to offload files from the camera itself. The first file I offloaded to the black thumb drive. It was 14 GB in size. Everything seemed to go well. I checked the file with my tablet and it was there as it was supposed to be. The next day I plugged the thumb drive into my tablet in order to view the file and check that everything with the camera went well. The tablet was no longer able to read the file. In fact the tablet would not even acknowledge that the thumb drive existed. Fortunately I had only used one of the thumb drives. I decided not to offload any more files to any of the thumb drives in case there was a problem. Fortunately I had enough space between my camera and the tablet memory in order to accommodate all the files for the vacation.When I got home I thought that maybe the problem was with my tablet since it could not recognize the thumb drive. I then plugged the black thumb drive into the USB port of my computer with the same results. The computer could not even identify that the thumb drive existed. Obviously there was a problem with the drive and unfortunately that one file was lost.It may have been simply that one drive that was defective. I will continue to use the other thumb drives for noncritical transfers. But in no way will I use them for backup or additional storage where the data on the drive is critical. If you can't trust the integrity of the drive it's not a bargain.",

                "reviewText": "I have hardly put any time into reviewing this product. The only task I put into being a customer to have received this product is performing a quick disk check in MS-DOS. I did it in DOS because I want to read all the details and correct any errors if any can be found. All 5 USB Flash Drives appear to function. I even ran a bad sectors check to find any bad sectors. Everything seemed to make it. One of the reasons why I purchased this item is because of the box it arrives in. No other review of this product, ever mentions it. One of the reasons why I purchased this drive is because I like having an intelligent place to sort, organize, and store important portable data. Having a box like this, allows me to do that. If a box didn't arrive with these USB drives, than I would toss them on my desktop and lose track of them. This box on a subconscious level gives me the option to control that.If I were to say anything negative about this purchased item, is that on the orange USB Flash Drive, there is a scratch mark. Not really a problem, I only mention it because that is the task of a customer's review. Mentioning all positives and negatives. I can live with it. What's most important is the disk check found no problems with it. I know there are other disk checking environments such as Linux, but Microsoft's attempt at disk checking is good enough for now.",
