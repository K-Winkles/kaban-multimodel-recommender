                "reviewText": "Wrote and verified 125,820,731,392 bytes with H2testw. Windows describes the capacity as 117.19GiB, or 125,821,779,968 bytes. My unit had a single exFAT partition when it arrived.At USB 3.0, H2testw took 65 minutes to write 117 GiB (32MiB/s), and 52 minutes or so to read (39MiB/s). Using Windows Explorer to store many 200MiB files averaged 24MiB/s, while a single 5GiB file averaged 28MiB/s.At USB 2.0, H2testw and other tools wrote at 25MiB/s.The plastic case is \"decent\". The packaging is \"nice\". The drive has a single red activity LED which flashes while writing at about 3Hz. The USB 3.0 male type-A connector shell is \"crisp\" and \"sharp\".At $6.59 USD and limited to a quantity of 1, this is a very cost-effective solution for storing many small files which are accessed at random. At $8-10, it competes with countless other options with varying quality and legitimacy. This one, at least, works.",

But these, no good at all. I just threw them in the garbage. I was adding storage to my firestick. When I plugged it in, I noticed it wouldn't turn on (red light). I pulled it out of the adapter half way and it lit up but never worked. I took the other one and went through the same routine. Nothing. Garbage. I cannot in good faith ever recommend these. Oh and just in case you are wondering it it was the adapter, I took one of my lower storage name brand drives and it worked perfectly. So now I'm off to buy quality drives. Let my mistake save you money. Buy quality. good luck.",
