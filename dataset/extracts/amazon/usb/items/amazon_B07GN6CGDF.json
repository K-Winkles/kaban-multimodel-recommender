                "reviewText": "Previous experience with USB stcks in this style had me expecting a much smaller unit, but it's not bigger than a normal USB thumb drive. The u-shaped aluminum bracket with the keychain loop feels a little lightweight and can pop off with only moderate effort, but I don't think it'll do so accidentally under normal use. Storage capacity is as advertised and no problems making 'doze 10 backup or installation media using Rufus, nor a Manjaro Linux live boot stick.",
