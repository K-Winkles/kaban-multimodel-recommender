Drive is small but has a loop to attach to a key ring or something similar. The end is open, but it is listed as dust proof. Read performance was similar to a squared end version of this FEMUOMA drive, but write performance was slower. It could just be my luck with the two drives. Still, the 44MB/s write speed was not bad and topped out around 41MB in real world tests copying large ISO/Zip files.",
