I purchased a smaller one of these (different brand and seller) had had a little trouble getting the iPhone 11 to recognize it, but this one came up right away. Transfer was a bit faster than the other and looking good so far in capturing all the photos and recordings with out a problem. The drives size is 512 GB and that's plenty of room to gain space in the iphone. Great little gadget. If I need another one of thee it will be from the same seller.",
