                "reviewText": "I needed to provide a bunch of paperwork and information to someone, and using a simple and inexpensive USB drive was the perfect solution. It was incredibly simple to put the files on the drive. I did not encounter any issues or errors, and when I checked to make sure everything transferred, it was all there. I didn't need to do anything to prep or format the drives, they were ready to go right out of the box.Both drives have a smooth matte finish to the cover (which I love) and they are in attractive colors of blue and black. I appreciate that they aren't the same color so that if you needed to differentiate between them, you could. I was also able to write a name on the cover in metallic permanent marker, and I liked knowing I was only putting marker on the case, not on the drive itself, so there's no risk of damaging it. The case spins around to expose to the usb, so there's no risk of losing a lid. The packge includes small, simple lanyards that can easily be installed if needed.I think getting two USB drives with this much storage for the price is an excellent deal and I'm glad that I grabbed a set, as it's always good to have a few of these on hand. You never know when you're going to need one, and these are inexpensive enough to have on hand for whenever you may need them.",

I needed to delete a partition and used the second drive in this set of two to run the software right from BIOS, as the M.2 drive I was dealing with had no OS on it. These USB drives are ready to use out of the box for both storage and running a portable OS.",

The 2 drives I received are both 58.4GB, or about 9% smaller than advertised, not a trivial amount. That said, they do work OK, and I haven't had any issues with writing to or reading from these drives. I will use them for periodic long-term backup for my laptop. An OK product except for the exaggerated size, so I give them 4 stars instead of 5.",
