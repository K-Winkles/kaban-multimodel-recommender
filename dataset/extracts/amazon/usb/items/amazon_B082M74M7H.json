I really enjoy that it can be used separately on either device.The transfer rate seems pretty standard, not any slower than if I were transferring off of my computer itself. The USB lights up when in use and has the same eject options whether using on my computer or phone. I do have to take off my phone case to use it with the phone because the USB C end is standard length and the body of the USB is not sized to be compatible with phone cases. Personally this isn't a big deal since my case is easy enough to remove and a small inconvenience for not having to also hook the phone up to the computer to move files, but this might be an issue for someone else.",
