                "reviewText": "This is a pretty reliable usb drive. I've carried it a couple days, it's holding files like a champ. To be fair, I baby my drives more than most people. Usually keep the in their own container in my pocket, avoiding lint and moisture. If you destroy your drives and complain about lost files that's your problem. I don't think this is going to lose data randomly on it's own. That being said, check out that keyring hole. I guarantee you if I put this on a ring and put that on my keychain my fat ass would crack it in half. Maybe the next revision of the design should have a slightly thicker bar to secure it against. Other than that, I dig it.",

Really, there isn't a lot to say about a flash drive. They either work or they don't. This one works.",

                "reviewText": "What I like best flash drives is they are quick easy access to whatever is on them. I love to cook, sew, crochet, embroider and bead. Keeping paper for my favorite patterns and recipes requires a lot of space. Flash drives allow me to keep, organize and access those patterns and recipes in a small space without using up the memory on my computer. I also like that I can put them into my laptop case and take them with me when I go on vacation. I don't need internet access. I have assigned a color to each category of file so I like the two color design because I can tell what type of file is on the flash drive just by looking at it. The retractable feature protects the USB connector from being damaged.",
