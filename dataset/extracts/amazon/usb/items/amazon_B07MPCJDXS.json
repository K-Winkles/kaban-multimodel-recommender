                "reviewText": "SanDisk 64GB Cruzer Fit USB Flash Drive - SDCZ33-064G-G35This is a reliable and very small USB type Thumb drive. It HAS THE LED INDICATION that flashes when the memory is being written to or read from, which seems to be something that is going away from the thumb drive market and if you want that option, YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT TO VERIFY YOU ARE GETTING IT. Don't be confused with the new thumb drives that just have a decorative LED that lights when plugged in an active computer. - These thumb drives work well but are S L O W. They work well for music and do ok with movies but movies could use a faster reading drive if you are seeing short pauses now and then on the screen.May take more time to download large files of pictures or documents as well. - They are reliable, I have not had one fail and I have been working with a couple that have been written to, erased, formatted many times with no problem showing up. - as they are memory chips, they will have the same negative that the SSD memory drives have, that is if you write to them all the time in huge amounts, the life of the drive shortens with each write. Memory type drives have this flaw which is a by product of the memory material used. This is why I strongly suggest you keep a back up copy of anything written on a memory drive of ANY TYPE.If you do not require the lightening fast speeds and want a portable thumb drive, I recommend this thumb drive here. - As these thumb drives have a very SMALL foot print, you can lose them almost as easily as a micro memory card. I suggest getting one of those cheap USB hubs and store your small thumb drives in the USB HUB. It also helps to lable the drive if you can in some way so you know what is on it. This will become a concern if your collection of thumb drives grows to any sizable quantity.I recommend this drive for small file transfers and limited work, this is only because of the drives write and read speeds. As said before, this drive has been reliable to me and I have worked them over a bit lately.I do not know the seller and did not get any discount or merchandise for my random review.200628 1220",

                "reviewText": "I bought this USB flash drive to do one thing: hang out as unobtrusively as possible for Unraid.For those that do not use Unraid, it requires you install the OS on a USB flash drive to allow for mobility by swapping to any system you want. It's great. Works great.And this drive is perfect for it. Unlike 99% of USB flash drives, this one is practically invisible. In fact, the best comparison is to imagine, if you have one, those Logitech Unified adapters that you use to hook up a wireless keyboard (like a K400) or a wireless mouse (G900/903). Or a cheapo bluetooth adapter. It's like that except it's 64GB of storage.Unraid doesn't really require lots of storage, but what it does give it room for is time for old age. Since Unraid is bound to the USB flash drive's mechanical ID, it's great to give it lots of room to provision space as the drive ages. And it's reasonably USB2-ish in speed.Didn't go with USB3 because if you read about people using USB3 sticks for Unraid (or Raspberry Pi for that matter) you find that USB3 has more of a tendency to fail because the drives tend to get hot and the controllers for them tend to get overly saturated.So that's what this represents. A fine enough drive in an incredible form factor. The only complain I have is how the overall body shape is so \"round\" that it's a little harder to remove than it should be even given its size. I kinda wish it was more boxy/angular.",

I keep on plugged into each PC so I can do a quick copy, just in case, for important files. Also useful for shipping a bunch of photos to family via snail mail. For me, it's cheaper than paying for a larger drop box account.Get some fishing line and put a small loop of line on each one for a lanyard. Makes them easier to handle.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars PERFECT if you have a USB slot on your car radio",
                "reviewText": "The radio I bought here on Amazon did not come as advertised. It was supposed to have an SD slot as well as the USB slot. It only had the USB. The last thing I wanted to do was have a 3\" USB thumb drive dangling out of the radio just waiting to be snapped off while drinking a coffee or shifting gears.That's when I discovered they made these great little nubs. I took a chance that they'd work on my radio and at this price I was glad I did. I haven't even used the second one I purchased yet because at 32GB it's more than I'll ever need in the car and I just haven't found another use for the other one yet.Beware though, because it's greatest asset is also it's biggest potential problem. These things are SMALL. Absolutely perfect for putting in a car radio. I'd imagine if you plugged one into a laptop it would be great there too for some extra outside storage if you didn't need to remove it much. Don't lose it. I wouldn't recommend this style for something you'd take on the go with you all the time, but if you have a need for a dedicated, low-profile solution, this is what you're looking for. And it's SanDisk. 'Nuff said.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've had a 16 GB Sandisk Cruzer Fit for a couple of years, using it in my laptops where it has worked fine. On day I put some mp3 tunes on it for one of my cars. It would not work in either my Dual XDM6350 car stereo nor the JVC (Kenwood) KD-T710BT. It was stuck on \"Reading\". I didn't know why it worked in the PC's but not the car units. I formatted it with every conceivable combination of file structure and and allocation unit size to no avail. I found a 64 GB Kingston drive at the local dollar store that worked flawlessly in everything, but I really wanted another low profile Sandisk. While I was waiting for the new 64 GB Sandisk to arrive, just for the heck of it I tried the 16 GB in the cars again and unknow to me how, it suddenly worked. Beats me how or why, but anyway, I'm getting of track.The new Sandisk 64 GB Cruzer Fit arrived and it also works flawlessly in both cars. I am so very happy with the fact that it's hardly noticeable plugged into the stereo so that I can just leave it plugged in, and only have to remove it to load some more tunes not to mention the fact that it can't be accidently bumped and maybe damaged and/or possibly broken right off? I am also happy that I don't have to worry about bumping it when moving a laptop around. And that it does not look as ridiculous jutting out of the front of the stereo as the longer drives do, in addition to the fact that the other drives are so obviously sticking out as to draw the attention of some ne'er-do-well walking by and peering in car windows. All in all, I am very happy with this Sandisk Cruzer Fit drive and would not hesitate to recommend it to others as well as purchase this item again for myself.",
