So I actually have a couple of months experience with them.I am using them to back up my System Backup, so I had to format that NTFS to get around the FAT 4GB file size limit. This means that my remarks on speed are for NTFS-formatted drives only.The write speed ... If you look at the details, the write speed varies from 0 to 64 MB/s or so. Actual testing shows that the overall speed is pretty much the same as my Ethernet, which chugs along at a steady 10-12 MB/s. So the average is about 10-12 MB/s. This is using a USB 3.0 port.The read speed, measured using a USB 2.0 port since that is all the Notebook involved has, is also around 60 MB/s, but is quite steady. However, on two occasions, after the first quarter or third of the file was transferred, the speed dropped precipitously. I have no idea why.Reliability does not appear to be an issue, at least so far.I'm not sure what \"warmth\" means. It does heat up a bit when writing, but not (IMHO) excessively. It provides no emotional support that I can detect.Th",

                "reviewText": "Not the strangest Flash Drive design I have used to open and close it, since you have to push the bottom while holding the top. Speed testing others have done do match what I got, make sure to check these to ensure you did not get a fake one with the way Amazon sells products now.Biggest thing you may notice is when moving a large amount of files or large sizes is the flash drive works like a toll booth where your truck of data will go through one load at a time when a large amount tries to go through. It gets portioned down and you can see the progress move in chunks. Not a major negative at all as the data transfers quick, but it does look funny when moving a few gigs of documents and seeing what looks like a laggy transfer.Great speeds if not a bootleg!",

I've used these USB drives for many years. No crashes, no loss of data. USB port is metal, not plastic which keeps the drive from cracking or breaking! Definitely recommended! Plus has a loop for attaching carabiner !",
