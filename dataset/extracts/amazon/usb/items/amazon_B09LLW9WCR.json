                "reviewText": "Apparently some of my USB ports are sticklers for detail and the IV stick in this set is just a tiny bit too large to fit into those ports, while the other four slid right in without an issue. All five work, though the IV one needs to be plugged into a USB extension cable that is more tolerant of the size.I like the roman numeral labels making each stick unique, but I find the labels are quite hard to read unless I get the stick to reflect something dark. My office has white walls and ceiling, so that's not always an instant thing. And the sticks are VERY reflective, basically mirror chrome, as it were, with the labels etched in a white/silvery color.",

                "reviewText": "It claims to be a 16GB drive, but you can only put 14.9 GB of data on the drive. Hard to believe that it takes 1.1 GB to format and put operating software on this little drive. Also, somebody claimed that it takes forever to download something to the drive. I downloaded 10Gb of music onto one in a few seconds, so either they used a Pentium-1, or a Commodore 64 as my I-9 sucked it down in less than 5 seconds.It took less than 5 minutes for over 245 songs.And they are actually labeled 1-10, (I-X) in roman numerals. This is very convenient when looking for the one you just saved something to.Nice sized hole for the keyring/chain to fit through.Non magnetic METAL for durability.Excellent drives, as I haven't had a drive failure yet...",

                "reviewText": "These drives look nice but they are unusably slow. Out of the package the drives averaged about 5-7 Mb/s write and 15-25 Mb/s read. I bought 64gb drives to load about 45gb of data onto for clients. It takes 2.5 hours on average to load the data and and an hour to copy it off. (for reference, it takes about 50 seconds to copy that much data to a usb3 ssd). Black Magic disk speed test can't even get a reading on the drives once the data was loaded. They slow down even more. That's unacceptable. I can't give these to clients, or even use them.",
