The backup function for photos grabs all photos from your various folders which makes it simple. I made sure all photos transferred successfully to my PC and were viewable, before deleting the pics from my iPhone. Would recommend!",

It pulled my photos off my phone easily, and with little fuss. Now, I feel better about pushing some to my backup server and some to a drive in the safety deposit box (I'm a genealogist, so I need backups). I read a couple of reviews that said it made their phone run hot, but it didn't do that in my case. I plan to keep using this as I accumulate photos. It's the one tool I never knew I needed.",

In two and a half hours it had downloaded my 25,000+ pictures and my 1,000+ videos all on one 128GB stick. Yes, the stick is now basically full so I will have to purchase another one for the future. I am not a techie, but I did not find it difficult to download. The instruction booklet seems thick and I was nervous based on reviews I read, but there is one direction per tiny page in the booklet along with a color photo! Don't hesitate - place your order today! You will not be sorry!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not kidding when I say that I have ALWAYS struggled with storage issues on my phone. I have over 20,000 photos and 980 videos on my phone. My issue is that I\u2019m not comfortable only relying on google photos or investing in cloud storage. I\u2019ve always wanted to take my photos off and put them on external storage. For years I\u2019ve tried to copy and transfer them with no success. The photos were always corrupted or it simply didn\u2019t work.I saw this product in a TikTok and believed it was probably too good to be true but at this point, I had nothing left to lose so I ordered one. It is amazing. I was quickly able to load almost all of my photos onto this device and then put them all on my external hard drive for safe keeping!! I can finally use my phone again and I\u2019m thrilled!!My only complaint is that I was only able to load 19,000 photos to the device as it did crash when I tried to load all of them. I\u2019ll probably just remove some photos and then get the rest of them off another day! Other than that, it\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s so easy to use and is WELL worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "This was quite difficult (stubborn little thing) to use. At first, I thought it would be simple, so I just stuck the thing in my iphone 11 and attempted to transfer files over to the stick, then over to my laptop. I did not delete anything on my phone in case anything goes wrong. To my surprise, it did not transfer all of it (343 out of 2438 photos/vids). Looking at the instructions, there are just too many pages to go through. I do not have time to read it as I have family over and I need the space on my phone for videos and pics. Those precious moments means no time's a wastin'! When I quickly scanned through the little booklet, I read \"formatting\", and so I did. That seemed to do the trick as it transferred MOST of the pics. I copied/pasted the files into my laptop's hard drive, went over the pics on BOTH my laptop and phone. If I see any of the photos/vids that were transferred, I deleted them off my phone. So it's good at this point. Problem is...the stick did not pick up ALL of my iphone pics. I've repeated this process with just the photos; for some reason the video files have changed its properties on my laptop's hard drive, but that is my doing and I've solved it (this has a lot to do with the programs your computer already have and NOTHING to do with the stick). I then painstakingly worked on the video files next on my phone and made a separate folder in my laptop's hard drive. This trick seems to work with me; it might be different for others. So far...so good. It's a pain, but I seriously need the space on my phone, like right now.Next thing on my list of problems is ejecting the stick off my laptop. Because it automatically backs up into my Dropbox -- which I'm trying to get out of cause it's a pain -- it takes FOREVER to eject the stick. I do not know how to turn off this feature, but I'm pretty sure someone out there has figured it out.As you can see, I can be quite impatient for something that is SUPPOSED to be easy to use and if it requires a lot of reading, then there's too much time being wasted.Three stars for:- photo transferring is pretty quick- once you get the hang of it and figure it out, then it's golden- convenienceMinus two stars for:- a booklet that can turn into a novel- not as easy as it seems- having to be creative with the way my computer and the stick communicate",
