I keep a copy of important files in my wallet, and have used a mini drive for that, but it still bulges the wallet. These drives store even more data and are not much thicker than a credit card. Sure, USB 2.0 isn\u2019t the fastest, and the thin form factor suggests it might not hold up to a lot of opening and closing, but if you have a need for the \u2018only use it if needed\u2019 backup drive, these are great. An added plus is that while there is a logo on the drive, there is enough blank space to label it with a marker.",

I ordered these and when they arrived, I was a little surprised to see the material that they are made out of. It says earth friendly and recyclable, but feels like it is made out of carboard. The way it opens seems flimsy and I gave one to a family member and spend more time explaining how to open, which way to insert it in the computer, etc. than I did with any other drive.Now on the positive side, they have 64 GB storage, and seem to work find. We will see how long they last. I think I would have liked them to be a little more durable.",

For years I have kept a USB stick on my keyring with a phone number in case I lose my keys, a bunch of my favorite music, some ebooks I want to read and a few technical reference books for work, and some movies which I change periodically. Anything else I put on there is encrypted.This is a 4 pack so I can give three of these away to others to do the same. FYI these are difficult to open, but that's good because they won't accidentally open by themselves.",

                "reviewText": "These are by far the smallest thumb drives I have ever seen. Very easy to carry in a wallet or pocket.I have used 2 so far with no issue formatting or saving info. The only issue I had was initially figuring out how to insert the drive into the usb slot. It's not the same size as a regular usb-a so you have to place it right. It's not hard and I had it down after a few second delay.If you have a need for such small drives, they don't come any smaller as far as I know! I can't speak to how they hold up to being carried in a pocket but they don't feel flimsy.I recommend them. I think as with any computer component, it's best to probably be gentle on them.",

                "reviewText": "These flash drives are a nice idea, but poorly executed. It\u2019s basically a thin regular flash drive taped into a bulky recycled plastic case. The plastic of the drive itself is non-recycled. The hinges of the case are badly molded, which means that the part with the drive doesn\u2019t move very easily. When you do unfold it, it usually pops out as you can see in my picture.The drive also transfers data pretty slowly. I used them to share some old home video files with family and it took a really long time - with lots of pauses - to copy them to the drive. It\u2019s a cool idea, but the ecological part of the concept doesn\u2019t carry through to the drive plastic itself, and the drive case just isn\u2019t reliable enough to use as a keychain in my opinion.",
