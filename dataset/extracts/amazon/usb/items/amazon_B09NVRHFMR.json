I told Amazon I wanted my under $5 refund withoutout a return since it did have personal information on it. These products only work sometimes and returning one is crazy, but the rewards to someone else if they could access the data is huge. Not worth buying from anyone that is not USA or named Brand that typically work for a very long time.",
