                "reviewText": "Picked this flash drive up with the intended use as a LiveCD for a Raspberry Pi setup.Reading some reviews online it received mixed reviews on this intended usage. Some stated it was a good value while others gave the impression it was pretty good. For basic transfer of files it was speedy and worked fine. Once I flashed the OS onto the drive and installed it into the Raspberry Pi and booted up the mediocre performance came front and center. It took about 30 minutes for the OS to get booted in and to run updates on the system. While this is not bad it is far from a quality experience. The read/write performance falls down unfortunately. Boot time on the system and miscellaneous files is just average.If you are using this device for basic files copy / paste it will work fine for what it does. BUT If you are looking for something for LiveCD / Raspberry Pi usage it will not perform well for the task.",

They tried to blame it on the Blink system but finally agreed to let me mail it to them so they could test it & sent me replacements if I wasn't stupid. I then Called Amazon very upset.
