                "reviewText": "Today, thumb drives are difficult to chose from.You are told basic info, called click bait, to get you to the info page.This is done because most buyers will purchase after clicking ontothe info page, at least 50% but bet it is more.But they dont Tell you the entire story, only what they must.If they dont tell me drive speeds, I won't purchase from them.THESE DRIVES, the Attache thumb drive, are 2.0, and in a high end drive, 2.0 is not a terribly slow speed.These drives are slow. But that is not all bad.For us who are using them for back ups or in my case, for my audio book and music storage andplay back, slow is not important, it will play back just fine.but if you are unloading or reading huge files, pics, documents, you will find time for a coffee orsandwich during the save operation.Speed seems connected with size of memory as well.Unless you are buying fairly inexpensive drives, the speed should be acceptable.But I did find with PNY 512gb drives that because of the drive and/or some action insidethe memory control programs, they are very slow, even the supposed fast speed drives.I am guessing this may be true of all very large memory thumb drives.-- I attempted to run a linux op sys from that drive, yes it is possible to do this, but because of thememory management in the drive, it would run then slow way down, run fast, then slow down.I ended up using them for back up drivesThe memory management has to move memory around, this is needed because flash memory(the same with SSD's) do not fragment files like hdds can. They remove the entire file, and rewriteit in a block of memory as a whole file. With the event of write wear damage which leads to theearly demise of memory in thumb drives and especially SSD's, this file manipulation takes time awayand decreases the life of the memory faster than on hdds. The HDD do not suffer from write wear.These drives do not have led activity lights. This was almost a no sale for me. Only the price vsmemory size prompted me to buy them. That activity light can be very important at timesand I dont understand why the manufacturers are cheaping out.They operate like any other thumb drive, are easy to use, and are easy to lose.I strongly recommend getting a small case to carry your thumb drives in if you take themwith you. That is the joy of portability. However, NEVER hang them from your key chain.You will be sorry at some point. You have been warned.I have not experienced a failure yet but, as in all drives, I strongly recommend you save to 2 drives, one to work on, the other as a back up drive, just in case your working drive fails.These are memory drives. They CAN BE USED FOR BACK UPS of files but know what you are doing.Memory drives use a residual amount of electricity, even when unplugged from the computer to maintain the memory. If you make a back up of an important document or pics, you need to keep them in a cool place, and yearly, plug them in the computer to refresh that residual energy charge in the drive.in my experience, Thumb Drive Failure has never happened when being used as a back up storage.I have experienced failure by user error. Thumb drives are fairly safe for your data, but as I said, ifthe data is important, make a second back up on another thumb drive.Thumb drives are great for holding files and data. they are pretty much reliable to the point I had usedthem to back up operating systems when the virus attacks were so bad they would shut downmy computers. At that point, thumb drives were priceless.IF you are not needing Fast read/write speeds, but are looking for an extra amount of memory space to store or access data, These may be adequate for you. with that I will RECOMMEND THEM.However IF you need something that reads and writes fast, look at the better, more expensive drives and pay attention to the speeds. If the seller does not post the drive speeds, then it is a SLOW speed drive and you need to look else where.I will repost if I learn anything more about these drivesI do not know the seller and did not receive any money or product for my random review.230412 1147",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a reliable, practical and above all value-for-money flash drive, look no further than the PNY Attach\u00e9 3 USB 2.0 Flash Drive. I recently ordered the 16GB 5-pack and was absolutely thrilled with my purchase.The first and most pleasant surprise was that these 16GB drives formatted to a whopping 32GB each! Twice the storage than I initially expected and a fantastic bonus for someone constantly juggling data around like myself.In the ever-evolving world of technology, compatibility often becomes an issue. This is where the PNY Attach\u00e9 3 Flash Drives shine bright. USB 3.0 drives are unfortunately not compatible with most older USB 2.0 devices, such as smart TVs and aging computers. Here, the Attach\u00e9 3 drives come in as a lifesaver with their excellent backwards compatibility.The read/write speed, while not being blazing fast due to the USB 2.0 limitation, is not a deterrent. It is more than adequate for typical everyday use and considerably efficient for image transfers, Such as loading Linux images on older computers. For me, this isn't an issue, as my needs revolve more around compatibility and reliability than speed.When it comes to form factor, these flash drives are both compact and sturdy, a perfect combination for anyone requiring portable data storage. They are very easy to use and ideal for use as a bootable image drive.As with any data storage device, I always advise maintaining multiple backups, but I must admit that the PNY Attach\u00e9 3 drives have so far proved to be remarkably dependable.In conclusion, the PNY Attach\u00e9 3 USB 2.0 Flash Drive 5-Pack offers excellent value, unexpected storage capacity, great compatibility and a user-friendly experience. It is an excellent purchase for anyone in need of reliable, portable storage solutions. Highly recommended!",

Did not test the speed but they seem fast enough. Did not fill up all the way to test GB but they seem to work as expected. They are not cheap junk. They are pretty durable and have a good feel. I would buy again since they were a good price per GB. I just needed some that I could give away or use spur of the moment so I was not concerned about getting the most GB per stick but getting the most bang for the buck per stick with, to my mind, a reliable name brand.",
