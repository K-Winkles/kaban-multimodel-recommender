                "reviewText": "I've been using these for a couple of months and they work fine. I haven't checked speed or anything because I just use them to backup or move individual files when a network connection isn't handy.What compels me to write this is the fact that I just came back from a trip, unloaded my suitcase and then sat down to do some work while the wash ran. I went to the backpack and couldn't find the memory stick. I recalled getting up at 4am to catch an early morning flight and putting it somewhere...... Hmmm.... I remembered it was somewhere I wouldn't normally put a memory stick because it wasn't going to be the cleanest place but well there wasn't anything on it that wasn't on the laptop. I checked the bottom of the backpack, the front pockets of the suitcase, the sandy inside of the suitcase. Oh well...... Not critical. Cost was about 1 Starbucks coffee.Since I mentioned the wash above I guess you know where I finally found it. It was in a pants pocket and it was pretty saturated having agitated under soap and water for 30-40 min. I guess that washed all the pocket lint and dirt out because after an hour in the oven on \"dehydrate\" setting I plugged it into the PC and it works as well as it did brand new.I'll probably mark it with a sharpie so I don't use it for anything critical but I truly did not expect it to work, but it did. For that they get a 5* review. FWIW I've used several other TeamGroup products (USB, SD and SSD) in non-critical applications and none of them have ever failed.",

                "reviewText": "Apparently, Amazon figured this out after I bought these and adapters for my Fire TV Sticks. Not the fault of the sellers of these but Amazon had been saying they would add extra storage for our low storage Fire TV Sticks. They recently discovered that is not true. You must have a cube or Fire TV to add extra storage. At least they were inexpensive and the one I used to copy data from my old iBook seems to work okay. But meanwhile I have these 5 64G flash drives and no use for them. I already had 3 old flash drives with more storage space that I no longer use. I bought these and the small adapters specifically for my 4 Fire TV sticks. Waste of money but I\u2019m giving 4 stars anyway because they seem okay and it was Amazon\u2019s misinformation at fault.",

The fourth one simply started going flakey and died on me while normally using it, and the fifth remains to be seen...I'm almost afraid to plug it in for fear of losing what's on it. Every one of the drives I attempted to flash now shows up in Windows as \"removable media\" with no media inserted.Terrible experience with these. I would recommend spending a bit more to get more reliable flash drives.",
