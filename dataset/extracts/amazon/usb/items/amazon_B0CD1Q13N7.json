I recently purchased the 1TB memory stick and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with its performance.Firstly, the design of the memory stick is sleek and compact, making it easy to carry around with you wherever you go. It also has a lightning connector which makes it really convenient to connect to your iPhone without having to use any external cables.In terms of storage capacity, the 1TB option offers plenty of space for all of my files, photos and videos, which is great considering how much I tend to use my phone for work and personal projects.But what really sets this memory stick apart from others on the market is its speed. The transfer speeds are incredibly fast, meaning I can easily back up or move large files in a matter of seconds.Another great feature of the EATOP USB flash drive is its compatibility with a wide range of devices. Not only can it be used with iPhones, but it can also be connected to iPads, computers and other devices with ease.Overall, I would highly recommend the EATOP USB flash drive 1TB memory stick for anyone looking for a reliable and high-performing storage solution for their iPhone. Its sleek design, fast transfer speeds and compatibility with a wide range of devices make it a top choice in its category.",

I was immediately asked to download the Y Disk app. So the iPad recognized the flash drive but the Y Disk software would not respond. It kept asking me to insert the flash drive. The drive was inserted and seated but not recognized.I have an older iPad 2 that uses the Lightning connector. The Eatop flash drive works perfectly along with the Y Disk software. I can offload videos and save them to a large external hard drive on my computer.I would not recommend using the flash drive for permanent storage. #1 the amount of space on my 1TB drive is very limited. Even though it is supposed to be 1 TB. #2 Other reviewers had stated that files mysteriously disappear. You do not want your files or photos to be lost permanently.Again, the flash drive lightning connector works. It does look like the USB port is not that sturdy. After one day the upper covering flipped up. I pushed it back down and continued using it. Another user noted the same issue with the USB port.I",
