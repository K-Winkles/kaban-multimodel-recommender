Its capabilities all fall within what is to be expected of a 2,0 USB. I have not performed any thorough tests in regards to the speed of this drive and I think that that would be superfluous anyways. It is not a 3,0 USB and thus one should not expect 3,0 speeds.It should however be noted that this drive is unusually small; the term \"thumb drive\" seems to have been taken literally by SanDisk as this is only about as large as half of the size of the average adult thumb\u2014something to bear in mind when storing this drive as one might imagine how easy it would be to lose it.In closing, if you are in need of a 2,0 drive for the purpose of updating your motherboard's BIOS then this shall do quite nicely. This might also do well for a student in need of cheap, transportable storage for school assignments.",

                "reviewText": "Hello there,There isn't much to say about an 8 GB USB pen drive you don't already know. But if you are a Bernina user, you may wonder if this model would work well with a Bernina.Short answer: Yes. I was looking for a brand-name USB thumb drive for our sewing machine and our embroiderer, and these worked great out of the box. Berninas seems to have problems going over 8GB, but they work perfectly with these 8GB ones. Make sure your format is FAT32, and you are ready!They were tested on a Bernina 700e, 770QE Kaffee edition, and Bernette B70. They should work with other modern series like the 4, 5, or 8.Thank you for reading!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Cruzer Blades for years. I keep buying larger and larger ones as they become available. It's rugged because there's no moving parts. There's no retractable useless mechanism to lock, no stupid dust cap to lose because it's not included, and those don't matter anyway. You don't need a dust cap, stop it. They're smaller than the majority of other flash drives. They're perfectly contoured and shaped to fit firmly between your thumb and index finger so that they're extremely comfortable and easy to insert. When you push them in, they go in. When you pull them out, they come out. You'll be at least 50% less likely to insert them upside-down, and they just work.I use them for everything. It's the best USB stick I've ever had attached to a keychain with 2 huge truck keys, 4 other car keys, 3 tool box keys, 4 work keys, and 5 house keys as well as some rappelling gear. Years like this. I work every day, and my keys are always with me. They get banged around, have been inserted and ejected into dozens if not hundreds of Macs and PCs at home and at work and have never failed. I still have and use every one of them I've ever bought, and in every storage capacity available since they were first produced.They have hundreds of uses. Game storage, backups, installer media, bootable operating systems, automobile service records, presentations, desktop, documents, downloads, library, movies, music, pictures, sites, shared. All of the software I need to do my job, right there on the keychain. PDF service manuals for the equipment I repair go with me everywhere. I guess you could put stupid stuff like homework, or passwords on it, but I don't because those things aren't fun. It's more fun to plug your whole music library into one of the USB slots on your brand new, shiny, technology-packed, voice-activated 6.1 digital surround sound equipped loaded premium model 4x4 truck and tell your truck what you want to hear. It's safer, too. For you and everybody else. Of course the truck is optional, but if your vehicle is equipped with these technologies, please do this. You'll never be the distracted one. The Cruzer Blade is perfect for this in the hot summer and in the cold of winter. I know this for a fact. Years like this. Always available. It will even let you use your phone storage for more useful and practical things, or it could even allow you to buy the smaller, less expensive, less storage capacity model of the same phone saving you hundreds of dollars. If you wanted to listen to music on the go, everything everywhere has USB, and it's all louder and sounds better than your phone. Go out to your truck and get it. Problem solved. Phone stays charged.Pros: If you need a RED and BLACK, tough, simple, durable, stealthy USB 2.0 flash drive, then this is the best one ever made. Indisputable champion.Cons: The form factor hasn't changed over the years, WHICH IS FANTASTIC! Don't change them in any physical or functional way... but the microscopic painted lettering eventually wears away on both sides, so you don't know if it's a 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB or 128 GB? You just know that it's the red and black one. I wish like crazy these things came in a dozen different colors. Maybe even get creative and make one that glows in the dark? Or polished Aluminum? Woodgrain? Tortoise shell? Burl? Clear? Of course I have nothing against red and black... I'm just sayin... it's the only way it could be improved, I don't know that any of this qualifies as a con? I have zero complaints with the quality of this product and my experience with using them. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, red and black. Long live the red and black Cruzer Blade USB 2.0 flash drives!",
