                "reviewText": "The molded metal formfactor means that it's easy to add to your keychain and always have it handy; since the hole is in the metal body of the drive itself that means no tiny metal ring or plastic tab to break off. As long as you don't loose your keys, you're pretty much guaranteed that the flashdrive is still with them.Speed is pretty decent, with a caveat: it gets *really* slow when you have more than one copy job writing to the drive at the same time, it will take literally 10+ times longer to finish than if you copy them as two separate batches one after the other.The metal body of the drive also gets pretty hot when in use, but so far I haven't seen any reliability issues.",

I don't have the equipment to do \"speed tests,\" but for my usual mix of text documents and photos, it certainly seems as fast as anything I've used.LikesSpacious, fairly priced; seems to perform wellNot-so-likesIs it *too* small? I had to take this drive with me someplace a while back, and was so worried about it slipping out of sight that I clipped it to a keyring. Nice that it fit so easily on the keyring, but if you normally slip your USB drive into a pocket or in a bag somewhere, it would be pretty easy to lose track of this thing. It's no more than 1/4 the length of other Sandisk USB drives I have.I have never had a USB drive run this hot. Maybe it's the metal housing, and maybe it's good that the housing dissipates heat, but I can't think it's great for the components that it literally gets too hot to touch when it's running full tilt. Even just sitting in its slot, it gets VERY warm, whereas the three USB drives parked nearby always feel room temperature.VerdictI'd buy this kind of drive again, but just given the way I use flash drives, I might avoid the combination of tiny footprint and a metal housing.Four hot, shiny metal stars.",

I like this formfactor, and the capacity & price were both right for me.One of the reasons the casing is metal on drives like this is to act as a heatsink for internal components; it is normal for this to get warm or hot to the touch in my experience. I would rather the heat dissipate as designed than have the chips fail.SanDisk also honors the 5-year warranty on this, and I have no doubt they will follow through as they have the few other times I have had to file a claim with them.I did a large file copy test, and yes, the initial transfer speeds were fast, but it slowed way down as the job progressed. However, the job still finished with no problems. It still transferred ~100GB in an hour or so.I then let the drive cool and performed a speed test from a USB 3.1 gen2 port, and it surpassed expectations. Benchmark results from a USB 3.0 port were also great.",

This drive is listed as a 150 MB/s second but my reads are much faster. Over 400 MB's. Write speeds are what I expected, in the 60 MB/s range. I thought this 128 gig model was very fairly priced. Maybe they sent me the 400 MB/s version by mistake as Sandisk makes one but Amazon was listed as being out of stock. I don't believe the packaging had any speeds listed and I threw that out. Maybe I just lucked out. I don't know why it says it's black in the listing. Mine was all silver. Of course, to get these faster speeds, your computer must have a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port.
