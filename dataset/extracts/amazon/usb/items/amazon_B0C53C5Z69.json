                "reviewText": "This is a very handy storage for flash drives. I own a lot of flash drives, and previously I had bought a flash drive storage pouch but it held it by elastic bands and pockets. The pouch doesn't have a lot of capacity and so I have a whole bunch of flash drives all inside a box. Sometimes it was hard to find a drive or if I left it somewhere to know that it wasn't in the box.This solves this problem and keeps all the flash drives neat and organized. It contains a foam piece with flash drive sizes cutout. You pull the foam pieces out and put in your flash drive. All of this inside a hard shell case.Obviously, the odd shaped flash drives don't fit. Secondly, the labels on the flash drives are not visible. I have some that I bought in a pack and are exactly the same and have to label to know what has what.The SD card storage was very tight and wouldn't fit with the transparent cases they come in. If you just want to store the SD cards without the clear storage cases, this would work well.Overall, great idea and execution. While my pouch now stores the odd shaped flash drives, this stores most of my flash drives in a very neat and organized way.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice storage case for thumb drives and memory cards, but it's a little short for my longest thumb drives. I had to put them towards the back of the case to get it to close (it was still very tight, pushing on the top of the thumb drives). It's a little larger than I expected, but that's fine because it allows for a lot of memory to be stored in one place.Something you should be aware of is the smell. It has an extremely strong chemical smell when first removed from the plastic packaging. It's so strong it gave me a headache. I had to put it outside on my porch for a day to get the smell down. Once it sat outside, the smell was greatly reduced.",

                "reviewText": "With no standards in place for the design of USB flash drives, we can find them in every configuration you can think of. There are tiny drives just a little bigger than the USB connector, drives the shape of a pack of chewing gum, and everything in between. They have got to be the most difficult to organize type of modern computer storage media that I've ever encountered.This storage case is about the best that you are going to get for storing flash media. For some thinner drives, I needed to use a piece of cardboard to keep them to stay securely in the foam cutout. I also found a thin piece of foam that I cut into a rectangle. I use this to keep all the drives from hitting the SD cards and to keep them more secure in the cutouts. They probably should have included one with the case.The SD cards cannot be stored while inside those little plastic clamshell containers. Those will not fit in the pockets. MicroSD cards can be stored in the pockets, but I feel they might not be very secure and possibly fall out + get lost.",
