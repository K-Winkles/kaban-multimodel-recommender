I have purchased enough USB keys online that turned out to be garbage that I test ALL of them the first day. Just note, this is a USB 2.0 drive and is slow in comparison to current versions.I am not a wood expert, but I would guess a solid pine and not a glue particle board, but strong enough to resist dents and keep its shape. The whole thing is polished finely with round corners that give it a sleek design.The key is held together with the cap by two sets of small magnets. The wooden box is a sort of clamshell system with an indentation in the middle that is perfect fit for the USB key, and the flap is held shut by a set of small magnets. However, there is an included eye-hoop that screws into the key directly, but if you use it, the key will no longer fit in the box.This combination is perfect to put on family photos or music and to give as a gift.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice looking usb flash drive but that's about it. It doesn't read/write large memory files quickly. It has an average speed. The keychain attachment is nice, yet it doesn't stay that way for long. Overtime the flashdrive while on my keychain has loosened. Preventing it from folding in or out.Works like normal usb with a wood finish. Nothing special.",
