                "reviewText": "This review is for the 3 pack of 32gb sticks which I see is no longer being offered. So for the offer I took advantage of, I have to say that the price was definitely good for 3 sticks! However, the low price may not be such a good deal after all when there are problems with 2 of the 3 sticks right off the bat. These 2 do not light up...not a big deal in my book but speaks to a lack of quality control. The same 2 sticks were very slow in being recognized by my super-fast computer and it's 3.0 USB ports. I expected immediate recognition but that did not happen with these 2 sticks! This explains my 3 stars for \"easy to use\"! I see problems with these 2 somewhere down the road if they are super slow to be read by my super fast computer. That to me is ominous and I don't see them lasting long. I don't really care if they don't light up but that could be an indication of a failure waiting to happen...I don't know but it is a definitive indicator that The \"rigorous inspection\" cited by seller ain't so \"rigorous\" after all! Yes, all 3 sticks did work after being recognized by my computer, with the \"plug and play\" feature and not requiring a format but I see problems after some moderate usage. I would not buy this brand again and it's not worth the effort to return these considering their low price. I consider them expendable at this point and will not and cannot use them for my original intent as historical, long-term storage devices. I will move on to another (more costly) name brand that has served me faithfully over the years and write this off to my being a bit too cost-conscious for something that I need to use for a long-term project.",
