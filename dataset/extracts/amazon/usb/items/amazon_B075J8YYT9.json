We made 75 total, and not 1 of them had an issue. These were super affordable and perfect for this small project. There are comments about them not holding much, which I suppose is true, but that is because they are only 64mb (per product description). You can find guideline charts online about how much mb/GB common projects are, which is helpful before selecting the right size USB as file size needed is not always intuitive. SMALL storage capacity. Don't confuse MB with GB but I just need some small ones to hold some small files (for embroidery) and these fit the bill. I like how you can easily write on them with a sharpie Nifty. A little small but great for small projects. What customers think about Kepmem?",

I purchased the 64 Mb size, which is just about big enough for a word document. Maybe even TWO word documents. (Yes you read that right). Bahaha. Amazing.Grab a hundred, put a digital Amazon giftcard claim code on just one of them, add a note (i.e. \u201cOne of these devices has an Amazon giftcard on it. May the odds be ever in your favor\u201d) and your passive-aggressive work holiday party white elephant gift is good to go for this year. Or do what I did and mix a few packs of these with conference USB devices, floppy disks and Zip disks.If I need bulk USB storage devices with a more usable capacity at some point, I would totally consider this company again based on the quality of the ones I received.",

Now that technology has advanced most cars don't have cd players anymore so my dad is unable to use his cd's with these vehicles.When I went home to visit I suggested he use flash drives. I ordered some and had shipped to him. I told him how to format and sync songs. He loves it. Only issue, the 128MB drives I sent he was only able to fit 14 songs on. I think 256MB would be better for him. He can fit 24-28 songs.",

The drives I got were only 118MB. Still enough to do what I wanted to do but if I needed every bit of the 128MB I would have been out of luck.Many of my CD's are either side of 50MB each which leaves about 15 to 20MB available on the flash drive.Two large CD's or three small CD's wont go on these 118MB drives but possibly would have if a true 128MB flash drive was sent.Likely will buy more, but false or exaggerated specs is really getting annoying.",
