                "reviewText": "TLDR:If you think it looks cool or want a double ended USB drive and are super concerned with read / write speeds go for it. If you plan to copy to and from frequently and in large amounts, move alone.The good:This drive has a solid feel to it, it has some weight, it feels good in your hand. Being able to use either USBC or USBA is a bonus. They way it rotates, it almost like a fidget spinner for adults. From that point of view, I love it.The bad:This is sold and marketed as a USB 3 drive. As someone who understands USB 2, 3, and variations, allow me to explain. USB 3.0 (also known USB 3.2 Gen 1 because USB's naming convention is horrible) is capable of speeds of 5.0Gbps. Now you'll nowhere get those speeds on a USB 3 flash drive, those are the max throughput. USB 2.0 is capable of 480MbpsHere's the thing, the MAX write speed I could get is 30 MB, and pretty much about the same for reading. I expect better from a USB flash drive. 30MBps = 240Mbps. Meaning the speed is still in USB 2.0 territory. This test was done on two systems, a Z590 using a 3.2 Gen 2 port, and an LG Gram 1260p USB 4.0 port. My computer is not bottlenecking the system.So after testing it out and being disappointed I can back and looked at their listing more closely. One of their images states USB 3 (20-40 Read 15-30 Write).So yeah for the price, it's current price, it's acceptable. Nothing to write home about. Won't be using as my primary.",

Those speeds are more in line with USB 2.0. Other than that having both USB A and USB C options is nice, but you can't fully close it.Regardless, this item isn't even available anymore so a 2/5 from me seems reasonable.",

I was so happy when I found this since I can easily switch between devices that will have either one or the other. It works perfectly. The only tiny negative is that one end remains exposed in your bag when the other end is covered, so just have to be careful not to damage the exposed end in transport.",
