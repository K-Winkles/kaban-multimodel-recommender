                "reviewText": "I work with a lot of thumb drives with photos, back ups, and just spares when I need them so I really wanted something that would help organize them and keep them all together. This was something I found. It can hold up to 134 thumb dirves and I was able to fill about half of them or so. It only has half for small thumb drives and half for big thumb drives (67 each). I understand why they did this but note that you can actually put big thumb drives inside the smaller slots. It will fit with a little bit of force but you may lose some spaces. Honestly I have more bigger thumb drives than I do small thumb drives. Most of the thumb drives I have fit pretty well into this. There are some that just do not stay in and actually fall out. If you happen to have those wifi thumb drives, those will fit but it will be a tight fit. It pushes on the lid a bit but it did fit. Most thumb drive I have seen fit well while some fall out when I carry this. The most annoying this about this is foam were cut but the middle was not removed. I had to remove them all one at a time which was really annoying. It took time to individually take them out. The best way I found to remove this is to just take the whole foam out and just push them out one at time. Some would say just leave them in and only remove it for the spaces you are using but it looks really messy if I did it that way. The next thing is that the latch on the right side does not always connect. I found the reason is that the sides of box near the latch are a bit weak so if you press too hard it will just push the plastic side in so it will never latch. If you do it lightly it most of the time will lock. The lid hinge seems fine and does not look like it will break off. The handle is simple but easy to carry around. I would have liked the case to not be see through as much as carrying this around reveals what is inside. That plastic is prone to sun damage so if you happen to leave this in the sun it will start to get murky look to it. It is light already and even with the thumb drive in it I barely notice the difference. Overall I think this is a good case to have if you have A LOT of thumb drives. I would not recommend this if you do not have a ton of thumb drives. I have a LOT of thumb drives so it works better with this. The only issue I found with it is that the removing all the foam cut outs take forever and the plastic sides are a bit weak so if you put too much pressure when trying to lock it, it will not lock. Also I do wish that the case was not clear see through so that if you are transporting this people do not see all the thumb drives inside.",
