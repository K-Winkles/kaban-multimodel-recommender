                "reviewText": "The cable barely fits in my 2015 gti. I have to force it in because access to the connector in the car is narrow and the wires project from the male connector directly into the interior wall of the compartment. It looks like the wires coming off of the main connector are being stressed, or at least the insulation is being stressed. Overall it feels like this cable was designed for a different car but it said it was compatible with mine so dunno who's fault that is. =/Otherwise it works as described.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this in addition to a few other cables (AV Couplers, HDMI to RCA box, USB-C to HDMI cable) to connect my Samsung phone to my MMI in a 2016 Audi A7. I am able to mirror my phone to the display which is what I was aiming for. There's a lot of information online suggesting only the official Audi cable works but this is not the case as this cable is working for me at a fraction of the price of the original cable.There was also information online suggesting that the RMC MMI system was not capable of video playback after the facelift but again this doesn't seem to be true as I have a 2016 Facelift Audi A7 with the RMC MMI system and I have it working perfectly, sound comes through the car speakers and I can control it with the volume knob and steering wheel in the car. I need to enable Video in Motion (VIM) to allow mirroring whilst moving faster than 5mph so an OBDeleven adapter and 100 credits are required to enable this feature, I will do this later.Also note that I have this working using a USB-C to HDMI cable without external power source as my phone supports DP-ALT mode through the USB-C. Check online to see if your phone supports this otherwise you will need a USB-C to HDMI adapter with external power to get this working. The HDMI to RCA box requires external power and they usually come with a short USB-A cable that can be plugged into your car cigarette socket charger that I'm assuming everyone has.Very happy with the setup at the moment, I am planning to buy a fire stick or chromecast to attach to the HDMI to RCA box so that I can mirror any android phone to the car screen.Will update if anything changes.",
