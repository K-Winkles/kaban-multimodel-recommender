I also couldn't afford to have speed latency issues so I was watching for that when i first got this. It's been great. I have a work laptop that uses the same peripherals to i keep everything plugged into the hub and just swap laptops. It made my setup effortless",

                "reviewText": "Needed more ports so I decided to give this 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub a try and it has worked out great. Here is an overview of the pros and cons:Pros:- Compact size - This hub takes up barely any space on my desk or nightstand. Easy to tuck away and position.- Sturdy design - It feels well constructed and durable. I don't worry about it falling apart with repeated use.- Fast charging - My devices seem to charge at normal USB 3.0 speeds. No noticeable lag.- Even power distribution - It evenly splits power between all 4 ports based on my testing. Reliable performance.- Plug-and-play use - I just plugged it in and connected devices without needing to install anything. Very simple.- Affordable price - For the convenience it provides, the cost is reasonable in my opinion.Cons:- Short cord - The attached USB cord is on the shorter side. I need an extension sometimes to position it ideally.- No on/off switch - It would be nice to have a power switch on the hub itself to easily cut power when needed.Overall, this BYEASY 4-port hub has provided the convenient extra USB ports I needed for my electronics and office accessories. It delivers reliable charging power in a compact and affordable package. I would recommend it for anyone looking to expand their USB capabilities. Hope this review helped!",
