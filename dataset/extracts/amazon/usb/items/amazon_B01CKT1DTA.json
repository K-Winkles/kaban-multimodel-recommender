                "reviewText": "I was looking for cheap usb drives that I wouldn't use more than 4GB each on for various boot utilities, installations, and flashing of firmware.Of course there's always the problem of fake usb drives where the actual space is smaller than indicated and you simply start overwriting data if you exceed the real space.These use Chipsbanks CBM2199a which is a pretty new flash controller and the memory reported as ECD7947E64C4 - Samsung K9HDGY8U5B - 4CE/Single Channel [MLC-8K]I ran them through a 3 pass low level factory format using UMPtool and they are all really 16GB (ish). Benchmark show they are below but close enough to the performance of a Sandisk Cruzer Glide (16GB usb 2.0). However the random write performance is pretty bad. You can compensate for this with disk caching in Windows. Below are the benchmark results. Overall they are 5 stars because the price is great , they aren't fake, and the performance is mostly ok.USB Drive formatted as extfat with the default cluster allocation size of 4KBUsing a USB 3.2 gen 1 port (5gbit) AMD controller , Windows 10, latest driversBenchmark Tool Crystal Disk Mark - 1 pass 128MB fileEastfun[Read]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 8, T= 1): 20.090 MB/s [ 19.2 IOPS]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 20.106 MB/s [ 19.2 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 32, T=16): 11.748 MB/s [ 2868.2 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 11.418 MB/s [ 2787.6 IOPS][Write]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 8, T= 1): 5.868 MB/s [ 5.6 IOPS]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 6.690 MB/s [ 6.4 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 32, T=16): 0.003 MB/s [ 0.7 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 0.008 MB/s [ 2.0 IOPS]Sandisk Cruzer Glide 16GB (Usb 2.0)[Read]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 8, T= 1): 25.301 MB/s [ 24.1 IOPS]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 25.985 MB/s [ 24.8 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 32, T=16): 6.950 MB/s [ 1696.8 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 6.048 MB/s [ 1476.6 IOPS][Write]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 8, T= 1): 6.285 MB/s [ 6.0 IOPS]Sequential 1MiB (Q= 1, T= 1): 7.125 MB/s [ 6.8 IOPS] Random 4KiB (Q= 32, T=16): 2.950 MB/s [ 720.2 IOPS]",
