                "reviewText": "I\u2019m enjoying this line of USB sticks from Corsair as I have different sizes, basically increasing as my portable storage needs increase. This model is no different in that the build it\u2019s sealed where you could submerse this and not worry about it getting exposed to the water. I\u2019ve seen online tests where people have buried it and froze it and it\u2019s come back usable every time. The only thing I haven\u2019t tried is literal trial by fire and trying to see if it would survive one. While they\u2019ve shown tests of it being run over by a car, I haven\u2019t done that but I have accidentally dropped about 40 lbs on it and no physical damage to the casing and the stick itself still works great.As far as transfer rates, unless you\u2019re counting seconds or even milliseconds, it\u2019s relatively fast under USB 2.0 and on a 3.0 port extremely fast. If you\u2019re looking for something with a lot of portable storage space and is durable at the same time, this is worth considering. Highly recommended.",

For me, its good to know that I can chuck this in a bag and generally be careless with it and it'll basically be impossible to damage or kill.The waterproof seal seems great, and the solid metal construction seems a lot stronger than any other drives I have. Its great to have at least one drive that you can trust to not die on you.I use this as my boot/installation drive, and for backing up important docs that I definitely don't want to lose, and its great.",
