They're beautiful and I've ordered similar ones on Amazon years ago so when I found these on Amazon again, I ordered a bunch. Out of 13 drives, only 2 worked. The others wouldn't mount onto my computer and an error messages pops up saying I need to eject it. I tried repairing the drive through Disk Utility and that doesn't work. I called Amazon to get replacement drives and they were great. They sent me a replacement for all the ones that didn't work. But when I got the replacement ones in, they all don't work either! Garbage flash drives. So disappointed because they're so pretty.",

Functions as intended the light could be a bit brighter in well lit areas but in a dim room it looks so much better. Usb only lights up while files are being accessed its not consistently lit up, Lasted from February until October with on and off use at work.

That said, it looks outstanding and you will get constant comments and compliments on your \"sci fi\" drive. Good for speakers and such.",

The last 15 minutes, one woman tells us her \"story\" of the people who have influenced the woman she has become today. We then take a copy of the recording and trim it to that specific section; I save it to the flash drive and then give it to the woman to hand down to her family. Not only do her children/grandchildren learn about the influences in their mother/grandmother's life, they hear it told in her voice. They are absolutely floored by this gift.",
