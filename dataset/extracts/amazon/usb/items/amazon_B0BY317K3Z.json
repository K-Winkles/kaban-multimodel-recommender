Downloaded about 1550 tunes and took about 19 minutes to complete. Downloaded tunes in WMA and MP3 formats. Has about 14.8 GB available which is normal after formatting for a 16 GB flash drive.Only drawback was that the hole at the non-port end is too small for a keyring. Will have to find a small, heavy wire or rope string to tread through there. Think maybe a combination of the size or the angle of the hole.Overall all, happy with this purchase so far.",

The photos occupied about 8GB of space, so there really was no way I could email them to my friends who don't live in my city. I put each drive in an envelope and mailed it to each of my friends. It took up to 2 weeks to get to the last person. The USB drive was perfect for this purpose - not expensive, and with adequate storage.",
