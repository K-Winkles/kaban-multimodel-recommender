I am used to pushing the usb side out to plug into my tower, however, I am not disappointed to slide/move a shiny protective shield to one side to put into my tower. I like the lanyard. We have to squeeze the loop at the end together to push it through the opening on the flash drive. Like threding a needle, only easier. Surprisingly excellent job packaging them. Each seal/unseal bag has ten flash drives. It is quite a heavy box. There are fifty of them. Compared to the price I would have had to pay from other stores/sites, this is an excellent buy! I could have used CD's, then I would have had to buy jewel cases. I like these better. Have a great day!On another note, did you know there are prescriptions for us to get from a licensed medical doctor to stop drinking alcohol or stop smoking cigerattes. Mine works and my sister does not want to smoke cigerates.",
