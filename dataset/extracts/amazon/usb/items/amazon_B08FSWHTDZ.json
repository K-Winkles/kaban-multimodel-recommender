Thus, I'm giving a high score. High failure rate and extremely slow, but at this price for this capacity, what do you expect? They're a very good deal, just know what you're getting. If you want reliability or speed look elsewhere, if you feel quantity has a quality of its own, this is your product!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this flash drive specifically for using it to use as a boot device on a clean install of Windows 10 on my laptop. The USB drive is very tiny but packs a punch! First thing I did was format it to NTFS as it is formatted to FAT32 by default. The flash drive performed absolutely perfectly, plugged into my USB3.0 port. I can't say anything more other than it performs exactly as it should and is a great price. My only disappointment, is that the open end of the USB drive does not come with a cover to stop dust etc getting into it.",

I have not had the drives long enough to test their reliability over time, but had no corruption during the write phase, which I *have* had with other (more expensive) devices.If I remember, I will update the review after a long enough period of time goes by and the data is still in good shape.",
