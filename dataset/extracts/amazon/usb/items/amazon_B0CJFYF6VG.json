Love that I can tell Alexa, Show me the front door, and she shows me who is there while I'm working remote in the back room. So far, so good, and a friend saw them and bought the same setup too because she could see how easy it was to use. Great product so far, loving the ease of install and ease of use. Easier than Arlo, but then again, we did purchase Arlo a few years ago and technology keeps getting better. Time to replace with this Blink camera setup around the property. It stays connected.",
