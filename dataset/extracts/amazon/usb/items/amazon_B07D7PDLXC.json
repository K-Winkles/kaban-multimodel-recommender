                "reviewText": "I'm surprised by its performance, tested using agnostics, is almost the same as BAR Plus but with a shorter form factor. However, it's wider than BAR Plus which makes BAR Plus better for my uses as I have port layout that's too close to each other . So if you prefer a small form factor, high performance and reasonable cost USB Flash drive, FIT Plus is what I recommend. In my case because of the port layout, I'll stick with BAR Plus. Yes there are higher performance USB Flash drive but at more than twice the cost. Samsung FIT Plus and BAR Plus are the best value for the money as of Jan 2024.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent USB flash drive. Formatted to NTFS with 238GB available. Write speed for a 1GB file on a SuperSpeed USB 3.1 port was 105 MB/s and transfer was steady. Write speed for a 2GB file was around 65 MB/s and the speed fluctuated. These are excellent speeds for a tiny flash drive. The build quality feels premium and will not crack like my Sandisk Fit did shortly after purchase. No complaints other than I wish it was available in a 512GB capacity. For a sale price of $20 you can not beat this. If you need insane speed, I also have the Samsung Shield T7 and it transfers at more than 1000MB/s!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this and Samsung's blue \"USB Type C\" drive at the same time. They both tested nearly identically (very good sequential reads, ok sequential writes, and decent random writes). These make good storage drives, but what's especially unique is the random write performance which will allow you to run an OS decently enough on them compared to most USB drives.If I had known they performed identically I would have gotten more of these Fit Plus instead of those blue Type C ones since these are much more compact. Unless you need the USB C interface, get these instead",
