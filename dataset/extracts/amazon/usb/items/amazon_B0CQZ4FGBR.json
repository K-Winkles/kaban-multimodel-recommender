                "reviewText": "I got the RecovStick FlashDrive as a universal thumb drive to manually backup and sync my devices. It has a unique way of using three types of USB connectors. The USB-C is available as a USB-A to USB-C plug. On the thumb drive itself, the USB-A body opens up to reveal a Micro USB plug. I used this side of the flash drive to connect to my PC and my Android phones. On the other end of the flash drive is the lightning plug for Apple devices.The device works well and the 64GB space is just right for moving files or even create a Live drive for operating systems. The only problem I ran into is that the USB-C connector has a wide head which prevents the flash drive sliding into the USB-C socket easily since I protect my mobile devices with a cover. I had to remove the cover and then the flash drive fitted into the mobile phone snugly. A small annoyance, but worth the extra effort.",

This high compatibility allows you to easily transfer data between devices without cables.The application of this USB flash drive in iPhone/iPad needs to work with a \u201ci-FlashDevice HD\u201d App that can be installed from App Store or iOS App. When the flash drive is used in Android phone, just turn on the OTG function to access the data from the flash drive through file management.",

I can also backup my contacts too. I also love how it gets rid of duplicates so that provides more space. It is 64 GB so that can hold a lot of pictures. This is much better to me than the cloud because I can now have all my pictures on one device instead of some on my computer and some on my phone. I also love that it was not that difficult to use. I am not that good in tech stuff but I was able to do this . It definitely serves my purpose and I am happy with it. I give it five stars. I also think it is a great value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the idea of this drive! I needed a new drive to transfer data between computers with USB 2.0 and US B c ports for work, and figured I could also use it to store pictures and other items from my phone to have an external storage backup. This seemed like the perfect unit to do all these things.The Good: It does what it says it will do with an adapter to go from USB 2.0 to USB c, and a separate port to use on an I-phone, (it's the older connector, not the new proprietary I-phone connector, so new I-phone owners beware). The drive is roomy, (though a few Gigs short of the manufacturer's claim of 64 gigs as you can see from the picture), and the transfer rate on USB 2.0 ran between 13 and 20 MB/s which is better than what I was getting with my old travel drive. The transfer rate using the USB c adapter was a little better, but not much. The unit is VERY well constructed and seems solid.The not so good. When I first plugged in the drive, it registered 58.5 Gigs of storage space, but when I went to transfer 2.6 gigs of data, I suddenly got an error message that the drive was full at 1.6 gigs, and could not hold any more. I did a drive reformat which SEEMS to have resolved the issue, but it was odd, and gives me concern that there might be future issues. I also got a couple of random error messages during the initial upload that files were having difficulty transferring and I needed to try again. After the re-format, when I went to upload the same data, everything worked just fine.I also found the slider, though it made an audible \"click\" when sliding from the I-phone connector to the USB 2.0, was very loose, and prone to sliding with the least amount of pressure. this made it awkward to try to slide the drive into a USB 2.0 port, and also awkward for sliding into an I-phone device. I had to physically hold the tab on the slider in place to keep it from moving, and even then, it was challenging to plug the unit into either port. The USB c adapter does keep the slider from moving once it is seated on the USB 2.0 port, but putting it on was also awkward cause \"sliders gonna slide\".I also wish the manufacturer had included some kind of small case or bag to keep the pieces in. These are small parts and could be easily lost.With a few adjustments, this product could be amazing. Right now, it's just passable.",

                "reviewText": "The best thing about this flash drive is all the different connections it offers. It worked as expected on my pc and android devices. The iPhone I tested it on is very old (it's a 4s) and an app download was required to be able to use it. One thing to be aware of is depending on your device's case, you might not be able to plug this in without taking the case off. It's not like plugging in a charging cable because this is almost an inch wide. I was unable to use it on my iPad or iPhone without removing the case first.",
