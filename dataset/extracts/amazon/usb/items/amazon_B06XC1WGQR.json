                "reviewText": "This is an excellent storage solution on the go, and as someone with enough USB Type C and Type A devices, the convenience is a godsend that can't be matched by cables. Moreover, the SanDisk Memory Zone app is simple and works well, which surprised me because in the past I've thought SanDisk utilities were little help and annoying to use. I liked it so much and it was simple enough to use that I got one for my dad to use with his Android phone and laptop. I paid $22 for 128 GB, which is a good storage deal in 2019 IF all the specs listed are met...HOWEVER this is where I'm sorely disappointed. The read speeds are near advertised and acceptable, but the write speeds are far slower at about less than a third of what's advertised. Moreover, the drive gets concerningly hot, particularly when it is being used in Type C mode. However, both read and write speeds are a touch faster in Type C mode as well and makes me call into question the buses used to interface with the memory, if the drive really is USB 3.1. When I plug it into my computer, the disk label reads 3.0, so I'm not sure whether they marketed the information or labeled it incorrectly. Moreover, there was a rumour that this drive is actually a micro SD card slotted into a dual adapter they've rigged up, which I could believe due to the sad write performance of the drive. Not in the mood to crack it open and break it to find out, but I definitely will once it fails.SanDisk has a reputation and it kinda makes me sad to see a product miss the advertised marks this badly. As someone in tech, I keep an eye on the specs and rely on them to be true to the device which is why it frustrates me so much when a legitimate company makes mistakes and flat out lies like this. It makes me not want to give them money.So why did I rate it 4 stars?Because I'll be damned if this isn't the best flash drive I've owned, lies and all. I've been waiting for this type of drive for a while and most reputed companies haven't put one of them out yet, probably because the technology isn't good enough to have consistent enough quality in speed, which apparently SanDisk isn't bothered with ;) The convenience and the huge amount of storage for $20 on a drive that will actually work on all of my devices at a decent pace is too much of an allure to pass up. As long as the file isn't too big and I use this as a casual, day to day drive as most people will, this will work well enough. Moreover, the app is so dead simple and convenient for even the tech illiterate to use. May still want to attach to a cable for those 4K videos though.Speeds in my pictures were collected using CrystalDiskMark. Faster speeds collected through USB-C Thunderbolt interface on same machine as the USB-A test, run on 3.1.",
