After updated iOS 16.3, Apple ID support security keys (they need 2 key\u2019s when registered). This key works great. That is really nice.

                "reviewText": "It's well built and looked like it would be usable. Unfortunately, the instructions are VERY unclearly written (actually put into a YouTube video running at 3X speed) that even when you step through them slowly, give directions that do not match the Windows 10 / Google software that I'm using. Wasted about an hour trying to figure out how to get it to work, and came to the conclusion that it doesn't really solve any of my security concerns anyway; it's just one more layer of security that is cumbersome to use and not worth the expense or the effort. In addition, caused my computer to lock up requiring a reboot. Returning.",
