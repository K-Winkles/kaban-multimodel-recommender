                "reviewText": "I was a bit wary of purchasing these thumb drives, but thought for such a great price and with PRIME guarantee, it was a safe bet. I'm very glad I did. I was looking for thumb drives that would hold pictures of athletic events for family members, so if the coaching support staff didn't return them, I wouldn't be out a ton of $$.. I guess some think what's 1 thumb drive cost, but it ads up quickly when you're taking photos of each event over a season! At any rate, I'm not technically adept enough to give numbers from tests ran but can say that I format them before use and easily set up folders for the week holding several hundred photos I take with my Nikon camera, not my cell. I'm able to put a couple thousand so far, and haven't tested the upper limits. I was super impressed with what it can hold and the speed of transferring the files and displaying them was extremely fast. Sorry this isn't technical but I would highly recommend purchasing them, and actually posted this review as I came back to look at the price again to reorder for the holidays. **Update**June 2023 - like these so much for the quality and cost, came back for more! Highly recommend.",
