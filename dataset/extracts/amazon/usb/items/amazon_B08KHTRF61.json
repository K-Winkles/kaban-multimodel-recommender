                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The absolute best inexpensive ($5.50) 32GB USB flash drive I've found yet.",
                "reviewText": "So far this is the king of the inexpensive flash drives I've found. Advantages include:- Unlike most vendor claims, the actual sequential read times exceed the claims. Kingston claims \"200MB/s\" but the read times are \"conservative\" and even exceed that if the read operations are large enough. Only when you start getting below 64K reads or so do the numbers drop below that, but people tend to use large files (like images, which are usually at least 1MB for reasonable photos and scans).- Of course the write times are never going to match the read times, because even in ideal circumstances where flash blocks are fully re-written, there's still this \"erase entire block\" followed by writing to each page in the block. So flash is inherently limited on writes, but these are respectable when writing large contiguous files.- As you can see in the second screenshot, random access is still amazingly good for 256K reads and larger, but it starts dropping off dramatically after that. Trying to write many small blocks in random locations is always going to be absolutely abysmal because when you write less than a full block, the USB stick has to erase an entire block, copy the pages you are not changing, then write your tiny number of pages. But this doesn't matter too much since people don't normally use these drives for highly random small write operations (as might occur on an OS system drive where the OS wants to write to lots of log files and such all the time).- The USB info returns clean sane values. Unlike the amazing \"ProductCode\" drive from that iconic household name brand \"VendorC\", the USB vendor and product strings in this drive contain worthwhile terms for correctly identifying what device you just inserted. The numeric product and vendor codes also correctly identify the actual vendor brand printed on the device as well as the product name.- The drives are also made of metal and are not going to get smashed easily by books and such being set on them.- The metal construction also helps dissipate heat, and these drives don't heat up like crazy unlike all of the little mini-drives that I've seen. While they might be 3 times as long as those, they are as thin or thinner than most of them.These are perfect for situations where you need to hand out some drives, but don't need more than 32GB on each drive. They can also be had for as little as $5.50 or so from some sellers. If you have to pay more than that then you will be better off to get a decent brand of 64GB.So if you want some small and inexpensive drives for whatever reason, like handing out bootable \"live\" OS installs, or just a lot of photo/video/music files, but don't want to spend much money, these things look like you're best bet. At least I haven't found anything better yet for this price.The amount of crappy drives out there, even from recognizable brands, is really a huge shame. But these are great and I'm not surprised that Kingston has no problem claiming credit for them.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews, usually my bad buys are my own lack of research or such, but when I needed a few usb flash drives to help transfer some PowerPoints and slides to a few people, I saw these Kingston DataTraveler Kyson 32GB High Performance USB 3.2 Metal Flash Drives at a good price, and made the purchase.Well, after people got what they needed, they gave them back, one I put in my scrub top and didn't think about it until my wife handed it to me this morning, explaining she head it clicking around in the dryer when she went to check the dryer. Well, the flash drive, as well as the laundry was dry, and knowing nothing was on it that couldn't be duplicated, I just plugged it in to see, and I'll be darned, this Kingston drive loaded right up. I transferred some non important files to it just to test, and it worked very well.I don't know or care about advertised speeds, they always vary, but a little survivability is very nice, because I've lost function of more expensive drives for much less egregious treatment.Anyway, don't do this, but maybe this can help someone feel confident in their purchase.",

And to my surprise, it offered half the speed (read) about 250+ MB/s. I choose Kingston over SanDisk Ultra Dual due to the speeds. Believe me a 50 MB/s difference will make a huge impact. If you are looking for a Type-C interface, don't use a Type-C OTG convertor on Type-A drives, go for SanDisk Ultra Dual Type-C (dedicated port) or you will lose the good speeds. I wasn't able to find Type-C on Kingston.",

For anyone who specifically still has a need for USB small capacity thumbsticks these are a decent option for performance/size.Obviously a portable NVME SSD will blow these out of the water in every single measureable metric, Cost per GB, Read/Wrtie/Random speeds and capacity. So if youre needs are fastest transfers of largest volumes of data and cost effectiveness, dont even think about these thumbsticksIf you NEED something even smaller 8/16GB, then you are going to find that you can only get your hands on really old stuff thats super slow like 5 MB/s write and 25 MB/s read, which is painful now that we have NVMEs that are in the 7000+ MB/s and Im not even talkign about PCIE 5.0This is a great middle ground for tasks that dont specifically fit into smaller or larger capacity category, for example Windows/Linux bootable USBsRead Speed around 230 MB/s, which is greatWrite Speed is very difficult to quantify and not so great. If you just do a test using crystaldiskmark like I did it shows you around 87MB/sBut you never actually see that in any real world use. Copying one large file over 500MB, I am seeing it start slow then ramp up to around 25-30 MB/s. I dont knwo how Crystaldisk gets 87MB/sSo even though in the grand scheme of things they are not good at all in terms of \u00a3's per Gigabyte (I just bought a FOUR THOUSAND GB WD BLACK SN850X NVME for \u00a3200!) and they dont really have much useable storage you may or may not be able to fit ONLY ONE 4k Bluray ripped movie onto this 32GB stick,I still give this 4 stars because in its niche use these days, it's still pretty decent compared to other generic SIMILIAR format products on the market.",
