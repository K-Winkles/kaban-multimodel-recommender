USB storage thumb drive can be used with keychain.Lightweight and portable.Compact and sturdy, and the Class-A chip ensures stable and fast data transmission.Suitable for data storage, transmission and sharing.Including music, photos, pictures, movies, video files, working files, programs, presentations, learning handouts and more.Plug and Play. No need to install any software.USB 2.0 connection. Compatible with Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 10, MacOS / Linux, etc. Compatible with all devices with USB-A ports such as desktops, laptops, tablets, TVs, speakers.Tips on flash drive capacity:The manufacturer of the USB flash drive uses a decimal calculation method to indicate the storage capacity of the flash drive, that is 1GB=1000MB.But in the world of computers, storage capacity is calculated in binary, 1GB = 1024MB.So there are some differences between display capacity and listed capacity of flash memory product:listed 32GB is about 29GB-31GB on the PC,listed 64GB is about 58GB-60GB,listed 128GB is about 116GB-123GBIf you have any questions, please contact us.

The carabiner clip comes in handy to secure onto an attachment inside my laptop bag to keep from losing it. Really like that that the USB connector flips up to make it more compact and keep debris out of it.",
