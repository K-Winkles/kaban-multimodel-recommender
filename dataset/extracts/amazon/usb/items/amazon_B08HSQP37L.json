                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a 3-pack of these SanDisk Ultra 32GB flash drives. They have a nice compact design that slides easily onto a keychain or in a pocket. The USB 3.0 interface means fast data transfer speeds when using USB 3.0 ports.However, I was disappointed to find the write speeds limited to USB 2.0 speeds, even when plugged into USB 3.0 ports. Saving large files seems to crawl compared to reads. There is also no LED activity light, so you don't know when data is transferring.That said, the read speeds are fast, allowing quick access to media and documents. The drives feel well-constructed and sturdy. And you can't beat getting 3 drives for the price.Overall, the drives work reliably and I'd purchase them again for the convenience of having multiple flash drives. But the slow write speeds and lack of activity indicator prevent this from being a 5 star product. I'm taking off 1 star for those shortcomings, so 4 stars from me.",
