I\u2019ve asked around and finally someone mentioned this key. My mind is blown. It did take awhile to figure out and I didn\u2019t think it worked but much of it was because I was trying to YouTube it was to something specific on my computer which only complicated things more as they weren\u2019t exactly what I was trying to do but it did help with the boot and getting to the screen I needed after that I got the understanding and read the instructions.
