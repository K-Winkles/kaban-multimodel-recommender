                "reviewText": "There are many reviews complaining these don't work in embedded devices, but they're using 64+ GB disks. I specifically chose these 32GBs as the upper-limit to the CD player in the car.Write speed is low as others will mention. Some day 1MB/s, I see more than that but I see a bunch of big writes and big pauses. This is NOT the worst flash drive I've ever owned for write speed. It will be slower than uploading something, yes. Speed will go up and down inconsistently. Be sure to only let 1 thing write at a time, pause other copies or wait or use a file copy manager. See pic for what not to do, see up and down graphs.Putting this in a Kenwood CD player, on Shuffle All (shuffle folder & track), skips \"instantly\" to the next track, like quicker than a CD changing track. This is sufficient read speed for a few MP3s.I can't speak to the fake capacity issues others are having, I've written 29GB to this without noticing an overwrite loop yet. I can't speak to longevity, but I appreciate the other reviewers mentioning short-term failure. I'll be sure to use these for recreational things only, not as backups.",
