They have a great read/write speed, and so far as I can tell, they're of standard construction, and will have good durability. The price is cheap enough to consider them disposable, or lendable (even to less than reliable friends).Color coded, but you can attach a small sticky label for identification, if you'd like.Highly recommended. I just bought a small pocketful.",
