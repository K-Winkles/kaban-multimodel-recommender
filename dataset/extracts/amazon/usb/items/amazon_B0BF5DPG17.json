                "reviewText": "The package came quickly and well packaged. Upon opening I was a bit surprised on the lightness of the actual device. The carrying case is solid and offers a decent protection to the equipment within. The device optic's cable is long enough for my purposes, and is rigid enough to maintain a lock on the image. The images are amazing considering the size of the lens. The flashlight at the tip is quite bright and does an amazing job at lighting up the area around the target. Having a second camera arranged at a 90degree angle is a nice touch when trying to get a better perspective on the area being observed, can be used to hunt around while locking in on target.I have now recorded several images which is a powerful capability, I have yet to determine the video benefit as it relates to my individual purposes but does perform well, almost as good as the images taken.Overall I would say that this is an amazing little device that I plan to use for multiple functions, including working behind walls as well as automotive work.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a real drag to be living in a modern, hi-tech world in a home with an electric supply that\u2019s from another time. This incredibly useful little product changed all that for me and supercharged my world with power to spare no more spreading devices out all over the apartment and having to unplug a lamp to charge a phone etc\u2026 this simple, inexpensive power supply is one of the most practical and useful upgrades I have ever made to my home\u2026seriously. No need for plug \u201cblocks\u201d-usb ports are built right in. The cost of those plug \u201cblocks\u201d alone is way more than the cost of this outlet extension- and you get a lot more than that with the standard 3 prong plugs that are on every side and allow for a tangle free, sensible approach to your charging needs and helps to bring your home into the modern age. You won\u2019t really know how much you needed this until you have it.",

                "reviewText": "Review for 10ft cord, white. Just set this up. I really like it. I was able to organize all my wires for my laptop and extra monitor and plug in my iPhone, and various Apple charging earphones neatly. Set it up right on my desk stashed behind the monitor with easy access and it does not take up much space. No more crawling on the floor to plug in stuff. No more dust bunnies collecting on a rats nest of wires on the floor. What is not obvious but a real plus is a shut off switch on the side with a very dim green indicator light . other products have annoying bright lights and multiple shutoff's which are ridiculous. The plug has an offset right angle so you save space beside furniture and can plug something else into your wall outlet. Prior to getting this i had an old school power strip. the wires were all over the place with charging cubes 10ft phone charge wires etc. I was able to eliminate all that mess. I found various original charging wires that came with Apple devices including USB C for my 13 and was able to use shorter original equipment wires for all these gadgets. I took the time to twist tie excess wires and use rubber bands to hold excess wire for laptop and monitor. looks really neat and organized now. The one thing I wish it had was some non skid rubber feet or something however once i strapped all the excess wires with rubber bands around the contraption it added weight and resistance from the bands and the thing stays put on my table that i use to work remotely on. I guess you could find some product to glue rubber feet if you don't want to just screw this to your wall or side of desk. Oh yes, it has holes on the back to attach to a wall or workstation. Well designed, practical and functional. I have been using it for a few hours now and it gives off zero heat. So long as this thing keeps working.....I really like it. I like it so much I just ordered 9 more, 3 I will use for additional work stations and 6 for stocking stuffers.",
