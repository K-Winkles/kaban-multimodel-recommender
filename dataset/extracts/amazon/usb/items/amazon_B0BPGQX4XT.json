                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I thought if you slid the grey notch to the middle - that both connectors would be inside the flash drive casing and not poke out with the possibility of any damage like getting water or dust in them, having them bend or snap off entirely - however I was wrong. Obviously if you have it slid out all the way on either end would have the entire connector out of the casing to be able to plug into a device, however sliding it in the middle does not in fact protect either protruding connector whatsoever, and it does NOT come with any sort of case unless you use the box it was shipped in. Using the box is also risky though - the lid comes off very easily, so while traveling or storing it safely you would have to tape it closed each time you use it and pray the lid doesn\u2019t fall off and don\u2019t lose your flash drive with all of its contents because of this system. This is a huge bummer for me since the entire point of keeping important documents/photos/videos/etc stored on a flash drive is to be portable when traveling because I can\u2019t take my entire desktop setup with me, I like to keep my flash drives connected to a lanyard so I don\u2019t loose them. While prime shipping is fast, if I had known this would be an issue with no protection, I would have spent a little more on a 1TB flash drive that DID have a protection system of some kind instead. Now I have to spend even more time looking for a case that allows me to safely and securely travel with these (I bought both the green and purple versions) so that\u2019ll be more expensive in the long run that just spending that little bit more originally on a 1TB flash drive that had protection, as well as saving time of searching for a case that\u2019ll work. You get what you pay for though I suppose. It DID have all the port connectors I needed as well as the large amount of storage I also needed, with the benefit of coming in pretty colors, and it was cheaper than most others I was finding - and that price tag shows with the sheer lack of protection needed for such priceless and irreplaceable information that could very easily be lost or broken, therefore making anything you store on it in a constant state of risk of losing it all. The 3 stars were earned by the storage level, colors, and number of port connections compatibility - however, it lost 2 stars for the lack of protection that now forces me to spend more time looking for a portability solution, as well as having to spend even more money to do so. If I could give 2 and 1/2 star\u2019s positive and 2 and 1/2 stars negative I would. If I could go back in time to save time and money, I would just buy a slightly more expensive flash drive with all the features I needed instead - the price was the main reason I picked this flash drive over the other ones I was also contemplating. I suppose if looking for a positive side to not return them would be that odds are I can probably find a cute case/holder to hang them on my lanyard in, instead of having a boring/plain looking flash drive just dangling from my lanyard. So overall I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product, but I wouldn\u2019t tell people to NOT buy it. Purely neutral, I would tell them what I said in this review and not convince them of either side/choice. There are both pros and cons with this product.",
