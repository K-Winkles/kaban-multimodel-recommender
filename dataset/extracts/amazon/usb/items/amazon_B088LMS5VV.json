                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars First one defective, but replacement works great.",
                "reviewText": "This is a pretty nice 3.0 USB. This is a great thumb drive to have for if you need a quick transfer of larger files or a back up for pictures and videos. The first one I received unfortunately did not want to stay connected to my PC. I thought maybe it was my computer but after receiving the replacement it worked beautifully. It does have a small loop I would say you could be a string through so you can put this on your keys or on a lanyard. The major down side of doing this is that the metal is very easy to scratch. Just a few seconds with your keys pressing against and you will notice the scratches on it so be aware of that. The thumb drive itself fits pretty well into the slot and will not be easily unplugged. It is not too thick where it will take up more than one slot so you can easily plug this in other devices if needed. The turning mechanism of the USB thumb drive is pretty sturdy so it will not just turn from the head weight of the thumb drive or by accident. Another thing I will note about this product is that it is relatively big compared to many other thumb drives on the market. Again the silver like layer is also very easy to scratch so know that if you are going to put these on your keys. It is thin enough where it will not take up too much space. I did do a test and verified that this thumb drive indeed has 128 gigabyte capacity and the transfer speed is not too bad. The writing speed was about 64 MB/s and the reading speed was 45 MB/s which is okay for a 3.0 USB drive. I would say that it all varies as well on the port you plug into as well. You have plenty of space to work with and transferring should not take too long, but you may be able to fill up 64 gb pretty quickly. I Overall this is a nice thumb drive to have for storing pictures and videos but be aware with the sizes of videos and pictures you may actually fill this up pretty fast. Compared to other usb 3.0 thumb drives, it has okay transfer speed. Again it is a nice side USB drive to have to store photos and family videos for long term. A down side of this product is that the swivel actually becomes really loose after running the device for long periods. I think it is from the heat and the gear. It became really loose to the point it would not close again.",
