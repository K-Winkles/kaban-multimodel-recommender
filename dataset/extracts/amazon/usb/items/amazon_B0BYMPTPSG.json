                "reviewText": "This was just was the doctor ordered for backup storage media. We recently had a PC give up the ghost and it nearly took a TON of valuable data with it - \"someone\" had neglected backing up her stuff. It took me weeks to salvage her data off the dying HDD. Now, we've made one of the thumb drives her go-to backup and gotten her into the habit of automatically saving copies of work to the thumb drive, so if the desktop PC checks out unexpectedly, the data will be safe.",

When you change the format to FAT32 or even NTFS, it slows the data transfer speed to a crawl. I put the exFAT format back on and it works at a normal usb 2.0Please Note:1. 1GB = 1024MB. Some capacity not available for data storage.2: Some of the listed capacity on a Flash storage device is used for formatting and other functions and thus is not available for data storage.As such, the actual available capacity for data storage is less than what is listed on the products.3: FAT32 is factory default drive format, which is read/write compatible with Windows and Mac OS;while NTFS is compatible with Windows but semi-compatible with Mac OS. Please format it properly if need.",
