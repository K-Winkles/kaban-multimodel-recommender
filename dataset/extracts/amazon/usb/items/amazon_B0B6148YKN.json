                "reviewText": "After I began editing down large amounts of video footage into usable material I realized I needed an immediate solution so work could continue without me having to get a brand new storage drive for my computer. I purchased a few of these sticks and suddenly I can store over a terabyte of data.Easy to use plug and play functionality, does what it says on the box, and has pretty fast write and read speeds. Am I going to upgrade my work PC in the future to support multiple heavy duty storage drives? Yep. Do I have to spend hundreds of dollars doing it right this moment? No!Worth noting, this was the second high capacity flash drive I tried. Won't mention the other brand, but it was garbage. Write/read speeds were abysmal, and its true storage capacity was much less than it stated on the packaging. Also was around the same price as one of these. Save yourself the time and hassle and just grab as many of these little guys as you need for your data storage needs.",

                "reviewText": "Los productos de marca blanca de Amazon siempre son una garant\u00eda de calidad, puede que no ofrezcan el mejor resultado, pero no ser\u00e1n malos. En este caso tenemos una memoria de 256gb fabricada en Taiw\u00e1n. El embalaje es muy sencillo, estando la memoria encajada en un peque\u00f1o bl\u00edster de pl\u00e1stico blanco, que a su vez esta insertado en una cajita de cart\u00f3n, todo ocupando muy poco y relativamente minimalista. El acabado del pendrive es de pl\u00e1stico pero bien rematado y aunque est\u00e1 hecha de materiales sencillos y baratos, se siente de calidad. En este aspecto no hay pega. La memoria es retr\u00e1ctil, teniendo un bot\u00f3n deslizante que al presionar y mover hacia delante asoma el conector USB y presionando el bot\u00f3n hacia atr\u00e1s oculta el conector USB. Como se habr\u00e1 visto en las fotos este conector es de tipo USB-A. No he tenido ning\u00fan problema de sobrecalentamiento. En cuanto a las velocidades USB 3.1, la velocidad de lectura es elevada, no as\u00ed la de escritura. Normalmente inicia la escritura a una velocidad relativamente elevada, pero tras unos 10-15 segundos decae de forma notoria. En fin, por el precio no est\u00e1 mal. No es de una calidad y prestaciones excepcionales, pero por apenas 20\u20ac a finales del 2023 tienes 256gb, que da para bastante.",
