Previously I had been using a 160GB IDE drive in a USB enclosure and that was bulky with a lot of extra cords. I picked this flash drive specifically for the low-profile design so as to not block the neighboring USB port. Works great so far, and I can have this drive and a Skylanders portal plugged in at the same time.Note: It does not work together with the Traptanium portal because the portal needs too much power. The Wii is finicky with USB hubs but I found a powered USB hub in my box-o-stuff that the portal works in.",

The most recent time I ended up using one, I got impatient enough to get something better.The C222 was very inexpensive in a five-pack, it's built in my favorite form factor for thumb drives - no slides to break or caps to lose - and my initial impression of the drive is positive.The benchmarked speed is far from groundbreaking, but it's actually considerably better than I was expecting based on another user's review, especially the write speeds. And it's much faster than those old USB2 drives.(Note that this is the 64GB version, which is rated for 100MB/s sequential reads, while higher capacities are rated for 140MB/s.)",

Their low profile allows me to keep the flash drive in the laptop continuously without fear of breakage and the set of five with 128GB of storage allows me keep each job on a separate flash drive with easy swap out. The low profile and fast access and transfer speeds make these ideal to use. I just wish I would have bought another set while they were on sale.My only complaint is that the mini's are so doggone small that they are easy to misplace. If you purchase these, I strongly suggest that you purchase a case that stores multiple USB flash drives.This is definitely an item I will purchase again even at full price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought my first flash drive about 20 years ago .. It had a capacity of 15 MB (no need to laugh! that's 3 floppy disks! There were a lot of programs and text files in there!) In \"used\" condition and for about 20 dollars ..Since then, I have used perhaps more than 20 flash. Very different. And now on my desk, in boxes and pockets, there are 4 or 5 different USB flash drives.Why do I need another one?I have never come across asymmetrical flash drives.You are probably VERY familiar with this - insert, no, rotate, no, rotate again, NO, look closer, rotate again - oh, inserted! Maybe I didn't look for it on purpose, but I didn't come across it.This flash drive is not symmetrical. If you inserted it into your laptop once (foto), it is remembered and you no longer need to determine which side to insert another time.In addition, it is made gracefully, simply beautiful.I could not pass by, I bought 10 pieces and in a couple of months I gave almost everything to my friends. And each time it brought a joyful smile :)Yes, it seems to be such a trifle.Since USB 3.0 appeared, I do not pay much attention to \"technical parameters\". Almost all flash drives are made with high quality. (If you didn't buy them at the keychain sale, 1 terabyte, 7 pieces for $1). Speed defines port 3.0 or 2.0. And the flash drive resource (I don\u2019t use it every day) will last for a very long time, I will lose it earlier or give it to someone.God bless the Engineer and Artist who came up with and made this design.Thank you.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Great Price - (RUNS VERY HOT) Beware the 512GB C162",
                "reviewText": "These little C162 128GB flash drives are very economical. I generally use Samsung FIT Plus flash drives and stock up when they are on sale. I couldn't resist buying these little TEAMGROUP C162 drives as the price was very low in comparison to the Samsung drives. One thing I noted right away is Windows reports a total capacity of 116GB for these and 120GB for the Samsung FIT Plus drives. Neither the slightly reduced capacity nor slower speeds are a deal breaker. These are certainly much faster than the best USB 2.0 drives but relatively slow for a 3.0 or 3.1 drive. I'm okay with the speed considering the cost. I'll be using them for storage only and for the inevitable loaner drive(s). I expect you know the typical coworker or friend I'm referring to here. He or she often needs files to take home but NEVER has a flash drive with them to use. My experience with this is, I NEVER get my flash drives back. I'd much rather loan (lose) one of these than a more expensive drive. As far as longevity and data retention goes, only time will tell. All things considered, I'm content with my purchase thus far.UPDATE 3/30/23: I've bought several more since my review and they have a concerning issue with heat.While writing a 120GB OS image, they will get hot enough to burn your fingers. I've had this happen literally every time I've written a large image to these drives. It's not a fluke and could be a potential problem. I'm usually gently wiping the exposed metal with a damp sponge while writing large images.I've noticed all brands will generate heat while writing a large image. These get far hotter than anything else I've used thus far. So far, my efforts to keep them cooled down seem to work well.It's not very convenient to have to cool the drives during a long write process but I feel it's necessary. They will generate some heat even when copying smaller files, but nothing compared to what happens when you are doing a 45 minute plus read or write process. I am not giving up on them by any means, but I will continue to put in the extra effort to keep them cooler when reading or writing large images. So far, I have not experienced any data loss. I hope it stays that way. I still recommend these because of the low cost. Just be aware they can get extremely hot.UPDATE 8/24/23: I tried two of the 512GB C162 models to run a Linux OS from. Both started out with reasonable write speeds. Both had their write speeds reduced to approximately 10% of their original speeds after writing a 256GB image to them. I've never seen anything like this happen, so I thought the first drive was just a bad drive. The second drive exhibited the exact same issues. Something is being damaged within this particular size and model while writing the large image to them. This doesn't happen on the 64GB through 256GB models although they all get overly hot. I may buy more in sizes of 256GB and under but, I'll never buy another 512GB capacity of the C162 model. These two can still be used as storage assuming I can live with USB 2.0 (or less) write speeds. The 512GB versions of C162 are totally useless for what I bought them for.I'm lowering my rating to one star, and I feel that is generous for the 512GB version.",
