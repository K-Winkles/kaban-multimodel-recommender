Not the USB 2.0 drives also in this product listing.Thumb drives are a commodity for the most part so looking at performance vs price is my metric. I wanted a set of assorted color drives to use in my IT practice to carry around various bootable tools including various version of portable Windows. This pack was exactly what I needed and they perform very well for my purpose.I ran a CrystalDiskMark on one of these in a USB 3.0 port on my laptop. Sequential reads were just under 110MBs which is about 2.5X what I get from a USB 2.0 drive, so USB 3.0 performance for sure. Random reads were less than 1/20th of the sequential reads at about 5.5MBs. Writing for sequential and random writes was *much* slower than reads.So what does this mean in my \"real world\" assessment? These drives are mostly reading files sequentially. After creating them there will be a lot of reading and very little writing to them. In other words they are well suited for my techie needs. Other applications where these might shine are to store or as a backup for music or photos where you write once or when you add more media and read a bunch more than you write.These are not the fastest USB 3.0 drives I've owned by quite a bit. There are some very fast thumb drives! But generally speed comes at a price and these are very inexpensive for USB 3.0 32GB drives. Construction is typical for economical thumb drives which isn't bad. I expect these will hold up to lots and lots of plugging and unplugging.In conclusion what matters to me is value and for their low price they give me everything I'm looking for. If you are looking for a good drive at a low price this may be an excellent choice. If your priority is a super-fast thumb drive and you're willing to spend more, then maybe not. Since they hit the mark exactly for me I'm giving this 5 pack of thumb drives 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I have a massive collection of USB 2.0 drives, but almost all of my USB 3.0 flash drives are of the extremely high capacity variety (128GB+). Paradoxically, that makes the USB 3.0 drives I have not all that suitable for some of the small tasks I need to do. I figured that I would find some cheap 16 or 32GB drives to use as bootable devices. A little searching brought me to the KOOTION 5 X 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drives.It's been my experience that you never know what you're going to get when you move away from name-brand flash drives. Historically, I've typically stuck to a small grouping of major manufacturers. In this case, I was willing to try off brands. The main thing to worry about is performance. Some manufacturers straight up lie about what interface the flash drive has. Some publish bogus performance statistics. With the KOOTION drives, I was able to verify that the interface in use is indeed USB 3.0. Better still, I measured decent performance from the drive!When I tout good performance, it's good to be realistic about what you're going to get for less than $5, per drive. This is not going to be a device that maxes out the USB 3.0 interface. The KOONTIONs do manage a maximum STR of ~125MB/s, in reads. They manage 50-75MB/s in reads, too. While there are certainly better performing flash drives, I've never seen a CHEAP USB 3.0 drive that manages anything like the write rate on these flash drives. So... blazing fast? No. Quick enough? Yes.With the aluminum, swinging KOOTION drives look an awful lot like freebie flash drives from 2006, so there is some dissonance when dealing with the performance. I like the drives and highly recommend them for light, general purpose use.",
