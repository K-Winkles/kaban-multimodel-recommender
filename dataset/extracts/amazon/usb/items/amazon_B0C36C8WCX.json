If your IOS device is with a lightning port, It is not compatible with our SD301. If your IOS device is with type C port, our SD301 can compatible with it well directly. You can first connect the C port of your phone, find and open the \"Files\" App, and then click \"Browse\", \"SSK SD301\" will appear so that you can start to use it. Is it normal for the product to heat up during use? This memory stick is a portable solid state flash drive, the speed is faster a lot than ordinary flash drive, and it is made of metal material, which has better thermal conductivity, so that the heat will be much more than the ordinary flash drive. Your hands may feel a little hot, but this is normal. This situation will not affect your use, nor will it damage the data. Our products have gone through a series of sophisticated tests, which is safety enough in normal using. Why can't SD301 be recognized on a smartphone? How to solve it? First, please go to check the flash drive\u2019s format, please make sure it is EXFAT, if it is not EXFAT, please format it first (Before formatting, please backup all your data);Second, please go to check whether the OTG function is enabled, most of OPPO's mobile phones need to manually open the OTG function. Only when the OTG function is enabled, the data transmission of external devices can be carried out. So you need to turn on the OTG function of your phone. The details can be found on Youtube. You can search for \"How to Enable OTG Connection on OPPO Developer Options\" on Youtube. Why does the write speed of SD301 drop when I write to large files at once? Writing large-capacity files at one time,the write speed will decline is a common problem of most solid-state drives. Even solid state drives produced by well-known companies also have this problem, which is a technical problem, not a problem of our product itself. If you want to maintain a high write speed, it is recommended that you do not write more than 1/4 of the remaining usable capacity at one time. For example, when the USB SSD drive has 600GB available capacity left, you can transfer data less than 150GB at a time, the speed will not drop.

I hope this does not limit its lifetime.I got this drive to back up my Linux laptop. I repartitioned and reformatted it to an ext4 file system with no problems. It mounts quickly and works perfectly with all my software.",

Some people might not care for the extra weight of this flash drive in their pocket. Its built very solid with a metal case that will weigh down a shirt pocket more than your average plastic flash drive does. On the other hand though, it should ensure this is a very sturdy and reliable daily driver that stands up well to pants pockets and the like over time.Performance wise it\u2019s the fastest writing flash drive I own. Totally blows away all the cheaper more disposable drives I own.We will see how this drive stands up over time, but on initial arrival I feel this drive is well worth the extra cost in exchange for the superior speeds and solid sturdiness of the metal housing.",

Our USB flash drive using SSD solid-state memory chips, with high quality and strong stability.The Writing Speed remains stable when the file size of each transfer is less than 1/3 of the remaining usuable capacity. For example, when the USB SSD drive has 600GB available capacity left, you can transfer data less than 200GB at a time, the speed will not drop. High speed transmission state, product heating is a normal phenomenon.2. The drive\u2019s default format is EXFAT, if the format changes, please set the format to EXFAT, it is compatible with iPhone 15, iPad which is with Type C Port. You can first connect the C port of your phone, find and open the \"Files\" app, and then click \"Browse\", \"SSK SD301\" will appear so that you can start to use.\"",

Not for more money but at same cost. Also, the USB C cover flips to the side. This crowds out use of another usb c port on my iMac. I wish the drive had caps on both ends.

                "reviewText": "Avevo bisogno di una usb con velocit\u00e0 di scrittura e lettura alta, per trasferimento grossi file. Ho provato diverse chiavette, anche di marche che ho gi\u00e0 provato e di cui sono soddisfatto, ma ho dovuto rendere 2 volte il prodotto comprato perch\u00e9 le velocit\u00e0 promesse non erano reali. Finalmente mi sono deciso a leggere un forum di benchmark chiavette e ho visto questa marca che non conoscevo, ma con risultati al test molto buoni. Il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo \u00e8 notevole, nonostante costi pi\u00f9 di una normale usb 3.0, ma con mia grande soddisfazione le velocit\u00e0 sono ottime. Esteticamente \u00e8 molto curata ed ha sia interfaccia usb normale che interfaccia usb tipo C. Bellissimo il foderino in finta pelle con anello portachiavi, utile per il trasporto. Molto pesante in quanto in metallo, sensazione premium. Un p\u00f2 scomoda la chiusura per la usb C, ma comunque molto sicura. Consiglio l'acquisto.",
