                "reviewText": "This is for the 256GB with 130mb speeds only!Worked right out of the packaging. (I own 3 of these) They all work great but have their pros and cons.Pros: Cheap. Memory is accurate. Affordable. Plug and play.Cons: Gets a tad warm if used too long but considering I have ran it for 8 hour straight recording gameplay it still manages to stay in one piece. Slow read and write. Some files take longer however I have found if trying to write multiple files to the drive it tends to get laggy and can take quite awhile longer so I suggest a file at a time.Easy to lose as its about the size of a penny. I have made my own lanyards for this particular item out of old electronic cord and have never lost them. Suggest doing the same.Overall I am pleased with this external drive and has yet to let me down. Note: I use this nearly everyday and have never had any issues and this applies to all three I own.",

I have been using this drive for several months now, and I am very impressed with its performance and reliability.One of the things that I really like about this drive is its size. It is incredibly small and compact, which makes it very easy to carry around with me wherever I go. Despite its small size, it has an impressive capacity of 256GB, which is more than enough for my needs.The drive also has a USB 3.1 interface, which provides fast transfer speeds. I have been able to transfer large files such as videos and photos in just a matter of seconds, which is very convenient.In terms of build quality, the SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 feels very sturdy and well-made. The drive has a metal casing that gives it a premium look and feel. I have accidentally dropped the drive a few times, but it has held up very well and has not suffered any damage.Another great feature of this drive is its compatibility with a wide range of devices. I have used it with my laptop, desktop, and even my smart TV, and it has worked perfectly with all of them.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of the SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1. It is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-capacity, reliable, and compact USB drive. I would highly recommend this drive to anyone in the market for a new USB drive.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Big Disappointment",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the USB in February 2019 and it failed in Nov 2019, ten months hmmm. From new it required far more pressure to insert then my other USB drives and the housing became noticeably warm when in use. At that point, I should have sent it back but instead dismissed it as the consequence of its small architecture and poor manufacturing tolerances. After less than fifty applications the housing broke but more annoying the stored data became unrecoverable. I have several full size SanDisk and other maker USB drives and none have exhibited the above noted concerns or failures. Unfortunately four days ago my wife purchased the SanDisk 256 model and it also requires more insertion force than should be required, foreshadowing dear reader. Would I recommend this product? Absolutely not. Will I continue future Sandisk purchases? Probably, but not their miniature series. SanDisk, if you wish to offer me recompense, I will gladly include your response as an appendix to my review.Cheers EUpdate: Nov 25, 2019The day after submitting my Amazon review I contacted the SanDisk warranty department by email requesting recompense as the USB was less than 5 years old. I provided them a copy of my Amazon purchase order and the next day I received a follow-up email from SanDisk\u00ae Global Customer Care stating SanDisk did not have a 128gb replacement in stock (in the warehouse) but would I settle for two 64gb instead to which I replied, yes. Within a day or two I received another SanDisk email this time different in tone. It referenced my Amazon.com review and included the following highlighted in blue, \"Note: Refurbished, physically damaged or non-authentic products are not covered by SanDisk warranty\". The email also included an RMA (Return to Merchant Authorization) but no mention of the previous replacement offer.So what happened, a SanDisk employee armed with my Amazon purchase receipt trolled the Amazon.com website and located my review. Upon reading it they identified I had mentioned the USB casing had broken and presto SanDisk feels the warranty claim is disqualified, hence the blue highlighted script. To appear as a good corporate citizen they now offer me an RMA (Return to Manufacturer Authorization) so we can go through the process. Okay I will, with the clear understanding that I intend publish every SanDisk response regardless of the outcome.Other critical Amazon reviews about this product identify similar concerns, it runs hotter than a full sized USB, it is a tight fit especially in USB 3.0 ports, the housing cracks and this device prematurely ends in software/hardware failure. See a similar Amazon.com posted review provided by Gennaro M. on March 15, 2018. It is one of the many provided by dissatisfied consumers. My complaint, like those generated before me, does not originate from consumer misuse, abuse or accident but by product failure and warranty issues.Stay tuned for SanDisks response which I intend to publish when I receive it.Cheers EOn 2019.11.27, I received the following email from James P.. a SanDisk\u00ae Global Customer Care rep, \"Thank you for writing back to us. Please be informed that the statement which was sent in the e-mail is a standard statement which we use in all automated RMA approval e-mail for letting customers know that Refurbished, physically damaged or non-authentic products are not covered by SanDisk warranty. Also we understand that you are not very satisfied with the model of flash drive which you were using earlier i.e. SanDisk\u00ae Ultra Fit USB 3.1. Therefore we would like to offer you an alternative product i.e. SanDisk\u00ae Cruzer Glide USB 3.0 128GB (SDCZ600-128G) in replacement. Please suggest if you are agreed for the alternative model\".I agreed to accept their offer and on 2019.12.10 I received without cost to me a full size USB SanDisk\u00ae Cruzer Glide USB 3.0 128GB (SDCZ600-128G) delivered to my door. In the end SanDisk\u00ae or the parent company Western Digital Technologies Inc honored the warranty. I will continue to use SanDisk\u00ae as long as the honor they warranty. However I would not again purchase or recommend this specific product the SanDisk\u00ae Ultra Fit USB 3.1.cheers e.",
