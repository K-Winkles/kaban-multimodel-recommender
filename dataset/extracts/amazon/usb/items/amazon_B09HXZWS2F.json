Using it, you can make photo sharing and file transfer between these devices very simple and fast.Precautions: The initial storage format of this USB C thumb drive is exFAT. If there is incompatibility on the mobile phone, you need to reformat it to FAT32 format. However, FAT32 format cannot store a single video or file with a capacity greater than 4GB. The capacity calculation method of the computer is different from that of the USB drive. The computer uses 1MB = 1024KB and the USB drive uses 1MB = 1000KB. Therefore, the display capacity of the USB drive on the computer is about 92% of the marked capacity. USB flash drive will generate heat when working. This is a normal phenomenon.

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Will show up as 1tb. It actually isn't.",
                "reviewText": "When you check storage it will say the 1tb. Not really. 999GB which is a lot more than you'd expect. That being said it isn't. I tried it multiple times but after 100~120gb (correction like 64GB) worth of data saved on it everything becomes \"corrupted\" and then disappears from the drive. Regardless of what I did I couldn't save anything on it after that point. I was very careful and COPIED my files instead of moved them or cut/paste. If you cut and pasted or moved and the device did not actually save because the data limit was met... I am guessing that info would be GONE for good. So be careful. After the initial save I tried putting One video of 300mb and it would copy then not be able to play and when unmounted and swapped to the pc? It is not there. 0 bytes. So if you want to transfer data to your pc from your phone completely doable. Just do it in smaller batches. write speeds are around 20-30 and it even was 40mb for me at some points depending on what transferred.WARNING: Do not cut/paste or move your files here. COPY THEM. You want to keep your original file saved until you transfer it wherever it is you want to transfer them to. Make sure they files work.EDIT: Raising it to 2.5 stars because it does work. I have been transferring things like I wanted to. I believe they have an actual \"size\" of about 64GBs. The You will know when its over because everything after said point will come as \"corrupt\" and look like it is actual data and you will transfer that but it is \"corrupted\".. IE: You transfer a total of 100GB. Find that 40GB or so show up as \"corrupt\" and cannot be opened. So if you save small batches AND delete them after you can transfer more that way. My recommendation is look at the size and do not exceed around 60GB and there is a very high chance of it working out for you. I always check my files after I try transferring them to see if they open up and play or they show up as \"corrupt\".EDIT: Dropping it to 1.5 as longevity is definitely not one of its strong suits. Do not expect to use it too much before it just fails completely. I think this is the first flash drive I have ever owned that failed within 3 months and this was with almost the full time being unused. I tried to transfers some files and it did and then it didn't. Then kept crashing while trying to transfer the files (it did this before quite often but not to this degree--usually I think its because the phones open space was too small but I couldn't transfer a 2gb video when I had 10gb worth of space on the phone which is not normal). It is a good thing I do not delete or move my files from my phone to the drive as they'd have been lost forever.I like the fact this drive has 3 ways of connecting but given how quickly it burns out. Given how of the 1tb worth of space is actually more like 64GB if that (after the first day I never put more than 50gb into this drive while making space). I Do not recommend this product. You can buy another usb c drive with 128gb or 256gb of say Samsung for LESS.UPDATE: Finally used the new samsung 256gb drive to transfer files from my Samsung s21 ultra t my PC. I Had NONE of those problems That I had with the drive. I was able to Transfer muliple files a one time. It was significanly faster and the drive was not constanly failing. I originally though maybe my phone had issues which was why it consistently disconnected from the drive but no. It definitely was The drive.I really cannot recommend the drive unless you need all 3 options and you decide not to buy say a usb-c o usb-a converter.",

No more fiddling with a ton of smaller micro sd cards. Now I have one device with mass storage and you can't beat the price!",
