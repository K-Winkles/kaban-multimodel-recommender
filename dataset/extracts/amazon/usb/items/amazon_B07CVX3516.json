I have used it to connect a variety of USB devices to my USB-C laptop, and it has worked flawlessly every time.One of the things I appreciate about the adapter is that it is not bulkier than it needs to be. It is compactness allows me to plugin other things into the USB ports beside it without it interfering (much). Additionally, the outdents on the side of the adapter are a nice touch. They help me grip the adapter when pulling it out of a port.The adapter snaps into place firmly when inserted, providing a secure and reliable connection. I've never had any issues with the adapter becoming loose or disconnecting unexpectedly.Overall, I highly recommend the Syntech USB C to USB Adapter. It is a high-quality product that functions exactly as it should, and its thoughtful design features make it even more convenient to use. If you're looking for a reliable USB-C to USB adapter, the Syntech USB C to USB Adapter is an excellent choice.",
