One drive held only 10GB before it said it was full. Another became unreadable a week out of the package. If you rely on these you will lose your data.

                "reviewText": "It depends what you want these USB drives for. They are very tough, waterproof and basically indestructible. They can't be crushed or easily destroyed. They are waterproof (I've tried it) and they are cheap. I have two 64 GB drives to use on my keychains as file transport for larger files. They work fine, but they are painfully slow for read/write. So, for just moving files from one machine to another they are OK, but they don't work well to run programs or video files on, they can lag. Music files like MP3's seem to work fine. I have other Silicon Power and Patriot USB drives that are MUCH faster for programs, videos, etc. So, I am OK with the slowness because what I really needed was the toughness and durability of these drives. Just know what you are buying and what your uses will be.",
