                "reviewText": "Bought for use with Mac laptop with USB C ports and various windows computers with regular USB ports. The capacity is great for me, and the form factor is tiny. It's so small I'm glad it has the metal loop, since I need to attach it to something (or attach something to it) so I don't lose it. It has worked with my Mac laptop (USB C) and various other windows and Mac computers with standard USB ports.The only issue I've encountered so far is that sometimes the transfer speeds are much lower than expected, sometimes slowing to a near stop for up to 10-15 seconds. I also noted that the drive becomes quite hot with extended file transfers. I'm guessing if it gets too hot, it throttles down or temporarily suspends file transfers until it cools to a safe temperature. This can be a problem with large file transfers, since it may slow them down substantially.Overall, I'm still fairly happy with the drive, and the issue with transfer speeds is only an annoyance. But if you regularly need to transfer gigabytes of files and absolutely need to do it quickly, I'd look for another drive.",

                "reviewText": "So I recently bought an NVMe SSD to upgrade my main storage drive. I purchased this flash drive for the sole purpose of reformatting my computer because I couldn't find my old USB that had my flash boot files and thought this would be a perfect time to upgrade to a USB 3.0 and/or USB C flash drive. This one looked like it had great reviews, had a good look and enough storage for any file that I would come across. When I received the product, the form factor was great (it's the size of your thumb) but the product itself was defective. When I plugged in the USB, the drive registered on my PC but I immediately received an error message saying the drive was corrupted and needed to be repaired. Upon repairing the drive, the drive was no longer 128GB but became this awkward 34.3 GB drive. The 3.8GB is the flash files I installed to see if the drive would work. I DO NOT recommend this drive. This experience led me to request an immediate refund.",
