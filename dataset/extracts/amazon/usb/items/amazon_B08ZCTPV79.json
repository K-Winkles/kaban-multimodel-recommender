I\u2019m fine with pulling over and parking to make a call and whoever calls me while I\u2019m driving can leave a voice mail.Seriously, if you\u2019re not already aware of how automobile manufacturers are data mining everything on phones paired to an automobile, do a web search on auto manufacturers collecting private data.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using \"FireFly\" model keychain thumbdrvies for years, because I liked that the drive came off the keychain from the bottom, and the cap stayed on the ring. I didn't like having to put my keys dangling from a drive, or have to hand someone my keys to let them put something on my drive.But, that's far outweighed by this one. It's not plastic, obviously, unlike most all the other modern thumbdrives.It works a bajillion times faster than the other one I had, too. I hadn't thought I notice that, but I do. I'm not worried about breaking this one and having to be careful with it, or constantly make sure that it's there and hasn't gotten broken off the keychain.AND - a big thing here - amongst several other keys, it doesn't draw attention to itself by LOOKING like a thumbdrive to tempt anyone to steal it if it's sitting alone for a few idle seconds. People steal keys just to get the thumbdrive all the time. But, this one is much more security conscious, because it's silver, and matches all of my other silver keys and rings. Most of the time I have to do a double-take just to make sure, because I don't notice it.12/10 would recommend. ;P",
