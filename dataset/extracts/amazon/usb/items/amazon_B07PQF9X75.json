                "reviewText": "I bought these to use for my Amazon Fire TV Sticks external storage. When I connected them to the fire TV stick they were not recognized. Even after formatting them with the fat32 file system, the fire stick still could not recognize the USB drive. I'm still giving them five stars because they are probably pretty good little USB drives (if you're not using them for your fire stick). I didn't get the chance to try them out on anything else. I would send them back but since they were so cheap it's almost not worth it.",
