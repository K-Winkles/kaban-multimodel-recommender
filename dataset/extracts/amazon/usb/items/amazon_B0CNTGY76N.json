In linux, at least, it will not work. But this is not a bad thing necessicarily.To change the switch FROM: Read Only TO: Read and Write. You have to unmount the drive and unplug it. Then plug it back in with the switch in R/W.It will work fine.Probably the same for Windows but I dont know.I can't test speed because my laptop is USB 2.0 but it does seem to max out USB 2.0.If I get a chance to test on other machine I will update the review.This type of function is only available on a hand full of flash drives.Other cost far more. \"kangaruu\"Or are unreliable. \"I wont mention\"I hope the speeds on a USB 3.0 computer will be just as shown.Thanks EZITSOL for not neglecting a forgotton segment of IT.David.",

                "reviewText": "Picture this: You\u2019re in a dimly lit room, surrounded by computer screens, and you\u2019ve got a mission. Your mission? Secure data transfer without breaking a sweat. Enter the EZITSOL USB drive, complete with its very own physical write-protect switch. It\u2019s like the drive is whispering, \u201cBond, James Bond\u2026 but for files.\u201dSuperSpeed, they say. Well, this little gadget zips through data like it\u2019s outrunning an avalanche. Read speed? A whopping 150MB/S\u2014faster than a caffeinated squirrel on roller skates. Write speed? A cool 80MB/S\u2014it doesn\u2019t break a sweat, unlike your stressed-out laptop fan during finals week.But wait, there\u2019s more! The physical switch is the real star here. Set it to \u201cRead-Only,\u201d and suddenly your files are untouchable\u2014like they\u2019re wrapped in an invisible force field. Viruses? Malware? Accidental deletions? Nah, they bounce off like rubber bullets on Superman\u2019s chest.And let\u2019s talk endurance. This flash drive isn\u2019t just a sprinter; it\u2019s a marathon runner. Seriously, it\u2019s the Usain Bolt of data storage.Plug and play? Absolutely! Pop it into any USB port, and voila! Data transfer magic happens. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, Mac, and even that mysterious cousin - Linux. The default format is exFAT (for those 4GB+ files), but hey, you can always reformat to FAT32 if you\u2019re feeling nostalgic.And the design? Sleek as a secret agent\u2019s tuxedo. The aluminum alloy shell screams durability, while the mini size slips into your pocket like a stealthy ninja.So there you have it: the EZITSOL USB Flash Drive - a mix of James Bond gadgets and Olympic stamina. It won\u2019t save the world, but it\u2019ll keep your files safe while you sip your shaken-not-stirred coffee.*Disclaimer: No actual secret missions were conducted during this review.*",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice flash drive, with the main selling point being the physical write-protect switch on the bottom of the drive. It's a small switch, as you can see in the photos, but it works fine and it switches positively. When the write-protect is engaged, it is a read-only flash drive. You can't write to it, save on it, alter any files, or do ANYTHING except read the files from it. It's comforting to be able to just flip the switch and plug it anywhere without worrying about picking up malware.The read-write speed I got upon testing was about 90 MB/sec on average, which is plenty fast. All other aspects of the drive worked perfectly. It's also got little lanyard holes on the body and cap, so you can keep it from getting lost.The packaging is also perfect for gifting, if you are so inclined!",
