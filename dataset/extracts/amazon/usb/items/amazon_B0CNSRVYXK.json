                "reviewText": "This is my second product from Fanxiang and I am seriously impressed by this one, and the company has come a long way since I checked out one of their 2.5'' ssd drives. Now, with this portable drive I am pleasantly surprised by the performance and quality, especially for the price. This 512 GB external drive has surprised me on several different levels, but most of all with its speed for the capacity of the drive, there are other positives and I will try to list them all below, but before that a few words about the packaging and presentation. The thumb drive comes in a very stylish little retail box, with the company name and the list of specifications of the drive, so before even opening it, you will know what you are getting. Inside the box there is the drive nested inside a protective foam shell and a small warranty card, that is it.Positives:- Surprisingly fast speed for the size and capacity - if you look at the test for the speed of the drive you will see 430Gb read and 430Gb write speeds on this small capacity drive, and those speeds are very good considering all the factors, I was surprised, in addition, those speeds a bit lower than what the company was promising, but I am still impressed by them considering the super small size.- Inexpensive - Around $40 for the 512GB USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive, this model is priced very reasonably and the quality is there to back it up.- Extremely portable, yet made of high quality metal, it can fit in any pocket and can be used with laptops, desktops, tablets and even cell phones as well, since the drive is featuring both USB-A and USB-C connections.- Easy to use - I am using this drive as a primary data transfer drive, when I need to quickly carry large files between different devices, and with the fast speeds, it can be done in minutes.- Great looking and lite, no flashy labels or RGB, good to be used for any computer - The metal body is great for heat dissipation, due to the high speeds and data transfer, the drive heats up, but the metal does a great job to absorb and dissipate. The drive feels solid and very high quality.Negatives:- No cap included on either of the ends - The way the drive is constructed to swing around the base depending on which connection you are currently using, one is remaining protected, but the other one is always exposed, so for example if you are using it constantly and you are carrying it in your pocket, there could be some dirt and other small particles that could end up inside the USB.- Not as fast as advertised, I was expecting speeds close to the 520GB advertised, but I could never reach those, regardless the drive is still plenty fast.Overall, this is a great small and fast thumb drive by Fanxiang, I really like it and I am still impressed by its quality.",

The materials feel premium. Most importantly, this drive delivers on its promises.I have attached a couple of reports to my review. A performance report that shows that the drive\u2019s read/writes approach the capacity of a SATA interface which is approximately 550 MB/s. It was strange that the reads were slower than the writes and it probably means there is a DRAM cache on the drive to help speed up write operations, which is fine.The read speeds I got were very respectable and this is now the second fastest USB flash drive I own next to the Sandisk Extreme Pro 4TB drive which isn\u2019t really competing with this easily pocketable USB drive.I also used software to confirm the capacity claims and this indeed is a 512GB drive. There are many fakes out there, but this actually is what it claims to be.I also love that it has both a USB-C and USB-A connector I definitely recommend this flash drive.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned and used fanxiang/ranxiana mSATA SSDs in my Dell laptop in the past. And found them reliable and fast, and affordable.So, when I recognized the brand, I had no 2nd thoughts about trying their portable USB 3.2 SSD flash drive.It is essentially a SATA SSD in a USB stick. The capacity is decent at 512GB too. Can archive and/or transport a lot of photos, music files, etc. It's equipped with a USB-C interface for fast USB 3.2 specs, and a legacy USB-A 3.0/3.1 interface for older systems.The build quality of the USB stick is excellent. The cover has a satisfying 'click' as it pivots. It's all-metal body construction. I plugged it into a Win 10 Pro laptop with USB-A 3.0 ports. It is immediately recognized and Windows Explorer shows it is formatted with exFAT.I ran CrystalDiskMark on the SSD flash drive and I posted the results. Even with USB 3.0, it reached its advertised transfer rate. Sequential reads at 562 MB/sec.They only thing that I didn't like and concerned me was the significantly slow random reads at 17.4 MB/sec. Hmmm. Perhaps the unit will perform more consistent with a USB-C 3.2 interface.But the results are excellent regardless and shows it performs like a SATA SSD. No more waiting for a file dump! Great product, no more cables, no SSD enclosures, just a super compact and fast USB stick.",

Unless I remove and add other similar files which would still be under 500GB TBW used\u2026in that case, this should hold up for years\u2026maybe decades?I feel like the two connections of both are used, would write to different parts of the SSD, so I\u2019ve decided to use just the USB-A part.So the data written (in theory) is more consecutive, as opposed to all over the drive. So no defragging or optimisation is needed, which will of course eat into that ever dwindling TBW capacity that\u2019s the bane of SSDs existence\u2026You can read from either end, without affecting the TBW capacity.4/5 so far, and I will update this, should This not hold up to the write speeds and storage potential.",
