                "reviewText": "I bought this Kingston 64GB flash drive to transfer large files. I tested it in Linux and everything checked out fine. Average read speed is ~ 100 MB/Sec. Average write speed is ~ 20 MB/Sec. I was using it on USB 3 port on my computer. This drive is definitely real. I have a Kingston 4GB flash drive I've used for about 20 years. It has been reformatted probably 1000 times or more and has also been accidentally washed in my pants several times. It has outlasted several other brands of flash drives. I can only hope this 64GB drive can perform as well as the older Kingston flash drive. Buy it. I believe you will be happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "I got one of the 256Gs to make a usb boot drive. For that it worked perfectly, I was able to fix this PC with youtube videos and a few downloads after a hard drive crash booting direct from the USB. Then I got one for photos and things, but wanted to test it's read write in a real world stress test. I downloaded 108.5Gbs over ethernet (GTAV from steam), it took roughly a day and a half to download. It's write takes a while. I was surprised it ran at all but I did play half the first mission until it struggled with rendering distant objects. No lag or pop in, just weird blocks in the distance. Amazed it ran at all. I am now moving the local files to a 2TB seagate and it's about 25% transferred after an hour. The download graph looked like a sawtooth, like it was getting a bunch of data but taking a moment to process it so there is defiantly a write bottle neck. For audio, photos, pdfs, and all those small files that add up fast this is fine, but if you transfer large data a lot it's slow. I knocked a star off for the write speed, but it's not bad to have horribly slow Tx for the price. If the it's my PC and the new seagate has the same issues I'll update.Update: Didn't have the driver installed for my video card, the Seagate did the same thing until I installed them so there is a chance I could have run GTA using this if the driver was installed. The write time was still crazy. It only took about 2 hours to move the 108Gs from this drive to the Seagate so it also may have been comcast throttling my download speeds. For the price you can't go wrong with this for backup though.",
