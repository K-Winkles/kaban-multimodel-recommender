                "reviewText": "Because of other reviews, I tested all of mine immediately to make sure that they all worked and they did.These are 2.0 speed so they aren't amazingly fast. 16GB is about as big as I'd go at 2.0 speeds since data transfer takes ages. I originally bought these for a dual purpose use. Linux distro installable USB sticks for family that they could also use for saving important files to/transferring files with. I can't speak for the longevity of the product, but it works well enough for my uses. the physical size form factor seems bulky and dated but that's probably a factor into the cost.PROS:+ @ $3 per stick, can't really complain too much for the purpose I'm using it for.+ Variety of colors are sure to leave you with options for handing out someone's favorite colorCONS:- An option for all the same color, or color choice was not available so you're stuck with whatever they give you. Some of the colors are difficult to see the red LED activity light through.- 16gb 2.0 is almost an obsolete device for some purposes what with Image, Audio and Video files becoming ever larger. Your mileage may vary depending on your actual needs.",
