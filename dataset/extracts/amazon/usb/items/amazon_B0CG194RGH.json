                "reviewText": "I was excited when I saw this because I have a bunch of \"USB thumb drives\" that lived in a coffee cup on my desk. Invariably I wouldn't have THE one that I needed when I was away from my desk, so I anticipated this would be the perfect solution! I could store ALL of my \"USB thumb drives\" in it and just grab them all at once in the case and never be without the \"right\" one!AND it would be the perfect solution - IF you plan on using it as it was designed to be used - with \"USB thumb drives\" that make use of the 20 small stickers included for labeling the drives.Unfortunately, I have already attached some plastic key ring tags with labels on them so I know what's on the drive. They take up extra spaces and as a result of the size of the key ring tags, I cannot zip the case shut.So I'm giving it 4 starts based on my particular use case. AND I'm betting you can have a 5-star experience with this IF you use it as intended!Oh, and as an unannounced bonus, the plastic zip-lock bag it comes in is very sturdy and has a \"zipper\" that closes it as well. So you actually end up getting \"a second bag\" that can be very useful for free! (See the last image on the Amazon product page as it shows the USB storage case inside the plastic zip-lock bag.)",

The elastic holders on the outside of the case fit larger flash drives while you can still fit those on the inner sections, it is quite challenging to fit them in. When you fill the case, it becomes bulky but the fabric itself stretches easy to close the case. Along with the case, you receive small labels to help with your organization needs. You can label your drives before you put them in the case.",
