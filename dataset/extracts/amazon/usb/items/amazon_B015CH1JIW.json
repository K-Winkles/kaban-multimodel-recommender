                "reviewText": "Device smaller than I thought it would be. Sequential read and write is quite good. Random read and write good. Summary below, on Win11 system, using CrystalDiskMark 8.04 (x64):Sequential Read Average: 160 MB/sSequential Write Average: 68 MB/sRandom Read Average: 9 MB/sRandom Write Average: 2.5 MB/sIn comparison, these are the benchmarks for a Sandisk 32GB flash drive:Sequential Read Average: 160 MB/sSequential Write Average: 47 MB/sRandom Read Average: 7 MB/sRandom Write Average: 1.5 MB/sSo it performed slightly better on random read/writes, but much better on sequential reads. Advertised speeds are usually for sequential operations. If you are writing a lot of small files in one operation, write speeds will be slower since system has to write entries in the directory for each file, reducing overall throughput.The drive did get a bit warm (not hot, but noticeably warm) after running the benchmarks, but the case is metal, and if it was encased in plastic, as many other flash drives, one might not notice. I guess having exposed metal case helps with cooling. Will have to see how it holds up to writing a full 2 hour movie.All tests were done on new, freshly formatted (e.g. empty) flash drives.So in summary, its a decent drive. Noting to 'write home about' but the price was decent.",

                "reviewText": "These offer a fantastic tradeoff between size, storage, and portability. USB 3.0 support is a nice plus, especially if you want to use these for live CDs. They seem to have a strange failure mechanism however, which is a fragile area around the plastic \"ring\" in the casing. I am now more gentle with insertion/removal and haven't recreated the failure mechanism since, so it is difficult to know if this is a common point-of-failure or a one-time fluke. I'd recommend handling these carefully.",

The only problem I have is its size. While I love the size, it is a bit small and could be easy to lose. I have not lost it yet, for which I am thankful.I have no problems with this device, and I would suggest buying this.",

                "reviewText": "Too many times I have lost all of my data on my computer and have had to reset it to a factory condition, wishing that I had backed up my data before the incident. Now, with the SanDisk 16GB Ultra Flair USB 3.0 Flash Drive, I have no more concerns about losing data from a crash or virus incident. I'm confident that the Disk is going to do what it says it will because I checked the backup files on the flash drive and found them all intact and usable.I hope that I never really have to use the flash drive, but I'm not concerned about the possibility of a crash or virus infection, because I have all of my files backed up on the drive.The only issue I have with the flash drive is how small it is. I appreciate the technology to make the drive small and efficient, but I am prone to losing things for various reasons. Thus, I would prefer it to be a little larger, making it easier to find. Just for thought, maybe it can be constructed in bright colors to make it easier to see and find. Otherwise, it is a good buy for the price and performs exceptionally. I recommend the SanDisk 16GB Ultra Flair USB 3.0 Flash Drive for backup and storage of data.",
