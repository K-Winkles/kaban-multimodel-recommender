                "reviewText": "I produce a program for a community radio station and turn in my show each week to the station manager. He prefers it in raw data form rather than on a CD. SD memory cards and USB thumb drives do get lost or broken and sometimes just quit working for unknown reasons. I needed a good supply of memory devices. I decided to try a 10-pack of Pnstaw 16GB thumb drives. The price was right, less than $4 per drive. And I don't have to worry about losing the protective end caps, since these have an attached metal shield that just swivels out of the way for connection to my computer. They're attractive, with the drive bodies coming in 10 different colors. In the short time I've been using mine, they have functioned perfectly both reading and writing data. You can tell they are receiving power because they light up internally when connected to a working port. The drives arrived in a foam-padded cardboard case where I keep the ones I'm not using. Now I have plenty of memory on hand.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pnstaw Flash Drives are color coded! Brilliant idea using 10 different rainbow colors to clearly differentiate memory files, most useful when storing photos and documents. The 10 pack flash drive arrives packaged in a white attractive box. An inner box slides out displaying 16GB USB, 2.0 flash drives, individually sealed in plastic. The flash drive swivels to expose a metal electronic connection ready to insert in the computer and copy those important photos or documents. I like the size of 16GB flash drive, perfect for a smaller collection of photos, documents or projects. The flash drive's bright colors make me smile every time. They also make a sweet gift to pass memories on to family and friends.",
