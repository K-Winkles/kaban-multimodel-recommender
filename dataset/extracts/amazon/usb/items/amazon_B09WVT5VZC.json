The majority of the slots are for standard-size USB drives, but there's also a row for micro USB drives and a row for large-capacity USB drives. The lid also has room to store a good amount of memory cards. The foam is pretty cheap, I accidentally ripped off tiny chunks when I was trying to take out the \"plugs\" to open up the slots. Also, you only get a single sheet of labels, which only lets you label half of the maximum capacity of drives you can store. The case itself is nice. It's sturdy and will easily protect its contents if you accidentally drop the case. It also comes with a very long wrist strap, which is...interesting.",

                "reviewText": "After years of having loose drives, cards, and dongles laying around, I finally have it all organized! I really like that when I received this case, all of the various sized cutouts were made already, but they left the foam bits in. That makes it SUPER EASY to customize the sizes of slots for those oddly shaped USB drives.The web pockets in the lid are great for storing SD, microSD, and SIM cards. Cards are held in place VERY securely. to the point it actually takes some physical effort to remove them when needed. There is even some extra space under the foam insert to store a few more memory cards if you're so inclined.The sturdy clam-shell case makes it easy to store just about anywhere, or just throw in your backpack on the way out the door. Items are secure enough inside the case that they will rarely shift in transit.All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. If I needed another, I'd certainly buy one. This one has enough space though, that I won't be needing another for a while. I'd highly recommend this for anyone looking to organize that messy pile of flash drives that we all have kicking around these days.",
