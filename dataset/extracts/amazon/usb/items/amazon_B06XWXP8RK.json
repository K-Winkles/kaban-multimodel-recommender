Of course it depends on the size of the files. Files that are only a few megabytes will be copied in 2 or 3 seconds.But if you are routinely copying a couple of gigabytes, and you do not want to wait a long time, then look elsewhere.The higher capacity drives (from this line) are probably a little faster (due to having more NAND cells to write to, simultaneously). But even if the larger capacity drives are faster, they will still be slow (just not as slow as this 4GB drive). So if you need to store stuff only infrequently, then buy this flash drive. But avoid this flash drive if you expect any level of performance.This flash drive is functional and reliable -- that's it.I purchased it as an emergency boot drive. So I will rarely have to write to it again.This flash drive has no activity light.",

                "reviewText": "Last year, I purchased these same Verbatim Store 'n' Go 4 GB USB Flash Drives and they were great in their operation and in their construction. I keep them in a 10 teacher unit for our students to borrow overnight if they need them. (This is a 35 student Special Education unit.) Our student base is increasing so I needed more and decided to purchase them early. In addition, I'm collaborating in writing a book and needed one drive with a low capacity for one of the authors and these seemed perfect. Unfortunately, I didn't see the picture clearly depicting a change in the flash drives from last year. The previous ones I bought allowed the metal part of the flash drive to be pulled back into a completely covering plastic casing when not in use. In fact, part of the plastic casing has been removed from the back of the flash drive covering as the blue flash drive as shown in the picture. I thought this was simply a picture of the flash drive being pushed out fully into the position needed for inserting it into the USB port. It's not. Fully one-third of the casing back is \"missing\", presumably to save some small amount of money on its manufacturing process. Thus, even when pulled into the casing, the metal flash drive is exposed and unprotected from any damage. The flash drive works as well as it did before, but this missing part of the back is unacceptable in terms of protecting the important part of the device when it is being stored. It might as well not ave any \"protection\" at all as well as this cut-down casing provides. In addition, there has been a basic change in the way the \"business end\" of the flash drive can be pushed out from the way it was on last year's model. It's harder to push the flash drive out than it used to be. That part is not as bothersome as the cut in protection for the flash drive, but it is there and part of my loweing my rating from 5 stars to three stars. I would suggest looking for a flash drive that covers the entire metal part when retracted, rather than going with these. It bothers me to say that, but they are just not what they formerly were, and I would have returned them except for the fact that I desperately needed one of them when they were delivered, so I had to use it which meant keeping them all. I wouldn't recommend these if you're looking for a flash drive that can be protected when retracted. Aside from that, if it's not going to be anywhere that it could pick up dust or debris, or be knocked into by other flash drives, these would be okay..",
