                "reviewText": "I purchased the older versions (USB 2.0) of the Apricorn Aegis Secure Key in 2017 and 2016, I store all my accounts, passwords, scanned documents and any important files on these USB sticks and so far they have proven to be utterly reliable. Both devices are still performing perfectly to included their batteries; nevertheless, given the importance of the data I store on them and the amount I use them I decided to purchased a third one as a backup, received 22 December 2020.The new version (USB 3.0), the NX, keys seem to be much more responsive than the old version; however, I do have a gripe about the new version. I dislike the LEDs for a few reasons. The old version used a Blue LED at the base of the stick which when it was plugged into a powered USB port would blink, brightly, to show it was charging, it was easy to see. The new one uses the Red LED which is very small making it difficult to see unless you are holding it in your hand. Obviously, this isn't a show stopper but it is a small inconvenience as one simply cannot look across the room to see if the unit is finished charging. Also, one normally associates a flashing Red light to mean a failure or error of some sort so I think they had it correct the first time with a Blue LED located on the device where it was clearly visible at all times.But, the bottom line will be reliability and only time will tell if this new and faster version is as dependable as the old.",
