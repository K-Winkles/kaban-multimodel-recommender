                "reviewText": "My Amazon TV was very slow \"which all of them are\", it was due to the memory being used, too many apps and there was no memory left. It would take sometimes 2 minutes to load a app, so after some research, I learned that you can add more memory to the TV.Now, I noticed that tvs are unable to hold more than a 32gb card, the TV must format it, the format takes about 25 minutes to an hour so be patient and do NOT turn off the TV or PULL the card out! Once it's done, delete all of the apps, reboot the TV and then you will notice your TV faster than when it was brand new. Automatically the TV will install all apps on the card, so redownload the apps and enjoy a faster fire TV.This frees up all of the space and the apps and TVs interface will run so much faster.This fits perfectly behind the TV, and does not heat up at all.... Simple upgrade that saves you money from buying a TV due to the frustrating of the TV being slow. This card is indeed a great value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a dj and got this usb to play music off of on xdj\u2019s. I liked it because it\u2019s compact, pretty, and has a sturdy key ring attachment - my last usb broke at the key ring attachment so I didn\u2019t want that happening again. The first thing I noticed when I tried to load my playlists onto it was that it was slow. Like, really really slow. Like, at MOST 0.1MB/s. I didn\u2019t know if it was an issue with my computer or the usb so I tried not to think much of it. But then when I tried to load up my tracks on the xdj\u2019s at an event, it was ALSO SUPER SLOW for them to upload, and I ended up getting a late start because it was loading like 1 song every 30 seconds or so. And then to top it all off, the tracks didn\u2019t even read properly, even though I had it formatted correctly (or so I thought). It\u2019s a good thing I had my old usb loaded as a backup.It looks nice and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably ok for regular file transfer (if it weren\u2019t so dang slow, but maybe that was a fluke, idk) but do not purchase this stick if you want to use it for dj\u2019ing.",
