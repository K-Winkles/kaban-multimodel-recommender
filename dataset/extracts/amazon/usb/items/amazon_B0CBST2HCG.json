                "reviewText": "I liked: I had trouble with scanning the QR so I searched for \"Y disk\" in my iphone apps and easily found the Y disk app. I noticed a very very low rating for the Y disk app/Y disk on the iphone app store. However, when I opened the app on my iphone, it was very easy to move all the photos from my phone to the app. The next step, attaching the actual device to my iphone, is where I ran into trouble.... see below.I didn't like: The connector for the iphone is way too short to fit either my iphone SE second generation, or an older iphone 11 pro. I read in other reviews that you have to take the case off in order to attach the device to the phones because it is too short. My cases are very hard to take off and this is not a good feature... a poorly designed, too small connector. Also, even with the iphone 11 pro outside it's case, the connector was not a good fit.... it was wobbly. Furthermore, after reading from another customer their concerns about attaching anything made in china to their computer, I decided that is the last straw..... I've worked for companies where we had corporate espionage by foreign actors from that country and it totally messed up all devices all employees had ever connected to their home office wifi, in addition to their work computers and work smart phones.Sending this back.Incidentally, the instruction manual is, as everyone else says, is way too small to be of any use other than to know what name to enter into an internet search, so you can pull up a manual on your laptop. I've found that more and more products, whether from apple, sandisk, or other tech companies, they don't even bother to put instructions in the box and you have to search for youtube videos or full manuals online. Advances in technology have resulted in poorer customer service in general. At least this company put a manual into the box, although that tiny print is a joke and is totally useless. I guess somewhat of \"it's the thought that counts\" was there.... maybe maybe.",

                "reviewText": "I just received this in the mail today, I haven't got a chance to use it yet though. It seems to be made of super tough material and doesn't seem likely to fall apart! It comes with lots of instructions, A voucher for a extra free Flash drive, and a type C adapter end, all tucked away in a cute little Box, to keep it extra safe. I've had a couple of these over the years and I really love them, they come in hella handy! Now let's see if it passes the test of time, And doesn't crash or Completely quit working for no reason! Just a word of advice to anybody backing up anything of importance to these, always make sure you backup your important things to more than one place or thing. Because you never know When technology is gonna glitch! This was a damn good value for my money, hhopefully that doesn't bite me in the ass! Well if things go horribly wrong with this little device I'll be sure to update my review! But if everything turns out fine and dandy you won't hear for me again!",
