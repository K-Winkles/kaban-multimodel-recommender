After setting up the Mac, I found the Mosdart 64 GB USB 3.0 2 in 1 Flash Drive a lifesaver for transferring files from Windows over to the Apple and the other way around during the first year of operations. I cannot stress enough how much time the Mosdart 3.0 Dual Thumb Drive saved us. The gizmo is fabulous!The portable stick swivels with a click to expose a 3.0 USB-C male on one end and a 3.0 USB-A male on the other. (See pics.) Because its capacity is 64 GB, it can transfer whole folders at a time, not just a few files. And it serves well as a temporary backup location when performing dangerous cleanup or reorganization operations on the desktop machines. In 2-1/2 years, the Metal Jump Drive has performed flawlessly.It is eye candy, elegantly designed with a handsome brushed silver finish.",

I plugged it in, transferred a bunch of photos, and ejected it. When I plugged it back in, my computer is not reading it. It's like it's not there. I tried another flash drive in the same slot, and it works fine. Thank God I didn't delete the photos I transferred off of my laptop. Total waste of time and money. Very disappointed in this product.",

                "reviewText": "I have to eat crow on this one. Originally I posted that I got a 32GB USB for the price of a 128GB. Unlike some USBs, this one came unformatted. When I formatted it, it was only 32GB. I even tried exFAT32 and NTFS and still only got 32GB. So I concluded that the cover was mislabeled and wrote a harsh review.Well, the company contacted me and offered me a full refund. I agreed. When they sent a document showing the refund, they included a second document showing how to format the drive in order to get the full space available. I figured that I owed them to at least see if that worked. Dang, it worked. So the drive really is a 128GB drive (formatted to 117 as expected). My apologies and kudos to this company for having great customer support!",
