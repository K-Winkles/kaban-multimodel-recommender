                "reviewText": "I wanted a pack of 64 USB 3.0 flash drives in different colors and purchased these as they were on sale forI got mine for $16.74.The USB flash drives come in a nice flat cardboard box, which is sealed with a paper sticker and contains also the \"user manual\", a sheet reminding us in different languages how to properly use a USB flash drives. The manufacturer makes sure that you feel that you purchased a legit product. So, manual and back of the box are littered with certification logos and contain address, phone number und email address of the manufacturer. The CE and FCC logos are embossed in the drive itself together with the crossed through trashcan.The flash drives look nice, even though the plastic is just average. The sliding mechanism works well and looks durable, but makes them (with 2cm or 0.78\") a little wider than some other flash drives I own. Probably not ideal, for those with a tight USB port situation. When in use, you can see a red LED shining through the plastic of the green, yellow and red flash drives. The black or the blue ones stay dark.Oddly, one of the drives appeared on my (Windows 10) system as being write protected by software. I don't know if this was my mistake or if it came like this. However, I was able to solve this with a quick format in no-time. FYI: these flash drives do not have a physical write protection switch.As there are many USB flash drives on the market, which have way lower capacity than advertised. I tested two of these Kexin flash drives with H2testw, which confirmed that they are legit.",

Would I buy it again; if I needed more usb then sure, why not.",

Tried another (it was black) no light, have read on a review that the black and blue ones light isn\u2019t very bright. So put another one in still no connection recognized. This time I wiggle it out a bit and seen the light flicker off and on. I then pulled slowly out to where it was barely connected and I finally have a steady light and a recognized flash drive. Over all I probably will send back and buy another brand due to the fact you have to play with connection. I fear that if I bump it, it may disconnect. I have use these drives (not this brand) over many years and have had no problems like this. Hope this was just a bad pack. Good Luck",
