                "reviewText": "I have now gone through three of these drives. And it wasn't until I had the third drive taken apart and examined by a very reputable computer outfit, that I found out why I was having problems. The first couple of times, I chalked it up to just having received something not working out of the box. This happens, right?First, they are very poorly made. But my mistake. Getting 1TB for $20 should have told me something. In fact, it read that the drive they sent was actually 2TB! Imagine that, something for nothing.No, it's NOTHING for nothing.The drive won't store data. It doesn't hold anywhere near what it claims. They have figured out a way for it to tell the computer that it's a hard drive with 1 or 2TB, where it really is 128GB, according to the engineers who looked at it. Tilt.Other problems included the computer no longer recognizing the drive, data saying it's on the drive when it isn't (where does it go!!??), messages that there are formatting issues, and more.To tell you to stay away because it isn't worth the time is one thing. This isn't poor quality control, it's a completely fake product. I spent several hundred dollars to retrieve a few documents that were critical to me, and to do that, I had to have the chipset replaced. Trust me, you can't run far enough from this product, faster. I honestly wonder if it is pulling data and sending it somewhere, like to the country of origin?",

Also some files it says it cannot copy but when I manually copy them, it copies. Looks like it is not reliable and when you have important files, need to be careful if it really holds on the files or deletes for any errors. By the way, I bought 1 TB but the capacity says 2 TB.

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these just to have an extra. They came with these cute cord things and plastic storage cases.My ONLY issue was this: The cases had these seller labels on them and when I pulled them off, they were hard to get off so it left this sticky glue residue. After trying a few methods, though, I found that olive oil did the trick of getting off all that sticky stuff. But I'm still giving 5 stars because the product itself is exactly what I need to store my music for nights I want to go out singing. The gold is a beautiful classy touch. Would definitely order again.",
