It's not bad, just not a very clean look (kinda poochy) when it's packed out... If that bothers you.For me, it works fine as it's just going to sit in a drawer when not being used.I wouldn't trust it to hold up on the outside of a bag, but that's not really how it's designed.The individual pockets for the drives are quite deep and the pockets are fairly slim, so they may not work with fatter USB sticks. I do wish the pockets were made of a more open mesh, or slightly shallower so that my different color drives were easier to see.",
