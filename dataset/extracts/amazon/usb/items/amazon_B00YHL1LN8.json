Also i dropped by mistake from my moving car, my small dog used it as a chewing toy for some minutes ( before this one i lost 7 normal USBs to my crazy dog). but this old one still perfect and kicking.I order TWO new ones because this new ones got more storage capacity , my old one still working like new but its storage capacity is very low comparing to new ones, and love it!! also they are smaller in size comparing to the older versions which makes them more portable. same quality though.quality feeling of the product is high, excellent fabrication, fast USB port, overall yeah if you want something secure and that will long last better buy this oneI use it specially for a stand alone operative system, i encrypted and also use it as storage, (YEAH im a Geek)so yeah guys if you looking for a secure portable waterproof this is one amazing option.100/100 Recommended",

The rubber on the caps allows for dropping it and it bounces rather than lands with a thud.The only downside, and that's only if your Jason Bourne or some such, is it writes very slowly, I suppose to insure no loss data transfer.If you're looking for something in say a live stage environment, this IS the drive for you.",
