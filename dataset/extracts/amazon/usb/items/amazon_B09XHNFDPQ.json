                "reviewText": "As an Indie composer for movies and games, I use a lot of USB sticks to send products, transfer files between systems here in my studio, etc.The price for these is definitely right. You are paying just slightly over $4 per drive.They are fetching in metallic colors, and the flashing LED (red) when they are plugged in is a nice touch. (You can actually tell when they are reading and writing.)That said, these are very S-L-O-W. I do not know why. I tried the USB in a variety of ports from USB 2 to USB 3. I also tried more than one drive from the batch. They top out at around 5-6 Mbps.They also read at about 10 Mbps (on my machines in my house). I checked out the drivers, etc. Nothing unusual.To write 6 Gb, slightly less than half the drive, took me 30 minutes or so.So, for small files, single songs, very short video clips, program files, etc., these are fine.If you are looking to move larger files, video work-in-progress, hi-fidelity/multi-track music, these USB drives are still workable, but you need to program extra time into your schedule, or have them read/write while you co-process with other activities.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE from original review of 1 star. I have now made this 5 starsOriginally, this would not work in my car and I did not understand why , something told me to check the formatting of this drive and what is compatible with my car. The default formatting ( which is I think ExFAT) caused my car to not recognize the USB drive because my car is compatible with either FAT32 or NTFS. I had to change it to NTFS once I did that it worked just keep in mind that if you\u2019re having the same issue format it first before you add the music otherwise you\u2019ll lose everything. I learned that the hard way lol but I am happy now that it\u2019s working and I can continue to add the rest of my music. I think that the seller should put something in the description about the possible compatibility when it comes to formatting. If you do need to change the formatting plug in the USB drive to your computer once the folder opens at the top, there should be something that says format, and you\u2019ll be able to change it there. It was very simple.Every single USB drive that I have used in my car has always worked to play music. Unfortunately my old one broke so I needed a new one. I had one that did not have enough memory so I purchased this one I transferred all my music onto it just to discover that this does not work in my 2021 Cadillac XT5 I plug it in, go to USB under audio, and it says no device found!!!! I\u2019m so annoyed. So either I got a defective one or it really doesn\u2019t work in the car.",

After I loaded TB of data on them, I went back to add a couple more items and organize further. When I added a couple more files, even though their was a lot of space on the drives, they no longer worked and no matter what I tried I couldn't access the drives on any equipment. My only saving grace was I hadn't yet deleted the originals, but eventually every one f these drives failed when I wanted to add further data. I spent a little more and did the whole project over using SanDisk drives and had not even 1 failure. The SanDisk drives were only USB2.0 so they were a little slower but I will never use another of these drives",
