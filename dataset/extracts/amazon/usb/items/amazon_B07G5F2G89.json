                "reviewText": "The first thing that potential buyers of this Verbatim ToughMax USB flash drive should know is that it is USB 2.0 -- and as such, it's NOT fast. If you've been spoiled by 3.0 speeds or expect to move large amounts of data to and from the ToughMax flash drive on a regular basis, then it may not be the ideal choice for portable USB storage.In my case, however, I was looking for an inexpensive and durable portable USB solution that I could use to store important files for work and travel. And in that regard, this ToughMax is exactly what I was looking for. For my purposes, 64GB of storage was plenty, and I have no problem with the 2.0 speeds of this drive. Additionally, I greatly appreciate the fact that this ToughMax flash drive includes a tight-fitting cap -- this means I can snap the cap on, toss it into my backpack or my pocket, and not have to worry about getting a little dirt or pocket lint intruding into the end of the USB.One additional thing I like about this ToughMax USB flash drive is the size. It's the goldilocks of portable USB flash drives: it's small enough to fit in a pocket without occupying too much space, it's small enough to not stick out of the side of your laptop like a sore thumb, but big enough so it won't be easily lost, and big enough to easily pull out of a hard-to-reach connection (like a USB port that's between 2 other devices -- try that with a SanDisk Ultra Fit, trimmed fingernails and no pliers/tweezers).Tremendous value for this tough cookie -- I recommend it.",
