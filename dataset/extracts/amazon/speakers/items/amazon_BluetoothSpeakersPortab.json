If you\u2019re lucky you will get a lyric or two and then nothing.My kid is autistic and LOVES music. The last cheap little speaker we had was AMAZING but was left at the beach accidentally. Thought with the reviews I had glanced over it would be ok. NOPE. And we cannot return it because my son ripped up and destroyed the boxes and it\u2019s too much of a hassle.Don\u2019t be dumb like I was. Save your dollars",

Not sure what TWS means but I\u2019m going with \u201ctinny whinny sound\u201d! You couldn\u2019t have worse speaker quality if you got a 1950\u2019s AM radio and put it in a sealed bucket. The Bluetooth connection is also suspect. It has trouble within a foot sometimes and if you go through an open door 10 foot away it completely drops out. Save your $10.50 and buy ANYTHING else!",
