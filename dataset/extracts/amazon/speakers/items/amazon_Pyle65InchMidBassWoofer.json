                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Meaty Sound; replaces sub-woofer for me.",
                "reviewText": "****************** UPDATE May 2015 *********************2 years and still running fine. I enjoy the set up so much, I wanted to write an update to commend these speakers.Reading the 1star review for this really makes me feel so sad for humanity. People who are rating 1 or 2 stars for this are pretty much just revealing to everyone how ignorant they are. That being said, ignore those reviews, and notice how it weighs on 5 star reviews.Using these mid woofers in the rear with full range in the front makes for a very enjoyable listening experience.Using only stock (full range) speakers; the sound stage feels like a narrow strip of flat sound coming from my dash area (chest area and above). Using these in the rear, it makes it like my entire car cabin is the sound stage, and increases depth of sound stage (from the floor of the car).They have an interesting sound character and make music very enjoyable to listen to and physically feel. Since there's more energy in the low/ mid range, the overall sound is more textured, and the vibrations you can feel are in the range of sound that have more musical significance than what you feel with low blasting sub woofer.(Comparing to a protege5 oem stereo : the audio sounds textually very flat, and the stock subwoofer is just so boomy. Very V shaped. Makes me think of a glossy magazine cover, vs. shoe box diorama. The sound has a high wattage glossyness to it, but it's not stimulating to my ears. The top is just harsh, and the sub woofer isn't providing any musically significant sound.)Well, probably any brand mid-bass woofer will be enjoyable (I don't know since these are my first mid woofers), but these were the cheapest so I went with these.The audio enjoyment you will get from adding these to full range speakers will be much greater than the cost of these speakers, and having that surplus increases the enjoyment even more. :)*********************************************************************************************I am using these for my rears in my 95 Accord LX with Dual XDM6400 stereo. My fronts are Pioneer TS-G1643R.(Accord specific comments: My stock rear speakers are 5.25\", I think; and it fits into a weird 6x9 looking adapter, that bolts in with 3 bolts; kind of weird. Anyway, to get these in; I had to drill some holes into said adapter, and pick up some small nuts and bolts to attach the speakers to the adapter. The Accord stock wiring clip can come apart somewhat; so that you can take the wiring out of the clip, and slide it onto the speaker leads.)I enjoy sound with a subwoofer; but I don't like the idea of lugging around 20-40lbs of junk in my trunk, plus the wear on my car battery and rear suspension, and loss in handling. For me, these mid range speakers sort of replace a subwoofer; in that they give me punch in the lower range, and that they give me piece of mind that I have something a bit more powerful, and more specific range than regular speakers in my rears. They however, do not have the lower extended range that subwoofers have, and are not an all out replacement for a subwoofer.I am pleasantly surprised how meaty these speakers make my music. Personally, in my car, I listen to electronic, rock, jazz, pop, jpop. Certain genres seem to make more sense now; especially Rock for some reason, or songs w/ rock instrumentals. Electronic music sounds great too.Since they are \"mid-bass\" woofers, I was sort of expecting as if you push up the mids in your eq - it might sound muffled, fuzzy and not very appealing. But that is not so! (well, maybe by themselves they sort of sound like that, but I'm using them with my Pioneer fronts covering the top). These speakers don't sound like they push up your eq mids, but more like they add more physical impact/resonance to your mid/lower range, giving your sound a bit more depth and texture. I would describe it like running your hands over a cobble stoned street; if that makes sense; kind of lumpy, and hard, and smooth, and dense, and textured.I do have some distortion when the volume is turned up; but I believe it has to do more with my head unit than the speakers. I am just using them with my Dual head unit, on stock wires, and they are good enough for me. I imagine they will be more robust sounding if you are using and amp and with crossovers.For $11-13 each; I think these speakers are pretty great value for sound, if you have another pair that is already covering your highs. They make music more enjoyable by adding some depth, punch, and texture to the sound.",

On the factory amp, They Did ok,Not awesome, but not bad. I installed a sound stream amp, That helped them a lot.With the amp they sound pretty good, had to noise kill the doors, to stop some vibration.Iv owned better. But considering the price, There probably as good as youl find.Im going with 4/5 Price vs Performance. There a good deal at the lower price point.No there are not as good as Jl-audio, or other higher priced subs.They are Good for a budget install or factory speaker replacement.They should work until I have the money for some more expensive replacements.",
