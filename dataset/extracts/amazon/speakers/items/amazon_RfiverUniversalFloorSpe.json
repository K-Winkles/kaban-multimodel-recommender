They look attractive and are functional adding weight for stability. I have QAcoustics M20 powered speakers that weigh 12 lbs. each. They sit well on the top plate and feel relatively secure. Given the cost, I can recommend these for your book shelf speakers.",

                "reviewText": "My B&W 805's have been in cold storage for several years due to life changes. I'm finally in a place where I can get them back out and enjoy them. I got rid of the speaker stands I used to use long ago, so when these 28-inch stands from Rfiver came along I figured I'd give them a try.Inside the box you'll find all the pieces you'll need to build two stands, along with a useless wrench for assembly. Do yourself a favor and ditch that wrench and use your own 12mm and 14mm wrenches. The stand is made of two glass platforms that are finished to look like marble on the top faces and for whatever reason are pink on the bottom faces. The white connecting pole is in two pieces and hides a pair of threaded rods that secure all the pieces together. The collar between the poles and the escutcheon at the bottom are silver-finished plastic. Rfiver includes some sticky 3M bumpers to help keep your speakers in place in case you bump them while they're sitting on the slippery top plate.You can hide your speaker cables in the connecting poles, except I can't because the opening isn't big enough for a big shell on my Impeto IMP-2208 cables. No worries, I'll just use them outside the stands.I chose the rubber feet to cover the pegs on the base plates because I'm on a laminate wood floor. You could choose to use the included spikes if you wish.Even with the glass plates and steel tubes these stands are not very heavy, so if you're really worried about vibration you may want to get something you can fill with sand or shot. I'm not worried about that, and since I'm on the second floor it doesn't much matter anyway. There's going to be vibration whether I want it or not.The 28-inch height puts the tweeters at a good position for my listening chair, which doubles as my office chair. Maybe someday I'll get a dedicated listing room, but not yet!This product is made in China.",
