                "reviewText": "Initially the speaker would not work with my desktop using the recommend ports at the back of the system. I attempted using 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 USB ports. Blue light would come on, but playing sound would result in speaker shutting down. I suspected a driver issue, but nothing would work. I notified the seller, FactoryOutletDeals, and they immediately offered to send a replacement without requiring a return. Within 3 days I had a working unit without the hassle of re-boxing and returning the other device. I am very pleased with the volume range of such a basic speaker bar. While sound can get muddled in the higher volume range or during bass-heavy audio, the mid to low volume quality is just what I needed for those times when I need to charge headphones or show a video to family members. The compact size easily fits under my Gigabyte monitor, sitting on the monitor stand. Overall, I'm happy with the device and the seller.",

I thought maybe it was because I had it plugged into a USB splitter, so I tried plugging it directly into the computer but it still has the hissing sound. A bit annoying to listen to, and can be distracting from the thing I'm supposed to be listening to.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not amazing, but it works",
                "reviewText": "Now, to be honest, I thought when I ordered this product it had volume controls on the device itself. It did not, but that's my bad, so I won't hold it against the device. That said, I would order something different based on that alone if I needed another.The Good:As a cheep speaker being used for audio monitoring for streaming, it works well enough. It has OK range, good enough sound, and is able to be clear and solid sound at low levels. It can get loud if I need to, and it doesn't distort too badly, and overall the quality of the sound is solid for the price point. Easy USB setup works on USB 2.0 so you can save your 3.0+ ports for something more important, and its stable and solid construction means it will hold up if I used it on the go with a laptop.The Bad:No volume or power buttons on the device itself means you have drive the volume and power from software or just unplugging it. This is expected in the product as described, so I'm not taking points off for this.While the sound is not bad for it's price point, it does have an \"in a box\" quality to it that gets worse the louder you get, and it's dynamic range is clearly limited. It at least did not distort much at higher volumes.Personal: The Blue LED not only looks kinda cheap, but it's annoying that you can't switch it off, meaning that if you can't have the light somewhere, this may not be the product for you.Overall:I personally would spend more on a better bar or speakers for regular audio use, but as a cheap portable speaker and 2ndary output monitor? This works just fine. I wish it didn't have the RGB, or had a way to turn it off, but for the price I payed, that's a compromise I made, and I felt I've gotten my moneys worth out of this.",

Seems a bit low quality in terms of hardware, like it can easily break if dropped, but sound quality is pretty good. Feels light, looks nice, and you can decide whether or not you want the LED to turn on or off. There\u2019s a volume wheel and power button as well. Only downside is that the cord seems a bit short. All in all, it\u2019s a good bang for your buck if you want something low price but with decent quality",
