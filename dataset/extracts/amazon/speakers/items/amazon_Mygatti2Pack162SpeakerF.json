                "reviewText": "These cables are in place and are working just fine with my surround speakers. However, there are a number of things I dislike:1. Despite the description, these are NOT flat cables. They are thinner than most, but I've had flat cables, and these aren't them.2. The banana plugs are so fat I had to crimp them with pliers before they would fit into any speaker terminals.3. Each cable is sharply folded back on itself to form the coils they're packaged in. The fold is strong enough to deform the cable permanently, almost certainly creating a weak spot that could eventually lead to failure.4. The connector collars are loose and unscrew if you look at them funny. 6 of the 8 collars were loose in the package when the cables arrived.As I said, these cables are working just fine, but considering the issues I've noted I wouldn't buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "Great spool of 16 gauge speaker wire. I wanted to redo some of my wires in my living room surround sound as the old stuff just got worn and frayed over the years. Really good and thick covering over tinned copper which helps the audio quality. Honestly some of the best speaker wire I've used and really great for the overall cost with a 50ft roll being about $22 as of review time.",
