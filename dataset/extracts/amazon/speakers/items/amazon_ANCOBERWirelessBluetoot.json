                "reviewText": "I have been looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker for many weeks and this one was the perfect purchase. I have created a little pro and con list for you all to check out if you are interested in buying one of these:Pros:-One of the things I like about it is the RGB rainbow effect meaning I have a little light show while I'm playing videos.-The best thing about this device is the USB C charger. This is great for me because almost all of my stuff these days needs C type and having to lug around a mini usb just isn't gonna cut it for me.The battery life for the speaker is pretty good, I use it for when I'm watching videos at night and often times I'll wake up nearly 8 or 9 hours later to the sound still coming out. Just goes to show how much juice this thing can handle.Cons:-One of the slight 'problems' I have with the speaker is that every now and then, the bluetooth connection will cut out and pause the video. Its not really a deal breaker because they include an aux cord so my little 'issue' is just me being lazy to plug the cord in.-a \"problem that I do have is the noise level when i am turning the speaker on and off or when the battery is low. I dont think there is a setting for the booting up sounds so its often times pretty loud. The running low battery can and pretty much will wake you up from a deep sleep. Of course, thats only if you dont charge up before using it again.Overall, its a solid piece of kit and i would recommend anyone looking to get a speaker grab this one.",

                "reviewText": "I like my Ancober speaker! Pairing via Bluetooth from phone or laptop is quick and easy. The sound quality is excellent for a speaker its size. It has decent bass-response on the low-end and does not sound \"tinny\" on the high-end. It's lightweight, very portable, and it \"feels\" good, too, like it is made very well. There are several settings on the light display: turn it off, have it pulse to the music, or just have an ever-changing array of colors to delight your soul! Buttons on the speaker allow changing tracks or volume if the connected device (phone, laptop) isn't within reach. This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made recently! The \"PowerOn\" and \"Pairing\" sounds are a little louder than I would like, but that's the only downside to this product! Love it!",

                "reviewText": "This speaker I got when I couldn\u2019t use my Alexa when I first moved AGAIN.I was super stoked to find the volume on this beautiful baby- powerful and booming!It seriously could have been turned up more, only it was loud enough!Changes colors and is pretty freaking cool anytime I use it! It is probably the best portable speaker I\u2019ve ever used, ever bought and will ever buy again! Stays charged for a good amount of time I\u2019ve been able to use it for a few hours cleaning off and on for about four days until it needs charging again.The only downside is whenever anyone would call it would make an awful noise that you can\u2019t stop unless you walk over to the speaker and turn it off because even pressing a button on my own phone didn\u2019t stop the sound on the Bluetooth speaker and if you press the sound button down while someone\u2019s calling it will answer the phone to them- so you have to just turn off the speaker!
