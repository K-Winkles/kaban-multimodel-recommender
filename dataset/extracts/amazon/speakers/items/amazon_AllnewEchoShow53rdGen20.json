It does not always work well. But we still love all but the one we got that is not a show its a dot, and it has static. Wish we could replace that one.",

This is the first Echo Show for me. I really like it! There are some really good features that the others devices I have do not have, so that\u2019s nice. There are a few features I wish it did have that my Echo Plus has. The one major feature that is missing is the ability to check and show the current temperature in the room. Overall, I\u2019m happy I got it. The camera feature is nice but very poor guality. The sound is pretty good for what it is. Connecting devices was pretty straightforward and worked just fine. I do wish the cord was a little longer. The screen is small so I wanted to keep it on a shelf that\u2019s eye level but the wall plugs are too low for the length of cord.The Blink indoor camera is as expected. I already had a few indoor and outdoor cameras so no surprises.",
