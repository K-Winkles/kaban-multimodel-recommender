                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker",
                "reviewText": "I bought this for outdoor use - taking to baseball tournaments, patio parties, picnics, etc. I have not tried using it for any professional purpose (DJ, live shows, karaoke). I have been using it for a few months now.Pros:-The sound on the speaker is amazing. At max volume, I can flood an entire baseball field with \"Green Onions\" and have gotten tons of compliments on how great it sounds by people at the ballpark. The bass can be tweaked in the app with the touch of a button, and I love switching between deep and punchy depending on the song.-The speaker is so far holding up very well. I am putting some miles on the handle, wheels, and lugging it over all kinds of terrain like rocky parking lots, grassy fields, dusty dirt paths. Is it getting kinda dirty? Yeah. Has it come down with a few scratches? Sure. But all in all, it is holding up better than I expected with all the bumps and jiggling. I haven't dealt with moisture yet, but it is supposed to be able to withstand any thing besides being submerged (not an issue on solid ground, typically).-The battery life is great. I can charge it up overnight and take it to the park for the next couple of days playing near max volume and I have yet to run out of juice with it. Stated battery life is 18 hours and I have tested up to ~10 without issue.-Comes with a USB port that you can use to charge up your phone or other portable devices with the speaker's battery. It's not fast charging capable, but it will keep your device from draining and boost it slowly over time if you turn the screen off. It's a small detail but I find it very convenient since without my phone the speaker is a giant paperweight.-The lights are cool, but I have yet to really use them. They are bright enough to be visible during the day and are a cool feature, but I just haven't found myself using them much.Cons-Thing is a bit heavy. Not too heavy so that my wife can't lift it and lug it around, but it certainly dampens it's portability. 10 lbs less somehow and this thing would be amazingly portable. Unless you're taking it over smooth, even ground you will be a bit tired if you have to take it further than 50-100 yards. So, not the speaker to take on a hike - definitely the speaker to take car camping. I would have liked to see slightly wider wheels on it, as the roller-blade like wheels on it now can get be unsteady when hitting bumps in a sidewalk and cause the speaker to start rocking - when this happens just stop, let it settle, and start moving forward again. Otherwise, the rocking momentum will build and cause it to try and tip over. I think fatter wheels would give it more stability when being pulled by the telescoping handle.-Some folks may not like the scratches it will take in moving it around everywhere. I see these as a patina from being put to good use - as long as it still works fine and the handle/wheels hold up, I do not mind some scratches or discoloration. I'm using it outdoors and taking it to so many places that I think expecting something to come out looking pristine is unreasonable.-One feature I wish that it had (and maybe could be added to the app in a future update) is a fade in/fade out button for when I'm transitioning songs (or if I was making an announcement and needed a short break in the song). An abrupt pause and start can be distracting to listeners, and it would be cool if I could just push a button in the app and it would automatically start fading out over 5-10 seconds, then start fading up. I can do this manually with my volume buttons but I usually don't because it is clunky.Overall, great bluetooth speaker. Well-designed, looks great, and I have yet to take it somewhere without drawing a compliment. People ask where I got it, what brand it is (\"Ohhhh yeah JBL, they are really nice\"), etc. It is a bit of an investment for the price, but I am using it weekly and expect to continue using it for years to come. After my experience using the speaker, my opinion is that the price is justified by the quality and functionality.",

                "reviewText": "I was in the market for a Big/Party Speaker recently and I did a lot of research I heard saw Sony speakers, LG, Bose and JBL and I went with this JBL speaker over the 110 Party box.I heard great things about this speaker and was honestly very hesitant. I am very picky about my speakers/sound and while I trust JBL with their smaller speakers, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d enjoy the big ones.Well I\u2019m happy to say I am thoroughly impressed!The sound in the Party Box 310 is amazing, clear and it gets very loud!I am someone who listens to many types of music genres so the in-app equalizer being simple is very helpful!Sometimes I love being a Bass Head and the Bass on the JBL does not disappoint whatsoever!The battery life of 18 hours is insane because I have yet to kill the battery in one use!The portability is also amazing! The handle feels sturdy and it\u2019s not so overbearingly heavy that I couldn\u2019t pick it up which makes the addition of the grab handles on the speaker a nice touch.The light show is a little cool but mostly a gimmick.",

                "reviewText": "If you're familiar with JBL, then you know that they're physically incapable of making a bad product, this speaker is no acception. It weighs as much as your mom, and costs as much as an ambulance trip, but the damn thing gets loud. The bass won't move your house across the county line, but it sure as shit will try. If you find the right song and put the speaker in the right place, it can and will break something. The materials are definitely premium, and the water resistance is impressive. The only gripe I have would be the battery life, but that's to be expected when the thing moves so much air. If you don't mind pushing around 50 lbs or don't plan on moving it very much, then this speaker is certainly worth it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Middle-Class PartyBox: Crisp sound, Great Peripherals",
                "reviewText": "Sound Quality - Sounds just as you'd like it to, and more. What is more, you may ask? Simply put: I was hearing instruments in songs that I've never heard before when using car speakers, phone speakers, or AirPods. Specifically higher pitched noises. The sound is crisp, and the bass is plentiful (with the option to crank it of course).Battery Life - Out of the box, using for 4 hours with my iPhone at volume 10 out of 16 and the light show on, the percentage ended at 77%. That is pretty on par with the description of the battery life that JBL gives you. Of course it will degrade over time, but you can't beat 3.5 hour charge time for ~16 hour battery life. Even if the battery life drops to 12 hours, that is still a big battery.Portability - Yes. I am a 136lb 5' 8\" shrimp, and I can tote this speaker like nobody's business. There is a suitcase-style retractable handle (with a soft grip) in addition to a static/firm/built in handle (with a soft grip) that you can carry sideways with another built in handle near the wheels (no soft grip). Carrying it is easy and comfortable. Wheeling it around is easy thanks to the soft wheels that it bears. I wouldnt recommend *carrying* it with the suitcase handle. Maybe it will break. Maybe not. Don't find out. (You can definitely wheel it with the handle). The manual says to wheel at a 60* angle maximum, but this thing can wheel at pretty much whatever you are comfortable with *without scratching the ground*.Visuals - It looks clean. Classic black and orange JBL scheme. The light show is fantastic, with the white strobes flashing to the bass and the circular leds flashing to everything else (and the bass). You can also pick from a variety of light shows from the JBL app.DJ Controls - I have no use for them as I intend to use this simply as a speaker that is loud. They work as you'd expect, and you can load more from the JBL app. The equalizer is a fun touch. \"But our phones have equalizers too...\" yeah except you can turn on Echo for the speaker, which, you guessed it, is a smaller echo of the song. You can control the intensity of the echo. In a party setting, I could only imagine this would pop off with Karaoke. In addition, Karaoke gutair and mic has their own set of EQ knobs for a very precise tune.Volume - It's loud. It's so loud that having the volume at 8 of 16 on my iPhone with bass boost 1 or 2 activated would hurt my ears after being 4 feet away from it while it was pointed away from me and on the opposite side of a wall. 12 of 16 and I could hear it all the way across the Burger King that I work at, and I could faintly hear music all the way at the dumpsters outside (about 130 feet away. Keep in mind the speaker was inside and I was outside). This is probably the loudest speaker I've heard in a long time, if not, the loudest I've ever heard. And, yea, it still sounds nice from far away.Cons - You can seriously hurt you ears with this speaker. Of course, you'd have to have prolonged exposure at max settings. But still, be wary. This isn't a true con since earbuds can also damage your ears. It's just more of a warning to those of y'all that haven't had a hot and heavy speaker before that this is big Bertha but only breakfast.Cons - The speaker can be oriented in 3 ways: standing, on one side, or on the other side. The speaker is not meant to have the front facing up. Not a big dealCons - There really is nothing major to complain about except the price, but trust me, you get what you pay for.",
