Time will tell if it will last in the Miami weather. Now my family wants to add more outdoor speakers. We use them with a Sony Two channel receiver.",

                "reviewText": "What o like about them is the mids and highs I'm pushing them on the Yamaha Rx-v638 and boy do they sing. Now granted the Yamaha is overpowering them but I limit the volume to -10db on master volume. If you looking for bass up top these ain't for you I bought them for surround sound fronts and let my 250w rms subwoofer handle the bass. They sound good paired with a good sub they are temporary but I can understand why someone would be content with going to order 2 more pair if the price is the same but I got my eyes on klipsh for more depth in two channel mode when listening to music they make great surround sound speakers though just no bass to judge by so keep that in mind. Update anyone?? Ok so when they say 10 to 80 watts it's more like 10 to 40 unless you play them above 100- 120hz they don't like low frequency so that 90hz will pass if your playing on a source that does not exceed 40 watts rms. That said they sound great on hometheater system I'm relying on my sub for low frequencies which will change when I find a better center channel you don't need much to push them but if your into rnb/hiphop get a sub, they are crisp I highs and midslows are lack luster unless for movies and TV series. For context, I'm using the Yamaha rx-v638 which I know is to strong for these but music is not the purpose of purchase. I limit my receiver to -15db, and it tops out at +15db I'm about clarity over loudness and I'm more than satisfied with the results. Besides I like having the more power in the reserves let's my know I'm not pushing my receiver to hard. I don't plan on buying a power amp with this receiver cause it only has 2 channel pre-outs. But for a 5.2.2 these speakers are great. The grills are not mentioned to be taken off so don't, my guess is people like to see the woofer move. But let me tell you if it's moving to your liking then they won't last long and again bass and longevity don't walk hand in hand with these guys. So take it easy, huh. Oh and people buy these for outside fun please don't I live in New England and they wouldn't last a year out here in my humble opinion. We get all four seasons to the definition out here, lol. We'll that's my review if they die on me will let you know now that your reading this you have an idea on how they were used and treated with care of course like I treat my dog. Good luck!!!",

I have one auxiliary volume knob, and didnt want to buy and install many more. This is way easier and does the trick.many of my speakers are the rock shaped ones on the ground, but for the ones that arent I am now planning to upgrade to these.I am using them with a 1500 watt amplifier, and some of them are wired over 100ft away from the amp. I am not sure how much power I am giving to each speaker, but they can be cranked up pretty loud and dont distort like my previous speakers did.I dont have a lot of bass going to my speakers, because I have separate sub woofers, but they do have more bass than any of my other speakers without changing any settings. These are much bigger than I expected. They do match the measurements, but they are over double the size of the speakers they replaced.If I didnt need the individual speakers to be switchable, and didnt need so many speakers, I would probably go for something a bit more high end.. but these are the perfect speakers for me.These speakers are mounted outside on a wooden beam. They do not have a wall behind them, which would make them sound better. I would tell anyone interested in outdoor sound to try these!",

The sound is important, but equally important is having the amp run cool since it will be inside a weather-proof box. I honestly surprised at how good the sound quality is for the price and 8\" woofer size. If this holds up over time, it's a deal. I wanted to get the quasi-legendary Dayton IO8XTB but those are out of stock for several months and I need them for a project. For my needs, I don't need great deep base (though that'd be a plus). But can say these 8\" woofers do a decent job with it. I read a review of OSD's other 8\" oudoor speakers, the AP840. That reviewer opened them up and found poor-quaity crossover conenctions. I'm hoping that this set is upgraded, and was willing to pay a little more for it. Time will tell. So far I'm happy with the purchase.",

The 8\" woofers provide the sound I was looking for outside. You won't be disapppointed. Couple other small things to note. They're fairly large (you can't get 8\" woofer in anything smaller) and supposed built to withstand weather, but suggest the manufacturer sell some type of small covers to protect from sun/rain. They're last longer, since I only use mine on weekends. Crystal clear sound and provide enjoyable listening.",

One caution is that these speakers are quite heavy so be sure to use strong anchors for the wall/eaves brackets.
