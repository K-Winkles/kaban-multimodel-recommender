                "reviewText": "Great little speaker! Got this to wear around when I am doing chores or working. Clips easily onto a belt loop, also its waterproof so you can clip it on the shower curtain hanger or something when showering. It's not so big that you can't clip it on your belt and go jogging. It's about the size of a smallish single patty hamburger. Gets decently loud; will fill a normal sized room, nothing earshattering but fine. The sound is a bit weak and muddy in the bass of course, but it's really not too bad. The spoken voice and singing range is very clear though, so although your electronic/dance/club etc music will sound washed out, pop and rock should be okay. Good for listening to audio books, podcasts, also listened to a classical piano performance and it was nice. For the money it's awesome; I charged it when I first got it and have been playing it a few hours a day for three days now, haven't needed to recharge it yet. Worth the money. Thumbs up.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this because I travel a lot for work and always wish I had a small speaker to listen to music while in my hotel room rather than using my earbuds (I prefer to save my earbud battery life). Instead, I ended up using this thing ALL THE TIME! I use it in my hotel room, outside on the porch, in the shower (because waterproof!), outside around the firepit and I also end up taking it from room to while I clean when I don't want to disturb the entire house with surround sound. I do NOT recommend submerging this speaker but I did accidentally drop mine in the bath and it's been totally fine since. The sound is clear, with a surprising amount of bass, and it can be clipped onto almost anything - highly recommend purchasing a skin/case like the one I have so that it can stand on it's own.Many of the negative reviews mentioned a mediocre sound quality or battery life but, I think to be fair, you must consider that this is a tiny handheld speaker not intended to sound like a home stereo sound system or sound bar. It's also important to keep in mind that the battery life depends on whether you have the volume on full blast every time you use it (I normally do and I still find that about 8-10hrs of run time is pretty accurate). Also keep in mind that the speaker turns off after about 20 minutes of idle time - so if you fail to turn it off every time you use it, that time it takes to turn off takes away from your overall battery life. Even with these things, I still give this thing 5 stars overall. I even purchased one for my best friend.The ONLY cons I have found that affect my experience, but aren't big enough of a deal to sway how much I love this product, are:1. You can double-press the play button to go to the next song, but there is no way to restart or go back to a previous song (this is annoying if you accidentally skip a song you wanted to hear)2. This model does NOT connect or sync with the JBL app (not a deal breaker but would be a nice option)",

This definitely did not disappoint. It clipped right onto our beach bag, and most importantly, stayed clipped to our beach bag. Hooking up Bluetooth was a breeze, and the sound quality was great. I mean, it didn\u2019t bug the neighbors, but we definitely enjoyed some tunes while hiding our snacks from the seagulls. And the best part was I didn\u2019t have to constantly keep taking my headphones out for every question my wife had for me. Win/win! Buy it, you\u2019ll like it.",
