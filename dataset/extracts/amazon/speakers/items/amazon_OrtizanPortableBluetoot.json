                "reviewText": "I am quite impressed with this lil guy. It was so fairly priced that I was sure it would be super weak, but it BUMPS.Durable, great quality, aesthetically appealing (love the lights!), and perfect for travel! Super easy to set up too.My car\u2019s Bluetooth/aux/USB broke (yes all of them), so I am stuck listening to the radio when I drive. I started going a little cray without my daily dose of music, but since I can\u2019t justify spending tons of $$ on a non-life threatening car issue right now, I had to get creative! This bluetooth speaker does the trick.My car is a very tiny ford fiesta. When I blast my music via this speaker, I swear my car starts vibrating & swaying. (But, I mean it is a \u201cfiesta\u201d on wheels; it\u2019s got colorful changing LED lights throughout the interior\u2014- so it prob was a club kid in its heyday...). My actual car speakers don\u2019t even make my car dance like that! Since it\u2019s connected to my phone, I am able to change/pause/play the music via voice control (to my phone) which means I can use the speaker hands-free. The sound is so crystal clear and it has a surprisingly intense bass for such a lil thing.It\u2019s great for parties too! We've used it for two gatherings we\u2019ve had recently with about 25 people both times and you could hear it perfectly! The charge lasted all night too.Def recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "This is great value for the money. It sounds infinitely better with a sound booster app. with volume enhancement and equalizer, etc. Also, to greatly enhance sound quality you should rotate the drum until the sound is pointing straight at you, or slightly to the side to get to the buttons easily. I like that it's shorter than other brands and fits on the upper part of the down tube of my bicycle with a universal strap on water bottle holder. That leaves room for two long water bottles to fit in their usual places on the rest of the down tube and seat tube for long rides in hotter weather, now with music and podcasts also. Even though the music is blaring I can easily hear everything around me, which is totally different than with ear phones. It's also an additional safety factor because I get noticed by pedestrians with their dogs. I believe that the variably flashing subwoofer lights also attract the attention of motorists front and rear. It works equally well with blue tooth or audio cable, so I'll stick with audio cable for health and to save power. I could not ask for a better speaker for my needs than this. If this all makes sense to you then buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Ortizan Bluetooth Speakers to use for movie nights on our patio and listening to music both in and outdoors. I've really enjoyed them so far. I have a covered patio on which I hang a screen to watch movies. I have one Bluetooth speaker, but I really wanted two to achieve the \"drive-in ambiance\" I was seeking. With the help of some carabiners, I hung the speakers on each side of the screen so the sound would project outward. It sounded great! The volume can get quite high without distortion. The quality is more than sufficient for my needs. With them being IPX7, I can leave them out even if we get a light rain without them getting ruined if I don't have time to take them in.I've tested how long the battery lasts with the flashing lights turned on. I've gotten about 15 hours before the very annoying \"beeping\" or a \"cutting out sound\" starts. I read about the beeping in other reviews, not only for this one but for other manufacturers as well. I have no idea what is up with that. Why tick off customers with that? I don't know how much juice was left in the battery because I couldn't stand listening to this annoyance for very long. At first, I thought it was notifications from my phone. Sadly, no. I didn't test how long the battery lasts without the lights on, but it would obviously be longer.Getting one speaker connected via Bluetooth was pretty easy. It was getting two of them paired that was an issue. One reviewer mentioned that you need to remember which one you connected via Bluetooth first and always connect that one first to avoid issues. Once I finally remembered that, I haven't had an issue connecting and pairing them since. I selected a bright carabiner color to attach to the speaker that I need to connect to Bluetooth first. Then I turn on the other speaker to pair them. Has worked 100% of the time so far. I even connected the speakers to my projector without a hitch. So that was a bright spot. I've also connected it to my Smart TV without issue.I'm very satisfied thus far with the quality, durability and sound. I would never use the speakers for 15 or even 10 hours straight, so having to charge them in between is no problem to avoid the low battery annoyance. My 3-year-old great-niece enjoyed listening to Disney music while playing in the yard sprinkler! When I took the speakers down, she wanted to help carry one but ended up dropping one on the patio. It still works fine, so I can say it can at least withstand a drop on concrete.If you don't need high-end sound quality, these are great for the price point. I ordered the blue color and love it. I also like the design of it and that it is mostly waterproof. The flashing lights can provide a fun atmosphere especially when used at a party. The kids like it too!",

I was looking into the JBL Flip 6, for a hundred and fifty, but I decided to go off brand and try two of these (black and blue) for about ninety bucks. The black came ahead of schedule, so happy to give this a try first. It came in a sealed box. Includes a tiny QSG/manual, the wireless speaker, lanyard already attached, 3.5mm audio cable, and a USB-A to C charging cable.Connected to my iPhone XR easily. 75% pre-charged, then just turned on some tunes. It\u2019s actually not bad at all. Loud enough. My kids love the LED lights on both ends. Keep the lanyard on to prevent it from rolling around. I can\u2019t wait for the blue one to come. PS. the music sounds better in person compared to the video I uploaded; I haven\u2019t played with this the whole day so can\u2019t comment on battery life yet. I should have an update by the time the blue one comes in. But so far so good. Decent sound, great value.\u2022\u2022\u2022Update\u2022\u2022\u2022Received the blue unit today. Blue colour looks pretty good. Main differences between my black and blue units\u2014the blue unit doesn\u2019t have ORTIZAN logos printed on each end; the flap for the port sits flushed vs the black unit\u2019s more recessed. Blue unit came in 30% pre-charged.Video: Tested with units linked together, sound is pretty good. You have to connect one speaker to the other before connecting to your smartphone. It emits 5-6 beeps every minute once it hits 25% battery life remaining (in the first few seconds of the video).It took about 10-12hrs of music play with LED lit up to go from 75% down to 25% battery life (50%). I wish there was a way to disable the low battery beeps considering there\u2019s still at least a few more hours left of power.",
