Although some game controllers do have 3.5mm audio output, plugging the green source plug into the controller can damage the source plug. If using the speakers this way it is recommended to use an AUX cable and the Aux port on the control pod. Do I need to install drivers for this?

                "reviewText": "Wow. I have had various stereo and speaker combinations in the past, for different use-cases and under different circumstances; and for a home computer system in a bedroom that needs to be beefy yet compact, and offer quality features without being overly complicated, I really don't think there's a better offer out there. I would have paid $90 for it, easily (probably shouldn't say that - but hey, now I can buy two).Make sure you take your time, read what the inputs and outputs are, and TURN THE VOLUME ALL THE WAY DOWN (as well as turning the power off on the dial that comes with it). You wouldn't want to start your experience with this thing by having it blow out your ears - which it would. So just a quick precaution there. But beyond that, it was VERY simple to setup and the output for the tweeter pair that come with it is on the back of the woofer. And that's probably the last time you will have to deal with the woofer, thanks to their handy-dandy dial (be careful when handling the woofer so as not to impress the open speaker on the bottom, just fyi). I also elected to put the woofer on the floor instead of the desk (so as not to rattle my hard drives), and I can't even tell it's there because of how much the sound fills the room.The first track I put on to try it out HAD to be \"Bad Boys,\" by Inner Circle - that song will always tell you what you're working with. I didn't hear any distortion unless I pumped it up way beyond what would be comfortable for me to listen to, and even at that, I had the woofer on 100% (which you generally don't need to do). The tweeters are bright, maybe brighter than one might expect, but when you get your woofer to 75% or so and dial-in that perfect balance, you will find that they really complement eachother and nothing feels lacking. Just to compare, I switched output to my desktop bluetooth speaker I was using previously (not a cheap one), and bam - it made that old speaker sound like a joke by comparison. I just couldn't believe how much audio detail and finer dynamic range I was missing. Such an improvement.I have this setup to come out of a home studio style mixer/audio interface combo, which receives its own audio signal from the computer. I've got to tell you - ABSOLUTELY amazing. Blew my mind, and that was without any EQ enhancement!Some reviewers have commented that the power button stops working after a certain amount of time... well as mentioned, part of the reason I bought this was to replace a desktop bluetooth speaker - which constantly turns off when not being used. And I wanted something that would just stay ON all the time, so I don't think that will be a problem for me. Also, the \"auxiliary\" output doesn't seem to work, but I haven't tried it with all possible receiving equipment, so I won't include that determination in my review. And honestly, even if I did, I believe I would still be rating it 5 stars.What sealed the deal in me taking a chance on this unit was that I also saw it was featured as part of a \"Small Business\" support type campaign in the description, and when I get a chance, I like to support small and up-and-coming enterprises. And as is often the case, I'm very glad I did.Bottom line? WORTH THE SHOT.",

They are much better than expected. The controller is great, very easy to adjust for the level of outside noise I want to cover up. The quality and workmanship are good. Hope they last a long time. If you turn the bass off the desktop speakers do not sound good by themselves, very tinny, but together they sound great.",

No warning, no moving them around, not even touched, and now, they don't work at all! DO NOT BUY!! Not worth the money. DO NOT RECOMMEND!08/19/2023 UPDATE! Cyber Acoustics reached out to me after reading my review. They had me send them pics of the unit to make sure it wasn't something that I had done, and offered to replace the unit for me for free. They were very fast and the gentleman that I interacted with was very pleasant. The customer service was FANTASTIC!!! I am currently testing out the new unit, so far it has been AWESOME! The sound is amazing for the price. Very clean and crisp mids and high end, bass is noticeable but does not compromise the integrity of the other sounds when turned up. So far LOVING THIS UNIT!! Thanks Cyber Acoustics for being awesome!",

I would recommend doing what I do: in addition to this unit I use two primarily midrange speakers, each with a three inch speaker (a cone I assume) to cover the midrange. With those added, you'll have a dynamite little sound system! I use a pair of Logitech speakers that include their own amplifier. I purchased them so long ago that I can't remember the model name/number. Sorry about that...The subwoofer is quite small but it does OK.Simple and easy to install !!! All that I had to do was plug in three plugs and it was up and running!",

                "reviewText": "I got these to replace an more expensive set of speakers that were twice the price, but it had developed a short in the cord that just kept getting worse. A friend helped me splice a new plug onto it, but that didn't last long. For a while I was just using my Alexa speaker, which has decent sound for what it is, but that doesn't compare to something with a subwoofer.I debated back and forth between this model and the two similar models with higher watts, but eventually settled on this on.It is really good! It's very loud, and was very easy to hookup.One review mentioned the volume adjuster part, which is two wires connected to a circle, and how it was poorly designed because the plugs are on the front... I almost didn't get this because of that, but it's not a concern whatsoever. Those to plugs are only for headphones or axillary, not for just plugging it in. And even so, I didn't find it to be in the way.The only cons, which seem to be very common with all of these, doesn't matter the brand, is that the audio cables and the speaker wires are hard wired. I don't understand why they can't just make these removable plugs. Not only does it make setup a lot easier (putting the speaker where you want it and then running the wires, rather than having to move things and adjust things out of the way because everything is connected), but it doesn't allow you to replace them later if they get damaged (or if you just wanted a longer cable).",
