Our older-but-still-quality Yamaha 7.1 amplifier offers separate A/B speakers that we've connected for those speakers, but I've never had a way to manage sound outside. PROBLEM SOLVED! My wife can now play audio books or music from her phone from the screen porch about 30' away. Whether main living area, screen porch or main deck, the tiny Esinkin bluetooth receiver does a great job. As for the sound in the main living area, it sounds great. It's a terrific price for a very impressive, simple device. As it's so small and looks great, I put it on top of our entertainment center behind the TV where it's barely noticeable. Tiny but powerful, I'm very pleased. We'll see how it holds up, but all reviews point to it doing well over time.",

                "reviewText": "Well worth buying if you are looking to make non-wireless audio equipment wireless, using Bluetooth technology. As long as the equipment you want to make wireless has either a 3.5mm audio port, or RCA type Left & Right audio ports you are all set. In my case I wanted to improve connectivity to an excellent (but out-of-date) Bose CD/Radio player. I used the included RCA connections for the radio, and this wireless adapter's corresponding female connections. Then I finished it by using the included power adapter required to power this Bluetooth adapter. When placing my Samsung S5 phone into Bluetooth mode, and after pairing the two devices, it connected immediately to this adapter, transferring all sound to the Bose radio. Both the phone and Bose radio had control over the volume range, although the stereo will have the greatest control, as expected. The resulting audio sound output is excellent - better than I would ever get from the Samsung phone. Obviously, the broadcast quality from a radio station is simply passing through to the audio equipment (and the resulting sound quality is now solely dependent on the quality of the audio equipment you are using). Note: If the sound origin is from your phone, double check the Bluetooth settings for this device, AFTER you have connected to the adapter (select the settings icon adjacent to the name of this adapter to make sure, at a minimum, that Audio is active, and Calls [if available] is deactivated). While you are at it, you have the opportunity to rename the device - especially if you plan to install more of them. With this unit, don't bother to look for an On/Off feature on the unit itself. There isn't one. It's just a small circuit board and it won't put you in the poor-house if it runs 24/7. However - should you be obsessed with only having it on when you use it, just unplug it from the unit itself, instead of unplugging it from an outlet. But a word of caution - No Circuit board likes power surges, brown-outs, or lightening strikes. If you temporarily have electrical supply issues due to an approaching storm, I would immediately unplug it from the wall outlet ASAP, thereby protecting the adapter and the power supply unit. Several folks have, in their review, mentioned that when turning on Bluetooth with their device, it would immediately connect to the adapter (after it's been paired for the first time, of course) rather than let you pick what Bluetooth device you wanted to connect with, as most other Bluetooth devices do. This is true. However, I don't find that to be troublesome at all. First it shows great Reliability and Repeatability (two good Quality Assurance characteristics), and secondly, you can always select another Bluetooth choice displayed, and it will connect to it, and disconnect this adapter. Speaking of Reliability, I have run this Bluetooth adapter for hours at a time, and it has never dropped out, sought re-connection, or displayed any other anomaly.Now, a couple of extra notes about this adapter: Pairing the unit to your originating source is simple. Press and hold the square button in the middle of the unit until the unit has a blinking blue light. Go to your phone/computer/other device that has Bluetooth on, and select this adapter. After it is paired, it will always connect in future use. The power adapter cord measures about 71 inches long. Very generous to reach a wall outlet without using extension cords. However , a multiple outlet extender with surge protection would not be a bad idea. The RCA cord from the adapter to your attached system measures about 61 inches - plenty to do the job. The included pictorial instructions show a variety of connection choices and is very good. The box that everything comes in is very strong & sturdy (a keeper), but I found the slide-on outer \"description-advertising\" cover to be very tight to the box and wouldn't come off without tearing it, which I didn't want to do. So, I used a thin knife and slid it along the glue line of the overlapping paper (where the bar-code is printed), and it came right off. Afterwords, I used one run of adhesive tape to rejoin them with just a little more separation so that the slide-on cover would be easier for on/off use.The unit does provide a 3.5mm cable connector, but I did not try it. I used the RCA cable instead, which works as I expected it to. Before I discovered and bought this adapter, I had connected a 3.5mm connector directly from my phone to the same type connection on the Bose radio, and although it played, the volume was next to nothing, even with everything turned up, both on the phone and the Bose radio. Not acceptable. On top of that, it would force the phone to be hardwire tethered to the Bose radio. Again, not acceptable. The only solution was to buy and use this great adapter as described earlier. This also gives me freedom to go into any other room and still be connected, and listen to audio (locally from the phone, or via a streaming internet connection ) broadcast through the Bose radio!I love it when a plan comes together! I plan to buy two more of these, one to connect to my TV, and one for a spare backup. Enjoy one of these! You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "I don't write many reviews but this product deserves 5 stars and a review. First, it comes well-packaged. Very secure. In fact, It was the toughest challenge with the product. Getting it out of the box. But all the necessary cables are included and it was extremely easy to set up. Essentially, there was nothing to set up. I plugged in my RCA cables from my Bose speakers and plugged the adapter into the wall outlet. I opened Bluetooth on my Android Samsung 10 phone and scanned for the Esinkin Bluetooth receiver. Within a minute they were paired and connected. No frustration which I have had with other Bluetooth devices. It works perfectly. Extremely pleased and I would give it more stars if possible.",

I found the pictograph instructions easy to follow notwithstanding I had read reviews that others thought they were deficient. Possibly, they have been updated since then. Easy to link my phone to this receiver. This unit turns on automatically when powered up. If you wish to turn it on or off manually, then you depress the power button (the only button) for 3 seconds. To get it to go into pairing mode when it is powered on you press the button quickly and release it. This is backwards to what I would normally expect but doesn't cause any problems in actual use. The sound seems fine. I have only had it for two weeks so cannot comment on its longevity.",
