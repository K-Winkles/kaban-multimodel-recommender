                "reviewText": "I had a \"hockey puck\" style Alexa speaker in my bedroom that just bit the dust, so I decided to upgrade to the Pop. It was cute, reasonably priced, and seemed to be more suitable for my room than the old unit (the Pop's speaker can be turned in any direction.)I was not expecting to be as impressed by this unit as I was.Setup was a breeze-I was able to transfer the settings from my old unit to the new one painlessly, and I was up and running in about 10 minutes.Out of the box I was impressed by its appearance, its lovely shade of teal that contrasts nicely with my peach walls, a lighter weight, and a smaller footprint.The best thing is that the notification light is at the Top of the Pop. :) I keep my speaker in a corner of an entertainment centre so the bass can be amplified - the hockey puck unit and the big ugly \"dome\" unit in my bathroom have the notification lights in locations that are much harder to see at a distance, and I like the fact I can see the notification \"arc\" clearly from across the room.Another plus: This unit also seems to respond to my commands faster than my older ones.The biggest advantage the pop has, however, is the SOUND!I always do the \"speaker in the corner\" trick to amp up the bass, but honestly, if you turn the bass setting up on the app, you don't have to do that.The sound is rich, full, and lifelike - I listen to a lot of Jazz and it sounds amazing on this speaker. Classical sounds lovely as well, and I have to reduce the bass a bit when listening to Dub Techno, because it gets a little rattly.Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and I will probably replace the larger unit in the bathroom with another Pop.I would love to see this offered in a nice shade of coral!",

                "reviewText": "I love the small size. It fits everywhere. Right now it is on my nightstand. A friend of mine just got the Amazon Dot. I was impressed by its sound. I decided to buy one but they are expensive. Then I saw the Pop while browsing Amazon. It was a steal at 17.99. I bought one immediately. I did not expect much when I saw it. It was easy to set up, I used my Amazon account. The sound quality is quite good. I listen to music mostly. I realize that the Dot probably has somewhat better audio, but I am quite pleased with the pop.I keep it on a classical music station while I sleep, it is relaxing. I adjusted the equalizer and it made an improvement on the sound. If I want bigger sound and volume I can use the Bluetooth and connect it to my system\u2019s Edifier speakers. I have tried this and it works well. So much for whatever limitations the audio on the Pop has. I do not understand the reviewers who write negative comments about the Pop. I am quite pleased with it. This is my first foray into Alexa. So far I really like it and cannot believe all you can do with it. I cannot wait to explore further. You cannot go wrong with the Amazon Pop. It does lack temperature control, and proximity sensor, both of which I do not need. I highly recommend this speaker, especially at its price. Buy one, you will be pleased with it. The setup is very easy, and it can be controlled with your smartphone. I am very pleased with it.",
