                "reviewText": "So I had this speaker for over a month now and I use it for work. Just about 8 hours a day it will stay on and majority of the time it will be on max volume. There was only one speaker that didn\u2019t blow that I used to have but I lost it and I\u2019ve gotten replacements and they all blew out fairly quick. This speaker has not once distorted or messed up in any way. I have my equalizer set for more deeper bass and this little thing can handle it like a champ. I\u2019m in love with this speaker and especially for the price you cannot beat it. Videos don\u2019t do it justice with the sound quality. Hard hitting bass songs will rattle the speaker which is cool lol I like it. They said you can pair two with it and my goal is to get another so I can have two and make a little enclosure on it for work. I don\u2019t think the wattage does any difference for these little guys. I had 20w and 40w Bluetooth speakers and they sound about the same but with thump. This is well worth it. Not too big not too small. I work fixing up buildings and it fills the rooms quite nice, 2 would fill it up even better though. But yeah I waited to write a review just to see how long it would last at the workplace and it\u2019s held up really well. I recommend it, especially for the price this quality is really good. I mean unless you wanna probably pay over 100 or something so be it but this speaker is pretty nice.",

                "reviewText": "The sound is incredible for such a small device. I bought a second one in black after buying the first one in blue. Both sound great. Top (silver part) actually vibrates if you are playing music with a lot of bass sounds. One HUGE thing I discovered is that if you have music downloaded to a thumb drive (this is why I purchased this particular speaker because it allows you to play music from a thumb drive)... is that the music you download MUST be recorded as MP3 format. This assumes you are 'old school' and have a lot of music still on CD's that you have transfered to a thumb drive. If you download your CD via Windows Media Player make sure you go to 1. Tools, 2. Options 3. Rip Music - pull down option arrow and stop at MP3. 4. Hit 'okay'. Now you are set! If the music you download is on another format (ie, not MP3) it may show on your thumb drive listing, but it will not play in this stereo. I think this is why there were some comments about the stereo 'not working'. Again.. love this stereo player. Well worth the money.",
