                "reviewText": "The sound is barely louder than my laptop internal speaker. It's fiddly bc it needs 2 cords (usb for power & headphone jack to connect to device/ laptop). The benefit is you can place the speakers closer to the person hearing the sound, so still useful, but it's not a significant increase in volume- it just moves the volume closer to you. And they're very cute & fun, as the kids pointed out.",
