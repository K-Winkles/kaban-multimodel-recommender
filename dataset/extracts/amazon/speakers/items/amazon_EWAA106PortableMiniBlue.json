Making Moments Special From the begining, we were thinking of making such a speaker: It should be small, so it can be taken and enjoyed anywhere. So, we defined the size as 1.89* 1.57'', just like an egg. It was originally packed with a hard EVA case to allow the speaker to play music when inside and to protect the speaker from scratches. It should be loud, beyond the limit of the size. So, we equipped the speaker with a custom-made, high performance 3W neodymium driver, which delivers a loud and balanced sound. It should have an incredible bass. Previously, the biggest pain point of small size speakers was the weakness of the bass performance. In such a tiny space, we needed to add the driver, the battery and all electronic components inside. Besides, through our innovative technology, the EWA A106Pro speaker was equipped with a passive radiator, which is why it released such amazing bass, this needed to fit too. It should be simple and delicate. People like something that is small and delicate, so we used metal materials, and followed a minimalism design. People do not like complicated technology, thus we gave up needless functions such as a 3.5mm AUX-in, NFC, microphone. And other buttons were also abandoned apart from just one, with an LED indicator. This is the EWA A106Pro, an unparalleled Mini Portable Bluetooth Speaker. We hope people love it and take it everywhere with them.",

                "reviewText": "I have quite a few BT speakers for different needs, most of which are filled. But I saw this little thing and based on reviews, discounted price (about $22), and sheer curiosity I figured I have nothing to lose, and of course Amazon\u2019s easy returns.First, it\u2019s indeed a keeper. 1. Great price. 2. Very high quality and sturdy feeling build. 3. So small you can literally take it anywhere in a pocket. 4. Dead Cheap. Skip 2 of your fancy morning coffees\u2026It does get shockingly loud, it\u2019s unbelievable so much sound comes from something so small. It remains clear even at upper volumes, but the the bass does get overpowered by the highs the louder you go, like most small speakers. It will indeed light up a small room!The \u201ckeep your expectations realistic\u201d part of the review. The bass\u2026 it is there, and for a micro speaker pretty good, but physics\u2026 Bass requires pushing around a lot of air, and that needs size, plain and simple. This isn\u2019t gonna shake your fillings loose, the end.Also, you are asking one litte mono pod speaker to do a lot, so when listening to complex, multi layered music, you do not get the separation and clarity you would out of a multi-speaker unit. It can get a little muddled, again this is unavoidable, and very picky.Overall, it is a great litte buy. Beautiful and if it lasts, quality little speaker.",

I love quick charging, the small size that allows you to stick it in your pocket, the great loud sound quality, and how easy it is to use and connect via Bluetooth! I originally bought it for a prank with a coworker at work. After that, I have decided to use it everywhere I go instead of using my phone speaker. I wouldn't say the speaker is heavy, but it definitely isn't as light as I figured it would be due to its size. It is still light enough for me to stick it in my pocket or mini purse and take with me anywhere. I would recommend this to anyone and I would buy this again for sure!",

                "reviewText": "Usually speakers this small do not sound good. I own 3 bluetooth speakers of varying sizes bought over 9 years. The EWA speaker sounds very good for its tiny size. It has decent bass and hits the mid-range and high notes with great clarity. This thing is small enough to easily fit in my pocket, purse, beach bag or even in the cupholder in a car. You can feel the little speaker pulsing with the beats. While something this tiny will never have as much deep bass as much larger, dual speaker cone models, this is a winner for size and ease of use.It appears to be well-made, came very nicely packaged with a short usb-c charging cable (same as my phone so very convenient on the go) and it's really simple to use - just one button does it all and since that button lights up - it's really easy to use at night. My other small bluetooth speaker has tiny buttons you can't see in the dark and are hard to touch because they are under the housing a bit. The weight of this EWA speaker makes it feel like a quality device. Pairing was quick and easy with my Galaxy S21+. The travel case and ring that came packaged with it are really nice to have so you can clip this to a backpack, bike, your beltloop or hang it on a tree, beach umbrella or whatever.All-around impressive little speaker for the price and size. I purchased this for use on vacation so I was looking for something that was waterproof and small enough to pack in my electronics gear case with my cords and chargers.Bonus bit of info - if you have a USB-C to USB-C phone cable, you can charge this little speaker right from your phone for extended play time. You can also play it while it's connected by USB to your phone for charging. Playback only works if the speaker has some charge on it first - if it's totally dead, allow about 15 minutes of charging to happen before playing to it while charging with your phone. The speaker has a 700 mAh battery so it only takes about 2 hours to charge from zero, but if playing while it's charging that charge time will be a bit longer - in my test it took 2.5 hours to charge while being used.",

                "reviewText": "I love this speaker; it's inexpensive, and suits my needs pretty well. Definitely use it in the case for the best sound. The sound does not distort at high volume, the bass is strong, and it's sturdy (I have dropped it a few times with, and without, the case-no damage). I use it primarily for personal listening of all types of soft and loud music, and podcasts. The battery lasts more than long enough for several hours on medium to high volume. It only falls short of 5 stars for two reasons: a. you can only control the volume from your phone; b. they cannot be paired. But I love it and I bought one for my mom after she was smitten with mine.",
