                "reviewText": "Have an old laptop that is still good for browsing or watching streamed movies. The interior speakers, while stereo are barely functioning. The maximum audio level is very low. I was looking for an inexpensive and simply solution. Enter this speaker.Pros:- a single USB plug, cant be user than that- volume control knob- power thru USB, not tangled mess for AC power- lightweightCons:- when volume knob is used to turn volume very low, Windows reverts to internal speakers for output (not necessarily a bad thing)- its mono, not stereoProduct Packaging and Aesthetics:Simple design. Good feel on the knob. Maybe a white or grey color would be nice, but the black is also fineProduct Quality and Durability:My initial views on product quality and durability are:I am unable to comment, with personal experience, on long term quality and durability.Considering the material and construction, I feel that this speaker is reasonable quality. Given its price point, I am not expecting a Ferrari in quality. Its works.Using a scale of Poor, Average, and Excellent for product Quality and Durability.Personal Rating: averageProduct Value:This review is not explicitly about the cost, rather the personal value at that price point.At this time of this review this product was priced approximately $13. For a non-powers, mono speaker, I think this is a reasonable value. The cord is long enough. There is a knob to turn from zero to max. It would be nice to be a couple bucks cheaper, but it doesn't break the bankConsidering my own option on the value for this cost where Poor means its overpriced. Average means its priced appropriately. Excellent means its great value for the price.Personal Rating: (slightly below) averageProduce Origin:Made in ChinaConclusion: Is this a buy or a keep looking?Considering the build quality, the price, and the features, I think this is a BUY.Would I recommend this: YesDisclosure:This is my own personal Amazon Vine review. It is an honest and true account of my own views, opinions, reactions, expectations relating to this product. I did not purchase this product, however I was provided this product for the expressed purpose of providing a review.",

I was looking for an inexpensive computer speaker just to have sound and ran across this inexpensive option. I was not looking for stereo sound or anything fancy. It just plugs in via USB and has a volume control - very simple. Turn the volume control counterclockwise all the way until it clicks and power is off with no sound. Turn it clockwise past the click to turn it on then you adjust the volume level with the knob.Sound is pretty decent and is can get fairly loud so this could be a good speaker for a small conference room presentation. I love that it does not require any power adapter or anything extra - just plug in the USB cable and it supplies the power and the data feed for the sound.Perfect for my use and is a great value.",
