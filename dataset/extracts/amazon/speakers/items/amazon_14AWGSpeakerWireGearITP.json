No brainer.Coper Clad Aluminum vs Oxygen free Copper: What the manufacture say is true. For audio applications there is absolutely no change in audio quality. What the manufactures forgot to say is that long cables CCA will significantly increase resistance consequently reducing the power to the speakers. CCA conductors have 55-60% higher resistance than copper. So again, long installations, big no no.Short cables, don't matter.It does have the advertised 2.5mm cable diameter which can conduct up to 20A which is probably 100 times more than most consumer applications need in terms of power.The cable is marked red / black which makes it super easy to install.Overall a really inexpensive cable that will work well for short length installations. I would NOT run 100 ft of those CCA and put a speaker at the end.Good buy!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this 14 gauge wire spool, not expecting much. My previous wire set had oxidized badly. It was a 16 gauge pure copper wire with a long ran of 26 feet to the Left & Right surround speakers, a pair of Klipsch RP-280F tower, powered by a high current Outlaw 5000X amplifier. I chose this 14 gauge wire knowing its comparatively cheaper to a comparable pure copper, expecting that because its cheaper, sound quality will be degraded. Boy was I wrong! After installation, I noticed that the sound from both the highs and mids are crisper, the bass fuller. I highly recommend this product if your wire ran is not longer than say 50 feet.",
