                "reviewText": "I am somewhat disappointed in the sound these produce. - This is my experience, with my discerning ears and taste in audio. - But i also realize the price range, the expectation cant be for $1000, or even $500 speakers, and not like my JBL 305'sI like high Hi's ....middle of the way Mid's and deep punchy bass without forgetting the mid to high bass.These speakers do cover a lot of those bases, and for many it may be an outstanding deal.For me, given the reviews here, i was a little put off when i got them, not totally disappointed, just let down a little.I considered keeping them for my son but opted not to and returned them once Saiyin replaced them for the 6801K - though they sent me the old version when advised i would get the newer version with the horn tweeter, not the done tweeter.***Build qualityVisual quality - excellent, super nice looking speakers with the grill on or off, although the LED lights in the front should not be the size (actually larger) than a pencil erasure and should only light up based on the input selected (color coded lights per input method maybe.Saiyin - all that is needed are tiny lights, you don't need big led's like you have now.They are not very heavy and the external aesthetics are very appealing.Vibrations/Rattle at high volume - nonexistent - perfect.***Audio QualityLoudness - Oh my gosh yes, very loud, i did not test distortion much but they handle and extremely high volume level.Treble - This is one of my sticking points, though its not BAD, just not what i want in a speaker.The version without the Treble and Bass are limited, they don't offer any wiggle room without a pre-amp/EQ, which for those who have one, many lucky you, get these speakers!If you don't, then you should look at the 6801K for the Treble controlDon't get me wrong, the treble is there, its nice, but it wasn't what i wanted.Bass - more than enough for such a small little woofer and small enclosure, in fact wow, WOW, huge bass for what they are.Its tuned perfectly, for what they are but what would be nice, really nice, is maybe an alternate version that uses a Bass Reflex type ported enclosure because it offers an extremely elevated level of punch to your bass. even porting it from the rear so that bass bounces off the walls.a full 5\" and 8\" woofer/subwoofer version with larger horn tweeters and a midrange speaker would be putting many speaker people out of business - Edifier i am talking to you.***Customer ServiceMy experience with Saiyin has been nothing but phenomenal, the rep I dealt with was polite, understanding, helpful and even replaced the speakers I was not personally happy with, with the 6801K speakers which offer separate bass and treble, and a MIC input (which i think is pretty cool)This greatly helped tone down the extra bass because of the chipset tuning and bring up the treble to where i want it (which is treble maxed out, and Bass about 60%)I really really which they offered a 3-way speaker though, man i would replace my JBL305's with those.I still liked the original model, they are 10000% worth every penny, but don't buy them thinking they are JBL Monitors, or B&W or any other high end speaker.Envision cheaply priced speakers, that blow you away, and then blow you away again when you realize that the things are less than $100.They promote them as phonograph speakers, but let me tell you whether its this model or the 6801K they make AMAZING home theater speakers.And depending on how you position them, the need for a sub is down to personal preference, not out of necessity.Original -YES i realize these are TWO-WAY speakers but with a separate tweeter horn there should be more treble here.So far I have only tested Bluetooth and this is what i am basing my reply on, so for now i am keeping the review the way it stands.On the Iphone i had to use the Treble Booster EQ setting which does a lot more than boost trebles, but it made it sound better.I have had other BT adapters that caused heavy bass too so i am hopeful with the RCA or Optical inputs the audio will level out. (hoping)I did not test those as i later reached out to Saiyan and they resolved it (per my above remarks)",

                "reviewText": "I have been living with these speakers for several weeks now and I am quite pleased. Reasonable sound, great value.These are definitely near field speakers. At high volume, treble is too sibilant and quickly fatiguing. Bass has some punch but gets fairly muddy at the lows. I believe they are rated down to 54 \u2013 3.5\u201d woofer. These speakers will not fill a moderate to large room with sound. Mine are set 3 feet from a back wall, 4 feet apart, toed in slightly to hit the listener position about 4 feet out. Separation is good, but soundstage is flat \u2013 nothing up front or behind and little dispersion of the mids and treble.They appear well made \u2013 feels solid and are heavy for their size. They are butt-ugly and have 5 orange indicator lights that are hideous. RCA, Toslink and Bluetooth connectivity \u2013 I\u2019m running RCA out of a TV and BT out of a laptop. Remote is good, BT connectivity good.I live in a studio apartment and never listen loud. Clarity of the mids is excellent at moderate to low volumes and bass is present and pleasant. For my use case these speakers are excellent. This price for powered BT speakers is remarkable. Will they last? Well, made in China so we shall see.With the above considerations \u2013 highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "These desk speakers are truly great for the price point but still have an annoying hiss/static to them. I tried moving the cables and even tried entirely different AUX to RCA cables yet none fixed that hiss. It's enough to be noticeable especially at lower volumes. The actual sound quality has a nice richness to it. I wouldn't recommend these for desk use due to the hiss that these speakers have, but for general room speakers they are a great buy. The Bluetooth functionality is also very easy and well programmed.",

                "reviewText": "To start I don\u2019t have any hissing noises as other reviewers have mentioned. I was mainly looking for inexpensive powered speakers with a sub out that I could connect to my tv. These are exactly what I was looking for and I am genuinely impressed with what you get at this price point.Sound quality: excellent at this price point. They get loud enough for a medium size room (I got around 95db average with a meter). They surprisingly have quite a bit bass for such a small speaker. Only con is I wish they had some kind of real equalizer but not the end of the world.Fit/finish: they seem to be put together well with only small imperfections in the vinyl and nice and snug speakers grills. The only con I have is the led lights, I wish there was on option to turn them off but that is just personal preference.Connecting to tv (tips): like I mentioned, I mainly got these to connect to a tv using an optical cable and I wanted to give the people in the same boat some tips. I used a Samsung tv with a firestick and amazon pro remote. Make sure you go to your tv sound settings and change your output to PCM. You can also use your Amazon pro remote to control your speakers (turn on and off and change volume) so you don\u2019t need to use 2 remotes. The way to do this is to set up a soundbar on your firestick and use the meidong soundbar option.Final thoughts: I don\u2019t know the longevity of these speakers but at this price you can\u2019t beat the sound quality and connectivity you get. You basically get bookshelf speakers, a receiver/amp, and soundbar all in one. Speaking of sound bars, this probably sounds better than any soundbar at 200 and below. I will update if I have any issues but as of now I would highly recommend.",
