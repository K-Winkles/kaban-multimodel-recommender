                "reviewText": "Magnet is huge! Too huge! Seriously, there's no need for a magnet this large on a 6x9 coaxial. I was a car audio installer for half of the '90s, and back then you only saw magnets this large on cheap off-brands from the flea market. I was not expecting this. Also loses points for not including a hardware kit, speaker wire and grills the only accessories in my box.Its for this reason I sadly have to return them. They are so large they don't fit in my car, not even close, way too deep. Please see the photo of the new Blaupunkt 6x9 with the older ('00s?), blown Sony 6x9 I am trying to replace.3 stars for sound quality as i assume they are adequate, but I didn't even get to hear them.",
