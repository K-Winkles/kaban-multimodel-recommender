The volume buttons can be held for FF and RW.There's a button to pair two of these for stereo output.There's a power/pairing button.Three different colors of LED to indicate charge level.Great form factor:No sharp edges. Soft touch materials. Feels durable. Fits in one hand like a small walkie talkie. The charging port is tucked under a rubber plug.Should work well for snowboarding; music and calls.The sound is as fine for such a small speaker. Not sure if a JBL Go 3 would sound any better, but this has 5 watts versus 4 on the JBL.Only real negative is the Amazon description here states 8 Watts and not 5.If I'm being nitpicky it would also help if the buttons were a different color than the rest. Black on black isn't awesome but the layout is very simple, with the volume and multi-function buttons on one side and the power and stereo pairing buttons on top.",

                "reviewText": "I was shopping for a very portable bluetooth speaker recently. It came down to this and a JBL Go 3. I've actually purchased both & compared the two. This little speaker from a company I had never heard of before was VERY surprising. It's LOUDER than the JBL, has more BASS than the JBL & has the same fidelity/sound quality as the JBL. The battery also lasts about twice as long as the JBL. The only thing the JBL improves on is a slightly lower bluetooth latency. But unless you have them next to each other going at the same time, you'll never notice. I also LOVE the full rubberized plastic feel of this little speaker. The carry loop is nice & centered on the speaker, it doesn't make some annoying noise when starting up/connecting, it has a nice cover on the USB-C charging port & even includes a carabiner for latching onto backpacks/etc. I honestly can't recommend this speaker highly enough. If you're looking for a portable bluetooth speaker with amazing sound, this is the one to pick!The seller/manufacturer is also extremely responsive.",

                "reviewText": "This review is based off what I was looking for in a mini speaker. Out the box Boomcore about 3/4 inch longer than JBL Go3, but about the same size on other 2 axis. It's also very similar weight, maybe a smidge lighter. I was looking for something compact that had the kicking vibrating bass of one of my Bogasing M4 Speakers, especially at low volume. I found JBL Go3 1st, then BoomCore. Boomcore got loud, but had the same level if not less vibration bass and kick than G3. But then I discovered something I never messed with. I used my Audio Effects equalizer adjustment from my phone and set to Extreme Bass, then boom both speakers kicked crazy for their sizes. With Extreme Bass Audio Effects equalizer on this little beast woke up and wanted to be the mini bogasing I was looking for, since the BogasingM10 let me down btw, no bass on that, even after Audio Effects. Without adjustments Boomcore just gets really really loud with a decent thumping bass, but with Extreme Bass setting on plus pushing volume up on Boomcore to max, this became my primary ultra mini bass speaker.Note, I have no test results on Battery Life and Water Resistance, it's not my primary speaker. Bose SoundLink Flex is my favorite compact deep bass speaker with my custom settings. Bogasing M4 is my Favorite semi-compact super thumping bass speaker. Boomcore became my favorite mini thumping bass speaker.",

Ich habe ihn erst daheim auf einen Echtholztisch getestet . Fand den Klang dann erst nicht so berauschend. Sp\u00e4ter aufgegangen in der Dusche war er volumin\u00f6ser. Sp\u00e4ter auf dem Desk im B\u00fcro hat er mich dann doch nochmal \u00fcberzeugt. Bei kleinen R\u00e4umen wirkt er vom Klang besser. Als Referenz dazu habe ich daheim auch noch eine. Huawei CM510.
