                "reviewText": "Was rather surprised at the quality of these as I was putting them together. The glass base is a nice looking piano black touch that adds the weight down low required to be stable. The adjustable feet or spikes if you use them on carpet makes it a piece of cake to level and make stable, even if your floor isn't perfectly flat and a little wavey like most floors are. I would recommend these if the height works with your needs since these are fixed, not adjustable.",

                "reviewText": "The speaker stands require assembly, and there are a number of parts, but they are not difficult to put together. They have a decent weight and a small footprint, which the latter is very helpful in a tight space. It will also allow me to free up room on my end tables where my speakers were sitting previously. They provided two options for the feet - pointed for carpet, and flat ones for hard flooring. The last pair of speaker stands I bought did not have feet for hard flooring, which required me to figure out a workaround (buying additional items). I love that it allows you to hide the cables into the tubes of the stand. The plate for the speakers also has pads to help keep your speaker in place, which is very important, especially with hardwood floors and vibrations. Overall, I would definitely recommend these, but be sure they are the right size for your speakers.",

It was easy to assemble and doesn't require too much work. The instructions are in English and easy to understand. I can't imagine these being too easy for the cats to topple over, but the rubber feet for the top help keep the speakers in place so they don't slip. I like how the wire can be hidden inside the stand and out of sight.",

An instruction sheet was also included. The instructions were clear and the stands were easy to put together.The stands surprised me. I didn't expect them to be as nice as they are. They're stable, solid and well-constructed. The base is glass. They're attractive stands and add to the surroundings (as opposed to those that are more utilitarian and you'd want to hide). At 31\" high, when speakers are placed on them, it's a nice height for anyone - and just the right height for those in a sitting position (the tweeters more or less being at ear level).All in all, I'm happy with these stands. Should my experience with them change in the future, I'll update the review.",

                "reviewText": "These speaker stands have been perfect for positioning my Edifier R1280DB bookshelf speakers to a better listening height. I used to have the speakers placed on a low TV table which was slightly less than knee height when sitting, but after I wall mounted my TV higher up, I had been looking for a way to improve my setup so I am glad that I found this product.Assembly was straightforward and easy. The build quality seems sturdy and durable. Sometimes furniture you get on Amazon tends to have bad uniformity when it comes to paint, but the black coating of these stands were nice and uniform. Being able to channel cables through the shaft was a good addition and let me achieve a clean look and helps prevent accidental cable yanking when cleaning especially when vacuuming.I appreciate that it comes with two different kinds of foot pads for wood floors or carpets since I do plan on eventually ripping out my living room's old carpeting and replacing it with wooden flooring. The product also conveniently comes with anti-slip pads for placing on the stand tops.",

The instructions are clear and easy to follow along and it does not take a very long time to assemble both stands.The quality of the stands are very nice . Good solid material used to build them and they\u2019re very stable once assembled. The base feels like a thick glass while the top of the stand feels like thick wood both nicely finished in black.What\u2019s really nice about these stands is that the speaker cords can be fed through the poles for a neat and clean look.They came with two types of feet, one for carpeted flooring and the other for bare floors such as wood.These stands display my speakers in such a modern and chic way.I did have a issue with one of them and it appears that one of the screws when tightened slightly pushed up the top of one of the stands.Apart from that I\u2019m very pleased with them.",
