                "reviewText": "My husband bought one of these JBL flip 5 Bluetooth speakers when he was out of town working so his work crew could listen to music while working. Well when he came home I borrowed his to take to work, I am a nurse at a small nursing home and my residents love to listen to music they will come out of their rooms and sit at their doorways so they can hear my music from my flip 5 speaker that I sit on top of my med cart in the hallway and all my residents can hear such great quality music from such a little device. I will even dance in the hallway with them even if they are in wheelchairs or can stand. It is amazing what some good peppy music does for even the elderly people, I can see their whole attitudes change and the smiles on their faces are priceless. One resident that recently passed away from COVID, was sitting in her doorway months ago as I had my flip 5 on and music playing and I asked her who was her favorite musician or song and I like to fell out when this elderly Caucasian female said Michael Jackson and song was Billie Jean so I looked it up on my phone and played it for her and she was in a wheelchair but she still patted her foot to the music and tapped her hand and fingers on her table and at times I could hear her singing along and this made me so happy to do this for her we had a great time that Sunday afternoon and a memory I will never forget This awesome little cute speaker charges up quickly just a few hours and good to go and I have used mine for a whole 8 plus shift even if not playing music it would still be on and I have yet to hear any low battery beeps etc. My husband loves that they are waterproof because of him working outside in the dirt and rain. He said what sold him on buying one for him was a friend he worked with had one also and forgot his hanging on the basket on a line truck and the next morning he got it and had dirt and mud on it so he took it over to the water hose and washed it off and all the dirt and mud can completely off and the water didn't do anything to this flip 5 speaker he shook it as dry as he could get it then hung it back on his bucket on his line truck and turned it on and worked just as good as before. I say if u love music and love even sharing music with others this little speaker is highly recommended by me and my husband. It is simple to connect to his and my iPhones. The buttons on the speakers are very easy to press and can be easily seen on the speaker. Also the volume can be adjusted by my iPhone volume buttons too. It makes the cutest sound when connecting to my phone which tells me is is connected. Never had an issue with it disconnecting for no reason. The range is good that is the range that my cell phone is from the speaker never had an issue with that I play music on it and put my cell in my scrub pocket and I am up and down the hallways and in rooms with doors closed and music keeps playing. I can't think of one problem/issue or complaint about this JBL flip 5 speaker. Worth the money and my residents appreciate me spending this small amount of money for them to have some happiness in their day and I do too. My husband bought his from a person advertising a used one wanting to sell when he was up north working I think he bought his for $50 dollars but I always use my Amazon prime so in case I don't like something I buy or have an issue I can return free and free 2 day shipping. And not very much more did I pay here for mine. I got pink and it is a pale pink not bright pink. I like it. I don't know if my managers at the nursing home that I work at would care or not about me playing music over my speaker but even if they did I would probably still sneak and do it because of the reactions I get from my elderly confused residents the smiles on their faces is why I would go against what a manager tells me not to do and do it anyway. These residents don't get much joy to be honest esp since COVID and isolation since middle of March 2020. They are depressed because they can not see (except through a closed window in their rooms) and can not touch their loved ones we that work there and love everyone of our residents don't replace the touch and hugs ans kisses they would be getting from the people they love the most in this world their children and grandchildren and even great grandchildren we have had residents pass away and they and their families haven't seen or touched since COVID and these are precious memories they can never get back it is depressing to me and I play music to keep all our minds off this depressing situation we are in right now and this little speaker helps me do this and is powerful enough to be heard from my med cart all the way down hallways and inside rooms. So even the residents that are bedridden can still hear some good music. So if u like good quality sound that can come from a small well built Bluetooth speaker that won't break your wallet then please buy this one. It also has a rope handle that my husband uses to hang his off the side of his bucket and it be out of his way. He is a lineman and stands in a bucket with limited room up high off the ground sometimes all day long so the rope handle is strong enough to hang this Light weight speaker from a hook and no worries of it breaking. Also I have accidentally dropped my speaker out of my nursing bad onto the cement floor in the nursing home and scared me because I would have been sick if it had broke my awesome speaker but turned it on and worked as usual I dropped it outside in the parking lot and no issues. Hope my review helps you realize this speaker is a good buy and u will be happy u did buy this one. Thanks",

At first I was using with my tablet and listening to a talk that was on video, and the sound kept skipping. I was worried that it was the speaker, but turns out, through my tablet, the WiFi was having issues, and although the tablet alone worked fine, also attaching to the speaker caused issues. This works great on my phone, however, where the LTE can cover any buffering or other issues that happens with the WiFi. The sound is great, and it can get loud enough to hear in another room if needed. I can also have my phone not right next to it and it still work (50+ feet away). I don't know what the range is, I haven't tested.",
