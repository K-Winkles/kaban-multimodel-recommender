                "reviewText": "These small speakers are exactly what I was looking for! I used them to have a mini stereo setup because my living situation doesn't allow for my large full setup. They sound quite good considering they each only have a 3\" driver. Lows are decent for the size, and highs aren't bad at all. I live the look and the fit and finish. The biggest thing I really wish they had was a phono pre-amp. I know this would raise the price, but I think most people would pay the extra for that. Or at least have it optional on all of the speakers. But overall I'm very happy with them!",
