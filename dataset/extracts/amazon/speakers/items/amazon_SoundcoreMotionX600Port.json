                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Speaker",
                "reviewText": "I had bought Anker ear buds last year which were excellent for the money so when I was looking and saw this speaker with a $50 coupon and high ratings, I pulled the trigger and ordered it without much thought. Being a musician who usually takes about 3+ months of research to buy any piece of audio equipment, this was a big step for me LOL.All I can say is that this speaker has been great so far. It's a very cool, clean, modern looking speaker. The construction feels solid and durable and having the handle to carry it around from place to place is more of a plus than I thought it would be. The sound quality is excellent, bass is very good at low to medium volumes but gets lost a bit when you really turn it up (or that could just be my aging ears), and it is loud! I didn't notice any significant distortion at high volumes and the overall clarity and presence of the individual instruments was very good. I tested a variety of musical genres (jazz, rock, pop, punk, ska, hip hop, rap, classical) and all sounded good to great.The Anker app is great and gives you more flexibility with the EQ settings as well as showing the battery level of the speaker. The voice prompt when you power on/off isn't obnoxious like some other speakers I've heard, it's just a tone but you can also turn it on and off in the Anker app. Since I already had the app for my earbuds, I just needed to add the speaker to my devices in the app (click of a button) and I was good to go.The battery life seems solid. It does take a while to charge fully (about 6 hours) but from what I read you can charge while using it in a pinch, but you shouldn't do that all the time or it can cause damage to the battery. I tend to listen at a fairly loud volume most of the time and after listening to music for about 4 hours using the BassUp and Spatial features on, the battery level is still showing as about 60%-65% so I'd expect to get about another 6-8 hours before I have to recharge.In short, I am very happy with the speaker and would definitely recommend it. I am definitely considering getting a second to have stereo pairing.",

                "reviewText": "There are many advantages of this product but the biggest is the quality of sound that it produces from such a small design. When you push the button for the base it really sounds great.It has an excellent waterproof rating which I accidentally tested while washing my truck in FL.It\u2019s very easy to set up & the High Fidelity Audio actually makes a difference in the quality of sound it makes. The metal design is very well made without being too heavy.Overall a well designed, quality made & excellent sounding device. I bought it after much research & it\u2019s well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "Packaging: I'm a sucker for nice packaging and the speaker came in a nifty box with custom-fit foam surround, very nice.Build: clean, solid build, metal and hard metal-like plastic, with easy-to-read lighted touch controls, and touted as water-resistant. The whole build exudes thoughtful design.Setup & Connection: pretty straightforward. Turn on, download the SoundCloud app, toggle on the LDAC code (required a firmware update), connect to phone Bluetooth & select LDAC in the BT connection. Now, this part is a bit more complicated, at least on my phone, but necessary to take advantage of LDAC: open Settings, then Developer Options and toggle on HD Audio & LDAC, select the highest sample rate, bit rate, and Streaming Quality. Viola.Sound: I'll preface this with a qualifier: I'm not an audiophile, and I have mid-60's hearing, BUT: I have a set of Sony earbuds that are LDAC-compatible and I subscribe to Amazon Music HD and I LOVE the sound quality of that combination. I wanted it in a BT speaker and boy this thing delivered imo: solid bass, good mids, clear highs, and my unsophisticated ears love the spatial audio. I've been listening to my Favorites playlist and wow.FWIW according to my music app, my phone is delivering \"hi-res\" 24-bit, 96lHz tracks over BT to this speaker at...24-bit, 96kHz. Argue all day, but it SOUNDS marvelousDon't care that it was a bit pricey, $150 on pre-Black Friday deal was good enough for me.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 7.1 media room at home and use audiophile quality IEMs with a dongle DAC when lounging in bed or when I travel - I absolutely love music. I had never explored owning a portable Bluetooth speaker - I guess I've been too old school thinking wired sound is the only way to go. My sons use Bluetooth for everything, so I recently started researching wireless speakers and ran across this X600. Reviews were very positive, so I decided to buy one. I've spent a good 10 hours listening to it in less than a week since getting it, and I've become a big fan of this speaker, especially at this price point. It provides a level of detail beyond what I'd expect from a smaller portable speaker, it has a fairly open sound stage from the combination of real stereo separation (a must for me) and the spatial speaker, and it creates surprisingly accurate bass - even at very low volume (another must for me). Deeper sub-bass rolls off, but that's to be expected given the speaker's compact size. Other reviewers have mentioned this, but the heft and build quality of the speaker is really good. Overall, I'm very impressed and happy to add the X600 as a new option to listen to music - bravo.Okay - a brief update on my review. My wife and I recently went out for dinner and had a couple of margaritas. We came back home and she wanted to listen to some music vs. watch TV, so I thought to pull the X600 out and play it. We did some \u201cdigging in the crates\u201d on Qobuz playing some old school music in the family room and I cranked this box up more than I had before. I was really amazed - the sound opened up a lot, it was clear, loud and actually did bounce around the family room - it was plent loud for us at 50% volume. Lastly, I couldn\u2019t believe the bass extension I was getting from a speaker this size. I have to say Bravo again!",

But for taking to the park/at home/backyard etc.. is excellent",

The x600 sound quality is outstanding, the power is fantastic, the bass is strong and deep and the highs are crystal clear. The x600 sounds better than our three expensive speakers. The x600 build quality is great, it has a decent weight that goes with the power. The surround button creates a wide sound that fills the room. I have listened to some very high end speakers costing hundreds of pounds. The x600 is excellent value for money. I was impressed with our Eufy video doorbell and discovered this is the same manufacturer, Anker create and make great products.",
