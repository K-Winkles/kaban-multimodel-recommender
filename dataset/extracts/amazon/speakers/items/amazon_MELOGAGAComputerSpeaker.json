I saw these and thought they were super cute, small and easy to install though I did have to play around with the different plugs for my desktop. They sound great for what I wanted. I just keep glancing at them as I worked from home today and I had to come leave a review. They make me smile and we all need that right now! Small things to be thankful for.",

                "reviewText": "Great replacement for my Amazon Basics speakers. These are 3.0 W per speaker whereas the others were only 1.2 W. They were pretty loud but naturally these are even louder. I plug them into the back of my smart TV. So much better than the Phission mini speakers which claim to be 3.0 W but were not loud at all!What a joke they were. These speakers are TERRIFIC, I like them a LOT!",

                "reviewText": "The Computer Speakers for Desktop, USB Powered PC Speaker, is a mixed bag, but it has its merits. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects \u2013 the sound quality is mediocre. It won't blow you away, and if you're an audiophile, you might find it lacking.However, the redeeming qualities come from its practicality. The ability to power it directly from a USB port on the computer is a game-changer. No need for additional power outlets or cords \u2013 it's a convenient solution for those looking to declutter their workspace.Considering the price point, it's a reasonable compromise. While it might not deliver the highest audio fidelity, the affordability and USB power option make it a solid choice for those on a budget or with minimal desk space.If you prioritize budget and ease of use over top-notch audio, these speakers are worth considering for your desktop setup.",
