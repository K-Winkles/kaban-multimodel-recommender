                "reviewText": "I have two major gripes with this product.First off, the photoshoped product photography\u2019s scaling is off. This product is way smaller then the photography implies. This is only a viable option for standard alexa speakers or small portable speakers like the jbl pulse (which doesn't even need a shelf to begin with).For reference, I included an image with the shelf (with the bracket extended to its max) next to the JBL Extremes, JBL Pulse 2, a Sonos, a half height Alexa, and both a small and full sized Alexa Show.Anything more meaningful in size and the shelf just can\u2019t support it. My 3.14lb Sonos speakers were too heavy for the included anchors which causes the shelf to sag. My slightly larger (yet still small) OS-10 Swan speakers at 4.5lbs don\u2019t fit on the shelves properly and sag under the weight unless they are screwed directly into studs. As a result I am temporarily forced to use just one of these shelves since the studs in my wall are not symmetrical with my TV. Let me remind you this is supposed to be rated for 22lbs and can\u2019t even handle 3 properly thanks to the provided anchors being so bad.This was also not fun to install. Its hard to align a drill due to how the bracket sticks out. Had to remove it once from my original mounting points due to the sag and I stripped the head of the screw when trying to utilize the stud in my wall on my reinstall.Overall, I don't understand this product. All the speakers you would want to hang with dual channels are simply too big or too heavy for this to be useful. The only usecase I can see this maybe being used for is a small smart-home device (like an Alexa with a small footprint) which only requires a single shelf. Even then, an Alexa tends to look just fine on a counter top or side table.This product simply does not work for what it is advertised for. This would be better suited as a small nic nac shelf then a speaker shelf.Needless to say I don\u2019t plan on using these long term for anything more than a possible nic nac shelf for displaying lenses or something.",
