The current bose lineup has 3 speakers and I was rather confused so instead of getting the Bose I picked a different brand.The JBL charge 4 is much larger than the bose, the sound quality is good but the sound stage feels a little bit odd. The 2 radiators are pointing to the side which may have something to do with it? The Bose has all the speakers/radiators pointing in the same direction which may provide a better sound stage, or at least that's my theory.The JBL is also cheaper ($99 compared to the $129 price tag for the SoundLink Mini II) so it is worth the price, but it is slightly inferior to the Bose, but it is decent for listening to news or music in the office/home office.",

Despite the minor charging issues that I have been having; it has outweighed all cons at this point. Yes, I know what you may be thinking that this speaker is renewed and or returned and fixed to be resold; yes, this may be true, but you can garuentee that this item will work FOREVERRRR the craftsmanship in this design of the Charge 4 is truly amazing. Its waterproof (just make sure you don't overly submerge it in water) its loud so you defiantly can have one and or connect two and jam out with your friends and family. They have great treble and base. Need I say more? If your contemplating, DON'T because this speaker is worth all the risk. It great! buy it and try it! you won't regret it. Trust me :D",
