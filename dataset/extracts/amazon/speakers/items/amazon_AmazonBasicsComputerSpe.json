                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars $10.97 for Basic Computer Speakers - Good Quality Considering Rock Bottom Price",
                "reviewText": "This is a \"stripped down\" very basic pair of speakers for your laptop, Chromebook or PC. For only $10.97 I did not expect much, but this is actually pretty good quality considering it cost a mere $10.97. These are ONLY for listening when you are sitting within 5-6 feet of your laptop, Chromebook or PC and NOT for listening on the opposite side of the room 20-30 feet away. No biggie - cos what do you expect for merely $10.97?It has a very simple volume control knob. A 3rd grade kid could figure out how to install these speakers. I didn't even need to read the instruction book! I just opened the box, pulled out the packaging and popped in the USB plug, the round, long prong and put it into the internal socket on my Chromebook. Then I quickly inserted the 3rd peripheral into my Chromebook plug, turned on the volume to full blast and BINGO! I had really clear volume instantly.Later on I read the warranty info and owners manual. Not much really to study since this is definitely \"Bare Bones\" \"strippe down\" very basic PC, laptop, Chromebook speakers. This is a sold, very low priced pair of speakers good for increasing the volume on your computer to listen to You Tube videos, streaming video. Let's face it - the speakers that come pre-installed on most Chromebooks, PC's and laptops are pretty weak. If you want louder quality audio - this is a pretty nifty \"stripped down basic\" pair of speakers for a rock bottom price.I was listening to a PBS streaming video documentary on Maria Callas - the late, great, brilliant opera diva from the 1950's - 1960's and the sound quality of Maria Callas operatic solos was crystal clear. I could also clearly hear the symphony orchestra in the background accompanying Maria Callas in her world class tour de force performance at La Scala in Italy and the Met Opera way back in the late 1950's - early 1960's.If you are on a really tight budget and want to oomph up the audio volume on your laptop, PC or Chromebook you get a LOT of \"bang for your buck\". Don't expect any fancy \"Bells and Whistles\". There is a basic, simple audio volume control knob on one of the speakers - but it does the job!I highly recommend it!IT was quite well packaged with a LOT of durable protective cardboard packaging inside specifically designed to cushion both speakers. I just wish Amazon would GET THERE ACT TOGETHER AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE STOP INCLUDING THE TOTALLY UNECCESSARY PLASTIC BAG that cannot be recycled. Amazon brags TOO MUCH about being so-called \"Green\" and environmentally friendly but that is NOT TRUE! The box the speakers came in was MORE than sufficient for the packaging. Amazon shipped this direct from their warehouse and insisted on including a COMPLETELY UNCESSESSARY PLASTIC BAG that cannot be recycled and will wind up in the ocean's Plastic Gyre or toxic dump landfill.AMAZON GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER and eliminate completely uncessary plastic bag packaging! Also for goodness sake ELIMINATE that darn bubble wrap plastic cushioning. These speakers came in a very sturdy box from the factory that already included a very durable specially molded cardboard cushioning object that was quite sturdy THE PLASTIC BAG THAT CANNOT BE RECYCLED WAS 100% UNCESSESSARY.I decided awhile ago to ORDER LESS FROM AMAZON because they allege they are \"Green\" but their packaging is excessive - too much plastic and bad for the environment!",

My monitor doesn't have speakers but I didn't mind until my headset messed up. I also didn't want some that go in an outlet so I got these that are usb and aux to reduce cables. Because I got my pc, my monitor, series x, switch, phone charger and other crap I might plug in so these work great. They aren't loud but I don't need them to be since I'm like 3 to 4 feet away. Yess the blue light can be blinding/annoying but my monitor hide it since it's behind it. Don't get these if you need them to be loud get the outlet one. Overall great product",

                "reviewText": "Given the low cost, there are quite a few positives about these speakers. They are solidly made, fairly compact, look nice, the controls feel of decent quality, and the sound is decent. The bass is mediocre, but that is to be expected. They work fine for my uses which is primary computer audio, voice and background music.I thought they just had a single USB connection that provided power and audio to the speakers. It actually a separate USB and audio jack combined into a single cable. I guess the audio jack gives flexibility with connecting to a source like a phone, but you would still need a power source for the USB plug. I pulled the two halves of the cable apart and and plugged the USB into an outlet using a USB power block.The LED light is much brighter than it needs to be. I have the speakers in my home office and at night the light shines across the hall into my bedroom enough to be annoying. I often turn off the speakers to kill the light. If the USB is plugged into a computer, the light will go out if you power off the computer (but not if in sleep mode).",

                "reviewText": "Speakers have built in amplifier and are rated at 10 watts of power. Excellent sound, much better than computer's built in speakers. I wanted the AC / 110volt powered version as you can plug in directly to a house current wall outlet in the U.S.A.. USB powered thru the computer USB port not as good in my view as that puts unnecessary strain on the computer.. whereas AC / 110volt powered speakers bypass that.Volume control has adequate volume adjustment and knob control when turning up or down has the smooth feel of top quality. Remember, if you purchase the USB powered version speakers, and run them thru a laptop, you're going to put added stress on the laptop's batteries and probably will shorten laptop's battery life. Would purchase my AC / 110volt powered speakers again. Very satisfied!!!",

                "reviewText": "Sounds very good for anything you'd use them for as long as you don't expect them to out preform their price point. Very solid vocals and highs. I bought them to use in my office at work but tested at home on music and some games and they did very well.Now for the bad.Blue light is suuuuuuper bright.The absolute worst part about the speakers is they have a very low volume whine to them thats always present. When you are actively listening to media it isn't an issue but it you don't have anything playing it is just present enough to slowly drive you insane in a quiet room. I think they'll be a perfect fit for my uses but I wouldn't buy another for my personal setup useless I absolutely didn't have cash for anything name brand like klipsh Logitech or CA in that order",
