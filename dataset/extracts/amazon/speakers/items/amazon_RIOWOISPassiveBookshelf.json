                "reviewText": "I've been an advocate for high end audio equipment for many years. I want my audio systems to sound like real live music, not like something coming out of a small box. I saw these speakers on Amazon and wanted to do an honest review on a set of speakers that sell for 35 bucks a pair. This review is based on those principles, but also considers the low price that these speakers sell for.First of all, these RIOWOIS Passive Bookshelf Speakers, are made of thick medium density fiberboard, they are heavier than they appear. Because they are, there are no cabinet vibrations or rattles while loud music is playing. Try that with a plastic cabinet set of small speakers and you'll hear the difference.In the setup to review these speakers I'm using a high quality integrated amplifier that is rated to deliver 50 watts per channel RMS, with both channels driven from 20 hz to 20Khz , with less than .03% THD, at 8 ohm. At the 6 ohm resistance of the speakers being tested, that power output rises to 70 watts per channel. The speakers handle that amplifier power nicely, no distorted crescendos. The music source is a logitech squeezebox touch playing from a 1200 CD music server ripped in lossless format.As I type this review, I'm listening to the speakers playing a recording of a live concert by a contemporary folk artist named David Wilcox. It sounds like real music, with stable imaging and good tonal balance. I'd post a video of the speakers playing so you could get some idea of the sound quality, but that would result in a copyright hit and the review would be rejected by the moderators.Now some reality. The speakers are advertised as having a frequency response of 65hz to 20 khz. There are no parameters listed for how that was measured. Luckily, I have a frequency generator that I hooked to the input, and used a sound meter to get some reality into those specs.They do not respond down to 65 hz at the standard plus or minus 3 db qualification that is required of honest measurements. They do respond at 65 hz, but the the output was down at least 6 db at that point. That is not a surprise because a 2.75 inch woofer just can't move enough air to produce an honest 65 hz response.Would I use these speakers to replace the main speakers you see behind these in the photos? Of course not. Are these speakers designed to listen to pipe organ music? Again, of course not. Where these would fill the purpose, is in a desktop system, for casual listening. Or, with your computer. They would also work well as surround speakers in an audio video setup. They are easily mounted on a wall.Within their price point, these speakers deserve a solid four stars from me.",

                "reviewText": "I am firm believer in reviewing items according to their price and features. Therefore I am not going to compare these speakers to $300 Polk speakers. That would not be fair. These Riowois speakers are well made, and sound pretty good! The appearance is great. The cabinet material, and the vinyl wrap look great. The grill is neatly made, and stays firmly in place on the front of the speaker. If you remove the grill, the exposed speakers look good too. They are mounted well, straight, and there is no excess glue or other things to spoil the appearance. These speakers are small. Very small.This was my signal chain for the testing: Windows 11 PC -- into a Focusrite audio interface -- into a Mackie 402VLZ4 mixer -- into a Fosi Audio TB10D power amp.The sound was better than expected for a speaker of this size, and especially for this ridiculously low price point. They lacked bass response of course. But the overall sound was as good as can be expected considering the cost. It was a little crunchy on the high end. But also well within expectations. I am sure these speakers would do well with an added subwoofer.Nice little speakers! Cheap, nice looking, and sound decent.",

                "reviewText": "These speakers sound surprisingly good for their size and price. They are very solid and weigh a lot so you don't hear a lot of vibration from the enclosure.At only 30W, they're not going to be great as mains, but for surround, they are really nice. The audio sounds clear. There is good response on both highs and lows.My ears aren't what they used to be, but I still have a fairly good sense of something that sounds good. These sound good.They look good too. I have these in my living room, where I want things to look nice. The cabinets on these speakers look like real wood. In fact, I'd say they look just as nice as my $300 speakers that are made of wood.They're very compact, so they fit nicely pretty much anywhere. As bookshelf speakers go, these are great.",

                "reviewText": "Paired with a small generic desktop amp + DAC fed by motherboard's audio optical port, these little bookshelf style speakers outperform my little Creative ball-shaped 2.1 system. I'm not doing any super-loud listening. I just wanted more overall audio range and response for games, music, watching streams, etc.These are indeed a step up for me. I find them clearer than the average store-bought PC speakers, but the highs are a bit crispy (thankfully that can be EQ'd out with a tiny adjustment down from noon on a treble dial). Won't call them the greatest because I have put ears to many different brands and configurations before, but for the average fella who just wants something a little more for their gaming rig/occasional audio editing, these are a good direction to look for 36 bucks. If you still find yourself in need of bass response, definitely look into a small add'l sub (the speaker, not the other kind, you naughty thing!)",

They have some excellent wall-mount hardware on the back of the speakers. I know that sound quality is subjective; these speakers sound pretty average to me at best; at their worst, lows are muddy, and highs have no snap.",
