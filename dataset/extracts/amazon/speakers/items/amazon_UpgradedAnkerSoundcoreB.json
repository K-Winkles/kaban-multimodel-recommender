                "reviewText": "You want a review? Here's a review!Talk about a damn good speaker for the price. You can't beat this value. I actually hear bass! I've had my speaker for a wee lil bit over 2 years now. So trust this is a proper review. If a reviewer got it, and it was broken immediately or shortly thereafter, yes, that says something about overall quality, but unfortunately, no matter the product lemons occur. Those reviews are totally helpful, but you have to weigh them against other reviews that may be more positive. And no, I'm not being paid for this review. I just feel that the more information provided on a product the best for all - consumers, manufacturers, and sellers. That being said...let's get down to the nitty gritty.Price - done and done, son. You can beat this price. Even without looking at quality, <$30 for a portable speaker is damn proper. Usually, at this price, I'm thinking, \"How much treble am I gonna have?\" Yes \"treble\" bc for most low end speakers that's all you get - treble, and then, bass that is the equivalent to a soft unsatisfied grunt.Charge - The charge does last a long time. However, I can now tell that the time between charges is shorter now. And in the past 2 months I've noticed that I can have it charging, not in use for a long time, but the blue light that indicates that the speaker is fully charged never goes on. This did bother me when it first started happening, but I now see that I still have a lot of play/usage time despite not having the blue light fully charged special.. Definitely 12+ hrs.I cannot say exactly how much use time I get. I don't keep the speaker in use for more than 5ish+ hrs most days. But I do notice the frequency of charge. And now, after 2 years and many, many, many days leaving the speaker on, not plugged in, not in use (for days), I will have to charge it once during the weekend. That's the time I use it the most and when it might be in use for 8+ hrs.Personally, it's not a bother since I can charge and use the speaker at the same time. However, if you're going on a weekend camping trip, especially if you've had the speaker for a while, definitely take a power source or an additional speaker. I'm planning on getting another for that same reason - one for home and one for travel.Sound Quality - As I mentioned earlier, for a portable speaker, the bass is quite decent, as is the volume. I've had house parties using only this speaker and it was perfect. Now, I do only have a 2/1 apt, but on the balcony and even on the yard (if strategically placed) all guests were able to hear the music. Yet, it's not too loud to cause a disturbance. We've been hanging out till 6-7am, with the speaker on the balcony, without any complaints. Volume: Distubance = on point!Set-up/Use - The set up is \u00fcber simple. And you can easily disconnect and pair the speaker to another device. As more an more devices become simpler to pair, this is not as an important feature, but still one to note. KIS - keep it simple.Not so short summary that is longer than the review - Hands down this is the best speaker for your money and better than many other higher priced speakers out there. I almost bought a Beats Pill, but decided against it after comparing price and reviews to Anker's portable speaker. And I decided, quite definitively, yes, Anker's portable speaker is worth it.For a fraction of the price for Beats I encourage you to try it out. Especially make the leap if you are looking for a travel speaker. Because when you travel, things never go as planned and inevitably something goes to crap like - your trip itinerary, your luggage, shady hostels inspired by or the inspiration of an Eli Roth flick, lost chonies (look it up bc the \"p\" word is gross, girls wear those, and I'm a grown woman and I wear chonies/chones), lost passports, lost virginities (the plural includes one virginity for multiple individuals or multiple virginities per one individual - like if you grew a second hymen or are a born again virgin), lost souls (it happens), or even the loss of dignity. But through all of that, what really blows is the loss of a hundreds of dollars speaker that you purchased mainly for your travel.If you get the Anker Soundcore, will you be protected from the aforementioned b.s.? Not in the slightest. But will you loathe yourself less when your bad ass portable speaker with 24hr charge is lost? Yes bc you didn't spend a few Benjamins on it.So now you can get a replacement. Or better yet, go ahead and buy 2 now and save yourself the hassle (but indulge in the Hasselhoff).Moral of the story. Stop reading reviews right meow and get this speaker. It's good, it's a fraction of the cost of comparable speakers, the charge lasts forever (if your forever was 24 hrs or less), you can charge it and still use it, and does this look like a face that would lie to you? Exactly! Also you can use the speaker, connected to your Alexa decide to play music by the Hoff, without a hassle (you see why I did there).Epilogue: On a side note, I'm currently debating getting this model (which I've had for two years, just reminding you in case you forgot or were distracted by to sweet tunage of the Hoff playing in your mind since you ahvent bought this speaker yet -Shame, shame, SHAME!), or the updated version. I've been pretty darn pleased with the older model. So that should also tell you something - the older model is so dope that I don't even know if I need the newer version.",

                "reviewText": "The other two people that I live with both work on Fridays, so I use that time to deep clean, do my laundry, do meal prep for the week, do light work on my laptop, etc and I love listening to my music while moving around my house doing these. My phone speaker is kind of trash and my computer speaker, somehow, is even worse than my phone, so I decided to buy a speaker.Buy this speaker. If you're considering buying it, don't worry about anything else and buy this speaker.Pros:1) Very fast when it comes to connecting. Even when connecting it for the first time, it's very quick to sync with my phone and laptop and is able to switch the audio with minimal delay. In addition, it's fast to boot up and shut down.2) The sound. Excellent. Usually with most speakers that cost less than 50 dollars would give you that gross disjointed, rattling sound when you turn them on full blast, but this speaker doesn't. It's quite loud as well; I'm able to hear it from all the way across my house and even a little bit outside when on full blast (though my walls are kind of thin and I don't blast my music enough for a public disturbance.) As expected, it sounds best on a low-mid volume, but it doesn't make much of any difference to the audio quality when it's on full volume. I could listen to Video Game OST's and Rock music all day on this thing.3) Overall design. The size is good for its power, not too big, not too small. The design is simple and minimalistic, and I like that the buttons are textured. The rectangular shape isn't my cup of tea, but I usually put it on my desk or on my kitchen counter and go on with about my day so it's something you can get over quickly. It's light and easy to move around as well. I've dropped it a few times on accident on hard tile floors, and it hasn't broken or damaged anything either.4) Battery life. I've only used it for maybe 2-4 hours every now and then since I bought it and I haven't had to charge it yet. It came to me fully charged and it's really nice that I don't have to charge it every two hours like other speakers.Cons:1) Bass. The bass itself is great, though I mean more like, wall-rattling, bring-this-to-a-friends-house bass. This isn't that kind of speaker. Now, it would be nice for a little private outing with some buds at a picnic or watching a movie outside and such, but don't bring this to a house party and expect a mosh pit, ya know? It's loud, but not like that. Personally, I don't mind the bass so this is for other people to consider.2) No fast-forwards/rewind option. Speaker has a power button, volume up and down button, play/pause button, and a bluetooth button but that's kind of it. A little inconvenient when I'm a bit away from my phone and want to change/rewind the song. Would really like if you could press the play button twice or three times to fast-forward at the least, but that's all.TLDR;This is a great speaker for a decent price. If you're cheap and have second thoughts about the price, this speaker is very much worth it. Great sound that is able to get loud without messing with the audio quality, excellent battery life, and fast when syncing. Not the best speaker for a house party if that's your kind of thing. Overall, 9.5/10.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this speaker. It has some great features such as automatic shut-off if you disable Bluetooth for any length of time. I am a remote worker so I use my headphones a lot for web conferencing. During this time I need to disable the Anker speaker. When I do that, after a while the speaker power turns off, which is a great battery saver.I like the size and weight, which is hefty and spells \"durable\" to me.*UPDATE!As a remote worker, when I am on conference calls with my headphones on (so I can use my microphone), I leave this Anker speaker connected, and it gives me even more volume than I can get on my headphones. This has been useful more than once when different speakers have very low volume and I can't hear them. And it doesn't cause any feedback through my microphone either. Another reason to love this speaker!!!The wireless connectivity also frees up a USB port on my PC. USB ports are in short supply given all the devices I need to attach to my PC.The sound is just OK, but I don't expect much from a small speaker.I found it relatively easy to connect it to my PC and my phone using Bluetooth, unlike some other Bluetooth devices I have purchased. This includes a different wireless speaker I purchased off Amazon, whose brand name escapes me right now. I sent that one back in favor of the Anker.Highly recommended!!!",

I am more than happy with the purchase of this speaker. Additionally, I own multiple Anker products, each demonstrating good quality and impressive performance.The battery life of this speaker is exceptional. Its Bluetooth range and connectivity are spot-on, ensuring a seamless audio experience. The sound quality just blows me away \u2013 it's super crisp, clear, and powerful, making every tune a real treat for my ears.Even after dropping it a couple of times, it's still performing exceptionally well, a testament to its durability and robust design.One con, though, which bears little weight compared to all the good things about this speaker, is that it's a fingerprint and dust magnet.",
