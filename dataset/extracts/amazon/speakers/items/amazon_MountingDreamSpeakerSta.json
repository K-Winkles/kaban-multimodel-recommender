                "reviewText": "These are very solid, well-built speaker stands that will not fall over. I used them with a pair of Sony SA-RS5 speakers, and they worked but were not perfect. The base plate on the stand is too big for these speakers, leaving a bottom lip protruding out front. If I move the speakers forward, the mounting L-bracket slides out in front of the speaker - ugly. This is solvable by using a spacer between the stand bracket and the speaker, so that it is moved out a bit over the base. It's great that the adjustable back bracket allows any height speaker, but it leaves a long 'tail' of bracket down behind the mount, which is industrial and unattractive (I cut them off). It would be nice if there were break lines stamped into this bracket so it would be easy to customize the length. The installation stickers identifying the individual parts were not easily removable without leaving gunk behind - use a different adhesive please. Are these better than the bespoke $300 stands built specifically for the SA-RS5 speakers? No, not even close, but they're a whole lot cheaper and they work just fine. If your speakers are out in open view you might want the fancy ones but mine are behind the sofa and I don't care that they're a bit clunky looking.",

                "reviewText": "These are decent stands. Easy assembly. But take note, for Denon Home 150 wireless speakers and maybe other similar wireless speakers, the L bracket to attach the speaker can\u2019t be used. The power cord sticking out the back doesn\u2019t fit well in front of this bracket and the bracket is too narrow to have the wire go through it. This seems like it would be an easy redesign for the manufacturer of these stands but, I had to end up using Velcro on the bottom of the speakers to secure them on to the stands. The speakers do fit well on the square mount thankfully. I would have preferred to secure them through the threaded hole in the back but, you\u2019d need much longer bolts in order to compensate for the power cord sticking out at the bottom and it wouldn\u2019t look as clean as having no bracket at all. The power cord fits easily through the tubes. Overall quality is good for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly requires lining up threaded holes in the interior pipe with unthreaded holes in larger outer pipe and using the hex wrench to screw the pipes together. Typical but a bit fiddly for me 'ol hands. Also black-on-black hard to see. Better would be a slot in the outer pipe and ready-set bolts sticking out from the inner which slide into the slot and are tightened with a strong wingnut. No fiddly tool needed. Same for the upper connection which is slightly but not fatally out of align likely due to the crimping of the inner pipe which inevitable shortens it by a 1/16th inch or so. As the threaded holes were likely set in prior to crimping, this moves them down a tad versus the outer pipe holes which were punched with a certain alignment that is not there after crimping. Net: slight misalignment not fatal but do not expect the holes to be properly centered. Just push real hard on the top pipe to encourage alignment as best you can. Back speaker support bracket adjusts horizontally and vertically. High enough for my Polks and design permits wires from wire posts to pass through unobstructed. This is a very clever, unique, successful design. So we now have 2 very strong and satisfactory speaker posts. Well worth the money. Might spray white Rustoleum on them to blend with the wall and replace speaker fabric with white available right here on AMZN. Then we would have something truly superb. Net: these posts are very good. Buy them, say we.",

                "reviewText": "Works well enough with my new Sony RS5's. These are on the heavy side for satellites (claimed 5.5lbs) so I wanted something with a base vs just hanging from an offset pole. When mounted and secured as shown, they're secure enough for my satisfaction - but I also don't have a large dog or kids to worry about. Just a lazy cat and robot vacc with a mind of its own. If I did, I think I'd put a bar weight over the post, onto the base.In the pictures it's important to note that I cut the wire loop bracket used to secure to the rear of the speaker. Normally it would be extending down past the base another 7inches or so. In addition the fore and aft adjustment bracket stuck out from the front of the base plate a good inch or so. Not aestetically pleasing. So I have no intention of using these stands with any other speakers, so I just cut them with a hacksaw, sanded the rough edges on a belt sander, and gave the edges a quick shot of black spraypaint.I'm *very* tempted to take a grinding wheel and contour the base so you don't see the corners sticking out from beneith the speaker. This is the compromise in using a stand more tailored toward small bookshelf speakers: the square base will show. For now I just wanted to get them setup so I'll save that for a rainy day.Power cable is annoyingly short, but that's not the fault of these stands. Still a good 18-20\" of cord at the foot of the stand when they're extended to roughly 35\" (to bottom of speaker). The right angle plug and choke dropped down the tube without any issue.Ultimately I'm happy - I know these stands were going for about twenty less this time last year, but at $35/stand it's still cheaper, and more versatile, than using accent tables.",
