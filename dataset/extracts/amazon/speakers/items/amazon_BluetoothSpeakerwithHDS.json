                "reviewText": "I normally buy Oontz for portable speakers but I liked the look of this pink speaker and price point. In my opinion, if Oontz were to provide a 90% sound quality, this would be 88%.(It would be nice if these portable speakers had the ability to fine tune the bass, treble, and mids, because this device HAS the ability to provide great bass, treble, and mids very well, but seems to play a little more treble-y. With the right music quality or choice of music, this is a non-issue.)I'm very impressed with the sound quality, durability, type C charger port, and the lights are a nice addition. I just may switch brands for the price.Because I've heard Bose portable speakers before and was very impressed, I gave the sound quality on this speaker 4 stars, the same I would give Oontz.",

I ordered one strait away and have been really happy with it. I had been looking at bigger, much more expensive blue tooth room speakers, and while I\u2019m sure this can\u2019t compare with those, this little guy is a great personal-space speaker. Just what it should be, and better than expected for the price. I even bought one for my sister who is Not tech savvy. Good one!",

I was also hoping it would work from my computer and it does. The range is good as well (how far the speaker can be from the computer). I'll be buying a couple more of these as the price is quite good for the value.",

                "reviewText": "I have used the radio shack cigar shaped speaker for my phone calls and as a BT speaker for eons. It was a bit smaller and never failed me for distance sound and phone calls as well as keeping a good charge time. Unfortunately it dropped to the floor one to many times and the charger price came lose . After using the speaker and only that one since maybe 2007 or so it was difficult to wade through a speaker to order at a reasonable price . My only complaint is that quite a few people have complained about getting an echo when I use this speaker . Other than that it sounds great . It turns of more quickly than I would like it to when. It in use but most of them do now . I hate the lights but I am used to turning them off now and the buttons work well and efficiently so far . I wish it was a bit smaller in length but over all its not a problem because I think it is more stable at this size anyway . The rubber feet are excellent to keep it from rolling as well as the triangular design . I got it at a good price and it sounds fabulous and bit more volume than my old one lets me cook and listen to news and videos without missing anything . I would give this five stars if I can figure out if the speaker is causing my phone calls at the other end to have their voice echo. My end has always been clear and perfect. Music sounds good . Voices sound fabulous and it buttons quickly . I love the stable triangular shape so it really can\u2019t roll as my old easily did . I have not tested it for distance with signal but so far it has been a fabulous buy. It\u2019s the best sound for the value when listening and loud enough to be able to move about while cooking . I am happy with it the longer I have had it .",

I was skeptical (& somewhat aggravated) when I saw how small it really is but when I turned it on, I was quite surprised by how loud it is. We had some charging issues for a bit but believe it was the charger we were using. Seems to charge in about 3 hrs now & plays (at high volume) for about 5 hrs. before it needs to be charged. Wish it had more bass but I'm overall satisfied with it for the price",

I live in Texas and this little speaker was unphased in 110 degree temps and definitely got wet many times! Since summer ended I have adopted it as my bathroom speaker and use it every single day. No issues at all. One minor peeve is when the battery gets low a oriental woman actually says \" battery is low!\" It creeped me out for a few weeks and I could not for the life of me understand what she was saying \ud83d\ude06! I finally figured it out! Great product at an amazing price! For $20 I would have been happy for it to only last poolside! This is a must buy!",

It holds a charge great and the reception distance to my phone is amazing. I have used it daily and have taken it camping here in the PNW, used it when I am gardening, and just around the house doing chores.
