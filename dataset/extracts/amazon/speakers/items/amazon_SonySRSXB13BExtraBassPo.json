                "reviewText": "My previous portable speaker (vintage 2008) had arrived at death's door, so I got the Sony as a replacement. The sound quality is rich and impressive. I was surprised by how much bass comes through. It's a snap to use, and it seems like just the right size. It fills the living room, or my car, with whatever I'm listening to. So far, the battery life has been nothing short of amazing (coming off a 15-year-old predecessor, I shouldn't be surprised).While the volume the Sony generates is perfect for my apartment, a space the size of a classroom is just beyond its abilities. Yes, my students can hear whatever song I play at circle time, but the sound is softer than I'd like in that setting; if the equipment lets me down at all, it's here. That said, there's a limit to what one can ask of a speaker smaller than a soda can.On the whole, I consider this mighty mite to have been money well-spent.",

                "reviewText": "We have only had this little speaker since Christmas, so I can't really attest to the longevity of the battery. We hooked it up with my husband's internet radio so he can listen in the kitchen. I agree with the reviewers who said the volume level is low, but turning the volume up on the radio it's paired with solves it for us. It has a great sound for such a little speaker, and my husband is very happy with it. Moreover, the room with the radio is a bit far from the kitchen, but it still transmits just fine. If anything changes in the next few months, I will add to this review.",

I then started using this Sony in my house recently and it actually performs very well in a wide open space, I was very impressed and embarrassed at the same time but now that I think about it it's just a lesson learned and so here I am to correct my mistake. This speaker does perform very well and is very clear, I turned it all the way up and there was no distortion to speak of and gets pretty loud.",

I used to wear headphones during the feeding, but I also wear hearing aids, so even with over the ear phones, they were still uncomfortable. I bought this hoping it would make the headphones unnecessary. I underestimated this little speaker. When I took it out of the box, I thought, \"How cute. Can it produce a loud enough sound?\" Again, genius dude, underestimated. The first time I fired it up, I was very happily surprised. This little bugger has very good fidelity. The sound is crisp and fills a small room. I also use it to listen to student's speeches. It's that good.I heartily recommend this to anybody, with the proviso that it's not really for a large room, but if it's a small room, you will be surprised and happy with your purchase.",

Short on time, as I'm only in the US for a few weeks, I've been playing this Sony SRX-XB13 mainly in the car while I run errands. The mids and highs are good, but it's been my experience that the bass is almost non-existent. This is playing pop, hip-hop, alternative, and spiritual music. Mids and highs are pretty good, however when I turn the volume all the way up, the sound distorts. This isn't excessively loud, but just almost loud enough.Maybe I received a dud, but I'd rather use the failing JBL or replace it with their newer model than use this Sony on my next trip.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical of sound quality since all YouTube reviewers mention some other brand speaker (JBL, Soundcore, \u201cinsert brand here\u201d) is better sounding, has more bass, blah, blah, blah\u2026 I\u2019ve been using a JBL charge 3 and JBL Xtreme 1 for a few years now. But when I first connected to this Sony XB13, I was amazed at how clear and well balanced it was. It is not a loud speaker, but it is loud enough to be able to hear your music indoors and out. Oddly enough, I find the sound quality to be better than the JBL charge 3, albeit, it is not as loud as the charge 3 and doesn\u2019t have as much bass. However, if you prefer a clear sounding speaker that doesn\u2019t sound muffled because it\u2019s trying to make more bass, this is a speaker you must try. In terms of physical size, the diameter is about the same as a charge 3 (slightly smaller) and length wise, you will need 2.5 XB13s to be the same length as 1 charge 3. The quality of material is also very nice. It may not be as durable as the charge 3 if you are throwing it around and dropping it often because it will get scuffed and scratched, but I figure by the time it gets sufficiently damaged on the exterior, there will be a better speaker on the market at a similarly affordable price. All in all, I highly recommend this speaker!",

I'm no audiophile but to my ears this little thing sounds phenomenal, more than good enough for music, podcasts, movies, and calls. This is not a party speaker, and the JBL ones get louder- but I tested them both in the shop and this one didn't sound worse per say than bigger speakers, just smaller with a more compact sound. I got it for personal use- after owning a 2019 16' MacBook Pro and moving to a 13' MacBook Air, I was spoiled for sound. I mainly picked this over the more expensive JBL and Bose models because its battery life is rated at 16 hours (the other two had 12), and it's smaller and more compact (and cheaper to boot!) This thing is attractive, rugged, sounds good and is a total breeze to pair and switch between devices. Call quality is good, too. Packaging was eco friendly, too. Overall, really pleased with this speaker. The cloth loop it comes with can attach at either the top or the bottom edge of the speaker, meaning you can hang it from a hook in the bathroom and shower with your favourite music firing down at you!If you're looking for a compact, high quality speaker for personal use, this is brilliant, and great value.",
