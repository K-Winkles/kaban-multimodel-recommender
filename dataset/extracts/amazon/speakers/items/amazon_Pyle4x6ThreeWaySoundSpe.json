If you already established a proper upgrade (head unit, factory speakers, sub and amp) then these are an amazing addition to your system. I would not recommend them as stand alone replacement for factory. The highs are crisp and clean and good mid range (not great). Sort of a hybrid tweeter. Lows are almost non existent but with subs it doesn\u2019t really matter. Have these connected to a Sony amp pushing 60 rms and no distortion or cracking. I been messing with systems for 30+ years and can say they are worth it. Note: the pic is from a 06 Jeep Laredo above the backseat",
