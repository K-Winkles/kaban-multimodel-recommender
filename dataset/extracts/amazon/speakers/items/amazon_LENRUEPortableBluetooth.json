                "reviewText": "Rating the clear sided speaker. Nice size, a perfect handful. About the size of the jars of face cream the ladies always have. Half a skinny coffee cup.Sound: Decent for the $. Not for the club, but for home use it's fine. Bass is about as good as stock Samsung TV built in sound. When linking two in stereo, it's a serious upgrade. The link delay is imperceptible and comes off as a touch of reverb. Adds depth. If you put them on the table in front of you 3-4ft apart and play someone talking, you'd swear the sound was coming from the table dead center. Freaky. Not for classical or metal enjoyment, but great for podcasts, TV, and garage/workshop jams.Look: Fun lighting, wish the programmer made the light status static, but it starts ON at theme #1 every time. With a couple taps you can change the motion or choose a solid color, making them perfect for tunes around the table looking like candles. Good travel option for tunes on the patio at the rental/hotel.BT5.3: Good new stereo feature as mentioned, easy pairing/repairing. Unless I'm missing something, switching hosts still requires shutting off the last one paired. Maybe in BT5.4 they'll give us a \"unpair and grab the next offer\" function.Battery life: Paired in stereo with lights on, they went 4hrs of TV at half volume before the first one went dark. Lights off should add a bit, and solo play should add a bit more.Happy with the purchase x2, may get another pair as a gift.(p.s. To be clear, they don't come in pairs.)",

                "reviewText": "Already have the A9 ((SILVER)) which is perfectly loud for it's size and packs a great punch for bass. This new A64 ((color changing)) is nice and the colors are beautiful esp if you turn all the room lights off but the space taken for the cute led does takes from the punch. Certain songs will be nice but half of them will not be as loud as the A9. I've played them side by side very open mindedly. Like the A9 you could play with a couple friends around and actually feel it's still contributing to the get-together [or a jam session alone]. The A64 is better for background music, whining down in your bedroom when you don't prefer max volume or when you won't be annoyed if beats aren't hitting the same. For bass reference I listen to mostly Hip Hop, Jazz/Funk or Pop so the A9 hits better in that regard. {Unless the manufacturer has changed how they were made a cpl yrs ago.} Sometimes the new A64 will go on sale near $10 and at that price I'd say it's worth to get even if's that WITH the more solid A9. When you look at the size difference in the actual visual speaker it makes sense in a way.",

                "reviewText": "I had the Lenrue A2 speaker for several years before it finally broke (my dog knocked it off the counter), so I was looking to replace it. Knowing I loved my Lenrue A2, and I like color-flowing lights, I decided to upgrade to this version. Price was amazing, so I was a little unsure if the A64 was going to be as good as my A2s. Well, it met & exceeded my expectations! The sound is great for bebopping through the house listening to music. Connecting to the speaker was a snap. The lights are great. I haven\u2019t played with them much, because I like the color-flow that it has at the beginning. I have an open floor plan 1750 sq ft house & with my iPhone connected at 1/4 (or less) volume I can hear my music throughout the house. My only question now is if the A64 will last like my A2 did. If so, this is the best upgrade ever!",

Main reason I bought this one.Two issues to mention. (1) The blue light is not evenly spaced around it. Possibly a defect. (2) A red light that comes on when it's charging only goes about 40% in full glow then about another 30,%, in a very dim red. Don't know if that's how it supposed to be.Overall the sound works, battery not an issue so not much of a big deal. However that blue light issue changed my mind about buying a matching one. Would have been cool to have a mini stereo system with it playing from the computer while I work.",
