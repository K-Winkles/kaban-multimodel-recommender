It would be more at home in a 1000 square foot or less room.It does have some features that other speakers don't have like a MicroSD card to play music without pairing to anything. The blind navigation is rough though.The magnetic base is a nice touch. Surprisingly useful!The quality of the unit is top notch. I am very impressed.My Soundcore Anker Mini 3 is a similar size if not smaller and has far superior sound performance - volume and certainly bass. We will compare it to this - a small portable speaker with mild water resistance.Value - not good. The soundcore mini 3 is $20 cheaper.Sound - not as good.Features - the Magolfin wins hands down with the magnetic base and the MicroSD card slot.Rating:-1 star for value-1 star for sound quality as compared to other cheaper options.I would rate this 4 stars if it was $20-30 for sure. It is a great little speaker!",

I think that I\u2019ve finally found it.Not only does this Bluetooth speaker perform all of its expected tasks as I would hope that it would, the crowning feature is its magnet. It holds fast and strong to anything metal, which is a wow factor and also makes it worry free.The sound that this Bluetooth speaker produces is very rich. It has a diaphragm, which makes for some very deep bass. The main speaker is full range, and the sound is crystal clear out of it. In addition, it gets pretty loud.The fact that it is waterproof is amazing. The rubberized container is very grippy in your hands, And the battery lasts for an extremely long time. The controls are very intuitive, but I do wish that they colorized the buttons and made them glow in the dark, as it is hard to differentiate between them without inspecting them closely. This speaker also gives you the ability to pair a second one to it, but I did not test that.The zippered case that it comes in holds all of the attachments together and also adds some protection when traveling. This Bluetooth speaker has absolutely every feature that I could ever hope for, and the presentation of it is very strong. It is very giftable and definitely deserving of five stars.",

                "reviewText": "This magnetic speaker can be used for any metal surface but is marketed for a golf cart. The magnet is super strong and you won't need to be worried about it falling off. You literally have to tug hard at it to pull it away from the metal surface. The speaker is bluetooth enabled and you can connect up to 2 of these at the same time for some more surround sound. The sound is loud and crisp and for the size much louder than other speakers of comparable size. It's actually got a decent amount of bass as well. I like the rubberized coating and will withstand drops and the rough. It's also waterproof so can be around the pool as well. I like the case it comes with. Also comes with a lanyard, usb A to C harger, and double male auxiliary mic cable. Weighs about a pound. Overall an excellent speaker and given the quality and features, worth the price in my opinion. Would be a great gift for anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I tested this in a disc golf tournament in the rain. I had this going for well over two hours with constant rain coming down and there was no issue. It is adequately priced at $44.99 and I think the value really is there. As I said, this was running for over two hours and the battery had not chirped at me, so who knows how long it could last. The thing that I am most impressed with is the magnet; this thing is super strong! I put the speaker on my fridge and had a hard time pulling it off the magnet is so strong. I highly recommend this to be your next speaker choice as the sound quality and other features make it very desirable.",
