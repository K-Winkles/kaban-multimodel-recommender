I'm on the edge about giving this Metra kit a perfect rating, but from an installer point of view, these connectors do snap perfectly in place with the car harness, they are stranded 18ga copper wire with insulated crimped terminals and proper wire insulation, so it's definitively not a downgrade from the OEM car wiring. Cutting off the wire at the terminal barrel, thinning them and soldering them onto the speaker terminal was easy and made for a great solid connection.Amazon should have listed them as compatible for the Yaris 2nd generation models, since Metra website does list them as compatible.",
