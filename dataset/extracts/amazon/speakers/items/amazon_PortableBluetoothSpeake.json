It is definitely a great little speaker for the price and looks awesome with flashing party lights. My warning: be careful on the speaker placement. I decided to put it on the ledge above my shower so I could listen to music; the bass is so strong that it vibrated the speaker of the ledge and landed on my foot, which taught me two things: 1. it's a little heavy (I now have a bruise on my foot) but it didn't get damaged at all so it is tough, & 2. it's waterproof so it didn't get ruined at all! :)",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these speakers in black. They can easily be linked together to produce the stereo effect. The sound quality is very nice. The bass response is sufficient. They are USB-C rechargeable and have excellent battery life. The LED light show, which pulses to the beat of the music, can easily be turned off. The speakers are waterproof so they don\u2019t mind sitting on the windowsill during steamy showers. They easily paired to my iPhone and play my streaming music service. I really enjoy these speakers. I recommend buying two if you can.",

They\u2019re pretty , but distracting . It\u2019s a lovely speaker , volume is perfect for a loud bouncy truck . This would be a great gift for a teen but the lights are very disco like and hard to hear at night. Pretty and works good though",

                "reviewText": "This is my second attempt at buying a waterproof Bluetooth speaker to use in my bathroom and when I wash my car. I got it in September of 2023 and have used it for at least 10 minutes every day, sometimes for much longer. I\u2019ve only charged it once when I first got it. The battery life is amazing. The sound quality is unlike anything I expected at this price point. And it\u2019s loud enough to use outside over the street noise when cleaning my car. Not quite loud enough to hear over the vacuum cleaner unless actually in the car while I do it. Definitely worth buying if you want a loud reliable speaker that also will hold up to exposer to water",

I spent quite a bit of time trying to scrub the chocolate out and listened to the speaker while scrubbing it. I recommend this little sound machine for a myriad of occasions.",
