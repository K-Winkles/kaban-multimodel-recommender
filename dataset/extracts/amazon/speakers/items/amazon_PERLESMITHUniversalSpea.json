I use the Rokit 8\" monitors, and they seem to push the limits of what these stands can support. The stand barely extends to the width of my speaker, and the weight of the speaker overwhelms it. The stand buckled when I first set up the speakers, and now permanently stands with a lean when mounted. It's not the best construction, but in the end, it does work. It would likely be great for a speaker with a 5\" cone, but the 8\" cone is just pushing it.",

It's made of decently heavy gauge metal, and the base is more than large enough to provide a very stable platform. I especially like the adjustability of the speaker holders. It's easy to set up and holds the speakers firmly.All the parts are packed well, and there were zero scratches/dents on any of the parts. Assembly is quick and easy. I picked these up on Prime Day when they were discounted, but even at the regular price I'd rate them as an excellent value. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "These stands are well-made, easy to assemble, and very sturdy. They work with a wide range of speakers, but do not work with the Sonos Era 100. The base plate on which the speakers rest is too large for the Era 100. The speaker will only be secure if it is gripped tightly by the clamps of the base plate, and the Era 100s profile is too small to be secured by the clamps.",

                "reviewText": "Got these to support a couple of Sony speakers. The speakers don't exactly fit these stands, but the stands were adjustable enough so I could make them work. These have a good range for height adjustments and the speaker platform has a nice, adjustable grip with rubber padding. The only problem I had was I could not get my cables to run on the inside of the stand tubing. If you're running speaker wire it might work for you, but if your cables have prefabricated ends on them like mine do, there's just no way it will fit inside the tubes, but you can wire tie your cables along the backside out of sight.",

                "reviewText": "At the price point I was not expecting much of a speaker stand and with Amazons return policy I thought I would give them a try. The assembly instructions are easy to read and the stands went together with out a hitch. My Polk Audio rear channel speakers fit into them perfectly and the stands hold the speakers securely in place. Some of reviews were saying the stands were unstable, but really once the speakers are installed and placed, they seems to work fine to me, and besides, I am not planning on walking up to them and kicking them, I just need them to hold the speakers at the correct height. I bought them over the holidays on sale and for what i paid for them, You will not hear me complaining about what I got for what i paid for. What a decent set of stands for the money !!!!",

They are well built with almost all metal construction (very little plastic). They are sturdy and do not wobble and the telescoping mechanism locks very tight and hold the weight of my speakers just fine. I know some people have complained about wobble and or the hight adjustment not holding but that has not been my expierience. Maybe the issues have been fixed with their recent stands. Anyways I love them and do recomend them for the price.",
