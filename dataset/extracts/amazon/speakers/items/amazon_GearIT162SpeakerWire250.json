My only criticism, is the linear foot increments printed on the outer jacket starts at 100 feet. Like many other wire mfrs, typically the tag end starts at 1\u2019. Doesn\u2019t bother me as I\u2019m going to pull what I need regardless plus some, but for some it may be useful to have your spools start at 1\u2019. Im only sending 30w RMS through this 14-2 down a 70\u2019 run between active outdoor speakers without a hiccup. I would recommend their product to everyone. Worth the little extra cost for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Deciding to get back into Home theater I needed cable. This looked good. A few problems. When I pulled it out of the box one side of the spindle had come off, leaving a mass of jumbled up wire that took half an hour to unravel. And the black sheath is stiff. Took some getting used to. But gradually I figured out the best way to trim and install this wire. Went with 14 Guage because 12 seemed overkill and 16 was too small. But while it was some work it was worth it. And since I laid it under carpet the black sheath was good at resisting carpet tacks. Overall a decent product. Especially if you're laying wire in a difficult environment. Done quite a few home projects and if you need wire with some protection this is for you. Otherwise a more flexible speaker wire might be called for. Gave it four stars for the broken spindle that caused a loss of half an hour unraveling wire that I won't get back",

                "reviewText": "This is an extremely well made speaker cable. The outer jacket is very durable but flexible, making it easy to route through and around installation obstacles. It\u2019s also very cleanly finished, any visibly exposed sections in your installation will look professional and polished. The inner signal transfer cables are also high quality and work well with binding posts or separate banana plugs- the copper core is tight and resists fraying and splintering. I fully expect this cabling to outlast my current equipment and be installed again on future gear.",
