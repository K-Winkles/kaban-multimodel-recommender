It's loud enough to hear over my true dual Samson pipes at lower to mid speeds but is difficult to hear running over 70mph.It is not as loud as the LifeJacket 2. I can hear the LJ2 running at 80mph. Only reason I bought this LJ3 is because a speaker has cracked on the LJ2, and some said the LJ3 was louder, but it's not. So, in a pool, inside a vehicle, a room, patio, etc, this speaker is loud and clear enough, and at lower speeds running loud Harley exhausts. Should hear it fine if running on a quite exhaust motorcycle.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I read some of these reviews and I know from Amazon, you have to sift through and decide for yourself. Altec Lansing is a GREAT brand and has great products. I stand behind this brand entirely. Altho, I do agree, the bass has alot of high points, it still sounds WAY better than some other brands.I had read a few reviews that this speaker had stopped working at the beach or whatever. I know EXACTLY why this happened.Here is your SOLUTION:I am an IT nerd and deal with electronics all the time. A bluetooth speaker itself clearly has a motherboard in much the same way computers do. Those connections are very closely related.The rubber outside comes off. Gently snap it off at the dip-ins on the speaker mess. Next, you will take a flat head and GENTLY put it in between the mesh and blue part of the speaker. On the BACK of the speaker. Sinch up the mesh slowly going around it. It will slide out little by little. There are 6 (six) screws that are deep inside some holes. This is a small phillips. You will need it long to get inside. Make sure you dont loose the screws. Once getting the screws out gently pull the front and back apart along the seam you see once the rubber protecter is off. You will see the mother board with all the buttons, some wires and the cillinder battery. You will have to take the screw out on the battery holder thing. Once you get that loose, pull the connection entirely. BE CAREFULL! These are very small wires and can pull out the plastic connection. You want the whole insert to come out. Then replace the connection. Press the power button. It should say \"Welcome to Altec Lansing!\" If you hear that, you did it! You may gently pull the other connections and replace them. But I would believe that this is the battery connection getting jarred loose during shipping. The other thing this does is RESETS the motherboard. It could be that it freezes up because it is also programmed with the lights to react to the music.This SHOULD solve any issue if it \"just\" stops working. If this does not, and you were patient and gentle with the speaker not destroying anything. Be careful putting everything back together. Call and ask for a return.I would hope this helps other customers with this issue. Make sure the battery is CENTERED ENTIRELY! You do NOT want the the battery trying to cling to the speakers' magnets. Also, re-adjust the wires that are the main power source so you have extra slack when you put it in. Dont forget the piece that screws on for the battery to stay in place.4 stars because this connection issue SHOULD NOT exist. But please people dont disappoint your kids or get upset if you do have the patience or know somebody that can help you do this. It is quite easy. This COULD be the same issue with some of your other bluetooth products as well. Another thing to keep in mind.... the battery CAN BE REPLACED! Just find one here with the same connection and wires!",

                "reviewText": "I own previous model Altec Lifejacket 3 model and works great, except it is now becoming touchy when it comes to charging. So I bought 2 new Altec Lifejacket 3 models with strobe lights/etc(waste of theatrics but whatever). I fully charged 1 battery and took it on the boat with me. I played it at 3/4 volume and it was dead in 3 hours. I recharged it fully and took it on the boat with me again at 3/4 volume. Again it was dead in 3 hours. I figured maybe it was a dud and then used the 2nd purchased speaker. Same results with 2 attempts. Neither time did I activate the strobe lights. The old model still gives me at least 7 hours of battery time on boat at FULL volume(I don't know how much life is left when done on boat, but it lasts my trip). The new model sucks. If I have to play the speaker at quarter volume to get battery life, it's useless to me. I returned both speakers for a refund. I have zero interest in purchasing any newer models from Altec. Majorly disappointing.",
