                "reviewText": "I was looking for rear speaker stands that would accommodate the protruding speaker connections for the rear speakers on a Vizio Elevate. Most stands do not have a gap to clear them and after searching for awhile , I found that this brand worked well with them and they do. I cant utilize the holes in the tubes to hide the speaker wire due to the molded connectors on the speakers but the included velcro straps worked great to run the wire down the stand and you don't notice it all and it still looks good. The stands themselves are easily put together and height adjustable. They are solid and the base heavy enough to keep upright and stay in position and look good in my opinion. If you have speakers that have a molded connection poking out of the rear , these stands will accommodate for that so your speakers still sit straight. For speakers with just the wires going in , you will be able to fish them through the tubes If need be. I'm happy with these and would recommend these stands for any rear speakers",

                "reviewText": "I love the look. Unfortunately my surround speakers have \u201cplugs\u201d that go into the back of the speakers as well as the sub. So hiding them inside is not possible. By the time I got them together (not the easiest) I didn\u2019t feel like boxing them back up so I used black electrical tape to \u201chide\u201d the cords. They are definitely sturdy and heavy bases. They fit well in the back of my room and my Vizio speakers just screwed right into the adapter very easily. They have to be sideways but that\u2019s fine with me. The material feels like it\u2019ll last a lifetime. Worth the money if you have a receiver with just wires to connect your speakers. If you have plugs off any kind do not buy this. The hole is large at the base the super duper small at the top. Whoever designed this wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Or this is only for what I just described and should be advertised that way and not for speakers with plugs of any kind.",
