                "reviewText": "TL;DR- Speakers sound amazing regardless it being games, movies or music. Lighting rarely doesn't change to colors set to certain games and stay in the default settings (whatever you have them set to.) Again very rarely. Lighting is done amazingly. Audio visualizer is my personal favorite, screen sampler is just okay. Depending on the game, screen sampler can really shine, or really be a little too chaotic.Man these speakers are the truth. I've used these for about 3 months now. I held off a review until I really got to try them out. Games sound amazing on this. I recently finished the Doom 2016 with these and it was such an experience. I have it set to where every time I'd shoot the speakers would flash red on this game and it really just added more to an already awesome game with really good sound designs. From music, to movies, to games, these speakers handle everything with ease. Watching the movie Interstellar on these was something else. The sound quality was out of this world.Sometimes the they can get a little finicky. You can have different effects/colors for different games if you so chose to, but sometimes it won't switch over to that and stay whatever the default lighting you have is. Randomly happens, but not often at all. Bluetooth was quick and easy to set up for my phone if I felt like just listening to music. The lighting is so clean and well done. They have multiple options. Static color, Cycle, Breathing, Screen sampler, and audio visualizer.My personal favorite is audio visualizer. More specifically for games. I can set them to whatever colors I'd like them to be. Like Doom for example. I have it with orange and red. When it's a lighter sound, it'll be orange, but let's say an explosion happens, a much louder sound, it'll flash red instead. I pretty much use this lighting for most my games but switch them up depending on the game. Screen sampler is interesting. I think it's just okay. Screen sampler does the best job it could at mimicking what the colors on your screen are doing and attempting to visualize it with the lighting. Some games work better than others.With Screen Sampler, it really depends. For example, I was playing Call of Duty's Warzone. The scene that happens right before everybody jumps, the plane starts flashing red to signal the characters to get ready to jump. The speakers flashed red with the plane which added some immersion. If you're in an environment that's predominately one very strong color, it does a decent job and mimicking the colors. Like walking through a forest area in Red Dead Redemption 2. But if there are multiple things going on is where it shines the least. Besides that, these speakers sound amazing, and really just throws you in to the world of whatever game you're playing. I highly recommend these. These have been a HUGE step-up compared to the speakers I had before.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking into upgrading my gaming setup for my PC. I was looking into some new speakers, and the look of these Logitech speakers caught my eye. I have to say that I am not disappointed with how it came out. I like the backlighting for the two main speakers on the desk, and it shines well up on a wall to do some light-spilling effect. The cables for the two speakers on the desk are a little different than what I was expecting (they looked like monitor cables from the early 2000's). The bass unit delivers some nice, hefty bass, especially in intense scenes. The Bluetooth on the speakers is a little touchy, but I don't use them for Bluetooth speakers. Would recommend, if you don't mind spending a little more for just the look of the light effect on the speaker. It does pair well with the Logitech G app, so you can do some neat effects based on audio or what is displayed on your screen. So far, pretty happy with them and would recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I'll preface, I've spent a good amount of time (and money) on audio equipment over the years; ultimately trying to find the balance between value and quality. That being said...here's my review of the Logitech G560 Speakers.Quality:The quality is actually quite good; on par with what I expect from higher-end Logitech Speakers. Are they studio quality like you would find in $300-500 studio speakers? Not particularly, but they work very well for everyday use and even for content creation where you need a full range of frequencies (Low-end to High-end). Playing through a series of HQ audio (Classical, Jazz, Acoustic, Rock, Electronic, Vocal, etc) produced very pleasant results. (Note: all of my tests were done using the \"Flat\" EQ setting in the Logitech G Hub control panel. Any other setting was either muddy or otherwise unpleasant). Overall the speakers sound very nice!Responsiveness:Audio was clear, crisp and bass was tight and not overly powerful. (Note: like stated above...I'm using the \"Flat\" EQ setting). I did notice some gaps in frequency responsiveness, particularly in the Mid-Low region. While not overly \"hollow\", the DB for some of the lower-end frequencies need a boost to sound more uniform. The higher frequencies are crisp and not overly \"bright\", producing a very well rounded sound.The RGB:Is it worth the extra $$$ for RGB....honestly, no. The pictures of the RGB make the light appear much brighter than it actually is. Even at 100% brightness, they barely illuminate their surroundings and thus making it (IMO) fairly useless. For all intense purposes the lights are just dim accent lights and not capable of bright illumination like you can find with LED Bulbs or Strip lights.Volume Control:This is where the G560 takes the biggest hit on quality. Like previous reviews, the volume is very touchy. To the point where a volume of 28% (windows volume level) is extremely quite and 52% is very loud. Around 37-40% the volume curves louder faster, thus leaving you with an effective volume control range from 32-42%. Everything outside of these values is either too quiet or too loud. The easy fix is for Logitech to adjust the sensitivity of the volume attenuation of the amplifier, thus giving you a broader range of volume control.Summary:These are good speakers with lackluster RGB and highly sensitive volume control. If you can get these on sale for around $100-120, they're a good purchase but IMO aren't worth paying full price for.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this while looking for speakers with good quality without buying a whole amp assembly and bookshelf speakers. This is the perfect speaker for me. Not only is it the right size to fit just behind my monitors as I intended, these little speakers are powerful and sound amazing. The dedicated downward-firing bass is super powerful and I had to tune it down because I have downstairs neighbours. at setup, the right speaker wasn't showing any RGB, but I fiddled around with the connector and it works flawlessly. The Bluetooth integration is another bonus. It is so convenient to hook up my phone to the Bluetooth because there is no transition between devices that are connected to the speaker. I can watch a meme on my phone and it comes through the speakers with the sound on the computer. This is most convenient when it is late and I plug my headphones into the speakers' AUX port. I don't need to take off my headphones to hear what's on my phone. It comes right through the headphones.Overall, I had a good experience and I am continuing to have a good experience with these speakers and I would highly recommend these to someone looking for computer speakers at this price point.",

However, while in voice chat, it's funny to have different colours flashing in sync with whoever you're talking to, aha.Only word of caution is that this has a down firing sub. So for those of you like myself that are in a top floor apartment, you will be restricted to playing this loud to only during the day.",
