A: No. This USB speaker can only be used for computers. Because the USB ports of those devices do not have enough power to drive our speaker, which may result in not loud enough maximum volume. Q: Can I plug it into USB-Hub? A: Not recommended. The USB-hub has no enough power to drive our speaker, which may result-in cluttered, distorted or even constantly pops (audio cut-out) at high volume. Q: The volume is too low/loud, how can I adjust the speaker volume? A: All you need to do is to adjust the volume of the media player and computer system. Q: What's the problem if the speaker still \u201cDoesn't Work\u201d after plugged in? A1: Make sure that the USB port of your computer can work properly. A2: Make sure that you had selected \"USB2.0 Device\" as your computer sound output device. Q: Is there a built-in microphone? A: No. There is no built-in mic, so it is recommended to use a separate computer microphone when having video calls.",

                "reviewText": "For the price this thing is a beast. To start, there is no distortion at even the highest volume. The sound is clear and crisp. Nuances come out very well. The speaker is a bit lacking at the lowest end, but not enough that it ruins the mix. The size is fairly small, great for just tossing it into a bag/case, and going., you don\u2019t even need an external power source. I hoked it to my iPad Pro, and it just worked. It\u2019s loud enough for small parties, and if you DJ, this could do the job for small venues. It literally is \u201cPlug and Play\u201d, just plug it in, select the right audio source, and there you have it. The volume and mute buttons are useful, and very convenient to have. One thing I think it could do better, is to have a jack for a cable, instead of a non-replaceable one, but for the price, that may not be a big concern. All in all, this little guy has outperformed every expectation I had from it, and I would buy it again, and recommend it to my social circle, in a heartbeat, and a very nice sounding one at that.",

                "reviewText": "4th: To be fair, something might be wrong with my desktop computer's USB ports. When I connect my phone to my computer through USB, it often shuts down randomly. I tested the speaker before using my laptop and it worked (20 mins of testing). But this is a tricky issue to find since my mouse, keyboard, printers, etc, are all functional. Due to this user issue, I will increase my rating to a 3/5 since I tried different USB ports on my desktop and it still doesn't work well and the audio does occasionally cuts like half a second during my laptop testing. I have already returned this product thru Amazon and have ordered another speaker that uses the 3.5mm audio jack.3rd Update: Connecting the USB to the front did not fix the issue. I don't use my laptop often so this speaker is no longer needed. I tried contacting their support for help (edit: they did respond back on Feb 28) but I am still waiting for their response. I contacted Amazon support and will be returning this product.2nd Update: I connected the USB to the front slots of my desktop and it seemed to have alleviated the issue. Will keep this updated if anything changes. I like the sound quality and the power it gives. The manufacturer does include an 18-month warranty but hopefully I won\u2019t have to use it.Update: Works on my laptop, audio cuts off on my older desktopWhen I plugged this speaker into my Dell desktop and played a 15 minute song, not ten minutes later, the sound stopped playing. I did some troubleshooting and found that other apps that require sound also malfunctioned, like YouTube videos. I tried updating my device drivers, restarting, disabling audio enchantments, and looked for help online. The only way for me to continue with the song is to manually pause or stop it and then play it again. My desktop is about ten years old but my USB is 2.0. I had the same issue with another mouse that worked only intermittently so the issue could be with my USB ports or drivers due to its age (but my Logitech mouse worked perfectly fine).I also tested this on my 2018 or so HP laptop and it worked. I played the same 15 minute clip and it played it all the way. The only thing I\u2019ve noticed is from time to time, the audio would cut off briefly for half a second or so and then continue playing again. I find it odd but then when I touched my laptop with static electricity the same phenomenon would happen. I used the VLC media player for both tests.Other then that, the sound quality and power is good. The speaker is powerful for its size. For stability, I would prefer getting audio speakers that does NOT use USB for either sound input or power and rely on the tried-but-true 3.5mm audio jack and AC power from the outlet.Received and used this speaker right away. I'm using this on my desktop computer and the cord is sufficiently long enough to each the back of my USB port. Installation is simple, plug and play. Volume up and down buttons modify Windows volume. I like how just one cable provides both the audio AND sound. At 8 watts, this speaker is overpowered for its size. At 60% volume it is enough to fill my large room. The sound quality is good.",
