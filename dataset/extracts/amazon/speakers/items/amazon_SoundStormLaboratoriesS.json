                "reviewText": "Before I start my review of the Sound Storm Labs EX369 6x9 3-way car speakers I would like to say KUDOS to the reviewer who said...\"Sounded crisp and clear, anyone who says otherwise either installed wrong or doesn't know what they're talking about.\" Normally I dismiss a comment like that but something inside me told me that he was right on.At fifteen bucks a pair...what the heck...I pulled the trigger on Amazon Smile. I'm so glad I did! The overall packaging of the product is impressive as are the speakers themselves. Included are eight screws and sheet metal nuts along with a 6x9 template if needed and gorgeous grills plus the two POS & NEG pigtails normally included with car speakers.Before I go any further...let's clearup the specs as they are wrong on many sites. The FREQUENCY RESPONSE is 50Hz to 20KHz + or - 3db. The SENSITIVITY is 92 db. The sound quality when properly installed is such that these specs seem to be accurate...more accurate than competing gear that do not indicate the PLUS or MINUS 3db in their specs. The woofer material is polypropylene NOT paper. The Pioneer 6x9 tri-axes that these replaced seemed to be made of paper as they easily crumbled at the slightest touch over time.I installed these in the rear deck of a '96 Camry LE using a pair of 3/4\" mdf black carpeted spacers. Anyone who has had the rather frustrating experience of working on a Toyota rear deck knows that the existing mounting holes are way too recessed for proper tweeter sound. The end result was that I was able to easily access the 6x9s while using the supplied grills which are much better looking I think than the tan Toy ones. I'll post some pics here soon.These are great looking and sounding speakers for the money. You could easily spend up to fifty bucks a pair for competing models by Pioneer, Cerwin-Vega, Boss, JVC, Kenwood and others without getting appreciably better sound. In fact I would say you'd have to spend about $70 for a pair of Rockford Fosgates to do better. The speakers also have a very noticeable break-in period whereas they keep going deeper and opening up during initiation. THEY JUST KEEP SOUNDING MORE AMAZING EVERYDAY!!!Now I've installed car stereos for 45 years ...YES...I'm an old-timer 4 sure...LOL. but never have experienced this quality even remotely close to this price. You actually start to feel the bass while experiencing superb mids and highs...all with just a modest aftermarket radio. The speakers are well-constructed and I see no reason why you cannot run them off a high-powered remote amp but take care to UPGRADE the supplied pigtails to H.D. ones when doing so. Either way...you'll get a well-balanced sounding stereo capable of very good detail.Take care when installing. Just because they are only $15 don't treat 'em like cheap garbage. Take your time and think things out. These would certainly make great gifts for family and friends. KUDOS to Sound Storm Labs for offering such a great product for a reasonable price!!! Go SSL...GOD BLESS and HAPPY LISTENING...LOL...PJSII",

Of course, they didn't fit so I had to modify the original speaker bracket and bolt the speaker to it, using the original factory plug.After putting the side panels back together, the speakers sounded amazing. I wasn't expecting the bass that it had, but the mids and highs were impressive. I'm using the stock head unit and original wiring. I would absolutely recommend these speakers to anyone who is replacing the factory speakers in their car.",

I bought these speakers to compliment the subwoofers for my bluetooth speaker I built for the subwoofers. The speakers being run with a 120hz high pass filter and sound GREAT on a 50 watt per channel amplifier.If you're interested in the toolbox thing, I have 2 12v batteries wired in parallel in the bottom section. I have a balancing RC battery charger that also charges lead acid batteries, Ill be mounting it on the back exterior of the box and hard wiring it too the batteries as a built in charger. (6amp 14v output for $40, literally cannot be beat by any automotive spec charger.) The head unit I pulled out of my car, it's a cheap walmart touch screen. The amp is also an SSL product, the EV4.400, HIGHLY recommend this amplifier. Everything is self contained and 100% portable, as well as solar ready!",

Never turned the stereo up loud but even at a max of 45 watts these speakers should have been perfectly fine even if I did. But nope day #2 and one started distorting at low volume. Total garbage.",

Fit perfect, used the factory speaker adapters from the old speakers and had to use a screw driver to pry the last tab on, but fits perfectly. Also, don\u2019t forget to get wiring harness for these. Speakers are factory quality, good enough for me since I\u2019m not trying to blare music up and down the road.",
