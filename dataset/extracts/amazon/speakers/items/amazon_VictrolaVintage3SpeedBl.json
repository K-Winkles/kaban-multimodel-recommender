He is very musical and his range of music taste is fairly large as he skips from Simon and Garfunkle to Benny Goodman to Queen to Russian Electro-pop to Beethoven all in the same afternoon. He choose the tie-dye design because it was the most fun. The colors are clear and vibrant, just as pictured. The case is really nice and solid, decent latches and handle, nothing feels exceptionally cheap or breakable. It is a bit smaller than I thought it would be but it does run 3 speeds and the sound quality is great for a first time player. It is clear and fills the room with a smooth sound. I did not rate the bluetooth, because we haven't used it at all. He very much likes to play the records he has found or been given. The one thing that didn't come with was any extra needles or cleaning supplies for the records/record player. It does have a manual that describes what these items would be however.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First off before I write this review let me just say I did a lot of research on this kind of record player and even a few of my own experiments so i would consider what i found to be pretty credible. I wish someone wrote a review like this for me when I was considering buying it.#1 Is this a good record player for beginners or people who only want a few records to play for the aesthetic? Absolutely. The sound quality is meh, but I mean what do you expect for $40. It plays the records no problems, and the bluetooth is great for just whenever.Now here is how you can upgrade your setup with minimal spending. Get an RCA to mini jack cable. Plug that into a speaker you already have or if in my case you have a practice amp cause you play an instrument, get a mini jack to 1/4 converter and plug it into the amp! It works great!#2 Will this ruin my records?No. It will not. I made a little scale and using pennies weighed out the tracking force to be around 5g. Now compared to $200 record players that track at 3g this seems like a lot. But be aware, when records were made, they were made to withstand up to 7 or 8g of tracking force cause lots of old players tracked at around 5 or 6g. Now tracking heavier like this will yes, wear them out faster, but it will NOT ruin them! The needle is also a diamond, so the needle is pretty decent actually.Now you can actually fix the tracking force on this thing. Get a small scale, like the kind to bake with, put your tone arm on it, get some pennies and nickels and start stacking them at the back of the tone are where the counterweight should be. One your tone arm reads at about 3.5-4g. Take those coins, tape them together, and tape them to the back of that tone arm. Maybe even go for around 4-4.5g because in my experience these cheap ones skip very easily.#3 Is it portable?Absolutely not. You need to plug it into an outlet, and it could totally break with some throwing around. Also the lid is completely useless.I took the lid off by unscrewing the screws on the back hinges. The lid is NOT big enough even when open to run 12\" vinyls. The edge is right under your record, like millimeters under, and if you have ANY warping, at all it will hit the edge and cause it to skip. This is likely the problem a lot of people have when it skips and just don't know it. Just take the lid off its useless.#4 Does it skip? Does it sound weird?No, not at all. I had it skip on me once, and after replaying that section it never did it again. Probably was just my fault since i accidentally tapped the vinyl I was playing when getting it out of the sleeve. Also I tested the wow and flutter using a phone app. Let me tell you that it is BAD, like the wow and flutter is REALLY HIGH. But, even so, I didnt notice ANY sort of distortion in the sound. It might be worse when playing above 33rpm but at least for 33, its fine.#5 Is it worth the price?100% as long as you know what your getting. I didn't expect this player to be good or even great. Its okay at best and I'm fine with that cause its $40. If you are looking for a very nice player that delivers great sound quality, dont get this. If you want to really get into vinyl, dont get this. If you want to experience the most you can from your records, dont get this. If you want to just play a couple of records for cheap and have them in your room cause its cool and aesthetic, go ahead, im doin it for that exact reason.(Also, I purchased an amazon return and found no problems with it. Dont be afraid to purchase a used one for less, you can always return it if it is actually broken, but it will probably work anyway)",

I had a friend who recommended me one of these, and against my better judgement, I sought out other opinions online.It's insane how the vocal record vinyl community online is so hostile to these things. There's (disproven) claims about how it'll damage the records you play, claims that they're poorly built (no issues here), and lots of claims about the sound quality being tinny (again, not true).This thing (I got the red one) looks really nice and fits perfectly on a stand I built. The records play perfectly, the sound quality is really good considering the price. Maybe I have weird ears or something but I'm not hearing any tinny audio.I'm really glad I went with this purchase; it's gonna make Christmas this year feel really cozy! Don't listen to the gatekeepy pompous guys telling you how dangerous and bad these things are for your records. The whole \"they'll damage your records!\" thing is a disproven lie.Just go for it. You won't be disappointed!",
