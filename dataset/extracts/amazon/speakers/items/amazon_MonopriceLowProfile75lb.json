I've bought two different speaker mounts (one for center speaker and this for rear) and I had to retrofit both. My Yamaha speakers mount with a 1/4 machine screw. The screw that this came with for mounting was slightly smaller, I'd get a #10 machine screw, although I didn't actually test it's size.Very good value, and didn't take much to retrofit. I just had to drill out the hole to 1/4 and buy a 1/2\" machine screw that fit my speaker. But a little extra work.",

                "reviewText": "First I will state I did not need to purchase any additional hardware when installing my satellite speakers for the Vizio M-series sound bar system. The reason why is because I was able to use the mount screws that came with the Vizio satellite speaker brackets right out the box. The screws were long enough to fit through the bracket hole of the speaker mount and attach to the satellite speaker and properly be tightened enough that the speaker will not move.All other hardware screws and screw brackets came with satellite speakers in box.I found the satellite speakers to be a great quality for what you\u2019re paying for. Yes, they are all plastic but the bracket that you screw to the wall is metal and the tightening screw for the speakers itself or metal. Worked out just fine for me as my speakers could not be any more than 2 pounds each. I would say if your speakers are 5 pounds or more then maybe you will get sag.I loved the installation set up as I can\u2019t read instructions due to the fact I am a blind individual. But right out the box and hand the speakers mounts were very self-explanatory. There\u2019s a metal flat plate that\u2019s screws off the back of the mount then you install to the wall and then slide the speaker mount on the plate simple as pie.I paid just under nine dollars for these mounts and they shipped to my door in less than two days. I would buy these 100 times over for the price. Just bite the bullet if you\u2019re on the Vizio V series or M series sound bar 5.1 system. I cannot say much for the other ones.Oh yes, and One more thing before I forget and leave this review, if you are wondering about tilt up and down it is not a whole lot. I\u2019d say about 15\u00b0 or 20 tops, however that is more than enough that should be needed for satellite speakers being mounted at your level. I set mine almost 50 inches from the floor. With a little tilt and worked out perfectly. And for side to side was more than enough. I\u2019d say about 180\u00b0 from left and right. Or just under so that should not be a problem for you depending on how big your speakers you\u2019re mounting to this far. Like I said before I\u2019ll say it again I would buy these mounts 100 times over for the price. Nine dollars free shipping that\u2019s a goodbye for me.",

Super facil de instalar solo bastan 2 taquetes y pijas (incluidas).Giran digamos 180 grados arriba abajo izquierda derecha para posicionar la bocina a tu gusto, estoy muy feliz con mi compra los utilize para kit speakers traseros de barra lg sl5r y quedaron perfecto. (OJO para los que han preguntado, si puedes colocarselos a las bocinas con orificio de tipo \"llave\" SI SE PUEDE) solo hay que ponerle un tornillo volteado y una tuerca de contra para aprisionarlo en el soporte.Animense estan excelentes !!!",
