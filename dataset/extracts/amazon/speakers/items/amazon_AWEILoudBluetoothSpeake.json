                "reviewText": "Great overall product and good value. The battery life is good and the lights on the front have a few different options and can also be turned off depending on your style. The sound is great and I like how the maximum volume is limited by the highest setting on either device. This means a kid can't turn it up any higher than the phone is set and similarly a phone at max volume is limited to the max volume set on the speaker. Anyone who has kids knows this is a handy feature.I also like the SD card slot option. I have not tried it yet as I need to find where I put my old mp3 files but I have no doubt it will work great and means it can be used without an accompanying device.My only gripe is with Bluetooth. It does not seem to be possible to \"kick off\" another device by holding the pairing button. If you want to switch you must have first device disconnect and then connect the second device.",
