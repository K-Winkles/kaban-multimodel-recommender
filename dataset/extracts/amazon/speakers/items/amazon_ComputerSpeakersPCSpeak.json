The setup is easy and the volume knob is responsive and quiet. I've had other speakers where the knob is either squeaky or sounds like a ratchet. The sleek design is simple with a matte black finish. This brings all the attention to the beautiful RGB design on the front is customizable to solid colors or the rainbow stream effect. The speakers don't force a power source from the wall, opting out for a simple USB connection to the pc, console or brick if you prefer. I only wish the sound output was shared with the USB cable instead of using the old 3.5mm connection but that is not a matter of function, just a matter of taste. The sound is clear and really loud for their size especially in a smaller room. Decent lows for not having a powered subwoofer and crisp highs. Only a small amount of distortion at full volume on the knob and from sound source. Overall, the speakers are a good set for the price. They look good, they sound good and are reliable.",

                "reviewText": "The Nylavee SK400 speakers are a good choice for anyone who wants desktop speakers for playing games or watching movies. They are easy to use with a variety of sources, simple to control with a big volume knob, and have some cool LED lighting modes as well.They come with built-in cables: one cable that connects the left speaker to the right, and a pair of cables that connect to a sound source and to a power source. These cables are not removable, but they have generous length \u2013 the speakers can be up to 36 inches apart from each other, and the right speaker can be as much as 48 inches away from the sound & power sources. In other words, the left speaker can be as much as 7 feet away from the source. This makes it possible to place these 3 feet apart from each other on a desktop, and run the source cables down to a computer under the desk. The sound cable plugs into a 3.5mm audio or aux port, and the power cable plugs into a USB type A port. The USB cable is for power only, not for digital sound. The sound cable is analog only, which means the sound source can be a computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, mp3 player \u2013 any device that has a headphone jack. In addition, the power source can be a power bank that has a USB port with 5V output. This makes these speakers able to be used in a variety of ways, but they are not built to be portable nor designed to be used outdoors. They\u2019re not too heavy but they are not rugged or weatherproof.These speakers have a sound quality and loudness that is surprising for a mere USB power source. They have good stereo separation and a decent sound-stage as can be expected from their placement 3 feet apart. But with a simple turn of the big volume knob they can get loud, much louder than some near-field personal desktop speakers. I tested these in a large meeting hall and they filled the space with sound that could be heard throughout. At maximum volume level there was no more discernible distortion than at lower volume, and the sound was fairly balanced with no over- or under-emphasis on a certain frequency. These are not neutral studio-quality reference monitors by any means, but for what they are for this price, they are good enough for gaming or movies. The many other positive reviews here also indicate that these will not disappoint any reasonable expectations of sound quality.The icing on this cake is the cool LED lighting, which can be switched between several modes easily with the touch of a button on top of the right speaker. The button cycles between modes so simply keep pressing until you find the one you want. Some modes are colorful and static or dynamic, while other modes keep to only one of a few different colors, to complement the mood of the game or movie soundtrack. The lighting is bright, so that in a dark room they grab your attention. During movies they can be distracting when set on a mode with movement, but when set on a static mode they can provide some helpful ambient lighting. The zig-zag design of the LED is the same direction on both speakers, which would have been cooler if they went in opposite directions like a mirror image of each other. Maybe the next version of this model could be designed this way.Besides the brightness of the lighting and lack of symmetric design, these speakers don\u2019t have much to criticize. They are meant to be stood upright, with little rubber pads on their bottoms to dampen vibrations, so they aren\u2019t meant to lay on their sides. They stand vertically upright, with no angle in their design to direct the sound upwards from desktop to the listener\u2019s ears in seated position. They have only one control knob, for volume \u2013 which has a nice feel, but there are no other controls for adjusting the sound. None of these are deal-breakers, just compromises that make these speakers simple to set up and easy to use with a variety of devices and power sources. Yet with their good sound and cool lighting, they are more than just your basic pair of desktop computer speakers. Overall, they are a good deal for the low price.",

                "reviewText": "These speakers look OK but the garish logo and the big old-fashioned volume knob are a bit of a turn-off. The RBG colour effects are subtle enough. The speakers are not too big and very light. Connection is via audio jack and it is powered via USB. The speakers are connected to each other with a wire.Volume is lacking - these speakers are not very loud and do not really have a warm, rounded sound. They are OK for amplifying speech in meetings, etc. but the sound is too tinny and has no bass to speak off, making these a poor choice for listening to music or when watching a film.Even at \u00a356 (Black Friday deal, 2023), these speakers are not value for money.I have returned the speakers.",
