Gets pretty loud but try to be mindful of those around you, nobody wants to hear your random music while out in nature no matter how refined you think your tastes are. If you're having a BBQ in the park or at the pool or something, go nuts, its already loud there anyway. If you're hiking in a spot with lots of foot traffic, turn that down enough to just be in range for your group. Same if you're at a busy beach. Show come courtesy with this thing because no one wants to hear your music nor do I want everyone to hear me playing the Austin Powers theme song on repeat Groovy baby.",
