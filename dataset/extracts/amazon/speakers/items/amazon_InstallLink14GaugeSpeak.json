I bought it for a friend who's a little electronically challenged regarding home stereos, so having it black and red was mandatory. Just a great chunk of speaker wire. I should buy another roll for a back up.",

                "reviewText": "The cable features soft, low friction insulation and so it is a pleasure to work with. It glides smoothly and does not kink during routing.Something that is prominently mentioned in the product description but I failed to notice is that the wire itself is copper-clad aluminum (CCA) and so its effective gauge is closer to 16. This was a problem for me because I needed it to connect the surround speakers in my 5.1 installation which (for reasons we do not need to get into) required rather long runs, at the limit of what 16-gauge can do. That is, 14-gauge CCA is not really recommended for my installation. This being said, the audio quality ended up just fine after calibration so I cannot complain (at least not too much).Overall this is very good wire and I can recommend it as long as the buyer is aware of the material it is made of (CCA). Beside, I cannot really blame the product for my failure to read its description.",
