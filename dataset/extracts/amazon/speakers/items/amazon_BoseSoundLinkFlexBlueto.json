With crisp audio free of distortions, you\u2019ll hear every instrument on the track and nuance in the vocals. It doesn\u2019t matter how the portable speaker is positioned: PositionIQ technology detects its orientation and ensures the best sound. The portable Bluetooth speaker is packed with exclusive technologies. The transducer offers clear sound and deep bass. Its digital signal processing technologies, proprietary code, and custom algorithms work together for ideal sound quality wherever you are. Really, wherever, since the SoundLink Flex is an IP67 waterproof speaker. Its exterior can handle falls, the coat won\u2019t peel or flake, and it resists corrosion and UV light. It\u2019s also easy to hold or store, and you can secure the outdoor speaker with its utility loop. Rigorously tested to meet an IP67 rating, the SoundLink Flex is waterproof. It floats, too, so it won\u2019t sink if it falls off your boat. For added protection from dust and debris, the Bluetooth speaker is crafted and sealed with waterproof materials. Plus, to ensure it can travel with you, Bose subjected the outdoor speaker to water, temperature, and drop tests. These proved that it\u2019s durable enough for anything. And its battery offers up to 12 hours of unplugged play time. The Bose Connect app lets you customize the portable speaker settings, update software, and more. If your phone isn\u2019t nearby, press and hold a button on the IP67 waterproof speaker to access your phone\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant. A built-in microphone means you can also take and make phone calls through the SoundLink Flex. It also connects to other Bluetooth devices within 30 feet for even bigger sound.",

                "reviewText": "This speaker was the second replacement I purchased, and I am glad I did.In stark contrast to the first one I bought, this unit is solidly built and well constructed. It feels and looks very sturdy and doesn't give me the impression that it will be easily broken or damaged.The design is better than that of other speakers I've owned in the past. It has a good, broad surface area, so the sound isn't at all tinny, and due to its shape, it does not fall over, even if put onto a softer surface.Getting it paired to my device was fairly easy.I like the layout of the buttons.I really did not expect a speaker this size to sound great. I wasn't in the market for something that could dominate an outdoor party, so this would have been tolerable. However, I am very pleased with the sound quality. It's neither too tinny nor too heavy, and I find it works just as well for music as it does for other audio. Mainly, I use it in my room to read audio books, and it does a good job; I'm sure it would be quite a nice choice for those of you who actually are looking for something to use outdoors. To get that good sound from it, you don't have to blare the volume or turn it too far down, and the sound quality is superior to that of some larger speakers.There are a couple of other nice features I sincerely appreciate. First, I frankly find it obnoxious that when you turn on many speakers, or turn them back off again, for that matter, they play an annoying, little bit of music that is far too loud and impossible to disable. I'd rather have them simply beep, if that much, or do as this one does and give you the percent of battery power left. I like that this takes a USB-C cable--no more irritating, fragile micro USB for me. Its battery life is quite good, which helps me because I sometimes tend to forget to charge my things. Last but not least, this speaker is the only one I've had that beeps to acknowledge that it is charging when you plug it in. The sound is unobtrusive and quiet, which I prefer.Overall, you'll find this to be a very wise buy. You can get cheaper units, certainly, but spend a bit for this, and you won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for another bluetooth speaker to replace my Sony SRS XB21, one that had a much better battery and sound quality. I did a few hours of research into portable bluetooth speakers, looking for the best quality sound and base, as well as good battery, and I kept finding this speaker as my top choice, and since there was a deal on for it making it a bit more affordable, I decided to get one, and so far I am not disappointed.The USB C is something I come to expect to be on any good product, specially in 2023, so that makes me happier then the Sony one which has a Micro USB port. I was a bit worried when I realized the sound was coming from one side of the speaker before realizing the subwoofer takes up the other side, and it is a really good subwoofer for its size, producing some real nice base without sacrificing anything, specially at near max volume which for my Sony speaker, the base would disappear passed 80%, and sound would get distorted. The Silicon shell feels great around the speaker, with its metal grill, but does have a plastic rear grill for the subwoofer air exchange, but that is fine. The strap on the side I don't have a great use for at the moment but with a carabiner, would easily hang from a backpack or belt loop.I currently have a rubber case on it from another brand (TXesign Silicone Case Cover) which provides a carrying handle, making it easier to move around and add some extra protection, even plugging up the Type C port to add some more protection, though it may not need a case, I recommend one regardless mainly because of that handle and potential extra protection. It does not impact its sound performance at all, which its sound performance is outstanding. I would say it is worth every penny even at full price.",
