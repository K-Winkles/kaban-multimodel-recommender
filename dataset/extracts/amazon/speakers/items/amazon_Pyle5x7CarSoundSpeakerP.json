                "reviewText": "Was not really expecting much since the price was not bad. To be honest was not looking for high bass speakers. That's for my sub. Was really looking to replace my rear speakers. What I needed was something that would pair nicely on over all sound. Was looking for more then just bass needed something that would put power the bass lines and not sound distorted. Well I took a chance on those ones. They sound good by them self if you don't want bass. But when I add my sub in the mix it is great. The right audio / Bass levels. They work really well together. I ended replacing all 4 of my car speakers from stock speakers on a 93 Plymouth Sundance wagon. To 5 1/4 \" kicker door speakers and a pair of 5/7\" rear speakers. Using a really old after market radio. Mix with my 800watt kicker amp. With a 12\" kicker sub. Now this little car let's the neighborhood know am going down the road. But if you read this this point I will get down the real facts here. If your only looking for good sound not great. To use your tweeters more then really more depth then those will get you there. Just me personally. All I need is good sould from my rears my sub takes over the rest. As far as my fronts there kicker as well. They have a good bass with them to to help make it sound good up front but when you set everything perfect. Will in my setup to me or is great. I could not be happier. They did fit into the Mounting bracket for my rear locations. Easy plug and play. At this point a couple day after installation we have to see how they break in and weather or not they hold up after putting though the ringer a bit. But time will tell. But at this point there is really not much more I can say for the price you get what you pay for really on the end. But for me and the way I wanted it. It is good by me. I know I seen other say alot negative things. Maybe you really did take the time to troubleshoot any issues like did and found out it was not the speakers but a setting on my radio. Fix that now my 4.1 is running at tip top. Well update if needed.",

                "reviewText": "These Speakers sound pretty dang good for the price paid for them. I used to work in car audio install, and swore by Polk audio for the most part, but bought a beater car and wanted to at least have something in it, so I got these and a used Pioneer deck, and wow I was extremely surprised at the quality! The speakers themselves are built well, and are made of the same types of materials seen in the higher end speakers. The look and feel great, and most importantly they sound great. They have a very good low range, and high range, sadly the mid range is lacking a bit, but certainly not more than i expected. I also bought a set of 5.25 round and they did not sound quite as good as these, which is what I expect anyway as almost all speakers are that way. (Bigger is often better, in car audio)The cons: The speakers are pretty bulky, and the mid and tweeter stick out much farther than on any other speakers I\u2019ve seen, also the protectors they came with were also very bulky and unattractive, so because of these 2 things I had to make some minor alterations to my vehicle so that they would fit, had the speaker guards been more attractive, I would have just mounted them with a spacer and used the guards instead of the OEM covers. An addition the speakers sticking out a lot they are also much wider than the holes cut for them, as other speakers I tried fit in the holes just fine, but with these I had to shave some plastic off, set them in slightly angled, and snip off several of the screw supports on the speakers.The cons did not effect my rating because of how ridiculously cheap these speakers were, and how great they actually sound, another bonus was that they came with speaker wire, and template to cut holes bugger (likely because they know that they take up more space than they are supposed to.",

                "reviewText": "I have never owned Pyle speakers but for the price, not bad, but not really great either.The Goods: everything is included to mount your speakers e.g. wires, grill, etc...the highs sound really clear, almost piercing (this may be due to my stereo settings); the mids are ok; the shipping was ok; I liked that the speaker accommodates 5x7 and 6x8 speakers frames--this made for an easy install.The Bads: No bass response but this is probably due to my cheesy built-in amp/stereo; Arrived with scuff marks on one of the tweeters and bass driver; mounting grill requires specific rubber/cover screws to hold the grill over the speaker itself(not really a big deal but did have to go search for it at a speaker store.Like most after-market installs on car stereos, where the rubber meets the road is the quality of your system. These speakers require a decent separate amp to drive the bass, mids and highs. The source unit does not have ample power to make these speakers sound good. My Kenwood distorts the bass (bass tuned all the way up)at only sound level 23, yes crappy but if you want to avoid any distortions --purchase a decent amp. Also, Pyle claims the drivers can handle up to 300 Watts, uh, maybe but I wouldn't want to find out.Overall, I liked the price and well, you get what you pay for. If you want a kickin system your are gonna pay for it. These are not even in the same league as infinity or bose speakers. If you wanna listen to some hip-hop with bass you'll be completely disappointed(or you can wire them to just produce mids and highs). I listen to Trance and House and I was disappointed. But guitar-based music sounds ok( of course this could also be my source/stereo). I got all 4 speakers for less than $45.00 dollars--these are definitely budget speakers.",
