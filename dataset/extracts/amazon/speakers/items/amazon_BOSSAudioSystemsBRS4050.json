If you do not have any to begin with, a local Audio/Video shop can guide you with a few simple questions about your vehicle.

This is the continuous power that a speaker can handle without distorting. Your head unit will have to have the proper number of speaker outputs compared to how many speakers you plan to hook up to it, as well as sufficient power from the built-in amplifier.

Foam Surround Foam is a great material for surrounds in speakers and subwoofers. It is in general more flexible than rubber, providing a slightly higher efficiency. This also translates to better excursion. (How far the cone of a speaker linearly travels from its resting position). It generally lasts anywhere from 8 to 15 years under the right conditions of usage Stamped Basked Stamped baskets have better Resonant Frequencies. This means that the frame is able to absorb and transfer much of the energy produced by the speaker. It is more durable and harder to damage or break, good corrosion resistance, high thermal/electrical conductivity and retains strength at high temperatures High Temperature Voice Coil Our speakers are capable of higher or elevated temperature strength and fatigue properties that will increase performance and efficiency of heavy duty play time through lower weight and higher operating temperatures",

                "reviewText": "My Prime streaming app recently blew out my speakers when I reversed the video and the sound automatically increased to the maximum volume. Luckily only my old front wired speakers blew out. I took it apart and replaced the bad speakers with these Boss speakers. They didn\u2019t fit exactly so I had to be a little creative (and lucky) with putting in the screws that hold down the speakers. But the sound is great and since the wattage is much higher with these new Boss speakers, it should avoid the problem of possibly blowing out the speakers if the volume increases when I rewind while using the Prime app. As for the volume increase problem with the app, I have no idea why it started doing that or how to solve it but I\u2019ll keep investigating and provide an update if it gets resolved",

For the price point this speaker really can\u2019t be beat.For a mid speaker this one is top notch at the price point. It\u2019s rare to find single speakers so when I saw this I figured \u201cwhy not?\u201d I wasn\u2019t in the market for anything top tier after market for a replacement after the factory speaker blew. The sound quality is miles above the factory speaker that came in our 2010 Nissan Rogue. The holes don\u2019t match up and I had to cut the stock wire harness off and re-wire myself. But, not a problem. A few washers and some basic wiring knowledge is all you need to get the job done! After installing countless aftermarket speakers/amps/subs/tweeters in my personal vehicles over the years this one was a breeze! Say goodbye to distortion and that annoying crackle that comes with a dry rotted stock paper speaker! I\u2019ve only had it in one day but if any issues arise I will update my review. 10/10 would recommend at this point in time though!",
