The only drawback I can see is the speakers, they are very tinny sounding and distorted at any volume. But, I didn't buy this for the sound, a good sound bar or bluetooth takes care of this problem.

For context, I use my computer almost daily for 5+ hours a day nearly every day during that time period. These things are durable. I've fit them inside of a duffle bag and taken them onto a plane with no damage, they've survived multiple moves, not even the cables have gone out. They do have some downsides though. Their audio quality is terrible, and they definitely aren't the best. But they are the best for your buck monitor and one I highly recommend to people regardless. I'd recommend picking up a lower resolution, high refresh rate monitor and one of these when doing a cheaper pc build or just one of these by themselves if you can't afford another.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to setup and performs pretty much as expected. It's an inexpensive monitor with builtin speakers. The screen is large enough and the picture quality is decent. The only issue is the sound is tinny, with almost no bass. Still, it works well enough for my purposes, i.e. background music while working and the occasional video call.",

                "reviewText": "I am not a gamer, I just purchased this monitor for work because I wanted a large monitor. I got the 27 inch, 100hz model. It\u2019s great for work. I actually got a Sceptre TV on Black Friday literally like 12 years ago and it is still working perfectly, so I really trust the brand. Plus the price was better than any other 27 inch HD monitor I could find. My son asked if he could use it as a TV, so we plugged in the Apple TV 4K. We were blown away by the picture quality. It\u2019s more clear than our 65 inch 4K LG TV. I don\u2019t know how much of that is the Apple TV to be fair. But I can tell you that the picture quality is fantastic. As far as using it as a TV, I do you have to admit that the speakers are really bad for that. But we just plug it into our Bluetooth speaker and don\u2019t know the difference. I really recommend this monitor. I\u2019m very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these to replace two 32-inch 1080p monitors I was using a secondary monitors. The picture quality and color is great with these. I could see myself using them as primary monitors. The only downside is that they are only 75hz, but that's not a shocker or surprise as they are clearly advertised as such. I personally could not use it as a primary monitor because I primarily play shooters and every frame counts, but if you are on a budget and do not care about refresh rate, this makes a great regular use monitor and gaming monitor. The picture is crystal clear in my opinion! And the price is perfect (at time of review).",

                "reviewText": "Great product, the visuals are amazing. I use this monitor for gaming and it runs smoother than my tv. What sets this monitor aside from most monitors is that it has an input audio and output audio source which is pretty awesome because I can just plug my headphones into the monitor and hear everything clearly. The audio on its own is not the greatest without headphones as I\u2019m used to the surround sound system on my tv, however if you put headphones into the monitor, the sound is perfect. In terms of the audio without headphones, I had difficulty trying to distinguish where enemies were during games based on their footsteps, however when I put headphones in, I was able to properly distinguish where people were. So I\u2019m conclusion, it\u2019s an amazing product and definitely worth your money, but if you\u2019re gonna use it for gaming, make sure you have headphones or another audio input !!",
