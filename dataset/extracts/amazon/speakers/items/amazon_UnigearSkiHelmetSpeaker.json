If I could find motorcycle speakers that sound this good in my snowboard helmet, I'll get them. Capable of much louder than I need. Very happy.",

                "reviewText": "Like a lot of people I bought these cause I was tired of the AirPods putting too much pressure on my ears when I wore my helmet. These are my first pair of ski helmet speakers so I don\u2019t have much to compare it too but I really like them. As far as battery life they\u2019re impressive. I used them from 8AM-4PM and when I got back home it was still showing 70%. I think the sound quality is great especially if you like songs with bass in them. I never maxed out the volume cause I still like to hear my surroundings when I\u2019m on the trails. But when I tried to max it out at home I felt like it was more than enough. The buttons are great and easy to use for pausing and skipping songs. I didn\u2019t make phone calls on the mountain so if that\u2019s what your looking for I couldn\u2019t tell you if you\u2019ll be happy. Every helmet is different but I have a Smith Mission helmet and once I was able to peel the Velcro and play around with the foam padding in the ear pads the fit comfortably. I\u2019ve seen some speakers that are connected but for me I like that these are separate. I bought the extended warranty just in case these things start to give me problems after a few uses.",

                "reviewText": "I tried these against two of the top competitors (most expensive wireless Outdoor Tech Chips Ultra 2.0 and mid priced wired Wildhorn Alta\u2019s).Pros: these sound amazing (much better than $229 Outdoor Tech and a little better and louder than the Wildhorn), charge via USB-C, have a good battery life and fit perfectly into my Giro helmet.Cons: no charging case like the Outdoor Tech, for additional charge on your trip or the mountain. And the biggest con\u2026NO VOLUME CONTROL (seriously, why is this left off?!)Verdict: if you don\u2019t care about volume control and just want play, pause to have a conversation and all the other standard functions, then these are hands down the best audio quality I\u2019ve heard. They are a little thicker than the OT\u2019s but they aren\u2019t uncomfortable in my helmet. Unfortunately for me, the volume control and audio quality was most important to me, so I went with the Wildhorn and will be returning those and the OT\u2019s.Hope you find this review helpful if you\u2019re looking for on device volume controls, like all other helmet speakers have.",

                "reviewText": "Writing this review for everyone who likes quality sound, and like me has looked at every helmet speaker on the internet. These speakers have bass! Do they sound as awesome as AirPods? No. They sound one step below AirPods but you don\u2019t have to deal with the ear pain of AirPods under a ski helmet. They have plenty of bass and the sound quality is pretty darn good. I\u2019m a sound quality snob and these, for helmet speakers, are definitely impressive. I had one phone call on them and the call sounded great too. I compared these to another highly rated and more expensive helmet speakers and these sounded much better.",

But every time after about 15 minutes, it says in my ear that the speakers has lost connection. Then a few minutes later it states it's connected. I got so annoyed with the constant chatter that I had to just take them out. Disappointed and because I couldn't troubleshoot in time the return window has closed.",

I put them in a mid-grade Turboski Helmet and now I am shredding in stereo. It really makes my whole helmet sound like surround sound stereo. I've actually never wore a helmet in all the 20 yrs. of snowboarding but with this surround sound stereo, I enjoy my helmet very much and can't believe it took me so long to put all this together. I guess as one gets older, they seek more luxury in everyday activities.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, these are not Hi-Fi supreme sound quality speakers but they serve their purpose very well. I use them in my snowboard helmet and I love being able to listen to tunes while on the slopes. I had been using AirPods but the helmet pushes on them so they hurt and they make it hard to hear when I am on the lift. So far, going to these speakers has been an improvement in every way. The oversized button is great for keeping my gloves on and still being able to pause/play with just a tap. I don\u2019t have any other helmet speakers to compare these to but I am very happy with these. I only ride for about four hours at a time and I have never run these out of battery - I am not sure how long they last on a single charge but long enough for me. I also don\u2019t carry the charge case with me - too bulky and heavy for my pockets.",

The battery performed at -10 to -30 temps (base to summit) temps for most of the 8 hours and I didn't need to charge it.The only negative but probably a me thing is the side button is a bit sensitive. My helmet is quite tight and on some jumps and steep turns, it seemed to pause the music (registering as a click). Not a big issue as it only happened a few times and can be fixed with just a click.Enjoying these very much so a week in, will come back at the end of the season and adjust my rating based on longevity",

Loved them!The sound quality would be 8/10 in comparison to my iPod pros. Not bad really, bass was deep, treble was high. Pretty darn good! And I do like to ride with music, and it\u2019s gotta sound good. I rode for 4 hours, no disconnect or battery dead in -15 Celsius.No more gloves off, just tap the ear muff side of your helmet once to pause, twice on the left to go back a song, twice on the right to move forward.Tap 3 times, tell Siri volume up or down.A call came in, hold the right or left for 2 sec to ignore.These things just changed my life. I hope they up!",

                "reviewText": "I like to listen to music when I'm skiing, so I ordered a set of headphone pucks for the coming season. Upon receiving and listening, I was terribly disappointed at the quality of the sound...very tinny and little base, despite an impreasive price tag.Not so with these pucks.The sound quality is impressive. Especially the base. I'm not saying these are supper hifidelity pucks, but they do punch out an impressive amount of bass. For good bass, you need a large surface area and matching electronics to drive the lower frequencies. These guys do a good job of that. And not at the expense of the mid and upper frequencies.I also like that they are loud enough to be used outdoors. Providing good sound at high volume without interference is also a sign of quality. The manufacturer obviously had the end user in mind as helmet earpads are not acoustically insulated, so these pucks would have to work extra hard at providing quality sound at a higher energy level guven all the ambient noise.I also like that they come in a nice case.If there was anything to ccomplain about, 2 things come to mind....1) My phone earbuds come with a charging case which serves as an extra battery so my ear buds are always charged when I pull them out of the case, yet these do not. Why would you not incorporate this...especially when this case is even larger?2) The provided charging cord does not have a storage spot. Why do manufacturers not take this into account and provide a space for the cord. Someday these guys may start thinking like an end user! Arghh!The run time indicated is up to 10 hours at high volume (I did not test it), but I imagine the cold on the slopes will greatly reduce this.Overall, despite these minor nuisances, they do provide quality sound at a high volume for a relatively long time, so they will get 5 stars from me.I will continue to use these over the winter season and will update this review if my experience changes over time.",
