                "reviewText": "I've tried several of these bluetooth wireless speakers, and all the others were difficult or impossible to set up as a stereo pair. These, however, took just a minute or two to connect to my notebook and give perfect stereo separation. They are smaller than most: about the size of an XL egg, have a lanyard (i'm not using), charge using USB-C, and I have used them for several hours for several days before recharging.The only negative is based on physics. The sound is a bit tinny especially the bass, and there is no compensating equalization switch. But, they still sound better than the internal speakers in my Surface Go and are so small they are great for when we travel.Size? Super small and portable!Ease of set up and use? As good as it gets.Charge? Lasts and lasts and lasts.Price? Incredibly reasonable. They are looking to unload the red ones so they are priced lower AND have a coupon not available on the other colors.Sound? Leaves a little to be desired.Update: Still love them, and they are still offering the special pricing on the red ones. One night, watching the new \"DUNE\" movie, my wife complained they were too loud! :)But if they aren't set at high volume, they actually are hard to hear unless you're near them. So I can listen happily with stereo separation and the sound doesn't carry beyond me the way the Surface's speaker does. They are GREAT for travelling, too!",

                "reviewText": "My old JAM Plus bluetooth speaker died and I needed a replacement. I'm glad I read the reviews because they didn't steer me wrong (in fact, they encouraged me to purchase two, so I did)! They were super easy to pair with my devices and they were really easy to pair with one another so they function as stereo speakers. The sound quality is awesome for something so diminutive, and you can literally tuck them anywhere. You can't beat the price point, and even buying two so that you have a pair, they're still less than other Bluetooth speakers and the sound quality is comparable (and perhaps a bit better).My only criticism is the the charging port is on the bottom, and it doesn't seem that you can use them and charge them simultaneously, which is kind of a bummer for anyone like me who has a fixed place to use them indoors. I loved that I could use my previous speaker while it was charging so I never had to go without music or podcasts in my work area.I get a few hours out of each charge. The design (with the exception of the location of the charging port) is lovely. They're attractive, unobtrusive, and have a small footprint. They're especially portable given their size - you can put one in a coat pocket and barely know it's there.I highly recommend this little gem, it's one of my favorite Amazon purchases!",

                "reviewText": "The laws of physics reveal the limits of mini-speakers. But any mini-speaker is way better than any laptop sound of machines I've owned.OK, OK, I buy inexpensive laptops because I've learned that at their heart, laptops are disposies. One bus trip to many, or flight, or even cab rides and the laptop has died, has been stolen, or has been left unintentionally either by your own stupidity or that of others. So: my phone is an iPhone, but an older model I bought used with a LOT of memory since I can't add any to it myself. My reader is a kindle fire tablet, and eight-inch model because I needed one with a lot of room for books. and my laptop cost me four hundred bucks. The speakers, like those on my last 5 laptops, are pretty bad. But I could fix that for $20.00, and get stereo by buying ANOTHER of them, an identical one bought three days after I bought one. Yes, they're pretty good. No, Celtic Women sound lousy on one of them, and less than wonderful even on two. The limits of physics. But, two of these are MUCH better than any single $40-$80 mini-speaker I've seen (You'd have to try them side by side with a larger speaker to judge them yourself. But they're WAY better than the last pair of speakers hooked to my desktop (I've moved up to a genuine sound bar for my desktop, A CR stealthbar, and that IS better than the mini-speakers. They are quite good, actually. Quite durable (I haven't tried them in a tub of water, mind you). Excellent batter life, and require you PLUG THEM IN AND CHARGE THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVE. Charging on a 5w USB port didn't take very long, but I didn't time it. And they'll convince you they are MUCH bigger than they really are when you hear them. Buy one, and buy another once you've got one. They're WONDERFUL for voice, way LOUDER than any cheap laptop's own speakers that I've ever forced myself to listen to, and not bad for music. -tc",
