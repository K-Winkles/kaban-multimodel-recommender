It also has a lot of bass, which my sons appear to enjoy. This is rechargeable and will last a long time once charged, so we won't have to worry about it running out of power while we're using it. It even has light, which makes using it in the dark much more enjoyable.This connects easily to my phone, iPad, or other Bluetooth devices. It is easy to set up and works great. It has USB and auxilary interfaces, as well as a microphone for karaoke. Another useful feature is the ability to connect two of these speakers to work together. The speaker is well-made, fairly priced, stylish, lightweight, and ideal for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "This bluetooth speaker is surprisingly small. The speaker system is very powerful for the compact size. The sound is also pretty good. There are RGB lights are simple. It is not overly bright where it will be blinding and it gives a nice ambient feel. The built in battery is pretty strong so you are able to utilize these speakers for a long period. I also like that it does have AUX so you can use it directly with your device if needed but bluetooth works great. The device battery last for quite some times, even with the bluetooth connection. I have yet to seen it drain super quick. It does take a bit of time to fully charge the speaker. It will work while it is being charged which is great. The sound quality was amazing. There was no lag or static even from several feet away. It is crystal clear and had a good bass sound to it. The device itself isn't too heavy but it is a bit big. It does have a handle so you are easily transport this as needed but it is still pretty big. The hand is durable but I am not sure if the material will last long term. It is a big bluetooth speaker. On bluetooth from full charge I was able to use the speakers for several hours. It lasted me a full day party. The black color looks pretty nice and it is not as easy to see the scratches on the device. You also do not see the dirty on these as well. The material the device is made out of it is pretty sturdy but I wouldn't recommend dropping it regardless. It should not break if you drop it but might get dinged up. The front is a nice dense material so you do not have to worry about puncturing the grill but it can get sand in it. Do not get this wet as it is not water resistant or proof. The buttons are pretty straight forward. I like that it has those traditional knobs so you are able to adjust the sound and such how you like it easier. Also pairing it does not take long. The ports are on the side and easy to plug into. Overall I think this is a great bluetooth speaker. It gives a good amount of range around 15 feet before losing any kind of sound quality. The speaker batteries last a pretty long time. It is definitely a must have if you like playing music on the go. The handle can at least be pushed dwon so it is not as noticeable but it is sturdy to make it easier to transport the bluetooth speaker. The controls are very easy to follow and can control your phone for the most part.",

                "reviewText": "I definitely recommend this speaker and can say that it is well worth the money and does a terrific job. I'm not professional with frequency but I was a musician for thirty years with very specific complex and acquired taste. I like my music loud and clear and if appropriate for the style I want to hear and feel bass and sub bass frequencies. This speaker delivers. It can handle outside noise pollution to the extent that it should if not more for it's price. Oh and it's wood! The best sound conductor. I'm quite happy with the speaker and the company as well with their desire to satisfy their customers. Keep it up guys!Let's get the lesser points out of the wayThe notification sounds are go off at high decibels no matter where volume is set. Minor inconvenience for me at times. Not a deal breaker. The battery life is ok not terrible not great. Sometimes I have to tinker with the volume knob back and forth to get louder volumes at lower levels. It's not a short or anything and no unwanted noise of any kind",

                "reviewText": "So, I gotta tell you about this super awesome Bluetooth speaker I got - it's the Tpyesss Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker with Beat-Driven Lights and all that jazz. Seriously, it's so cool and I love it.Let me hit you with the cool features. You can connect two of these speakers at the same time and make the music go all around you. And that's not even the best part. This speaker has lights that dance with the beat of the music. Like, for real! Ten different colors and six flashing modes. These colors are beautiful and bright.The bass on this speaker is like, whoa! There's this button called \"Bass,\" and when you press it, the whole place gets filled with this powerful sound that you can feel in your bones. And guess what? You can control the volume with a knob.This speaker got 80W (peak) output power and four drivers - two full-range drivers and two tweeter drivers. I don't know much about all that technical stuff, but what I do know is that it makes my music sound amazing. Like, seriously, you've never heard your favorite songs like this before. It's a whole new experience. And it's not just for home use. This thing is portable, like really portable. It's got Bluetooth 5.0, which means it connects super fast to any device with Bluetooth. I take it with me everywhere. Oh, and there's this cool design on the speaker that shows you how much battery is left.One thing that blew my mind is that this speaker is made of wood. Yeah, you heard me right - wood! Apparently, wood doesn't mess with the sound, so you get this super clear and rich audio. I didn't even know that was a thing, but now I do, and it's awesome.",
