                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Sound!",
                "reviewText": "I tested this M5 model against the Tribit Maxsound Plus, twin 20 watt (total 40 watts) paired cannister style speakers, and a third 24 watt well rated speaker. No contest! The Bogasing M5 was the clear (and I do mean CLEAR ) winner. This little speaker is loud enough for any room, and the bass tones are crisp and clean all the way up to max volume! And that's without using the bass boost!!! This speaker took a victory lap, then competed against a 60 watt, quad speaker - a Miatone boom box (called an XBOX). It came in second in volume and bass (no surprise), but actually beat the Miatone behemoth in clarity, richness and tonal separation, battery life, portability, toughness (water, dust, shock protection) and connectivity options. The M5 plays via Bluetooth, 3.5mm aux in cable, Micro SD card (TF card), and USB in (flashdrive, cable, etc.)! It's fair to say I've just purchased my new favorite speaker! I think this very compact unit is UNDER PRICED and can easily compete in the $80 - $120 category. An amazing sound for an even more amazing price!Added July 27, 2023:One thing I noticed in many of the other reviews on YouTube (and other places), is there seems to be some confusion as to how to achieve stereo separation with the drivers located \"front and back.\" To automatically get the correct left and right channel separation, simply turn the short end (without the accessory door) towards the listener! This puts the left and right channels in correct alignment. Or, one can simply stand the speaker up on that same short end and the drivers will be pumping out excellent stereo to the left and right of the listener. It's not a problem at all, but in fact, it's a DESIGN FEATURE that allows the user to change the amount of separation sound by simply adjusting the placement of the M5!! This is impossIble to achieve on any other single unit. Way to go Bogasing!RobUpdate 8/7/2023:I'm so pleased with this little speaker, that I purchased a second M5 to try out the TWS (true wireless stereo) feature. The ability to employ two separated speakers (mine are now about 10 ft. apart) not only doubled the output, but created a surround sound experience that I didn't expect from such tiny speakers. It pulls you INTO the music in a way that's hard to describe. I appreciate the stereo effect from a single M5 speaker, but this is an immersive experience on another level entirely. It's so easy to pair them once, then that's it. You can turn them off, on, off, come back days later, it doesn't matter - they're paired together like two wolves in the wild!Because it's all wireless, I've had a lot of fun moving them around the house, and found a great spot on the floor that amplified the bass dramatically. So far they've performed flawlessly, and I'm so glad I didn't \"cheap out\" (my default setting) and stop with a single speaker.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot begin to describe how impressive the sound is--the richness of the bass messes with my head, like it is impossible to get bass like that from such a tiny little thing. But it does.And it projects the sound very nicely outside with surprizingly nuanced stereo effect. The battery lasts overnight easily and charges very quickly.I've had this one for a few months now and I am still so impressed that I just bought another one for my son.From what I understand they can be connected in tandem, so I look forward to hearing the stereo effect of two combined units. I might actually buy another one just to have two for myself.Again, great product for a great price.",

Until I bought it, I'd always sworn by the ones with model names such as Motion, Boost, Boom, and Flare, but having seen some favourable reviews, I decided it was time to 'drop anchor' (<== see what I did there?!) and take a chance on the BOGASING.Amazing. The sound this diminutive device produces is astonishingly good. In the default 3d sound mode, the base is clear and strong, does not overwhelm more intricate frequencies, and does not sound unnatural.I am in awe of how much sound such a small speaker can produce, and the quality of the sound.
