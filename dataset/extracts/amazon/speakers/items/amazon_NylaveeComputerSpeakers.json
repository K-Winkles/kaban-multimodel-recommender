It costs $60 and is well worth its value: very high quality, an excellent attention to detail and a great sound. For that price I have no regrets for buying it.It has amazing sound strength. I find myself having to turn it down after putting it at max because it is so great. It can be heard well close and far. It could be seen as a tad bit echoey though. I haven\u2019t used it with Bluetooth a whole lot since I got it but out of the times I have used it, it sounds great with music. I haven\u2019t tried but according to the manual, it can end and answer calls and change tracks too, and so it is very versatile and the capabilities of Bluetooth is nice. It fits on my desk, looks neat, and is very simple. Even the headphone port in the back of the speaker is pretty nice, just ensure it\u2019s plugged in all the way. No noticeable problems to point out to get your headphones to work properly. Also, from my somewhat limited experience, the customer service is amazing too, just like the speaker.",

                "reviewText": "This was purchased due to the sound quality not being the best on this dinosaur of a laptop- whether it has something to do with compression or the file transfer...the sound quality wasn't very loud (even with the settings and player volumes all the way up to 100). After \"window shopping\" for a couple of hours, decided to give this speaker a chance. The reviews were positive, the price was attractive, it was USB powered (a definite plus), it's relatively compact, it has BlueTooth connectivity (that actually works), and (compared to like items) there is no \"dead space\" in this li'l speaker. A lot of other speakers are exactly this same size, but only have 2 internal speakers- this one has 4 speakers and it creates a noticeable difference. The volume settings on the laptop and applicable player can now be turned down and main volume is now controlled through this speaker. The volume is loud, but not overpowering. There is no buzzing, chirping, hiss, or popping when the sound frequencies change. The set-up couldn't have been easier- within 5 min. had this thing up and running. If you're experiencing similar issues OR just want a quality speaker that's actually worth the money that you pay for it- then this is the one you need to buy!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Nylavee Computer Soundbar, and it has been an absolute game-changer for my audio setup! This compact soundbar is perfect for my limited desk space, and I'm amazed by the quality sound it produces.One of the key highlights of the Nylavee soundbar is its small size.

The soundbar delivers crisp and clear audio, adding depth to my music, movies, and online video calls. I can now enjoy a more immersive experience without the need for bulky speakers.What sets the Nylavee apart from other soundbars is its outstanding performance at such a reasonable price point. I was pleasantly surprised by the bang for the buck this little gem offers. The sound quality competes with more expensive alternatives on the market, making it an unbeatable value for the money.Additionally, the setup was a breeze - I simply connected it to my computer through the included USB and was ready to go in no time. The convenient volume and power controls on the soundbar's side make adjusting settings effortless.Overall, I highly recommend the Nylavee Computer Soundbar to anyone seeking a small-sized audio solution with outstanding sound quality without breaking the bank.

                "reviewText": "I bought this speaker to be a 100% full-time bluetooth speaker for my docked lenovo laptop setup. My setup is a single USB-C into a docking station and then into a 44\" monitor. The monitor doesn't provide audio and the docking station has no 1/8\" audio jack, so bluetooth is my only option. I plugged the USB cord from the speaker into my docking station and it immediately powered up just fine. I was able to quickly pair the speaker with my laptop and things worked great. All was well until I came back the next morning to work and the speaker was no longer working. I quickly found that the speaker had switched back to 1/8\" audio jack-in mode, even though there had never been an input that way. I pressed the volume knob twice and the speaker went back to bluetooth and stayed there all day. The same thing happened the next day and each day after. No matter what I try, this speaker always defaults to 1/8\" audio mode. If it would just remember its last mode on power up, I would have given this speaker a 5 star review. It sounds great and is easy to use. I have never used the built in microphone, however.",
