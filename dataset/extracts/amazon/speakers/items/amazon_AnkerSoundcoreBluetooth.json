                "reviewText": "I did some research for the best Bluetooth speaker under $20 (as of Nov 2020). Finalists (that I bought) were:- DOSS SoundBox- Anker Soundcore- OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen)The DOSS SoundBox and Anker SoundCore were comparable in max volume. However, the DOSS SoundBox had a better bass due to its larger size. The Angle 3 did not compare at all in terms of volume or bass.The best rugged speaker would be the Anker SoundCore. It has a sturdy, compact build, with little room for water or dirt to make its way inside. It also has nice tactile buttons. Bluetooth connectivity is great, with very little \"hiss\" during quiet parts in songs.The best bass-y speaker is the DOSS SoundBox. It packs great volume and decent bass (for its size and price range). The battery life is great. I've never run out of battery, even after playing music for 5+ hours. However, it has a noticeable \"hiss\" during quiet parts of songs, but that's if you are listening closely. It also has a habit of shutting off momentarily during silent parts of songs (probably to save power), which cuts out the audio for a bit. If these are things you can't have, go for the Anker SoundCore.Overall, I rate this a 5 stars because it's the best rugged Bluetooth audio speaker I could find for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I bough this speaker to match up with my other Anker Soundcore speaker so I could get Stereo Sound as advertised. It was very easy to Pair this aspeaker with my excisting Sound core speaker(please read the manual). Once paired, I place the speakers about 5 feet from each other. Anker claims that this is not just two mono speakers playing at the same time, but actual 2-channel separation stereo sound. After pairing the two speakers wirelessly, I connected the main speaker to my CD/Cassette/radio combination via AUX cable(purchased separately) and could not beleive the sound I was getting out of these ! WOW. The battery lasts forever, but they seem to work better when fully charged.",

I am disabled and the microphone on it and range make using voice assistant and also phone calls much better, I can leave my phone in my room and bring speaker out to garage through brickhouse and still have pretty solid connection. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a Bluetooth speaker... And the price can't be beat. I was not paid to make any of this review or given a discount but honestly is one of the best speakers around for the price especially.",
