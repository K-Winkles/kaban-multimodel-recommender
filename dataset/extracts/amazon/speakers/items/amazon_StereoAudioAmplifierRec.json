                "reviewText": "Needed some inexpensive receiver for some audio once in a while outside the house. I've bought a lot of cheap junk in the past so there was some trepidation about getting this thing, but for the price it actually is pretty good and exceeded my expectations. Most people should like this product unless you're an enthusiastic audiophile.What's really good for me is it has an SD card as well as USB port to just play some music, plus of course bluetooth. It replaces a cheap stereo I used with a built in CD player, but with just 10 watts per channel it just wasn't enough.OK, to the nuts & bolts:PROSGood, clean sound at low to moderate volumeNice clip-type speaker portsAmazing size factorRMS 40 watts per channel is pretty decentTakes 4 ohm speakers tooSD card/USB portCONSNo balance controlNo headphone jackNo AMNo tuning dialFM antenna is a jokeInadequate manualAlways starts in Line modeAmp makes some noiseAs said, it puts out some decent sound at low to medium volume. It has simple clips in the back for the speaker wires - just open, insert, and that's it. No idiotic screw ports which are a big PITA. It's size & weight are really astonishing - easy to fit nearly anywhere, plus you can run it off of AC or DC, and since it can handle 4 ohm speakers too (like car stereo speakers), it can work great for a tailgate or beach party. Wasn't interested in the mic inputs or karaoke, so didn't try it out.There are a few shortcomings or quibbles. While it does have treble and bass control, it has none for balance. There is no headphone jack, nor any AM, though that may not matter to some people. There is no way to easily dial in any FM station - it all operates on memory functions, so if you go to some other distant place, expect to have to program it all over again. The manual never explains this nor how to save stations. The antenna you get is near useless, but you can get a cheap 75 ohm antenna online. In fact the manual says very little at all about anything. And while a minor thing, the receiver always starts up in Line mode, not what you used last. The amp also makes some noise, sort of like crinkling paper - from the unit, not through the speakers. It's noticeable at low volumes but not really at anything higher. It has one RCA input in the back, but this thing really isn't made to be a primary home stereo. For a garage, small bedroom, or college dorm, this might be just what you're looking for.So will this rival a Sony or Pioneer receiver costing five times more? Of course NOT. But for its price and what it is, it's actually quite remarkable. If you want more power, there's also the AK55 unit as well. You can easily just put in an SD card or flashdrive with your favorite tunes, and play it away - that's something the entry level Japanese receivers don't even offer.",

The Logitech audio adapter can plug into this and seamlessly connects Bluetooth to Firestick. Together it works perfectly for my use. Would be 5 star if it connected to my Firestick on its own.",

                "reviewText": "I'm listening to it using Linux Mint 21.2.1. I would like a better device description when the device is paired. It shows up as \"BT\", I think it should maybe say \"AK-45\".2. I first hooked it up to LINE. I set the main volume control and it was working fine.3. Changed to Bluetooth and there was no sound at first. For some reason it did not retain the volume control setting between LINE and BLUE. After a bit of confusion, I tweaked the volume setting and it worked. The volume knob has a line on it, so I would think if I don't turn it, it would have some initial volume.",
