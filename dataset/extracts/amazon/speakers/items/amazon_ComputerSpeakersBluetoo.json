                "reviewText": "After upgrading my gaming rig, I was looking for a great speaker at a cheaper price point - enough to hear the sound well and look good doing it. What I liked most about this option is that not only did it look nice, but it was compact into one unit and received power straight from the PC. The speaker was extremely easy to connect/use and I am surprised how well this speaker sounded. I was impressed by the quality for a price conscious purchase and I am very happy that I made this purchase. The pairing process is simple, the volume knob is easy to use/responsive, easy to connect a bluetooth device such as a phone or tablet and I like how there is a headphone jack on the front of the device for a personalized experience.Obviously, the sound does not compare to a higher end system and it does have a few other drawbacks: 2 cables plug into the computer (headphone jack and usb power) that can be annoying, the green power light stays on the entire time it is plugged in (I unplug when finished) and is \"bright\" for me when trying to get to sleep, the colors at the bottom can't be adjusted color-wise or brightness-wise (not like a gamin mouse) and in general the size could be a bit smaller or have extra speakers packed into it.Overall, this speaker was perfect for my requirements and seems to work very well. It has a great sound for the price point, budget-friendly, looks nice, easy to connect and easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, I was a little hesitant to pick this up. But I had been needing a new sound bar as the one I had has started to reach the end of it's life cycle I think. And honestly, I am very glad I chose this specific one. It's relatively small and compact, so it won't take up too much desk space. It has some nice little LED's on it. Overall, It's pretty simple to use and hook up and the cable it has in it to connect via USB for power is braided which is a plus from me and tells me this isn't just some cheap \"Made In China\" hunk of plastic. The sound quality is quite nice, and the sound bar can actually get pretty loud at max volume. The bass is pretty good, but it could be a teeny bit better. But I guess that's a small downside of the size.Overall, really good quality and sound fidelity for the price. If you're looking for a new sound source for you PC or other devices [I'm not sure what this sound bar all works on, but it seems it works on a fair handful of devices] I highly recommend this one!",

                "reviewText": "This is a very solid, well made speaker that has a nice modern/sleek look and a very practical design - simply LOVE the nice large adjustable volume control wheel right off to the side. This is a really nice feature that is often overlooked - I can't stand speakers that do this via a series of small, separate buttons that are often placed with other controls. Having a nice large analog dial is sooo much more convenient and makes adjusting volume during a ZOOM call a snap. I use it primarily on my \"work\" laptop computer which I have plugged into a separate monitor/mouse/keyboard and use it primarily for listening to zoom calls. It fits nicely right under my big external monitor and completely solves the the issue of the weak built-in monitor speakers having such crappy/tinny sound. The audio quality is actually quite good given it's size - ESPECIALLY for listening to voice conversations. (I use a separate USB stand alone mic.) Anyway, this speaker is much better and clearer than anything coming out of a built-in TV/Monitor speaker or laptop speaker. (Like a night and day difference!)It is USB powered, so I'd recommend powering it off a dedicated USB powered hub or USB wall charger that can provide the full 2amps it needs rather than using a laptop's USB port for power - in that it will then get enough power to sound good. I believe most folks complaining about sound quality in other reviews are most likely using this speaker underpowered via their laptop's USB port, which typically is NOT providing sufficient power for this speaker. While it may work, it won't sound as good. So be sure to give it adequate power and then simply plug its audio jack into you PC or laptop. Cables are of high quality and nicely braided - they should last.The RGB strip can get a little annoying - but easy to turn off with a couple of pushes of the volume knob (it can be \":clicked\", so pushed inwards as a button as well.) I keep my speaker powered on all the time, so I don't have to reset the volume or RGB lighting as others have mentioned - so if you have it set up to power on/off all the time, having to reset the lighting option and sound volume can become tiresome.Also, I've never messed with the Bluetooth option, but it is there if needed. I feel it really performs best though as just a dedicated monitor speaker.Tip: If the RGB lighting drives you nuts, it is very easy to just run a line of black electrical tap over the RGB bar - problem solved and easily reversible.I didn't give it 5 stars because the manufacturer should do a few more design tweaks to make it perfect:1) Have it remember LED and volume settings on powering off - i.e. If power cycled, it should remember its last settings.2) Provide a dedicated power supply for it instead of relying on USB power - many laptop/PC USB ports will not adequately power it, so having a good/dedicated power supply would help.3) Get rid of the shiny chrome logo emblazoned on the front - use a matte black one instead. (I solved this by coloring mine with a black sharpie pen)4) Have the RGB lights have a dedicated hard switch somewhere to be able to completely turn lighting on or off as an option.Minor quibbles aside, this is an excellent speaker for ~$50, so much better than any built in PC monitor or laptop speaker and don't let other reviews sway you, the sound quality is actually good for what it provides - especially for voice/dialogue sound. Note: This is an unbiased review - I DID NOT get asked to review it - this is my own honest review after owning it for 2 years. I liked it so much I also purchased one from my father who needed a solid speaker for his PC monitor. If you are looking for something practical and well designed, this is a good choice. If you are after a speaker for huge room filling sound, spend more and get something designed to do this at the $100-200 range. This is a great, dedicated PC monitor speaker replacement and it does it very well!",

                "reviewText": "It's not the ultimate high end speaker for audiophiles, but then it doesn't come with a high end price tag. It does what it's designed for, to give a good quality sound for your computer at a very reasonable price. Very sleek looking and if the light bothers you like it did me, just turn it around so the light is facing down.Having said that, I spent a very frustrating 3 days trying to figure out why it didn't work. I tried all the fixes on the website and in the instruction pamphlet, unplugged, rebooted, until I was ready to throw in the towel. Then I decided to haul myself down on the floor and eye level, with my glass on this time, to my computer tower and low and behold, I had confused the audio output and input ports. Switched them and all was well. Note to self: don't try to connect things without actually looking at the connector ports.My only complaint, and it's a minor one, I'm not a fan of the control knob. I wish the volume knob had a directional arrow or some visual aid to know where the volume level is before you turn the computer on.The push button thing looks cool and up to date but I'm just old school when it comes to things like that.All in all, would I buy it again? Definitely. And buy more for gifts.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I increased to 5 stars because of the after sales service on this soundbar. They provided lifetime warranty and offered to ship me a new one.This speaker works fine plugged into the audio jack of a smartTV as well as some Bluetooth TVs as an added bonus. Technically there is no need for there to even be a Bluetooth option when you have to have the dual plug end plugged in for the USB power anyway, so I find the Bluetooth unnecessary, but it's there as an option.I hooked this up to my daughters laptop as she plays a lot of video games and chats with friends online and Bluetooth worked, but again a dangling audio jack cable seems pointless so I just plugged it in and forget bluetooth. The sound quality is a little fuzzy and the louder you turn the volume up the worse it gets. It's a larger size speaker that you wouldn't be carrying around as a portable speaker anyway since it isn't rechargeable but you need to have room for this wide speaker on your desk or laptop area as it's quite lengthy. If you put it in your bedroom beware even if you turn it off the side green RBG lights still remain on and with no way to turn them off other than unplugging it, so if lights at night in your room bother you, you may want to place it somewhere else. Otherwise, not a bad speaker for the price. It is very easy to use with everything on one knob and very simple.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this device for one week, and have the following impressions:1) The lights - turning off the lights does not turn off the lights on the ends. Not ideal - when you want a dark room, you want all lights off when you want all lights off. Also, the light effects do not apply to the ends - the ends are forever green. This seems odd. In favour, however, the lights are pretty cool. I left them on the cool breathing effect.2) The cable - a nice, rugged, braided cable seems pretty sturdy. However - you cannot disconnect it from the speaker. So if a cable issue *does* arrive - the entire unit is impacted. You can't just replace the cable. Seems not ideal.3) Powering - I do like that it is USB powered. Keeps things tidy.4) Sound - It turns up louder than I expect you will need on a desktop. Plenty loud for music. The bass is fine, superior to my built-in monitor speakers. A nice upgrade!5) connectivity - nice flexibility between BT and wired, but wired is not an option I wish to use. I want the wireless appearance on my desk, ad I want the BT functions from the device, like play/pause. So my review is BT-only.I noticed, right after installing this device, that my other BT devices, previously stable, became unstable. Specifically I have a BT mouse, and keyboard. Both devices will often experience a BT disconnect, and lag in reconnecting. The impact of this is, I move the mouse, and have to wait 5s or so until the computer reconnects it and the cursor moves. Same goes for the KB. I have to hit a key, and see if the KB is connected. If not, wait 5s for it to connect, then everything is fine. This happens often, like 10x a day. I contacted support, and they mentioned 2.4Ghz interference.. but until this device showed up, there was no issue. And removing this device (unplugging it, powering it off) restores stability to the other BT devices. Not sure what's going on here, but it's a drag.UPDATE:After working with Bluedee support, they recommended a move to a non-BT wireless mouse, to reduce interference. This is an acceptable compromise, and seems to have fixed the BT disconnect issues, so bumped the review up to a 4.",

The sound is not bad but with no bass.- For the sound control, I see better, it's a wheel with no force on it.
