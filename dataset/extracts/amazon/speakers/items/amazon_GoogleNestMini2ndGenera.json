I spent over 2 hours attempting to get this to connect to my internet and trying to get Google home to recognize the Nest Mini. I gave up and returned the item.Update.I stopped at a local department store, and purchased another Google Nest Mini (gen2). Brought it home and it connected in less than 15 minutes.",
