                "reviewText": "INITIAL REVIEW:Advertising:This speaker wire comes exactly as described and pictured.Shipping & Item condition:Arrived on time and in good working condition with no damaging.Price:$15.99 - This wire, for the gauge and amount of feet you receive, appeared to be some of (if not the) cheapest priced speaker wire I could find.Build Quality/Durability:The wire is true to size and has a nice thick sleeve that has a good feel to it. I was considering getting those fancy-looking braided sleeves, but the quality is good enough that they are unnecessary. They split and removed easily as well (though I had a wire stripper, which helped to get a clean strip/cut).Performance:I have not yet seen any performance issues with these wires. I'm not an audiophile, nor do I have special audio tools to measure their performance. Considering, however, that I ran about 20 feet around my room, and under my carpet, and still hear no issues with my surround speakers, I'd say they are up to par.Design/Features:Not much to say in this department. They're speaker wires. What you see is what you get.Overall:Very impressed with the quality-to-price ratio you get with these wires. They look good, feel good, sound good. No complaints here!1 Year review UPDATE:I've had these wires for about a year now, and I have had zero issues with them. I've had speakers get knocked down and the wires ripped out from the connections, yet they still work fine. They're just plain speaker wires, after all, so there's not much to complain about. Still a great product producing great sound!",

                "reviewText": "I chose this wire because it's cheap, thick, and blue. My 23-year old Paradigm Mini-Monitors sound as awesome as they ever have when fed signal by this wire. We have a nearfield 4.1 system in a bedroom that's also the gym and pantry, with the speakers in position when in use and put away when not. This requires lots of moving the speakers around with the wire still attached as the system still works for background music when \"put away\". The wire moves easily and coils up nicely for storage. I have zero complaints about the sound quality. Does there exist expensive wire that would give a tiny increase in sound quality? Probably. Will that wire give you as much joy as spending that money on music and movies? Probably not.To bust a couple myths from other reviews: This is 14-gauge wire, not 16, or at least it's definitely thicker than the 16-gauge Amazon basics wire we have going to the rear speakers, as shown in the photos. This is indeed a full 30 feet of wire, not 15 as someone suggested. Yes, it's copper clad aluminum. And? We tend to think copper is for wire and aluminum is for cans, but I assure you unless you're doing a very long run of cable, the electricity doesn't care.Low price, high quality, and the blue looks cool. Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "The speaker cable is fine, not outstanding, not terrible. It's fine.I say that as an audiophile that's spent four figures on his speaker cable at home. Sadly, it's overkill, too, but nicely terminated cable for a bunch of bi-amped speakers costs a few bucks.The reality is, oxygen free copper in a car, with poor imaging, road noise, compromised speaker cabinets and positioning, reflective and deadening surfaces, and on and on is overkill. If you're building a show car for SEMA, you aren't shopping Amazon for speaker cable anyway.I used this for wire in one of my antique cars (an '86 C10, my parts fetcher/lumber hauler/etc) where the speakers fire at the back of my bench seat. The change in conductive material has not hampered the ability of those JBL triax speakers to bring noise to my ears.It's a nice flexible jacket. Easy to tell polarity from clearly defined colors. Carries plenty of power for a car. Inexpensive per foot. I'd buy it again for most projects, if it were available. It does shed when you strip it, the way to fix it?Go a size up on your wire tools, I think it's a generous 16ga. Tin them if you're worried they'll corrode, or continue to come apart.Buy it. It works well for what it is....",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a home theater setup I put in in my basement. I could have gotten away with 16 gauge but I figured I might as well keep it higher quality. I have excellent sound response across all of my speakers, no crackling or distortion and the wires were identifiable enough to ensure I was not reversing polarity accidentally. Stripping the wires is clean and there aren\u2019t a lot of loose strands. Everything was very easy to work with and I\u2019d highly recommend this for any setup.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased a spool to wire a set of speakers into my 1993 Del Sol. Was going to add rear speakers to the car. Ended up using about half a spool in total to wire up both the speakers. The cable itself looks great and seems to be well protected by the external rubber (probably vinyl) coating. Easy to strip and solder as well as crimp. Was great to work with. I've seen some highs and lows in terms of weather and temperature (35 to -10 degrees celsius) and there appears to be no issues with the wire. I will say if cable flexibility is of concern it may be good to see if other reviews have made any mention of cable stiffness in cold weathers. I'm not sure if the cable stiffens in cold weather as do many cheap cables do. For me the cables are all tied and hidden behind plastic interior panels and I've not gotten around to checking their condition in the cold. SO far I havent had any issues that would indicate to me that the cable stiffened and or cracked due to stiffness (i.e from clanking around during cold days or from shorts to due unsheathed section of wire). So overall I think its great. Would buy again if I needed wire for automotive applications.",
