                "reviewText": "This speaker is a good value. It is not as loud as more expensive speakers of the same dimensions, but at this price it is more than loud enough for personal use. I've used it outside in the rain, confirming it is at least splash-proof. At less-than-full volume the sound quality is decent. At full volume it can distort a bit, but again at this price it is fine. Its style compares well with more expensive speakers. The card-reader and stereo-pairing are nice plusses but I have not yet used those features. If you're looking for a small speaker to bring on a peaceful walk or a bit of low-key study background away from home, this is a fine device.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to use with an old mp3 player just around the house. But the sound is horrible. You get screechy static if whatever you have it hook to is turned up above 10 but if you turn the actual speaker up it's the same thing so it only plays well at a fairly low volume. So if your sitting right by it it would probably be fine otherwise your going to struggle to hear it well. I gave it 3 stars because the battery does seem to last fairly well.UPDATEToday I used this on and off throughout the day it's worse than I thought every time I turned it back on I had to reconnect and I'm not even talking about the Bluetooth function I literally have to unplug and re plug the AUX cable it's ridiculous. Horrible sound and a pain to use. I stupidly threw away the box so now I can't return the junk. Don't waste your time or money.UPDATE #2I finally tried the Bluetooth option I used it on my phone first and it worked OK. It actually connected immediately no problem at all but it would cut out every little bit. Then I tried it with my lap top and I could not get it to connect at all. So the Bluetooth function doesn't work very well either. I got this speaker because it got good reviews so I don't know maybe I got a dud. Still wouldn't recommend.",
