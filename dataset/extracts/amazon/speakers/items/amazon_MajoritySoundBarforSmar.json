                "reviewText": "I got one of these for my kitchen probably two years ago because I love to have music and podcasts going while I cook and bake. I needed something that didn't rely on a rechargeable battery and that would also fit on top of my microwave. This not only fits perfectly, but two years later, I still have no issues with it. It's a great little soundbar for the money, plays all music clearly, and it even throws a lot of sound if you turn it up higher (I have no idea how far exactly it goes because it's very powerful even on lower settings). I've mostly used it for the Bluetooth connectivity over the years, and it only cuts out if I take my phone to another room (which is to be expected). Otherwise, it maintains the connection very well and will go for hours if you leave it go. I actually ended up buying one for my office last year for cheap waiting room music, and on its lowest sound setting, it's perfect for background music. I just hooked it to my office computer, turned on YouTube Music, and let it play till my workday is finished.More recently, I remembered the other reason I bought this particular model -- the USB capability. I have an enormous vinyl collection (most of which is computerized) and was getting tired of having to wash my hands every time I changed the song on my phone while cooking and baking. So I got a small thumb drive on Amazon, loaded it up with some of my vinyl recordings, and now I can play it all day without having to start and stop and change songs. Christmas Eve, I cooked a holiday dinner for 13 people and was in the kitchen most of the day. The music just played and played without issue for almost twelve hours. The remote works great; this whole unit is worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "Generally I am satisfied with this soundbar, my first ever. I am not by any stretch of the imagination an audiophile, so my observations may be faulty. The soundbar came well-packaged. However, a small issue was that the instruction sheet that was supposed to be included was not. No major problem, set-up is mostly intuitive, and I was able to download a manual PDF from the manufacturer's website to double-check my efforts. Still, the instructions SHOULD have been in the box. The sound itself is fairly good, though I haven't been able to adjust it to my complete satisfaction -- how much of the TV's own speaker sound should be mixed with the soundbar? I'm not sure -- it seems to be a personal opinion, but I would have appreciated some advice. As others have mentioned, this unit does not output much in the bass register -- okay for me, as I don't want to shake walls, but it may be a problem for other users. A small annoyance is that when the unit is turned on from the remote, the volume level is rather high no matter at what level it was left (this wouldn't be a problem in a house, but living in a condo with neighbors can make this kind of sudden sound explosion embarrassing and potentially problematic). Another small annoyance is that the adaptor cord is barely long enough in my situation -- I expected it would not reach my surge strip at all, but it did... just barely... and the fact that the jack is at the right end of the bar, rather than the rear center, could well make that cord too short for some users depending on their ball of spaghetti cord-situation. Minor issues, but for some they could be much more major. All in all, for me it seems to be an improvement over my TV's own sound, which was often too bass-heavy and full of distortion -- with the soundbar I've not had the TV volume rattle and hum as it used to do. The bar is small, attractive, and unobtrusive, and priced to sell even for experimental reasons -- can't go wrong with under forty bucks. I'm not one to need surround-sound Dolby etc etc high-end components (and volume needs to be kept reasonable for the common wall), so I don't mind that it's not an earth-shaker. I think I'll get a better sound mix the more I play with it. If not perfect, at this price it doesn't need to be.-W.D. Gagliani, author of The Judas Hit",

I was able to connect it via the optic cable. I was also able to play music from my cellphone through the Bluetooth option.It doesn't have a lot of bass or give off the sound of theater surround sound as I would have enjoyed. But like I said I wasn't purchasing this to get that feature. For small spaces it's perfect. I'm not sure how this would work with my 50 inch TV, I'm curious to give it a try. I'm looking to get a new one for that TV as well.",

                "reviewText": "El dise\u00f1o es compacto, al rededor de los 40cm por lo que es perfecto para televisores peque\u00f1os o equipos de c\u00f3mputo que no cuenten con audio integrado.El sonido es bastante n\u00edtido y los bajos son profundos pero la calidad de sonido no es impecable. Esto se aprecia m\u00e1s en niveles de volumen m\u00e1s altos. Eso s\u00ed, la potencia es much\u00edsima para el tama\u00f1o del altavoz. Recomiendo usarla hasta un m\u00e1ximo del 30% de su potencia, considero que es un nivel suficiente para una habitaci\u00f3n no muy grande y cerrada, adem\u00e1s que as\u00ed se evitan distorsiones del sonido y se aprecia un sonido de mejor calidad.No esperes mucho, al contrario, pero por su precio entrega una calidad muy buena y un sonido excelente pero que no llega a remarcable.La prob\u00e9 reproduciendo m\u00fasica en Tidal por medio del cable auxiliar, luego en videos de YouTube, una pel\u00edcula en Netflix y finalmente un programa de TV. El sonido es claramente mejor que el de una televisi\u00f3n peque\u00f1a ya que \u00e9stas suelen tener altavoces de mala calidad y sin presencia de bajos.Su acabado es elegante y me gusta su rejilla met\u00e1lica al frente. Tengo que agradecer que incluyan cables RCA y AUX, adem\u00e1s el control es de buena calidad, yo habr\u00eda preferido m\u00e1s modos de EQ pero nuevamente por el precio se agradece que haya 3, utiliza 2 pilas AAA y tiene buena respuesta.La recomiendo para personas que quieran un sonido suficiente sin gastar de m\u00e1s, pero si eres audiofilo y necesitas claridad y potencia, \u00e9sta bocina no es para t\u00ed.",
