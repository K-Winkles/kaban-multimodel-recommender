                "reviewText": "The product description emphasizing the heavy bass and ability to annoy the neighbors made me think that I might not be the target market for this product. My musical interests do not run to genres where extremely loud bass is key, like hip Hop or Electronica or club mixes for big parties. I do listen to genres where bass is appreciated (blues and rock) as well as some where over-emphasized bass might be a problem (like jazz and vocal heavy genres often characterized as Americana or Singer Songwriter). I am so glad I gave it a try!The bass is certainly prominent, but rich and warm, unlike the fake bass boosts on some other products. More importantly for my purposes, it has beautiful, clear, well defined mids and highs. It can be very loud with minimal distortion, and still sounds great at both more normal and even low volumes.The other feature that was a pleasant surprise was the Adaptive EQ. I assumed it would just be a gimmick. I don't know how it works, but it maintains a very consistent sound in radically different environments, from a small contained room, to a greatroom open to a loft, and even outdoors on the deck. Another good feature is the fact that there is no change in sound quality and volume between powered and battery modes.The soundstage is amazing for a single speaker. I can't imagine why you would need more volume than this speaker produces. In terms of sound quality, I think it easily beats out the Bose Soundplay 30. I would give a slight edge to my Audio Engine HD6's, but that is to be expected from more expensive, powered, dual speakers. The Hyperboom may even handle bass better, and of course it is portable.Other good points - it has good bluetooth range, and has never dropped or crackled. The battery life is excellent.The app was easy to use, and set up was seamless. I did not try to connect additional speakers, so cannot speak to that function. The EQ function was a nice touch. The ability to pre-load a couple of play lists was interesting, though more would be better, and since you have to have your phone there anyway I am not sure how much it adds. But compared to the abysmal apps shipped with other products, it was a nice change of pace.The negatives - these don't matter to me but they might to you. It is pretty heavy (maybe just awkward because of size/shape and crappy rubber handle). Plenty portable, but I wouldn't take it on a hike or public transportation. I am not sure how water resistant it really is. There is a hole on top for the Adaptive EQ (where the ads show drinks being spilled, etc.), and it only arguably splash proof when being battery operated. Attaching power or other components requires removing the rubber cover on the electronic inputs. That cover is also a little fussy to get properly reattached.Overall, this is an excellent speaker and well worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "OverallThis is a great sounding speaker with long battery life. I considered sending it back because it's not as loud as the JBL 310. HOWEVER, this speaker does way too many things right to disregard.Sound Quality -This is a great sounding speaker! The bass is deep and musical (it's not \"boomy\" for the sake of being boomy). UE has done an amazing job tuning this speaker to get the most out of it's enclosure. The gain stage is set so that you can play at full volume without clipping the amplifier (this is probably done to avoid damaging the speakers). The volume is more than adequate in most situations (indoors is GREAT, outdoors is really good though the bass takes a hit without having the benefit of being against a wall, to help the passive radiators). I also think you may not consider this speaker \"loud\" because it plays so cleanly at full volume. The EQ in the app is helpful but I find myself leaving it flat most of the time, this may be because the adaptive EQ is really effective. I have not tried the optical input yet. This speaker has a huge soundstage and easily fills a decent sized room - I think this can be attributed to having speakers on two sides - most speakers only utilize one face - this seems really effective.Bluetooth / Battery Life -The Battery life is GREAT. I play this speaker all week thru the day on a single charge (volume around 50%). The Bluetooth has awesome range as advertised, of course going thru walls cuts it down somewhat. It never loses connection. We have not tried the 2nd BT input.Form Factor -This is a decent sized speaker, though very portable and easy to move around (especially compared to the JBL 310 or the Sony XP500/700). The handle is a clever idea and works great. I think having a 2nd one paired in Party mode would be unbelievable - I will likely pick another one up when I get another $400 :) Idea - UE should create an 8\" bluetooth sub that has an optical output that could feed a stereo signal to the Hyperboom (a 2' pole mount on both would be super cool).I had hoped to audition this speaker at the local big box retailer but of course their display wasn't working, I'm very happy though and would purchase this speaker again. If anything changes (quits working, battery life falls off dramatically, etc.), I'll post an update to this review.",

                "reviewText": "I love good thumping music. Ever since my days at UNC, I have enjoyed hosting parties and providing the highest quality sound. Great music makes a party!These days, I have a big backyard with an Island Deck which would be difficult to hardwire. The Hyperboom provides Hi-Fi sound and a good heavy beat. It allows me to \"Party-Up\" with my Megaboom and Boom 3 speakers to bring deeper and richer sound to my back yard!For the price this is a great and reliable alternative to hardwiring speakers outside.The only downside I have experienced with the Hyperboom is that it is a little heavy. It does not travel well on a bicycle like Wonderboom, Boom3 and Megaboom. It does, however, travel well by car, in a bike trailer, or on a larger touring style motorcycle. I can attest to all of these modes of transportation. The Hyperboom mates easily with Boom, Boom 3, and Megaboom devices. Great price...thanks Amazon!",

Dir\u00eda que est\u00e1 entre megaboom y megablast en calidad de audio (lo cual de todas maneras supera ampliamente a much\u00edsimas otras marcas en calidad de audio). Tiene m\u00e1s potencia que megaboom y megablast, aunque uno se quedar\u00eda con la idea de que pudiera tener m\u00e1s potencia considerando la buena potencia de su hermana megaboom, de mucho menor tama\u00f1o. La calidad de sonido es excepcionalmente buena, la bocina es bastante pesada, el material de la bocina es de muy buena calidad. el precio del producto es algo elevado y viene bien protegida en su empaque. S\u00ed es resistente al agua, aunque no tanto como megaboom, de acuerdo a la norma. La bater\u00eda tiene muy buena duraci\u00f3n, aunque da la impresi\u00f3n que megaboom logra un mejor ratio en un tama\u00f1o mucho m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o. Tiene un bot\u00f3n en la parte superior como selector del origen del audio, para dos dispositivos bluetooth, la entrada \u00f3ptica y la se\u00f1al auxiliar. No es una bocina 360\u00b0 como megaboom y megablast de modo que la ubicaci\u00f3n es mas importante para obtener una mejor distribuci\u00f3n del sonido. Dir\u00eda que por calidad no hay ning\u00fan problema. Su precio hace referencia a la alta calidad, aunque ese precio hace a veces complicado decantarse por una bocina port\u00e1til como esta. Estoy a gusto con la misma, recomendable si te gusta viajar, y escuchar m\u00fasica solo o con amigos en zonas donde no hay acceso a energ\u00eda. Tambi\u00e9n es recomendable para poner m\u00fasica en casas de tama\u00f1o medio (se siente como modo club) Supera ampliamente a muchos est\u00e9reos y modulares mucho m\u00e1s aparatosos. Su cargador es grande (similar al de una lap de 15.4) y si carga r\u00e1pido.",

Es esta.Si para ti es importante la conectividad con asistentes de voz (a mi no me interesa eso), entonces no es esta.Empec\u00e9 buscando una bocina Bose, pero luego me di cuenta que en la actualidad (jul 2021), las bocinas se enfocan mucho en la conectividad con Alexa y demas asistentes de voz, entonces el precio incluye esa parte que la verdad a mi no me interesan (yo buscaba CALIDAD de AUDIO.Al darme cuenta que la mayor\u00eda de las bocinas consideran eso de la conectividad con asistentes de voz en su precio, era obvio que mermaban en la calidad del audio. Entonces segu\u00ed buscando y di con esta excelente bocina, me decid\u00ed y estoy encantado.La compar\u00e9 con bocinas bose de gama alta (un amigo las tiene) y es lo mismo, solo que mucho m\u00e1s barata.Los materiales se sienten duraderos, la bater\u00eda practicamente nunca se te terminar\u00e1 (considerando que en la mayor\u00eda de las ocasiones no estar\u00e1s lejos de una conexi\u00f3n a la luz m\u00e1s de 24 horas), y nuevamente la calidad del audio es EXCELENTE.Puntos negativos:- La app presenta muchos bugs (aunque no es necesaria para que funcione bien la bocina).- Al menos yo, en la app no me aparece el equalizador (no he buscado soluci\u00f3n con soporte por que no es necesario, el equalizador autom\u00e1tico que trae funciona muy bien).",
