                "reviewText": "I got this mainly because it was not expensive and I have a lot of Boba Fett items. It's tiny and it looks good. The sound isn't great, but it's not so bad that you can't listen to it. It's actually clear than I expected. But I'm used to stereo and this is very mono. It might be better to have two connected at once and set apart from one another, but I'm not planning on buying a second one to find out. I would say buy these if you're a fan/collector of the character it is in the shape of, but there are better choices if the main reason you want this is a speaker.",

Grabbed a table next to a propane jet, set down our beers and proceeded to stream our Spotify playlist for 4 hours until the battery was spent.There is no bass to speak of, think 70s era transistor radio, but this bad boy can get LOUD without distorting what you are playing.I almost want to pick up another one so I can pair them up",
