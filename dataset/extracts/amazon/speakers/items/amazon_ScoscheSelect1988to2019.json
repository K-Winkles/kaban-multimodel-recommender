You will still require some work and modifications, as there are too many different aftermarket speakers of different makes and models that are not designed to be the best fit for your application.I was replacing all 4 of the original 6.75\" speakers, so I purchased 4 (four) of these adapters. Still had to drill some extra holes and shave-off some material, but I made them to work for my retrofit. However, the plastic is still... plastic... and one of the adapters broke in one place. Wished I had purchased a couple more to cover all the unpredictable situations. But I used some adhesive and automotive rubber-like strips to seal some gaps, insulate and reduce vibrations.Took a lot of time, patience and adaptation work, but I made it.",
