                "reviewText": "I've had this for roughly two months now and feel like I can finally give my opinion on it. I'll admit that I didn't expect much from this little speaker, and honestly wouldn't have been mad if I only got a month of use of of it for the price. But it's still working perfectly.Right off the bat, while I spent call myself a big audiophile, I can be a bit picky with my audio devices. I usually stick to my headphones, but I wanted a little speaker for sharing music or when I'm working around my house and want a portable speaker to take to the room I'm in. I also wanted something I could stick in the bathroom for music while I'm taking a bath or shower.I researched a few little speakers around this price range, and after a bit of consideration, I decided to purchase it. One big factor in my decision was the which shipping.Right off the bat, it's a stylish little speaker. Everything is straightforward and it can be set up easily even without the instructions. I turned on bluetooth on my Android and it paired easily. I haven't tried it with an iOS device yet. If includes a sturdy little case for portability, charging cable, and aux cable.I noticed the speaker was at the bottom, so I worried about the sound. Other reviews said it sounded good and had surprisingly good bass, and they were right. Compared to other speakers, it sounded full and not tinny or muffled.I was also concerned with the volume possibly being too low, but this speaker can definitely fill a room pretty well, so long as it's not a huge room with a noisy crowd. Putting it on a solid flat surface helps as well.The battery lasts pretty long, as I was able to use it for half a day continuously on a single charge. I probably could've gotten more out of it if I needed.The touch controls are very responsive as well.Now, just today, I decided to grab it after not having used it for a few weeks. I didn't charge it and just fired it up, and to my pleasant surprise, it's held its charge! Most cheap wireless devices I've used tend to have a drained battery after an extended time without use.I haven't used the microphone, so I can't comment on that.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and would happily purchase another if something happens to this one. The only thing I didn't really like were the power up and power down messages, since I don't like my devices taking to me, but that is a very trivial thing.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased and tested the XLEADER Circular Design Speaker, and while it has some positive features, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Here's a detailed review of my experience:Design and Build Quality:The circular design of the XLEADER speaker is aesthetically pleasing and compact, making it easy to carry around. The speaker is lightweight and feels well-constructed, with a solid build quality. The design is minimalistic and modern, blending well with different room decors or outdoor settings.Sound Quality:One of the standout features of this speaker is its sound quality. Despite its compact size, the XLEADER speaker delivers impressive audio output. The sound is clear, with decent bass and good overall volume. It offers an enjoyable listening experience for casual music playback or watching movies on a smaller scale.Connectivity Options:The XLEADER speaker provides several connectivity options, including Bluetooth and an auxiliary input. Pairing the speaker with Bluetooth-enabled devices is quick and hassle-free. The speaker maintains a stable connection within a reasonable range. Additionally, the inclusion of an auxiliary input allows for wired connections to devices that lack Bluetooth functionality.",

                "reviewText": "I always sleep with a white noise machine and got this for a longer trip where I would be staying in multiple hotels in large cities. I used it every night for over 3 weeks and it was amazing (with a white noise app). So small and light it fit in my backpack, connected to my phone super easily, charged up very quickly, and lasted 8+ hours when fully charged. The little case was a nice bonus and didn't add bulk. It was some of the best $ I've spent on a travel accessory EVER since I value my sleep and am a light sleeper. If you need something super loud then it might not be the right choice but it was loud enough for my purposes, occasionally I could hear a heavy metal hotel door closing but it was still a huge improvement.",

                "reviewText": "This speaker did surprise me, it's clarity & sound were more than I expected at this price point. I simply needed a speaker to enhance the sound of my laptop & this little guy could not have worked out better! It has several nice features including an auxiliary port & cable, an SD card slot, including that cable, as well. However, the two things that I really love about this speaker is, that you can use the speaker as a single device or you can pair two devices together. And 2nd, I \ud83d\udcaf % absolutely l\ud83d\udc95ve that the controls on this speaker are so accessible & SO easy to see, even at night, yes please!! It is incredibly challenging to find speakers with top buttons.. & if so, they are barely readable!! And that, is what made me so very happy to find this little guy, which has been an absolute pleasure to use, because of this design! It also stays firmly on whatever surface you place it on because of the rubber feet. The speaker also comes in a great little zippered case that holds the speaker, cables & can prob. even fit an SD card if you wanted to tuck it in behind the cables. I think it would be hard to beat this little guy considering it's feature set, sound & price point.. I \ud83d\udcaf % recommend.",
