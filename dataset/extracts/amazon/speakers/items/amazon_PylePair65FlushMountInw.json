Works great so far, wanted to add speakers upstairs so we didn't have to crank the basement and she the house to hear everything upstairs. Install was simple, minus attic insulation haha. They are 16 ohm so volume is not as loud as the other system speakers but not a major difference. I paired them with the Pyle for channel selector and I am not disappointed. Only time will tell on actually quality but everything seems well made. Need to get some outdoor speakers for the patio and garage now and will most likely go with Pyle again",

                "reviewText": "First off, these speakers are not the best speakers you\u2019ll ever hear. But in-ceiling speakers don\u2019t need to be! These speakers are perfect for whole home audio and work great and sound quite respectable, especially considering their price point. I have gotten worse sound from speakers 2x the cost. They are a little lacking in the bass department, but you can EQ them to sound pretty good. All in all, very happy, 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this brand when I moved into my home 7 years ago. One of my speakers started to separate from the ceiling and turns out the plastic ring was disintegrating - fell apart like brittle when I removed it from the ceiling. Bought these to replace the old ones. They did not disappoint - the ring of these new ones feels like a hard plastic or even metal. And hey - for 7 years, that one speaker worked perfectly. And for the record, the other 7 speakers I installed 7 years ago are still working just fine.Great brand for the value. And sound is excellent for my home theater, bedroom and dining room.",

The sound out of these drivers are nice and clear. I created a compass out of a wood shim and drywall screw and nail. Stud finder to find the joists and cut the circle in the middle.Now wired for 7.2 sound, movies are much more immersive with this pair of speakers added.Great product from a name brand known for quality speakers. Very happy with my purchase.Thanks so much Pyle!!!",
