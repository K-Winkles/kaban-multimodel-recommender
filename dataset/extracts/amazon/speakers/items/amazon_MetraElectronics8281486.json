                "reviewText": "Hello,I purchased these for my 2007 Toyota Corolla LE. The positives for these adapters:The nice thing about them is they are very similar in size and shape to the factory adapters. They also line up with the rivet holes that are left over once the rivets are drilled out. The mounting bracket has a hole on the side to slide the new wiring through instead of having to re-route the wires or pinch them when mounting.The negatives of this mounting bracket:The bracket is not designed to fit a 6.5 inch speaker without modification. This means that the inside tabs will need to be trimmed off in order to fit the speaker correctly. This can be a pain to do if you do not have the right tools or do not take this into account prior to installation. Another issue is that the provided equipment includes bolts with washers and nuts that do not appear to lock very tightly. That is to say that the bolt and nuts appear as though they might loosen over time. If you are expecting to use self tapping screws, you will have to provide them yourself.Overall I give this 3 stars as it worked but required modifications and has me a little nervous that I might have to go buy locking washers at some point if I start to hear some rattling. Hope this quick review helped.",
