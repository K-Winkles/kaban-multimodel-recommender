The sound quality was all right when I first started using it, but to be honest I was a little bit disappointed what the sound. However, after a few weeks the speaker had broken in a little bit more and the sound became so much more rich and full and it has continued to. I love it everything about it. I live in a one bedroom apartment and this little speaker is enough to fill it with sound, I usually never have it above 75% volume. I will eventually get a second one for stereo sounds but I haven't actually really noticed very much, the speaker does a good job at filling out the room. If you're on the fence at all just buy it and give it a little while to break in. I am more than happy with mine.",

It's easier to carry for barbecues, park and so on. Sounds amazing and loud. Took me a while to figure out how to use the microphone during a call but I finally got it :)",

                "reviewText": "Wow! What a great speaker. This thing gets loud and has that Marshall sound profile you know and love. I was looking for something small to fit in my carry on for a trip to Hawaii and this fit the bill.First off, this thing is beautiful just to look at. The styling on it is very swanky. It\u2019s looks just like a miniature version of a guitar amp so it looks great just sitting around in your home. I decided to download the Marshall Bluetooth app to test the different sound profiles. I fired it up and connected it to my iPhone. I was immediately greeted by nice clear tones with surprising low end from a speaker of this size. It\u2019s amazing that that much sound can come from a speaker just a little larger than a deck of playing cards. It has a couple of settings. One that\u2019s a little flat designed for vocals, one that boosts the highs and lows, and then the signature Marshall sound. That\u2019s my favorite. It has just a fantastic sound profile that\u2019s pleasing for all kinds of music. The speaker also has a built in strap that snaps over any backpack strap or belt for using while you\u2019re on the move. It has a nice rubbery texture and seems to be very impact resistant.Overall, this is a fantastic speaker and if you\u2019re looking for a smaller carry on speaker you won\u2019t be disappointed with this one. There\u2019s other very capable speakers for less money but they won\u2019t sound this good. Spend the extra dough. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

Al principio el sonido es algo acartonado pero despu\u00e9s de la primer sesi\u00f3n probando distintos g\u00e9neros, vol\u00famentes y todas sus ecualizaciones mejora la calidad considerablemente. De momento me ha dado unas 10-11 horas 85-90 % de volumen constante, podr\u00eda esperar las 15+ hrs a menor volumen. A\u00fan no he probado el strap pero parece lo suficientemente robusto como para soportar las traves\u00edas. Lo he encontrado en oferta y no pude resistirlo, una compra acertada. Si lo que buscas es un parlante de viaje bueno, bonito(quiz\u00e1 no tan barato) no busques m\u00e1s.",
