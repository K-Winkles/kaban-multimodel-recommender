                "reviewText": "if you like jbl you will like this both the same just different brand and half the price. Battery last long and the bass is good for the size sometimes I use this more then my boss or jbl speakers just for the fact that I don't have to worry about jamming it out to hard and regret buying a new one. Don't be cheap but don't be stupid bump it until the next door screams then just throw the speaker into their window and change the song because at the end of the day it's cheap enough to be that good and worth every penny I can't break this thing even if I tryed. BUT JBL just has that respect factory where it just becomes the life party just because of brand. Just saying",

                "reviewText": "Liked the speaker a lot. The sound is good for the beach and the golf course. However, after 2 years the battery will show fully charged, but only last about 10-15 minutes. Maybe that's normal, but I thought it would last longer.Edit: Trelab contacted me after seeing my review and replaced the speaker right away!! Great customer service and the new one sounds great and the battery lasts a long time (haven't run it out yet).",

                "reviewText": "I bought one just to play background music on my porch whilst I'm enjoying a pleasant afternoon or evening outdoors. But liked it so much I bought another so I'd have full stereo! They are loud enough that at higher volume my neighbours can all enjoy my music with me, and the sound quality is much better than I expected for speakers of this size and price (in my home theatre I have 7.2 surround with two 12-inch subs and Cerwin-Vega VS-12s, so I'm used to top quality sound). They have decent highs and midrange, plus plenty of bass for R&B, Ole Skool, Jazz, and Hip-Hop.They're even good enough that when the DJ didn't show up for a store grand opening last weekend, I ran my favourite '90s and '00s playlist through these speakers for four straight hours and the crowd started calling me DJ Busta Hip 'cause I'm a G (geezer; not gangsta)!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First off, if you\u2019re trying to decide between products, I was very happy with both the Treblab HD77 (smaller) AND the Treblab HD Max! Both off impeccable sound quality, response, and bass. Of course a larger diaphragm means more sound and even more bass, so the HD Max blows its little brother out of the water, hands down. Much better sound and construction quality than other brands; price too. I bought my HD Max for my theater projector actually. The awkwardness of dragging around a sound bar and trying to find appropriate placement within or outside of my house is a pain. With the Bluetooth capability and or 3/8 direct input cable good connecting great sound is a snap. The HD Max is built for travel. It\u2019s also not going to keel over and die when subjected to some light rain, splash from a nearby pool, or a spilled drink. Treblab products are simply built like a tank. And the will play for hours on end on a single charge. Using your phone to play music and you get a call, no problem! You can use the speaker for that too. There really is very little that I can find to complain about Treblab\u2019s speakers. This wouldn\u2019t be an honest review however if I didn\u2019t include a couple of minor issues. My biggest complaint with the HD Max (or HD77 for that matter) is the low power warning that you get when nearing empty. Don\u2019t get me wrong, warnings are good, but not when you\u2019re using power to warn me that it\u2019s going to shut off. You\u2019re just robbing me of rocking out to the last few minutes of the song I was listening to. Not to mention the frequency in which the interruption comes. I think a better option would be using a light system. Example: lit green = full power, yellow = moderate, red = need to recharge. There\u2019s really no reason to audibly tell me I need to charge my Treblab; I\u2019ll know when it dies after all. Lastly, and mind you this is purely a limitation of the technology itself and not Treblab\u2019s fault, I can\u2019t wait until the day that using Bluetooth means no longer sacrificing volume. It\u2019s a story as old as time itself, trying to find the balance between quality and functionality. When you take on the flexibility and convenience of the portability that comes with Bluetooth, you are not going to get the same performance that you would with a corded, uninterrupted, powered version of another audio source of equal measure. That said, Treblab is pretty damn close! Best audio investment I\u2019ve ever made. Bottom line, you will not be sorry!12/04/22 - Okay, now I\u2019m a little sorry.....So I\u2019m not going to bad-mouth Treblab, I still have had predominantly good experiences with them and their products. That being said, my HD Max is now dead after 1.5 years. The warranty is good for 1 year, so in fairness, Treblab has fulfilled their promise. No one assumes a purchase will crap out soon after than time though. Usually they last a few years and the buyer understands that after the warranty expires, if you \u201cbreak it\u201d it won\u2019t be serviced for free. I hadn\u2019t done anything different, the rubber enclosure has always been kept closed aside from charging, it was never around humidity, water, or dropped. It just stopped charging one day. Sad \ud83d\ude2d. So, I\u2019m not asserting that if you buy this product it will happen to you, nor do I know how often it happens in general to this product. Also, the customer service agent was very nice and professional in attempting to help me revive my, now useless, heavy-a$$, paperweight. I have to reduce my initial impression of a 5 star review to a 3 star now. In comparison, my Treblab HD77, although smaller and cheaper, has been chugging along with no problems and purchased 1-2 years before the HD Max, as much more robust and expensive speaker. As always, buyer beware.",
