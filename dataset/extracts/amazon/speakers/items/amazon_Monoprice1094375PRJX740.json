That's a deal!No instructions -> Figuring them out isn't an obvious thing (given the sizable number of reviews/pix using the plug-stacking side hole, to mount the wires):It's pretty easy, checkout Ealan Osborne's \"monoprice\" YouTube video tip (strip _very little_: you want ~ 1/4\" of bare wire sticking out past the end of the barrel, splaying out the individual wires across the barrel top, and avoid crossing them into the threads, then screw the plug into the barrel), and Barbara Chambers recommendation to _use two pairs of pliers_ to tighten the coarse thread connection down to _firmly_ grip those splayed wires.If you've got too much wire overlapped, and it's tearing the spayed wires off, strip back further, trim the end and try it again.You may have to attempt it a few times but that combo gets it done.I've got some old thick-insulation monster 12ga wire, that wouldn't even fit up the barrel, so I simply stripped enough to traverse the barrel + 1/4\".
