                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Their 12 AWG wire is definitelt worth it; especially if on sale",
                "reviewText": "I was unfamiliar with this brand, but took a chance on buying 100-feet roll of 12 AWG CCA Speaker Wire, because on that day, the price definitely caught my eye. Considering how many times I've received incorrectly sized standed speaker wire in the past, I was very pleased with the quality of this wire for the price I paid. So impressed that I was intending to buy a second roll, but got distracted for a couple days, and when I remembered, the 12 AWG 100-feet roll had almost doubled in price. Prices will vary, but when I need more speaker wire this will be one of the brands I will look at first.I liked that the product listing did not shy away from it being CCA wire, nor did it try too hard to justify why you should buy it. Listings that go too far out of their way to imply that CCA has certain advantages over pure copper wire, would be fine if they weren't also misleading consumers about the actual gauge size of the wire they are attempting to sell, which brings me to the next thing that I liked about this wire.I love, truly love, the fact that the brand, Seller, and/or manufacturer publicly discloses the strand count. Unfortunately, they could do much better job at it by making things clear for the average consumer. They state that their 12 AWG Speaker Cale has 2 conductors, and 168 Strands. Well, that could be 168 Strands per conductor, or 84 Strands per conductor. Which is it? 168 Strands is not uncommon for Pure Copper Speaker Wire, usually starting around 90 cents per foot at the current price of copper. It is a little unusual to see that many strands in a single conductor for CCA Speaker Wire, but I have personally seen it before.Unlike the \"rope-braided\" copper speaker wire that people often refer to when complaining about how small in diamater CCA wire is, this wire looks and feels a little like it has a pseudo semi-rope-braid-thing going on with the strands. In the past, I don't know the name of the true manufacturer of that wire back then, but they did an interesting thing in assembling the strands for each conductor. They took like 6 or 7 strands, and put a very gentle type of twist to the strands to keep them together. Then they assembled these little \"bundles\" of strands, and twisted the bundles together to create a single conductor. The twists complimented each other, so it wasn't obvious to see. Back then I tried to seperate all the strands so I could count them, but I don't do that anymore because it's too easy to lose count with just a stripped end of wire. Twisting helps hold the strands together, but I could be wrong. It makes me think of a spring. It can take a 12-inch steel wire to make a 6-inch long spring, and all those loops, or \"twists\", add strength. So I think the way they twisted the strands improves the tensile strength of the CCA conductors as a whole.There's not a ridiculus amount of PVC insulation, which is another good thing. The PVC is traditional fare, in that it's a little stiff and rigid, similar to lamp cord, but you have to consider the price point. Soft, flexible insulation made from foam PVC, or even PTFE insulation is more \"boutique,\" and begins at a different price point provided wire sizes are accurate. There are only two things I do not like abou this wire:1. \"We need small pieces of self-adhesive hook and loop included.\" The wire length seems to be measured and cut by machine. Don't simply unroll and try to measure the wire's length. The PVC wants to hold its shape, and it needs time to relax. If the wire was hot when measured and cut, you may be short a few inches, and if the wire's version of an odometer for measuring is out of calibration, you may be short 6-feet. If a roll is more than 6-inches short, it usually means that someone doing the CAD programming screwed up when converting Metric to American Imperial Measurement. I'm sharing that because the roll arrived with 4 twist ties holding it together, inside a cardboard box. Whoever programmed the CAD box dimensions didn't make the insert tabs wide enough. Once the seals on the flaps are broken, the weight of the wire itself will open one or both flaps. My roll went flying across the room when I picked it up to put it away. lol2. 0.785 times n(umber of strands) times (strand diameter)^squared. This simple formula provides the cross sectional area of multi-stranded single conductor. I wish, and I'm very disappointed that they did not post publicly the strand diameter. Based upon common wire industry practices, the strands may be 0.16mm in diameter, but I don't own a micrometer or caliper. However, if the strands truly are 0.16mm in diameter, then this is indeed equivalent to 12 AWG, which at least my roll seems to be equivalent.Most importantly, this is a good quality CCA Speaker Wire, regardless of gauge size, and when it is available around the same price range as other brands, I would choose this over the others. Too many brands are basing AWG upon the diameter of the loosely twisted single conductor, which is why people complain about wire being smaller than what it's labelled. There's a formula because the cross-sectional area excludes the air gaps between the individual strands, while measuring just the diameter of an assembled conductor includes those air gaps.There's a very simple way to estimate if the stranded wire you buy is the gauge it claims, or at least, very close to it. No math involved. When you go to strip Stranded 12 AWG Wire, you should be using the 10 AWG hole, and the insulation should be removed cleanly from the stranded conductor. Take a look at some different brands of wire strippers, and some will show which holes are what gauge for a single solid conductor, and which holes are what size for stranded conductors. It will vary, but generally stranded wire with strand diameters between 0.16-0.254mm are one even gauge size larger than a single solid conductor gauge. Strand Count, Strand Diameter, and \"Twists per Inch, Foot, or Meter,\" are some of the variables. The roll I received stripped almost cleanly using the 10 AWG Solid conductor hole of my brand new wire strippers. 10 AWG cut off a couple strands, but 12 AWG cut off a few strands. So the only thing I really don't like about this brand of CCA wire is that the flaps on the box won't stay closed. lol",
