Sound preferences r exceptionally variable; I am nowhere near an audiophile and I listen mostly to classical music, fair amount of opera...and bluegrass. The quiet passages are rendered nicely and I find I no longer need to compromise when setting the initial volume or adjusting the settings on the fly. Tosca and Carmen use essentially the same initial settings. I do find they are a tad bright and the bass can get a bit muddy but the equalizer does a great job on these speakers. Banjo solos sound great with little adjustment. Excellent choice, well pleased and thanks again to the reviewers who took a LOT of time to explain these speakers' performance.",

                "reviewText": "Yes...I was finally wanting to upgrade from my used thrift shop Sony CMT cp11 bookshelf tape/cd player with only Bass and Treble eq, at about 30 watts with only two speakers possible. Good little retro unit. I used to have one of the bigger, thicker Sony monster bookshelf 3 or 5 disc changer with those big old speakers with super looking sub woofer dealios. I miss that that system very much. I used to also have some components I got from my dad's old cool system, 2 full size Pioneer speakers that were pretty nice too. I had to let some things go and some things didn't last the test of time. I've had a few thrift stereos that have their own speakers. Issues here and there. Used stuff isn't always a great idea for the savings.I finally had a little saved paired with some early Xmas money and I opted to research pushing my Sony CMT through some better speakers in my price range. I missed feeling the music MORE. More push...more vibe, more of a fulfilling overall wall of sound, spectrum, space, soundstage and all those audiophiliac terms that I am not that familiar with. If it sounds good and I can hear that music wonderfully with some control over it with the source, DSP/EQ...I'm good. I don't crank it to 11 or 9..maybe more like 5 to 8ish these days. So...after much research...and watching many vids from the most awesome reviewer out of many, Randy the Cheap Audio Man...I really narrowed my search down to Cs5's. A pair ..my first ..around Thanksgivingish...73 bucks..GREAT Sale! Had to get that Cs9 subwoofer too.The trio arrived and I pushed it with the Sony CMT...but I felt I wanted a little more of something.Found the Keiid cd player 2 channel 20 watt cd/mp3 cd usb sd card unit...for a damn good dealso I opted to get that one. Got it..retired my old thrift bought Sony CMT cp 11..as I really dug the power and sound and 3 eq offering of the Keiid.Then...hmmm, I wanted to use the other channel, having all 4 surround sound for audio mostly and maybe watching some movies and concerts on dvd and vhs. I ended up getting 2 more on sale...and one more sub for a total of 4 cs5s and 2 cs9s...after of course watching some more reviews on them by Randy the Cheap Audio Man. Hmmm... Great info lead me to make a follow up buy whilst these speakers were on sale which was awesome saving for sure.I then..heard about the Sony 149 priced stereo audio recver via Randy. I had to look into that more. I did. I thought I'd make that buy too. Then...of course..unsure of how long the Keiid would last...as I dug it..but wanted another cd/dvd playing choice as I was running audio and dvd through an old dvd vhs sony unit that might have not been all that great..also a 8 buck buy at the thrift shop..with remote. Worked great..but quality had diminished via vid and sound to my ears. Got the 44 buck Sony HDMI upscale dvd that plays cds. I wanted to keep it all Sony since I had has mostly good luck with Sony over the years...and I felt it would make a great set up to keep it all one brand..all complimenting each other. Knowing very well that there are better speakers, subs, receivers, dvd cd players out there. This seemed to work for my musical needs...which seemed like a BIG upgrade from what I was listening to for the past 5 years.I have 2 speakers Fronts at ear level not that wide of a spread since my room studio isn't that big and I am limited on space. I put the 2 back speakers on the cd bookshelves above or at about 6 to 7 feet up spaced about same as Front speakers. A very nice musical sound box was created..with the two subs below table of where front speakers are spaced about a foot or more apart. Wonderful set up! Light years of where I was with my other bookshelf units..Sony, Aiwa and etc. This set is NICE for the investment ..as opposed to waiting and building a system for more money in time. This is a great sounding system of sound for my collection to be played through and enjoyed with enough power and over all everything I need for where I'm at in life now....hand in hand with awesome savings..I hope all the pieces of this ensemble last a long time... I'll save up and aim a bit higher next time..but this was a pretty wonderful first venture in the audiophile ..build a home audio stereo system that works well with your needs..as opposed to watching tons of reviews and doubting you did the right thing after learning about other awesome productions in that same price range or on sale or close to it.I guess, if you have the budget to expand and have a plentiful variety of speakers, receivers cd transports power amps..components, systems and etc... luck you. We peeps on budgets...find what we dig, need, want..and make it work.cause it works well enough without use needing to upgrade monthly.Rock on...Have a wonderful 2021! Be safe..Be kind.Check out Randy the cheap Audio man and learn..get pointers, advice..info..and make your decision a fun journey like I did. Tell him RiffnWolf or WrathBliss sent you.",

                "reviewText": "We received this subwoofer yesterday and tried it extensively today. We own a pair of small speakers in back which, though good overall, suffer from the usual imperfections of outdoor listening. This clear, efficient woofer fills the gap. [Yes, any speaker now can be used outdoors. Protective spray coatings are available, or weatherproof fabric covers can be ordered to fit any size and shape of speaker cabinet.] Since the Sony SA-CS9 allows a frequency range from 28 Hz, adjustable to as high as 200 Hz, it reaches further up into the \"mid-bass\" range than the usual 125 Hz cut-off. This benefit renders the Sony sub perfect for music, even paired with very small speakers. We reduce their bass output from the amp's tone control, allowing the sub to make up the difference. Even heard at a soft volume, outdoor (or indoor) music displays more richness and accuracy, without disturbing the neighbors. This wide-range subwoofer is a great find. From my results so far, i would recommend it without any doubt! // Some Features: Adjustable crossover and volume; optional automatic on/off; 115 watts RMS (200 peak) active output; fiber cone (not paper); sturdy cabinet; relatively compact size; ported design; simple, flexible set-up; low price; high-quality sound.",
