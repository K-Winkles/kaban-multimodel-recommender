I'm a woodworker and when I get around to it I'll make something so I didn't want to spend a lot on something that I would be replacing. These are a perfect fit. There's a heavy weight in the base so they are quite stable. However the plastic that the speaker mounts to did break when one of my cats ran full speed into the speaker when he jumped off the arm of the couch. So I had to make a new way to mount the speakers. So I did mark down the durability some.They have plenty of height adjustment and the speaker wires run inside the metal tube. So they have a clean look. If you have rough kids or wild animals they may not be durable enough. That being said after one got knocker once it hasn't happed again. I did have plans on mounting the base to a wide heavy piece of hardwood to help keep them upright but I haven't and doubt I will",

                "reviewText": "I needed something to give me better options in a weird shaped room for my rear channel speakers. I didn't want to spend a ton of money for something that just holds a speaker, so went with this.It shipped quickly and is adequately packaged, so not much chance of damage during shipping, but my immediate complaint was styrofoam. I hate styrofoam since it always ends up with a bunch of small pieces broken off that just seem to get everywhere far too easily.Assembly was easy, and even getting the speaker wire through the stand was not too difficult. There were no screws that fit my speakers (Yamaha) so I had to use the generic key option to fit in the slot on the back of them, and this was another part I wasn't too thrilled with. The default way to do it is a screw ran backwards so that the head of the screw is what slides into the slot of the speaker. Then there's supposed to be a rubber washer, the stand then another rubber washer and a little female part that screws onto it with thumb grips that you use to tighten it all. I tried it that way but the rubber washers meant no tight fit, speaker sagged and wouldn't sit upright. So I pulled the rubber washers and just used the screw and the thumb tightening piece, and that worked better, so the speaker sits mostly upright now, but the problem using a screw is there's no good way to really get it as tight as I'd want since the screw in the slot will just spin after a certain point. I could pull the speaker off and try to tighten it a little more, then try to force the speaker back over it and just pressure the speaker into place with a tighter screw there, but I didn't want to risk braking any of the plastic, either on the speaker or on the stands. I managed to get it about as tight as I could without risk, and the speakers are held just about upright now.The bases have a weight under them to help keep everything stable, and the stand adjusts easily up or down.All told, you are getting what you pay for with a lower price, but for someone with my needs, it at least is functional and inexpensive.",

                "reviewText": "Great minimalist surround speaker stand.Gets the job done and comes with all sorts of bolts and washers so you can mount a wide variety of speaker brands.I'd say it's probably worth no more than $20 or $25 because of the build quality. It's borderline cheap looking but it's acceptable by my standards because you won't be staring at it. as you watch your movies. the little plastic that tightens the two halves arrived and functioned properly but I can see this could be a problem. Try to delicately put tighten and assemble this unit or you might damage it's plastic parts.When you shop and look for alternatives online, you'll see that nothing can touch the cost benefit of this set.It was very easy to assemble and put it together for my set of 5.1 ONN (Walmart branded...) speakers with the two surround satellite speaker set. By the way, these satellite speakers are quite big and heavy and this stand had no issues coping with the added weight. In a sense, I'm impressed.If you're like me and always try to stretch your bucks as far as you can whilst purchasing a product that will not crumble right before your eyes or as you attempt to put it together, this is the set for you.I highly recommend this product.",
