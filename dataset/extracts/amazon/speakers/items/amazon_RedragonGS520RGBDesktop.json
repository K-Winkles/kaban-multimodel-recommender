                "reviewText": "i absolutely adore the color and led lights of this speaker and the sound quality is really nice as well! my only complaint is that i had to mess with the wires for awhile to get the speakers to both work after i had plugged them into my monitor, which was pretty frustrating (make sure to plug in the audio jack fully or else you\u2019ll have a terrible static noise behind your sound). i also have run into another problem with the speakers randomly turning on / making that speaker thump noise and led lights turn on while mymonitor and gaming console is turned off. i\u2019m not sure why this happens but it\u2019s usually every few hours which is weird, it gets annoying after the first few times and i\u2019m unsure how to fix this as my speakers are plugged in completely snug and my monitor is turned off when it happens :(",

The color modes available are: regular rainbow led colors, regular rainbow led colors but less saturated, breathing led, red, green, blue. Very easy to change with a small tap.Value? = for budget or even non-budget gaming, very strong addition to set up for its price.BUToriginal title: Defective - 9/10/2021; TWO DAYS AFTER opened and started using beginning 9/7/2021All of the above is true, above expectation, and would receive a 5 star from me only if it maintained itself this way, which it didn't...Reason for low rating = the original title of this post... Used it for TWO days. Worked absolutely fine and was above expectation for what it's worth. Then 3rd day... the left speaker stopped working. On top of not working, there is a ticking sound that is non-stop and very noticeable even at a high volume.I've messaged them. I'll update this response and star rating depending on how their customer service goes.update 1 - 9/17/21: The customer support is fantastic. Quick, simple, and precise responses. As of right now, I'm getting mine replaced. I think I was just unfortunate to get a factory error one. I'll update the rating and response once I test the second one when it arrives.update 2 - 9/19/21: Literally arrived in less than 2 days. Received it today, everything works perfectly when simply plugged in right out of the box. I'll update again if something happens after 2 days again; otherwise, I hope this review helped.",

                "reviewText": "These were bought to replace some other PC speakers my cat decided to destroy. They're not as robust as my old ones, so I didn't expect them to be a complete 1:1 replacement. That said...Pros: Love the compactness of them, they fit well on my already busy desk. They have a decent sound when playing certain types of music or video game dialogue. I love the RGB! They match my ROG keyboard and Redragon mouse perfectly. The volume was wonky at first, but once I figured it out, the controls work fine. The touch controls for the RGB is nice!Cons: The sound on a lot of music isn't great, which is the whole point to having speakers in the first place! There's a \"fuzziness\" to it that is hard to get past. At first I thought it was just when playing music above around 30 or so on windows. But after trying different music and volumes, it happens even at low settings depending on the songs.I realize these are not exactly high quality, expensive speakers. So my expectations were pretty minimal. It's just really disappointing that they aren't as great as many of the reviews seem to say. Maybe I just got a bad set?Overall, wouldn't buy again, but they aren't the worst speakers I've ever had. Others seem to have had a better time with them, so maybe I'm an outlier. :)",
