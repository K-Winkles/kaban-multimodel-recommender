They can be turned off by holding down the RGB button. Bluetooth connection is handy, but delayed. Great for music, but not for videos. Changed PC connection to the 3.5mm cord. Which is also very short, only 3 feet long. Overall, decent speakers with some shortcomings (as in short cords).",

                "reviewText": "These are great sounding speakers when you have music going through them. Surprisingly good! Very balanced sound. I really want to like them, but.......WOW the voice prompts are HORRIBLE!!! There is no way to turn them down or off, so every time you change mode, you hear an unintelligible voice in broken English saying what \"mood\" you are in. There are 4 modes and I can only understand the voice for two of them. The bigger deal is that the voice is LOUD and you cannot disable it, nor turn it down. You could have the speaker volume ALL THE WAY DOWN and that awful voice still yells at you.These speakers have so much wasted potential. I really love how they sound, but I can't really get past the terrible voice prompts and random sounds they make.I could not get bluetooth pairing to work at all. I had to plug these in to my computer via USB to use them.One last thing, these are not brand specific. There is no brand on the box at all. So, these are likely a generic speaker set that is sold on that one marketplace that I can't mention. Not that its a bad thing, just realize you are buying some generic speakers.Overall, I can't recommend these...especially if you plan to use them with little ones sleeping in the house!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These computer speakers brought to you by Jounivo provide very good sound, lighting and controls, but are limited on their max volume. Probably not the best choice if you want to play loud music, but great for everything else.What I like:\u2022 This is a very nice set of computer speakers that perform very well overall. I would put them in the mid-high level on performance and value.\u2022 The center control unit is handy and nice to have. It works well and gives you most of the controls you would want.\u2022 The sound quality is very good for the size, can get mildly loud for computer speakers, but the performance falls off quick at the top. I would\u2019ve expected them to achieve a higher top volume for their current asking price of $79.99 USD, but it\u2019s still very good.\u2022 The lighting is fun and has many settings to add to their value.\u2022 The EQ settings also work well and perform like everything else in a higher middle range.\u2022 Not that you will touch the speakers often, but they have the soft touch feeling to the plastic and I love it.\u2022 It\u2019s very useful that you can use Bluetooth, USB, Or 3.5mm Aux.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this set of speakers, they are easy to set-up, user friendly, have good solid sound, and have a great way to control the action. Despite its lack of super high volume, it\u2019s still provided a great experience while gaming or watching videos.If you want to see them in action and close-up watch my included video in full screen.I hope you found this information to be helpful in your decision.",
