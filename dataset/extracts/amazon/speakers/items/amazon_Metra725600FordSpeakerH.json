                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Zero need to cut and solder as other reviews have stated",
                "reviewText": "The number one thing these reviews have said is that the wires are pinned into the connector incorrectly. This is true, the negative wire on these does not match up with the negative on the body harness. BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO CUT OR SOLDER ANYTHING TO FIX THIS. Normally I would suggest de-pinning the Metra connectors but I couldn't quite tell how they de-pinned and I was concerned about the quality of the connector in switching the pins (this was valid, read on). The easiest thing to do to make these work properly is to de-pin the body harness. All you need is a small flat blade screwdriver and some patience.1. First thing you want to do is disconnect the stock speaker and throw it away.2. Then focus in on on the body harness connector, you will see a red locking mechanism (plastic), there is also a red gasket there (rubber) so look close. Stick your flat blade screwdriver between the plastic lock and rubber seal to pry the plastic lock up (see pictures).3. Once the lock is popped up, you then need to pull it straight out, you can user the screwdriver but I would suggest a small needle nose. It should come easily, just make sure to pull straight and not break it.4. Now that you have the locking tab off the connect. Look inside and you will see the two pins and a small space above them (sorry didn't take a picture). If you look even closer there is a little tab that needs to be lifted to release the pin. The best way to do this is to get your hands on the wire and connector in a way that you can apply a slight pull force on the wire while trying to lift the tap inside the connector. It can be a little funky at first but just be patient, just remember you are trying to lift the tab AND pull the wire at the same time so as soon as the tab is lifted high enough the wire will release. No need to yank on the wire, if its not coming easily then the tab is still holding it. Remember light constant pull on the wire while prying the connector.5. Repeat for the second pin.6. Replace pins back into the connect into their new positions by simply sliding them in. No tools needed.7. Replace the red locking tabby simply pushing it back into place, and you are ready to go! No cutting or soldering needed!The other reason I gave these a four star instead of five was that one of them just didn't fit right in either door. The pins would not seat correctly and eventually I pushed hard enough that one of the pins in the metra connector popped out and couldn't be locked back in. I was able to manipulate it enough to get it connected and used some shrink tube to secure in place. Works but seems like a QC issue, then again these are only $8 so",

                "reviewText": "I know there are some instances where people have to swap the pins. It was correct on the woofer plug for an NC Miata with the Bose stereo, but didn't even fit the tweeter. So pick up one of these pairs if you're doing an NC and you'll have one harness you can leave in place. I don't like clipping factory wires if I can avoid it, so this was 1/2 good per door for me.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Would not connect to my similar OEM speaker harness connector - UPDATED 20231204",
                "reviewText": "I bought a set of Rockford Fosgate speakers to replace the 20 year old OEM speakers, and the Metra 72-5600 pigtails came up as an option to make the upgrade easier. This is a common connector that even Crutchfield bundles with their kits, so it seems logical that this part would work for my application.What I thought would be an easy install ended up taking wayyy longer than I had planned for with the 2 speaker side connectors being too small to connect to the Rockford Fosgate speaker connections. After a call to the Metra support line, I was advised Metra uses the same size connectors for all of their speaker pigtails, which makes sense to have an industry standard, and one I am sure Rockford Fosgate uses in the manufacture of their speakers.Metra support suggested I solder on new connectors that fit better, since i do not have any other connectors to use, i used a small flat-head screwdriver to widen the gap on the connector and I was able to get it to fit the speaker side connector better.Once I had the harness on the speaker, I attached it to the vehicle speaker harness. It would not connect easily there either. Looking at the both connectors, they were the same style of connector but it 'felt' like wire ends from the speaker side of the connector would not go into the OEM speaker connector.I attempted to complete the connection several times, with no success. Finally I really put the Hulk on them and pressing them together, the speaker side wires popped out of the connector and now they will not stay in that half of the connector.The wires outside of the Metra connector, will fit into the OEM speaker wire connector, but NOT in the Metra connector so there may be an alignment issue. Out of the 4 ea. pigtails I purchased not 1 would work, so is this a bad batch or something different with my 03 Ford F250?I bought these because Metra has a great reputation and everyone across industry recommends the product.UPDATE: I contacted a major electronics dealer and they said while Meta has historically been a higher quality parts provider, the past 6-12 months their quality of products has declined horribly and this is indicative of the industry. While my opinion of Metra was high, the reviews of crossed-polarity on the products bought from Metra (in my research), the poor quality of the speaker connections that should be .187 for the negative and .250 for the positive, and they are way too small to fit, AND the issues with the connectors coming out of the connector that is SUPPOSED to fit the OEM harness, Metra is no longer a viable solution for quality parts.I welcome Metra to contact me to help them get their program back on track.",

                "reviewText": "These adapters were a perfect fit forMy 2012 Ford Escape. Nice tight connections, and no problems at all to connect to the speakers, or the speaker wires from the suv. Some have mentioned needing to expand the clips with a screwdriver, but this is unnecessary. The connections are MEANT to be tight, and if you are familiar with this type of connection, you know all that you need to do is gently wiggle the connector as you slide it over the clip, rather than push it straight on. it will seat itself properly, once you get it started, and leave a tight, secure connection. These were a life saver, and I am 100% satisfied. \ud83d\udc4d",
