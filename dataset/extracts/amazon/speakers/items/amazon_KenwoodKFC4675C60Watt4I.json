                "reviewText": "I gave these speakers 5 stars because of their direct fit in the dash of my 1981 Corvette. I'm not sure if they're the best sounding 4\"x6\" speakers, but they definitely sound great compared to the stock speakers. At 32 years old, the stock speakers were blown with the paper cones brittle and disintegrating, so replacement was a must!Pros: Direct fit and great sound compared to stock.Cons: None.C3 Corvette Installation Tips:- Factory speakers or wires are not marked + or - and also not identified as such in the wiring diagram in the factory service manual. I was able to google the correct wiring polarity at stereowiringdiagram.info. I found that pin A on the factory wiring harness connectors for the front speakers and the right-rear was the ground (-), but pin B on the left rear speaker was the ground, so don't trust the connectors without looking up the wiring diagram. I removed the connectors from the old speakers and soldered on 6\" of the pigtails that came with these speakers so I could just plug them into the factory connectors at each speaker location.- The 7mm hex head screws closest to the windshield are hard to get out and a 1/4\" socket and ratchet will not work because it's too tall and hits the windshield glass. I used the 90 degree end of a 7mm open end ignition wrench to remove and reinstall them, worked very good for me.- A tip from corvetteforum.com said to use pantyhose to protect the speakers from dust since there is no felt on the dash grills. Just cut the legs off the pantyhose, slip them over the speakers like a tube sock after the wires are connected and tie them behind the speaker magnets. I used small washers to try to keep the pantyhose from getting wrapped up on the screws, but the screw still twists the material. It's kind of a one-shot deal to screw them in - more than once and it will tear the material.",

They are crystal clear, decent: not great, bass response, and pretty loud. I am pushing them with a Pioneer DEH-1100MP head unit, and they sound pretty awesome, especially for the price. They actually show a Frequency response of 50Hz - 25,000Hz, and that's pretty impressive, which explains the decent bass response. If you're building a high performance sound system and want a speaker to amp, these may not be it, their peak power rating is 60W, but makes no reference of RMS power on the box. I would say for the average person's needs these are a great speaker.",

                "reviewText": "The stock speakers in the C3 Corvette are horrible. A couple of years ago, I upgraded the dash stereo to a Pioneer AVH-3300NEX Flip Out DVD Receiver, installed Pioneer TS-G4645R 4x6 Speakers in the dash, and a pair of Pioneer TS-D6902R 6x9 speakers in custom boxes in the rear. I loved the sound from the 6x9s but the front speakers sounded thin and \"sizzlilly\" on the top end. I got tired of the harsh sound from the front so I replaced the front speakers with these KCF-4675C and they sound great. They are a tight fit but work well. You will need a 7mm shallow wrench to get the speakers out. I used the integrated high pass filter in my head unit to roll off the low end at about 100Hz and I can turn them up loud with no rattling or buzzing. The sound is clear, clean, and extended.",

I have let Amazon know and hopefully by the time you read this it will be corrected. Speakers sound good to me but they are in a convertible so who can tell if they are premium sounding speakers or not. I wasn't looking for super awesome sound due to the car they were put in. Gave 3 stars because I really needed the grills and didn't want to spend more money for grills, but I ended up doing it anyway.",
