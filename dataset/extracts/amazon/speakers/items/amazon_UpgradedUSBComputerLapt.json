A: No. This USB speaker can only be used for computers. Because the USB ports of those devices do not have enough power to drive our speaker, which may result in not loud enough maximum volume. Q: Can I plug it into USB-Hub? A: Not recommended. The USB-hub has no enough power to drive our speaker, which may result-in cluttered, distorted or even constantly pops (audio cut-out) at high volume. Q: The volume is too low/loud, how can I adjust the speaker volume? A: All you need to do is to adjust the volume of the media player and computer system. Q: What's the problem if the speaker still \u201cDoesn't Work\u201d after plugged in? A1: Make sure that the USB port of your computer can work properly. A2: Make sure that you had selected \"USB2.0 Device\" as your computer sound output device. Q: Is there a built-in microphone? A: No. There is no built-in mic, so it is recommended to use a separate computer microphone when having video calls.",

                "reviewText": "Likes: the price, ease of operation (plug into USB port for power and audio), small-ish size fits about anywhere. Just adjust the system volume control on the PC, no buttons on the speaker. Easy.Adequate: you hope for the best sound quality for the price, and I think this does give you that.Like any speaker powered by USB, it's not going to have a lot of amplification. It gets plenty loud for listening to podcasts or Internet music. You're not going to be buying this for studio quality sound. You get something with its own power supply for that and pay a good deal more. But these definitely serve their purpose and do what they say they do. I like the size of it, it fits about anywhere you would want it to. You just need to be within, whatever, 2 feet or whatever the length of the cable is, to a USB port on whatever PC you are using it with.Not disappointed with any aspect of the function or fit of this speaker.",

                "reviewText": "I had a special need for these. I was building a retro arcade machine for a present and I needed speakers that were separate from the internal sound card of the laptop. Lots of technical reasons why, but a pair of \"USB Powered\" speakers wouldn't work. These show up as an additional audio device in Windows or Linux.I was hoping for two separate speakers to match the typical setup, but I made these work. A little Velcro mounting and some Alien Tape and they are not going anywhere. You can see the picture with the USB cable coming down from above and connecting into the USB Hub.They were still small enough to fit in the top of the arcade box. The sound is loud enough and clear enough to give a quality feeling to the sound. The bass is OK, but it's not going to be your thumping bass. Just fine for this situation.I was very happy with the speakers, quality was great, price point was perfect for my needs. If they provide an option for some lights and two separate speakers, I wouldn't complain as long as they kept this model as well. I'll be buying another pair for another retro gaming machine I'm working on now.",

                "reviewText": "Even though I had seen the photo on the listing, I didn't really grasp just how small this speaker was until I saw it in its box. I wondered what it could possibly sound like, and it didn't take long to find out. I placed it just behind my PC display and plugged the plenty long USB connecting cable in the rear of the OptiPlex unit. I quickly brought up a video on Edge and almost had my ears blown off (a bit of exaggeration) before I could turn the sound level down from initial full volume to around 60% using my mouse. The bass is naturally pretty thin but unless you are listening to something where bass is important, this little dynamo gets the job done. Decent sound, utter simplicity and very low cost. What's not to like? If it fits your needs, buy one!",

Sound quality is good (not outstanding) for something this size. Volume is OK if you are near the computer. It's not going to fill a large room, so if you want to turn your device into a party machine, look elsewhere. No volume control on the speaker itself, you must use your computer to control the volume. However, this is perfect for what I need.",
