                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Mini boom box!",
                "reviewText": "As the description says, this Bluetooth speaker is 24W (internally x2 12W speakers). The reason why the sound is \"quieter\" as other commenters here have stated is because they are forward-facing, not omnidirectional. This means you have to \"point and shoot\" in a sense to maximize its volume. Also, they're only 12W speakers individually inside of an enclosure and wired together, which means you're going to get appropriate sound based on this corresponding speaker capacity.That said, I bought two of these and I take one to work with me to use with a mp3 player while the other charges. Then if the mood or fancy strikes me, I'll occasionally pair them together for surround sound when watching a movie on my mini-pc. The Bluetooth connection has yet to drop or produce any strange sounds or static or what-have-you.Long-pressing volume up skips to the next track, long-pressing the volume down skips back to the beginning of the current track (press again for the previous track). Pretty stock and standard. By default the RGB lights come on, which I personally don't care about. They're easily turned off by double-tapping on the 'M' mode key (twice to turn off completely). Holding mode key down for a full 7 seconds factory resets it, if you encounter any particularly weird issues.I usually work 7 hour shifts and this little speaker can last that long no problem -- and at full volume. Seen a lot of comments about poor battery life and I've been experiencing no such problem. Push comes to shove, you can plug a power bank directly into it while its playing and you'll keep bum-bum-bumming your way through music land. ;-) The volume itself is definitely directly tied to the audio device itself. What I usually do is lower the volume level of my mp3 player down to the lowest volume level, sync the speaker and then use the speaker's volume up button to get it to my desired volume level. Do note that the speaker will give you a couple of very loud beeps in quick sequence when you've hit its upper limit -- don't let it scare you!And for those interested: FM radio works pretty well from my mp3 player piped to it via Bluetooth, though I can understand how it might sound \"tinny\" to some who are used to listening to FM radio directly and not being broadcast wirelessly. :-)I'm in agreement with some of my fellow reviwers that this speaker is certainly not worth $160 retail as stated, but at its \"sale\" price currently even if the retail value were cut in half... the speaker is still very decent for its performance to price ratio. It charges a touch on the slow side is about my only complaint. Otherwise, quality speaker that I'd recommend if you're in the market and on a budget.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic little speaker",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this speaker because it touts multiple features that I really like and was at a price point that is significantly lower than the \"big brands.\" This is a capable speaker that is relatively easy to pair to your Bluetooth device (phone, tablet, etc). It's not too heavy, is quite water resistant and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy a party or family outing on the deck. At just under $40, the sound quality (overall) is difficult to beat. The bass is pretty deep and rich, the higher frequency sounds are very clear and not hindered by the closed-mesh grill that aids in making it waterproof. I like that it's USB-C charging enabled and the SD-card slot is great for when you are out of \"cell range\" and just want to play music.Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks that could be addressed in the next revision.1 - The volume is directly tied to your Bluetooth device. There seems to be almost NO amplification offered. I am very hard of hearing and even at max volume (or when I'm in the pool and this is on the deck), from greater than 8 feet away, the speaker leaves MUCH to be desired in volume. When I'm enjoying an evening on the deck or in the pool, I want my music to enhance the activities.2 - The buttons on the top are for \"play, power, mode, and volume adjustment\". For a remote speaker that is designed to keep one from having to handle (even in wet conditions) their mobile device, I would expect to have buttons to switch to the next song or even go back one selection (or more). If that feature is there, then I haven't discovered it.3 - The protective \"door\" on the charging port/PC port/SD card slot leaves much to be desired. It's rubberized to help with the waterproofing, but the actual size/diameter of the rubber extension from the cover to the speaker is so small, I imagine that after a few uses in the hot summer sun, it will become brittle and break. Full disclosure, I haven't experienced that with this speaker (it's still new), but I have with others. We boat a lot in the summer, so this could become a problem in the near future.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and hope to enjoy it for a long time to come. My biggest complaint of all the items above is the volume. The speaker is simply TOO QUIET! In your bedroom, office or library it will be \"ok\". Unfortunately, if you go outside (on a boat, pool deck, back porch) or anywhere with a high ceiling, you won't be \u201cWaking up the neighbors\u201d. The MFG says the battery life is up to 24hrs, based on how high you have the volume, with 6 hours of playtime at max volume. I have been fortunate to exceed that and would, therefore be willing to give up a couple hours (or connect it to a power pack) if it meant I could take it on the boat and be able to hear it blasting out those summer sounds.",

                "reviewText": "While I haven't had the chance to try this speaker near the water, I have no doubt that it would hold up just fine as it seems to be a very durable and well made Bluetooth speaker. It sounds great when we take it camping or outdoors during the summer months for a barbecue. The light feature is fun, but thankfully you can turn it off to save battery if you just want to focus on the music or the audio you are listening to. It connects quickly and easily to any device that you throw at it, or you can plug in directly via the auxiliary cable. There is thankfully a strap included for connecting it to a backpack when traveling, or perhaps even a belt loop if you had pockets deep enough to carry it. It's a great little rugged Bluetooth speaker, and definitely something that I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to purchase.",
