                "reviewText": "This speaker surprised me in its sound quality and duration of charge, especially for the price, compared to other name brand portable Bluetooth speakers. For two days - easily twelve hours - I played and streamed music from my Android phone and did not hear a miss or skip. I moved my phone from room to room, even put it inside my car out in the garage, and the speaker never skipped or cut out.Volume range is very good and charge life excellent. The device boots up with a whooping sound that lets you know it's on and connected. About twenty (20) minutes before the charge depletes, the speaker makes a whap whap sound and the end lights flash warning of impending battery discharge. Plenty of time to disconnect and recharge the device.Instructions clear and succinct; connectivity quick and easy; charges in about an hour. Great value for the quality. Definitely recommend. Thank you.",

He\u2019s 14 and not what one would call careful with technology so we thought this would be a good starter speaker. It is a good speaker, and a really good value as priced. The sound quality is good and my son seems to like is a much as the Sonos and he\u2019s taken good care of it so far. It also looks nice, not cheap. Our only issue is that the notification sounds are EXTREMELY loud and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to adjust the volume of the notification beeps. The notifications sound automatically when the device turns on and when it pairs or unpairs with a device. I don\u2019t recall if it sounds when the speaker turns off. It can be heard across the house and having a teenager who enjoys music at all hours of the day and night, it\u2019s been quite annoying to be woken up in the middle of the night. I\u2019m still hoping we can figure it out, but it\u2019s been a month and a half so I think this just might be our new \u201cquiet\u201d for awhile lol.",

                "reviewText": "I've ordered this in April, when it was still cold in most parts of Canada, and it held up well so far. I've been keeping it outside in freezing temps, and the battery still lasts for at least a week on a charge, if not more. During the summer I only had to charge it once a month or so with a daily ~30 minutes of use (riding with kids to and fro daycare). I have it stashed in the Chariot, and occasionally forgot to close the tarp on it, leaving it out in the rain; still works well. It also had a bunch of squirrels go nuts at it, thinking it's some sort of snack box, but it held up well against them. Overall, if this would die on me in the next year or so, I'd still probably buy another.The sound quality is adequate. Sure, it can pump out loud music and it has some bass, but of course it will be nothing compared to a good car stereo or a hifi audio setup. Let's just place it somewhere between a built-in TV speaker and a mid-range, OOTB home audio setup. Which is good enough for an outdoor or kids party.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased with a $20 coupon, so for $40This thing is amazing.Side base boosters are cool, LEDS, waterproof.Great sound. Decent base for it's size. Only peaks a little on very base-heavy songs at max volume.High and mid range are crystal clear, and honestly for it's size and price, can't complain about the base, it definitely punches above its size.And LOUD.Its a use anywhere speaker. Throw it in your aquarium and vibrate your fish.Super worth the $$$.",
