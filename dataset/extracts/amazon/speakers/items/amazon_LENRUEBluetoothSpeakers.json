I wanted to try for a good period of time before writing a review Now here is the problem I\u2019ve seen.When I first got speaker. The volume was low no matter what I did as far as raising volume on speaker or compatible Bluetooth device. It was like this for a about a couple weeks. Idk what happened but all of a sudden speaker worked fine. Now before anyone thinks anything. I tried a different speaker and everything was just ok. No issues. But now everything works fine. WeirdNext and important thing is battery life is not what\u2019s advertised. I at most get 10-12 hours. Low high volume whatever the case. I do not get more than what I mentioned.Conclusion it\u2019s a decent speaker for price. My other speaker is the oontz angle 3 and couple dollars more but compared to the Lenrue speaker. The angle 3 blows this speaker away.Edit: I would like to give a lot of praise to seller for reaching out and making every attempt to fix the problem. They sent me another model speaker quickly. Sound is better, louder and battery life is a bit better. I would absolutely buy something from this seller again.",

                "reviewText": "I'm quite happy with the sound of these, esp. at under $14 each. At max volume you'll get a bit of distortion, but not crazy so if \"needing it all\" working outside you'll likely think that the tiny bit is fine. I listen to jazz (Pat Metheny, etc.) so if you're into dance music or heavy bass, you'll probably be disappointed by their lack of low end. One or two notches down from full volume the sound seems to clean up completely to my ears.They pair to play with 2 of them in TWS a bit wonky, I'm not even sure I can tell you how to do it, since the instructions of TWICE power button (or worse an \"M\" button which is not on the unit at all) didn't seem to work for me. But I did get them playing together after each were individually paired and now turning both on automatically pairs both and ready to go. Should you decide to use only 1 after using a pair in TWS, know that one will be primary and ready to play, the other will be secondary and require manually selecting it to play by itself. But once playing together it doesn't matter which you turn on first, once both are on, you'll hear a blip from each and they're ready to go.I think these are a good value and seemingly decent construction I'm hoping they hold up and give me some music working outside and moving around a bit, where having 2 will give me a larger sound field without having to have a single speaker blasting out louder. It's nice they pair into a true stereo field, not just two mono copies.If not clear elsewhere the blue ring is not lit up, just a color of plastic, which I prefer since I don't need to give up battery life for some pointless lights.",
