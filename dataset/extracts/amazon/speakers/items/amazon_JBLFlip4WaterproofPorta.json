You will be surprised at the huge sound, deep bass, crisp highs. I hosted a small get together in my living room and pumped heavy metal through this baby for 6 hours straight without worry of it dying. My guests were surprised when they saw the speaker, they were expecting something much bigger; like a boombox from 1985! I owned a Bose Soundlink and This JBL sounds just as good, if not a little better, and more bass, and it's cheaper! I have had it at full volume and there is no crackle or distortion. If you lay it longways, like on its side, you can really hear the stereo sound despite the 2 speakers being so close together. I love this speaker and everything about it. The design is sleek enough to put anywhere, the buttons are perfectly and simply placed, it's rugged and heavy for its size and not in a bad way! There is nothing I do not like about this speaker, I've tried to think of something bad........and then I connected my phone and Blasted some music and could not think of anything!",

                "reviewText": "The JBL Flip 2 has been a favorite for a while. It has two 6 watt speakers giving it 12 watts of power for something this small!The Flip 2 is a fantastic speaker especially at this refurbished price. The MSRP for this speaker is around $100, but I was able to buy it for $65 refurbished which is a steal!So what came in the box?1. You get one hard case for the speaker itself.2. You get a little cute instruction manual that tells you all you need to know about the Flip 2.3. You get one micro usb charging cable along with the wall adapter.4. You get the speaker itself of course!Let me start with the amazing features:1. Even though the unit is refurbished, it came looking like new.2. You get 12 watts of power from something so small!3. You have hands free calling so you can answer/hear your calls loudly from across your room or office.4. The sound sounds great! I'm just the average consumer, so I just want something that works, sounds amazing, and won't make me go broke. This speaker gets loud and sounds great while doing it.The lacking:1. The battery life is a bit short. I am only getting about 3-4 hours on a full charge. This is not a really big issue as I'm only usually sitting at my desk.2. The bass is a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong, the Flip 2 sounds amazing, but for bassier music, I do with there was a bit more...oomph.3. The charging cable sometimes wiggles out of the port a bit too easily. If you move it, it might slip out.4. The speaker turns on when the cable is plugged in. Not a big deal, but it is a bit annoying to turn the speaker off whenever you first plug it in.So what, should I buy it?YES! The Flip 2 is a great option and is now even better at $65 refurbished. You can't really go wrong for the price and you know you are going to get a speaker that works well and sounds great.",
