                "reviewText": "Definitely get the slim line! I ordered this size based on the reviews for the 6\"x8\" version of this product, and they were not wrong. This is just the right depth and hole size for my Pioneer TSD6802R speakers - anything bigger would be too large a internal diameter, and there's no need for extra depth. Time will tell the longevity, but this seems just as thick and sturdy as the 6\"x8\" XTC baffles I used for a different set of speakers.Update after installing these into my 2004 Ford Taurus front doors. Although these are the slim line, and match the depth of my Pioneer speakers perfectly (no space between the back of the magnet and the bottom of the baffle), they're still just a hair too deep! The back of the baffle contacts the window just barely when the window is rolled down - in the last 6\" or so of travel. It doesn't limit or slow the window travel, just makes a nice squeak of the glass rubbing against the foam. Not the fault of this baffle, just crazy how little clearance Ford gave for their door speakers - just the thickness of the foam on this baffle - since my Pioneer speaker is the same depth as the factory speaker. Not sure yet if I will make the fix of cutting out the bottom of the baffle to fix this issue, as that would mostly defeat the purpose of the baffle - or just live with the squeaking.",

                "reviewText": "This is going to be a mixed review because I\u2019m not really sure what to say. I installed these on one set of speakers, a cheaper set, and it accentuated the sound. Made it produce better low frequencies, just made the speaker sound like it was worth much more, I was very impressed.On the other hand. I ALSO installed these on a set of expensive speakers that sounded amazing right off the bat. My mind set was \u201cwow! If these sound baffles could make that cheap speaker sound good, imagine what they will do for these\u201d. Yeah well they made them sound worse then the cheap speakers without the baffle. Absolutely no mod or lower range, just straight high frequencies.This MIGHT have to do with my application though. The cheap speakers were 5.25\u2019s located in the kick panel with a very holo area behind it. The expensive high quality speakers are 4 inch speakers in a very small awkwardly shaped area that the seatbelt actually runs through. So like I said. Mixed review, worked very well in one case, worked absolutely terrible in another.They\u2019re cheap enough that I can say just get them if that\u2019s your plan. If they don\u2019t work out hold onto them because you never know. But don\u2019t be surprised if you get opposite results then what you\u2019re expecting.Very interested in how they\u2019ll preform when I replace the kick panel speakers to the same brand expensive speakers. Maybe I\u2019ll post a comparison video and change up my review.",
