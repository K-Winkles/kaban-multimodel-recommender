The onboard battery pack for phone charging is a plus. Plenty of volume and good mic sensitivity. Rugged. Comes in a nice hard-shell case, though said case does not have a pocket for the charging cable. I opted to upgrade the charging cable to one of Anker's braided-nylon cords, since the one that came with the device is rather thick and very stiff.",

                "reviewText": "When I first read the reviews on this product, I was a bit skeptical since so many of the reviews were so positive. Now I understand why. After using this for two days, I am absolutely in love with it. I am using it with a 2020 MacBook Air for zoom calls, an iPhone XI, and tried it on a Mac mini as well. The mic performance is excellent - I have tested it in a number of rooms, one with a 16' ceiling, and at various distances. The mic quality degrades slightly at distances beyond 6 feet, but that is a minor point. As long as I am in the vicinity of the device, the clarity is excellent and folks can't tell the difference. The output is very nicely tuned for the human voice, making it much easier to hear the call when different people are speaking or there are heavy accents. The ease of use is excellent - it connects faster than other bluetooth devices I use - and the construction is nice. A good weight to it, silicone pad so it won't slip, the enclose is nice to hold, and the buttons function fine. For the price point, this is really impressive.By way of comparison to the MBAir, the mic pickup on the Anker is far superior. I find that the MBA has trouble when I'm not centered within two feet of the device or there is background noise. The Anker really \"releases\" me from having to be exactly in front of the MBA at all times. Also, while the MBA audio is far superior, it is not as good as the Anker for human voices. Voices on the Anker are much easier to hear and follow - I can sense it takes less concentration on my part (and my brain!).I've used a vast range of bluetooth devices for various audio applications, and as a conference device this is by far the best I have tried (Bose, Jabra,, and a host of music listening devices). Even compared to a VoIP Polycom Soundstation (the gold standard in my world), this is a worthy competitor. The key differences for the Anker are the mic quality, battery life, and the way the audio is tuned to human voices.Now let's see how it holds up over time ;-).",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good Value for the Road Warrior - Anker PowerConf vs. Jabra Speak 510",
                "reviewText": "My job is 90+% travel and has been for the past 8 years. I've used every iteration of Jabra portable speakerphones (410, 510, and now 710) and a number of Plantronics portable speakerphones as well. The PowerConf is a great v1.0 entry for Anker. For the purposes of this review, I'm comparing the Anker PowerConf against the Jabra 510 as I think that's the closest 1:1 comparison.Where the Anker PowerConf wins:- USB Charging: Adding the ability to charge other devices via USB is GENIUS. I previously carried a Jabra speakerphone and an Anker PowerCore in my bag, but now I only need the Anker PowerConf. Anker makes some fantastic batteries/chargers, and this device is one of them.- Cost: The PowerConf comes in about 33% less than the Jabra 510. Anker frequently has sales on their products, so I imagine it will be on sale at even greater savings than 33%.- Bluetooth Multipoint: The Anker allows for multiple concurrent connections (multipoint). Note: It will only play/send audio from one device at a time, but it's much easier to switch the audio/mic from your PC (if you're listening to music) to your mobile phone (if you get a call).- Carrying Case: The carrying case for the Anker PowerConf is a hardshell case, whereas the Jabra ones are all neoprene. I feel like this adds additional protection when it's jostling around inside my bag.Where it's a tie:- Microphone Noise Isolation: Both speakerphones do a good job of isolating noise. I made recordings with a radio playing in the background. In both recordings my voice was clear and I was not able to hear the radio in the background.Where Jabra Speak 510 wins:- Audio Quality: The audio quality on the Anker PowerConf is good, but the Jabra 510 sounds noticeably better when listening to music or on a call.- Microphone Quality: While both speakers do a good job of noise isolation, my voice seemed to increase and decrease in volume on the Anker PowerConf recording (as if I was walking away from the speakerphone and back to again - except I was sitting still the whole time). The microphone quality difference is much less noticeable than the audio quality difference, but it's still there.Summary:Choose the Anker PowerConf if...- You're a minimalist and the thought of consolidating your portable battery charger and speakerphone is appealing. IMO, it's nice to be able to reduce the space (and weight) in my bag by only having one device.- You're looking for a good lower cost option (the Anker PowerConf is ~33% less than the Jabra Speak 510).Choose the Jabra Speak 510 if...- You or your clients/colleagues are audiophiles (and if that's the case, I'd recommend going with the Jabra Speak 710 as the speaker and microphone are significantly better).- You have other Jabra devices and enjoy customizing them using the Jabra Direct app.My choice:I already own a Jabra Speak 710 and it's going to stay in my bag moving forward (even though it means carrying a separate Anker PowerCore for charging). It's by no means a 1:1 comparison against the Anker PowerConf (the Jabra 710 costs more than twice as much as the Anker PowerConf), but the audio and microphone are definitely better. Many of my colleagues also own Jabra 710s, so it's nice to be able to daisy chain them together in large conference rooms. If money isn't an issue, then I'd recommend the Jabra Speak 710. However, if you're looking to stay in the sub-$200 price range, then my comments above stand.",

It seems very well constructed with a high quality feel. It was on offer when I bought so very happy with the price and usual quick and easy delivery. So 5 stars for me.
