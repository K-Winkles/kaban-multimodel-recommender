                "reviewText": "I was looking around for a good quality audio solution for Mac Studio, and I was thinking about buying some PC speakers such as the Logitech Z407, or the Bose Companion 2.The thing I liked about the Z407 was that it had an a night knob controller you could position anywhere to control them. What I didn't like was the need for a sub, nor did I care for the fact the speakers would go into sleep mode, and it would take a moment for them to detect an audio signal, making so you missed audio pieces.What I liked about the Bose was really the fact they were a pretty compact design, but over all, Bose sound quality is pretty lack luster, and I didn't like the fact the controls were physically on the speaker, which I wanted to locate outside of easy reach.Thats where using a small class D amp, like the Fosi v3, provides the ability to have the audio controls where you want them, speakers where you want them, and the audio never goes to sleep on you. Then of course, you have the freedom of picking your speakers of choice. I picked these Klipsch B-100 speakers, mostly because they were the smallest set of bookshelf speakers by a name brand I recognized. I must admit, I'm SERIOUS impressed with the entire setup. The Fosi v3 is a straight up audiophile level amp, and these B-100 speakers have completely exceeded my expectations! I don't think I've ever heard speakers this small sound this good. I have two other multi-thousand dollar sound systems, and I can't say this competes with those, but it gets far closer to their quality than I would have imagined possible, especially at this size!",

                "reviewText": "No, they're not \"audiophile\" speakers, but they're great for the price. I'm using these as front speakers for my home theater, and the power and the frequency range are perfect for the job. Also, the sound is really clean when playing John Williams scores, which are good sound tests since orchestrals hit basically all the types of sound you'll come across during movies (not counting bass, which is handled by the subwoofer).Their physical size makes them work nicely with a clean and minimalist room design.I've wall-mounted these with an inch between the wall and the speakers, and technically you're not *supposed* to do that because they're rear ported (manual calls for a solid two feet of space between the walls and the speakers). However, there really doesn't seem to be any unwanted bass amplification or muddied sound, so I seem to be fine. It's possible that setting the crossover to 80hz in order to send the lower frequencies to the subwoofer may have helped in this.If I upgrade I'll be going for front-ported speakers speakers that are designed to be wall mounted, but that's a lot more $$$ for another time. At $75/speaker this is really solid performance.",

Picking back up lately wanted to try Klipsch. This is the smallest speaker they make and they fit my TV table perfectly. I wasn\u2019t expecting booming bass from 4\u201d drivers. But the bass is still good. The real benefit is the mid range and highs. Very clear sound. I value quality over quantity. Paired with a 50 watt per channel amp they are very close to perfect!",

Also can be driven to acceptable levels with a small amplifier (20 to 30 watts RMS). Don't expect room shaking bass, but there is enough there to be quite satisfying. Oh, and you can't beat the price!",

                "reviewText": "I bought two pairs of these to replace my front and back Bose bookshelf speakers (fronts were different model than rears before) in my 5.1 system. These were quite a bit smaller so I worried they would lack proper bass response, especially since I mostly use my 5.1 system for music, but my fears were unfounded. These speakers have great full-spectrum frequency response and have never started 'flapping out' or distorting, even at pretty extreme volume levels (far louder than I would ever normally listen to). I can't say I've noticed a whole lot of difference with films though they are definitely noticeably clearer than the bose speakers they replaced. I would say if your prime use of a 5.1, or even stereo system is films and television, these might be overkill, but for my purposes they are terrific given the price (black Friday discount they still aren't prohibitively expensive).",
