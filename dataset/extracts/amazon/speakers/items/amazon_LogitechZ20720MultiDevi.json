                "reviewText": "UPDATE: These are the best speakers at this price point you can buy. Do it. I just did my 3 tests: 1) Dvorak Piano Quartet in D major; 2) Kinks \"To the Bone\" version of \"Lola\" and; 3) Pink Floyd \"Wish You Were Here\". Tone, spatial BS..., whatever, these sound like music. Oh, the bass is lacking but, come on, look at the footprint. I don't know if you can DM here but if you buy these and don't like, I'd love to know.These are honestly very good. Nice to have the AUX 3.5 mm jack (patch cord included) to connect the laptop and Bluetooth for my Google Nest Hub. It plays both audio streams simultaneously with no mess and no fuss. Added the phone as a second Bluetooth source and I haven't quite figured out how to seamlessly switch between two BlueTooths using Logitech's \"Easy\u2011Switch\" technology but that is probably pilot error. Seems I end up disconnecting from one and connecting the Z207 to another in the phone's settings or the Google Home app as appropriate. No biggy. Awesome speaker solution even with my deficient operator skills. Sound is far more balanced (less tinny) than the laptop and the Google Nest Hub speaker. Built-in amp lets me fix low laptop volumes on some streamed content. I specifically looked for amplified speakers with a power brick and the AUX capability vs. a USB-only solution but that's just me. Your mileage may vary.",

                "reviewText": "Really nice speakers for the money. Not super loud, but they're plenty powerful enough for a little Black Sabbath while doing Excel.Bluetooth is super easy to set-up. The wired sound is very good even with the enclosed cord.Not super bass heavy, or too muddy.My ears are happy with their 100-ish to 10K Hz output. (Your hearing and set-up may be better. )I'm using them on their side, doesn't seem to impair the sound.",

                "reviewText": "I had a pair of Logitech Z200s for about 3 years and they rocked. They were loud, crisp, and clear. The other day they finally burnt out on me after 3 years of high volume usage so I immediately went online to replace them. That\u2019s when I came across these Z207s, which are practically the same, however these new ones here just include bluetooth connectivity, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it because it kind of muffles whatever you\u2019re listened to and muddies the frequencies. Instead, use the aux cord provided in the box and just plug it into your headphone jack and make sure your speakers are plugged into a wall/outlet and boom. Loud, clear sound. For $60 don\u2019t expect them to be as loud as a $100 set of speakers, but they get decently loud. Loud enough. I use these for causal listening and for making my own music to give you an idea. For $60, you cant go wrong with these!",

The bad thing about them, is that they auto-sleep after a short period of time, and they need a certain threshold of audio input to wake back up. Couldn't figure out why my in-game audio in certain games would randomly cut out in quiet periods. Using a headset, there's also a lot of line hiss that I don't hear when I plug the headset directly into my computer.I've relegated them for occasional usage when I want to play something through speakers (they work fine for that), but won't be using them any longer as my primary sound setup.",
