This speaker will sound great for all your PA announcements, and background music. There are 3 inputs so you can select how loud you want them to play. What is 70 volt ? When we say the word tap, we are referring to the rear of these speakers where you can use the 2.5 watt, 5 watt, or 10 watt inputs. What this does is limit how many watts the built-in transformer on the speaker will allow the speaker to get from the amplifier. This gives you full customization over the sound for your space. In a restaurant for example you can tap your dining room speakers at 5 watts, and the hallway or bathroom speakers at 2.5 watts. Another great feature with 70 volt is you can mix and match any 70 volt speakers whether they are ceiling speakers, wall mounted speakers, subwoofers, etc. 70 volt systems allow you to run very long lines of speaker wire without signal loss. This is ideal when running long speaker leads. The wiring is simple. You just wire all the positive terminals of the speakers to the positive 70 volt terminals of the amplifier. The negative terminals on the speaker simply get wired to the negative terminals on the amp. You do not have to worry about impedance. The power is constant.",
