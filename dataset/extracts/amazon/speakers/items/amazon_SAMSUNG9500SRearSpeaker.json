                "reviewText": "I order these 9200S rear speakers with the Samsung Sound Bar HW-B650 set. They came in different packages on different days but other than that no problems. They paired easily as did the sub. Make sure you buy as the set if you expect to get everything. Someone said they don't pair with the HW-B550 or 650's and that's incorrect. If you go to Samsungs website and look up the rear speakers, it clearly states every soundbar that they pair with. The info on Amazon is not 100% up to date and for some reason say otherwise, but I assure you they do. You have full control of the rear speakers volume and there are many settings for different modes of sound. I like the DTS option the best. DTS gives the rear speakers the most bang for the buck when it comes to volume and theater sound. I highly recommend buying a good quality 2.1 HDMI Cable, as this makes a difference as well. We purchased a Monster Gold Cable and love it. Worth the 70$. The only problem I have had so far is not being able to update the firmware. I made sure to unzip the file before loading it on a blank memory stick and actually the soundbar started to download the file, but then stopped and said no data. I tried several times, followed all the steps into he manual, and even tried multiple sticks to no avail. I will be calling support next to see what other options there are and will update this if I figure it out and actually see a difference. I'm curious if there is actually a difference in sound or anything else or if it's a waste of energy. All in all, this is a very good system for the money. It immediately pairs to my Smart Things App and with the ARC HDMI to my TLC Roku TV, it immediately synced without doing anything and can control he soundbar bar by the Roku remote. I give it 8 out of 10. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is the sub could be a but louder. I'm a little spoiled from my old Polk Audio Soundbar4000. The soundbar & sub were absolutely insanely loud. As we all know, loud doesn't necessarily mean great sound. The Samsung system has great crisp sound, very clear, nice deep bass and does thump. Just doesn't rattle the windows. I would highly recommend for under 400$ all day long.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to complete the home theater set in my living room with these rear speakers since I already have Samsung TV, soundbar & woofer. For reference, the TV was Q60A, soundbar was Q700A, and rear speakers are 9500s. The connection was extremely easy. Items in the box: 2 speakers and two power cords. No connection cord between two speakers is needed. I simply followed the instructions by turning on the ID setting on the soundbar and boom, the two speakers were connected. At first the volume of the speakers sounded low, I couldn't find a way to adjust them unfortunately. For some reason I couldn't find them on the SmarThings App. But later I realized it really depends on the audio source (has to be 5.1 Dolby Atmos I think) and the soundbar mode. Make sure you set it as eArc Surround. I tested Netflix movies and video games. What comes out of the rear speakers and the volume of it really depends on the audio source. And it does create a surrounding spatial experience. However, given the price of these speakers and how much difference it made on top of the soundbar, I would think the soundbar itself is sufficient enough. But I do enjoy the premium experience so I'm gonna keep them.UPDATE SAME DAY OF THE REVIEWI found out how to control the rear speakers volume and it\u2019s amazing how everything works together now. I can hear clearly from these two rear speakers. Even normal YouTube video or talk shows.I didn\u2019t connect them to smart things app. they\u2019re controlled by the soundbar using the soundbar remote. Press the gear button on the remote, scroll through until Rear Level, wait for the texts scrolling completely, a number will show up. Then press up button (not push up the volume up, but the up button on the wheel) to increase the volume.Thanks whoever posted in the review section originally!",

                "reviewText": "No complaints about the speakers themselves, they were easy to set up and link with my Samsung HW-Q700C soundbar. Sound is great.Getting to this point, not so great. I went to the trouble of contacting Samsung before purchase via their chat feature on line. My specific question was compatibility. I was told that the 9200s was compatible. Ordered it, tried to install it, no joy. Then I called Samsung and got a real person and was told, well, no, the 9500S would work.I am not mad about it; the 9500S is a much better speaker, completely wireless - no connecting wires between the speakers means you can place them easily and more conveniently. More expensive as well, but well worth it.Bottom line, if you didn't buy a complete surround sound system from the get-go and now want to add rear speakers, get someone on the line at Samsung and make sure they are compatible.Further note - I connected the sound system to a new Samsung TV that has the Q Symphony feature, and the combination of TV speakers, Soundbar, Woofer, and Rear Speakers is awesome.",

                "reviewText": "These paired quickly and easily to my Samsung Q700C soundbar. The sound quality is exceptional and I love the Atmos functionality. But even with turning up the rear volume setting on the soundbar, they do not produce loud sound. Instead, I guess they are intended to be more subtle. I wasn't sure they were working until I put my ear next to them when testing. They do make a difference but don't expect to be blasted away with rear sound.",

                "reviewText": "These speakers are very light and compact but powerful enough to provide a great surround sound effect (54 Watts RMS) .They measure 3.5\" Wide x 3.5\" Deep x 6\" High. The Wireless Receiver (the speakers connect to this unit using supplied speaker wire) is 2\" Wide x 5\" Deep x 8\" High. The Receiver connects wirelessly to the Soundbar.We placed the speakers 10 Feet behind our seating (25 Feet away from our Samsung HW-Q900T Soundbar). The maximum wireless range for our Soundbar is 35 Feet. After connecting the speaker wires to the Receiver, we simply plugged the Receiver into the outlet, pressed the Up button on the HW-Q900T Remote for 5 seconds and the 9100S speakers connected immediately. The sound is much much better than we expected but it is Samsung after all!Finding stands that would work with these speakers (I am not mounting to the wall) was a challenge but we finally settled on the Sonas Adjustable Model HTBS because I saw a few reviews where people had made them work with these speakers and we wanted something that would not be too intrusive. I'm sure there are other options too but after hours of searching we found nothing specifically mentioning these speakers.I had to use the adhesive mount option that is included with the Sonas HTBS stands because none of the included hardware is designed to work with these speakers, but, it works great and no issues with stability. We placed the Receiver behind a small cabinet to it is completely hidden from view.Very happy with the final result an these Samsung SWA-9100S Speakers in particular.",

                "reviewText": "Me acaban de llegar la semana pasada, las compre para mi barra de sonido b650, se conectaron muy r\u00e1pido no tuve ning\u00fan problema; para poder disfrutar del sonido surround el contenido tiene que estar configurado en 5.1 canales y tienes que activar el dts x en tu barra de sonido, de lo contrario no escucharas el sonido envolvente. Las bocinas se escuchan fuerte, te da ese sonido envolvente, pero es muy importante que lo que est\u00e9s viendo este configurado a 5.1 canales, si ves videos de YouTube por ejemplo es posible que no sientas ese sonido envolvente ya que por lo regular los videos son en sonido stereo o sea en 2 canales, he visto muchos comentarios que dicen que casi no tienen sonido pero esto es porque lo que est\u00e1n viendo no tiene la configuraci\u00f3n de 5.1 canales, es excelente para ver pel\u00edculas de netflix, star plus, Amazon, etc.Otro dato importante es que tambi\u00e9n tienes que configurar la salida de audio de tu smart tv, ya que el mio estaba configurado en PCM como salida de audio y lo cambie a Dolby digital y valla que fue un cambio total de audio.En conclusi\u00f3n las bocinas cumplen con ese sonido envolvente, se escuchan fuerte y claro, f\u00e1cil de conectar.",
