                "reviewText": "I did not really think I would get much out of a Bluetooth speaker compared to the sound quality of my iPad but I was very wrong.Build quality: very strong plastic, seems there may be some sort of cloth stitched over the small metal holes where the sound comes out of which I really think adds to the high quality feel and also just makes this speaker one that you want to use that much more. I don\u2019t know formal terms but New feature on this year\u2019s model is the vibrating bumpers on either end of the speaker that vibrate with increased bass sound. I really like this feature as it adds to the depth of the bass and just has a premium feel.User friendliness: this speaker stands up on its own with good stability on either end or can be placed on its side horizontally. No issues with it being in a certain position causing a problem or anything like that. Love that as soon as you turn the speaker on, it will auto connect to the last device that was connected. Have had a great time watching movies with this speaker on my iPad in bed.Battery life: charged this after 2 full movies, did not die on me though. Long battery life and charging cable included has the usb-c end that will plug into my phone\u2019s outlet charger so I can use the same plug as my iphone.This is a great product and definitely worth the money, especially if you get the option for coupon!",

                "reviewText": "The Tozo PA2 Bluetooth Speaker packs an impressive audio punch for its compact size. Connecting to devices like smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth was a breeze. I simply turned on the speaker and put it in pairing mode, then connected via the Bluetooth settings on my phone.Once connected, the PA2 delivers a surprisingly bold sound. The bass output is full-bodied for such a petite speaker. Many mini Bluetooth speakers I've used sound weak on the low end, but the PA2 has some thump to it even at higher volumes. I wouldn't call the bass boomy or overpowering; rather, it gives music a warm fullness you likely wouldn't expect from the speaker's palm-sized dimensions.Midrange tones come through clearly, allowing vocals to cut through a mix cleanly. Highs are crisp without sounding harsh or sibilant. Overall, the sound profile is pleasingly balanced.In terms of design, the PA2's small, circular shape makes it very portable. It takes up very little room in my luggage. I haven't put this to the test yet, but it has an IPX8 waterproof rating, which means I won't worry about using it at the pool or beach. Battery life is impressive too.Overall, between the great sound, rugged build, and affordable price, the Tozo PA2 Bluetooth Speaker is easy for me to recommend for those seeking big sound in a highly travel-friendly form factor.",

                "reviewText": "Tozo PA2 reviewThis is the second speaker I\u2019ve bought from the growing array of audio equipment from Tozo, and it\u2019s definitely a step up from their cheaper model the PA1, and justifies the higher price point.Out the box it has a much sleeker form factor than the PA1. It\u2019s more rounded and fits nicer in the hand, and feels less bulky. It covered in a mesh type fabric but is tightly formed around the curves so feels nice and solid. Either end there is a 1\u201d bass woofer protected by a rubber stand. The buttons on the back are all rubberised (I guess to make it compliant with submersion in water). It does feel a bit strange in how to place it in a table as it sits well upright with the rubber feet, but on its side it does tend to rock a little. I\u2019m not sure this affects the sound though.Setup is so easy out the box, it pairs within seconds once setup and connects every time without fail. This is very different to the Sonos move I got over Christmas. Just hold the pair button to search, pair from your phone and you\u2019re done.As per usual there are the usual play pause, power and volume buttons that double as skip and rewind. (And if you\u2019re using it for a phone call have other options to answer and drop etc). It\u2019s also got an EQ button for switching between bass boost, treble boost and normal. There are more EQ options via the free app which give you even more customisation of the sound suitable for the environment you\u2019re in.It\u2019s powered by the included USB-C which is the norm for anything these days. Power life seems pretty good so far although haven\u2019t fully tested the run time to see if similar to the claimed 25 hours playback. But with this it should be more than enough for a camping weekend away.Sound wise it definitely steps up from the cheaper PA1. It doesn\u2019t have any distortion through the range of except it looses a bit of punch at top volumes with more bass.Otherwise the mids and trebles perform very well for a portable speaker. As with any non-stereo speaker direction can have a big influence on sound and no surprises with this one that when a bass port is facing you you definitely get more warmth from the sound compared to face on, but perhaps this is why it\u2019s better having it stood up.You can also pair two of these to make a stereo pair, but I haven\u2019t tried this, and it didn\u2019t work to add my older PA1 speaker.Overall a very competent little speaker with improved sound quality and battery life in a solid form. Perfect for days out/ travelling /camping and the beech. Roll on summer!",
