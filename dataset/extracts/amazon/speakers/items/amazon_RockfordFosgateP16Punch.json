                "reviewText": "Installed these in the doors of my vintage '72 Dodge pickup. They replaced the old ones that were shot. The 5\" holes (for 6\" speakers) which were already there for the old ones fit the new speakers perfectly but I did have to drill new 1/8\" holes for mounting the new speakers with their grilles, which was no problem. The speaker wires had blade connectors for the old speakers which went right on the new leads without any modification \u2014 so installation couldn't have been easier. I'm very happy with the sound quality. It's just for my AM/FM radio but that's all I want and it sounds excellent and loud and clear over my noisy old truck.",

They didn't come with speaker wire is the only thing that stood out to me... The back side of the mounting ring has like rubber foam so as to not cause rattling! I got the Kenwood the same size and they sounded terrible and rattled so much my soul is still shaking! If you are getting these for A GD WRX get the front speaker adapter for the love of god! It will save time $ and effort headache and a whole lot of swearing!! You're welcome!",

                "reviewText": "I recently restored a Fiat convertible. Being the car is so small I was limited on the size of speaker I could fit. I figured I wouldn't have much bass and that was the trade off of driving a 50 year old convertible. I was also able to run only 25 WPC because of the car's older electrical system. I originally bought the Alpine and no matter how much I EQd them the sound was flat with no bottom end. I then got the RF. I didn't expect that much bottom end from such a small speaker. I would recommend paying a little more to anyone to get these speakers.",
