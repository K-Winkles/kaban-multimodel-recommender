                "reviewText": "I bought these to use with a Polk TL1900 system so majority of this review is based with them. I did get five mounts since I read a handful only received 4. I am using deadbolt banana plugs and found these mounts to be no problem if the bananas are plugged from the side holes of the binding posts. I'm saying this because I initially had them plugged through the top as it was best for hiding the wire with my temporary setup but if you were to keep it that way with these mounts you would have to flip the mount upside down for it to fit, which does not look good at all. So for these speakers, plugged from the side, they work perfectly and they seem to be fairly well-made with good range of motion (my rears are turned against the walls with room to spare). They are also pretty small so they easily hide behind the speakers. I have mounted them with the four satellites and did not find any problem with function. They do feel solid though these speakers are not that heavy. That being said, I did have to buy a set of screws for these speaker's threaded holes, 1/4\" - 20, as they do not come with the mounts as some others may have said already. They were less than $2 so it's no deal breaker. The 1/4\" is just a hair to big for these mount holes but you can easily screw it in before hand to thread it in, like I did, or just drill it out a tiny tiny bit. So depending on your speaker mount hole location, such as if it was just flush with the back of the speaker, you may only need 1\" length. Of coarse that's just a possibility so double check with your speakers to estimate the length. Regarding keyhole mounting, I cannot say much. My speakers are also not that big so I'm not sure about functionality and stability with bigger speakers. I will try to post some photos of them to give an idea of how they look with wire and everything. Overall they are great for my setup, I have no problems with them since I already knew about having to buy screws. I would also say they are fairly priced so I would definitely buy these again if need be.",

The brand that I had bought previously was no longer in business, so I decided to give these a try. These are great speaker mounts! As you can see from my pics, my speakers are rather large, Onkyo brand speakers. I was worried after reading reviews commenting on these being cheap and flimsy, but that's not the case. I am very pleased with these speaker mounts and I would buy them again. The hardware that these come with didn't fit my speakers, but I had bolts, nuts, and washers on hand to remedy this problem. I used the keyhole to mount them and it worked perfectly. I highly recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased 2 packs of these to have enough mounts for my 5.1 and 7.1 surround speaker systems. My center speakers sit on a shelf above my TV so I only needed 4 and 6 brackets for each system. The screws included to mount the speakers didn't work for my Polks so I had to purchase 1/4\" - 20 x 1/2\" screws to make these work. The screws did fit my Sony speakers. I also decided to drill 1/4\" holes in the right or left bottom section of these brackets (se photo) so I could feed the speaker wire that was coming out of the wall through this hole, and it also allowed me to cover the hole in the wall; thus, giving a much cleaner and professional looking installation. Two of the brackets for the 7.1 system were being mounted to a white crakcle finish bead board with white Polk speakers, so I spray painted the brackets white to make them look better with the speakers and wall (see photo). After making my adjustments to these brackets they are easy to mount on the wall and hold the speakers securely no matter what angle I need to place them for proper listening. Even with having to take the time and spend a little bit of extra money to make this work for me, I am very happy with these brackets and would buy them again. The price was great and the quality is well worth it.",

I've got the Logitech Surround Sound Speaker System Z906 and all of the speakers look great on the wall with these mounts. They're easy to adjust to get the angle correct and there is no sag at all - even though I had to flip them upside down to fit the mounting situation.I drilled through the base for feeding the speaker cable and it looks very nice. I'm very pleased with the results.",

Installation was a bit tricky single handedly since you need to hold onto the speaker while trying to align and screw it into the wall mount. Perhaps a butterfly screw would have been a better option here. There are adequate screws provided to fix the brackets to the wall (including wall plugs) and screws to attach the speaker to the bracket as well. A couple of the wall mounting screws were faulty (the Philips head groove was covered due to manufacturing defects). We just used our own screws to complete the job.
