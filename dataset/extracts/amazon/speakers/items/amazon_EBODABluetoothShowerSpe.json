                "reviewText": "Bought the red as a gift for husband in October 2022 - he brings it to work and uses it all the time, so I can attest that it is super durable and the battery life is enough for him to use often with a few charges in between. The sound quality - no complaints. I haven\u2019t measured the exact battery life we get out of it because I ain\u2019t got time for that, but overall we\u2019re pretty pleased with the product. I think if I had to consider repurchasing for a guy I\u2019d go for something bigger than this, as guys always seem to want more sound but it\u2019s a great buy for a compact product and is nice for travel (it is round though and something square/flat will take up less space, but the hook means you can attach it onto a bag strap). My female friends like this speaker too, but for myself I got this slightly less expensive Altec one in 2019 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013AOCFHI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) which I like better as it is cuter and even more compact, has held up well for an even longer time but then I am not as rough with mine so hard to compare the durability of the two. Can recommend as to quality, it\u2019s great for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "So far, so good with this speaker. My requirements were water resistant and loud enough for me to understand podcasts or audiobooks over the sound of my loud shower. It does that just fine. As an added bonus it does have rubber coating so hopefully that will help if I drop it in the shower or on the bathroom tiles.I\u2019ve tried playing music with it & the base seemed decent for the size & cost of the speaker. It\u2019s never going to be a Bose but I don\u2019t need it to be for the shower or in my small kitchen.I didn\u2019t really care about the lights feature. Kind of cool that they have several settings for different displays but TBH, I just leave them off. All you have to do is press the light button a few times to cycle through the setting until you get to lights off. It stays at that setting each time you turn the speaker on.",
