                "reviewText": "I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max and to be honest its built-in sound quality leaves much to be desired, way too much. This innovative Chinese little external speaker attaches to the back of Pro iPhones via MagSafe (two rings with 3M sticky tapes are included for phones without MagSafe) and connects via Bluetooth. The sound quality is not pro-level by any measure but more than adequate for a small, very portable, and VERY convenient stereo speaker. It also doubles as an iPhone stand! Battery life is good, I get about 7-8 hours on each charge (roughly 15 playbacks with 30 minutes each time when I exercise to a fitness app on my phone). I love this little gizmo!",
