                "reviewText": "Update 8-17-2022 - Yeah, they are still working.-----------------------------------------------------------------First off, the price is for a pair of speakers. That makes it less than $20 a piece. That is insanely cheap for two way speakers. The build quality is actually pretty good! The only slight issue I had is that the mounting frame mount points flexed a little when I tightened them down. Still, they are solidly attached to the ceiling. The pair I received did have spring loaded quick connect terminals for the speaker wire so there was no soldering or having to wrap wire around terminals. They look great when installed.Probably the most important question with speakers is how do they sound? Well, these do not sound amazing but they did sound better than I expected once I had them installed. From what I remember, there is not crossover on the \"woofer\" and just a resister to cross over the tweeter. The low end was rather punchy and a little deeper than I expected. The high end is not all that great but serviceable. The tweeter is a little subdued and isn't exactly what I would call crisp BUT still way better than expected. Remember, in this price range, typically you don't even get a tweeter but just a dual-voice \"full range\" driver. Their sensitivity is rated at 87db but they seem a little worse like maybe 85db but that could either vary depending on installation or just my tainted review based on my mains being very sensitive.I installed these as rear speakers in my surround system and they work marvelously in that capacity. They would also be sufficient for casual listening or mood music at a party etc. I had to give 5 stars not because they are 5 star speakers but because they are 5 star speakers in this price range.Update : Yeah, they are still working fine. Yeah, they are not amazing but for surround speakers? I still have no complaints even matched to floorstanding Klipsch towers. I keep thinking I should put something much better up there but... why?",

                "reviewText": "They're great for the price, bought 3 pair's for a 7.1 system and sound pretty good. Used them for the Left and Right channel and the two sets of Surround Sound (back left, back right, upper left and upper right)Not turned them much past halfway on my Sony STR-DN850 and no distortion whatsoever, not sure how they'll perform if I cranked them all the way up, but to be honest I'd need to be in next doors yard for that anyway.Fitting was pretty straight forward, the template worked perfect (little tip, put a small piece of double sided tape on the back of the template before you start cutting, that way you can step back and make sure they're positioned right first, also use a stud finder or drill small hole and use a bent coat hanger to ensure you've got sufficient clearance before you cut)Make use of the little wire tool to remove the grill and note that the speakers (the black part) only fits one way, so easy to put the outer frame in upside down and end up with the tweeter on the bottom.I've seen some people comment on the 'clips' that clamp onto the dry wall. I found the easiest way was to turn these clips to the correct position and push them up to the inside of the dry wall before you start turning the screws, this will stop them from breaking or griping at the wrong angle.I used 14 gauge wires and they fit easily into the connectors on the speakers.Delivery was quick and they arrived undamaged.Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I recenlty built a new photo studio and wanted to do all of my own work when it came to the sound system. I chose these when searching around on amazon and was a little skeptical of the price. I do not own the office Im renovating so I didn't want to put anything super high end in the walls, only to potentially leave them there if I go so I ended up purchasing 6 of these and 2 of the round ceiling ones. I mounted these across from one another in the large main area and in my hair and makeup rooms and I have to say Im quite impressed. The installation was fairly easy, especially considering it comes with a template that you can place on the wall and trace around and then just cut your hole. Buy a cheap drywall jab saw, sold at any hardware store and you are good to go. I ended up painting mine to match the wall so they were blended into the room and they work great. I have all high end klipsch in my own and I paid a small fortune for those so honestly I wasn't expecting much other than a semi decent, slightly distorted signal but I was overly impressed with the clear, detailed sound I heard from these. They do not push out a ton of bass as you would probably expect, however my receiver has a bass boost button on it which really seemed to help a lot. I do not find a need to use a sub to enhance these and I have received many compliments on both the look, installation and the sound from my clients. At less than 40.00 a pair, you would be a fool not to use these. If you want good sound but do not want to go high end, this is your answer in my opinion. Be careful when tightening the little brackets that grab the wall during installation. They can be brittle and break. However, even if you do break one or two of them, there are 6 total holding the speaker firmly in the wall so it will still install properly and firmly. Great buy overall. I added a monster speaker selector to this whole thing and it looks and sounds like a 2500.00 setup already. Give them a try!",
