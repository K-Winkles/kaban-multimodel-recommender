The bass is pretty good and the trebble for vocals was great for the purpose. I was so impressed that I brought a second speaker hopefully to overcome the issues when the hot tub is actually in full use with all the jets going. It paired easily to my phone too.",

Easy to connect...Superior bass for what you get...its just a great product...I tried several around this price...beat them all, easily. The craftmanship is excellent. I wish it went louder, but it is loud, I'm just deaf. Look at wattage...it's there. No loss at higher volume. Pair with it the 2nd speaker effortlessly...just a push of the button. The lcd settings are awesome.",
