                "reviewText": "**UPDATE**The company Saiyan saw my review and almost immediately enquired about the issue to resolve it. Their representative was very quick and professional. Due to the issue with my subwoofer they sent an entirely new system (soundbar and subwoofer) free of charge and without me needing to return the old one. In this case the subwoofer is working perfectly without any knocking noise like the previous one. They also redesigned the subwoofer enclosure/box so its slightly bigger in all dimensions and subwoofer sits slightly closer to the front. This change seems to work greatly as the subwoofer audibly is louder and hits HARDER even though it's 5.25 inches. Subwoofer placement is key in getting really good sound out of it. Also, the subwoofer definitely has a break-in period of 20 or so hours in my experience. So, I currently have the first sound bar I bought back in September connected to the new subwoofer and the new soundbar can go where ever needs on in the house. Changing my review to 5 stars as its a great soundbar especially for the price. A lot of other companies are selling very similar specs with 2x and 3x the price.The sound bar itself can get VERY LOUD, however the subwoofer rattles at mid to high volume. I have had this issue out of the box. The sub sounds great for only 5inches and if placed correctly you can sometimes feel it in your chest and whatever you're sitting on. With the remote, the subwoofer has 10 levels and 25 on the soundbar. When watching movies to moderate to slightly high volume (level 18-25 on soundbar and level 7-10 on sub), the subwoofer just outputs this rattling noise from the driver. I'm not sure If I received a dud subwoofer but is really does take me out of the listening experience and most times have had to lower the sub level to 3-5 depending on what is playing and it goes away. Furthermore, it has a audio boosting mode however the rattling is even more prevalent with it on. This kinda sucks because it's genuinely a great system overall. If subwoofer worked as it should this is will very easily receive 5 stars. Im not sure If I qualify for a replacement to just the subwoofer alone. Until then I'll try not to regret buying it :(.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered it with the subwoofer, and the subwoofer definitely booms. Set up is pretty simple, I'm still messing around with the Bluetooth trying to figure that out, but for now I've got it running through the optic cable and that works really well. I don't have it in a really big room but it puts out more than enough sound. I was even impressed with the packaging. Definitely a great bargain for the price",

I will be extremely happy if this lasts a lot longer than the last one. I may look into getting the subwoofer.*Update: It didn't even last a month. The sound would cut out for several seconds then come back on. I tried to restarting at and re-pairing it, But the problem persisted. The Bluetooth was connected. I'm not sure if I want too gamble on another one...If I can get 1-2 years or more out of this, it will be what I was looking for. It's easy to set up and the sound is ok. It has three presets on the remote that changed the tone a little bit. It paired easily with my fire stick and can use the remote for my fire stick to control the volume. Seems to be a decent value, it's better than my TV speaker.",

                "reviewText": "We got a 42\u201d tv for the bedroom recently and wanted to upgrade the sound without breaking the bank. This little soundbar sounds great and is a huge upgrade from the tv speakers. I highly recommend.A couple of things to know before you buy. Most of this is in response to other reviews I\u2019ve read.-This is a soundbar. Not a wireless Bluetooth speaker. It can connect to your tv via Bluetooth, but it has to be plugged in to an electrical outlet to have power. If you\u2019re looking for a wireless/ rechargeable speaker, this isn\u2019t it.-I was able to merge it with my insignia/ amazon tv remote so that I can use just the tv remote to control the tv and soundbar. My tv did not have Sayin listed as an option, but I saw another review that said to use Meidong, and sure enough that worked!-I got the pulsing feedback sound that others have mentioned when I first hooked it up. It took me a few tries to find the setting, but eventually figured out how to change the TV sound output to PCM.Overall I think this is a very good product and an excellent value.",

It's also small enough I can easily use it at my PC. And have the same great booming sound. This speaker will Definitely live at my PC. Only cuse I want a bigger surround set for my bigger room. Definitely worth it. Would buy a second time definitely..",

But I am really impressed with this thing. It's affordable. It was really easy to set up. And the sound quality is great. In fact, I got a little scared one night because I kept hearing voices from the corner of my room. Turns out, it was the background conversations from the show I was watching in a surround-sound-like experience. It was cool. So if you want to pay very little but get a lot in return, check this little sound bar out!",
