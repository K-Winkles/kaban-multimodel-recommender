                "reviewText": "These speakers were an excellent inexpensive upgrade for my daughter's 07 charger. Her right front speaker was blown. These were priced right and sound great. It should be noted, however, that they are not a simple drop in. I had to cut some of the baffling away from the door inserts. Wasn't a big deal, and a good utility knife got it done in a couple of minutes. Just be advised you'll have to do that small modification, simply because the speakers are a little beefier than the stock six by nines. You may also want to pick up some wiring adapters specific for your vehicle, if you're not comfortable with doing wiring work. I simply cut off the stock adapters and put spade clips on the wires and connect them directly to the speakers. You can then just crimp them tight, or put a drop of solder on to be safe.",
