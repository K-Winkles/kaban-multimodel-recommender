                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Performing and High Quality Sound",
                "reviewText": "I have been using this speaker so far for blasting music, connecting it with my monitor, using it to watch movies, and taking it on the go to friend's houses and parties, and I think this speaker has great performance and high quality sound compared to some of the other speakers that I have had.Pros:- The 16W drivers on this speaker allow it to be very loud, and so I usually use it at 60-70% volume which is enough to fill an entire large room.- It has a very robust, cylindrical design allows it to withstand some fall damage, and with rubberized ends so that it doesn't slip, and the design allows for it to play audio from multiple directions.- It has the capability to play in wireless stereo mode by connecting to another Miatone speaker which allows for audio playing from 32W which is very high and can allow for very far reaching audio.- The battery lasted me around 9-10 hours depending on how much I kept the volume at during certain times which is great because it lasts me several days without charge since I use it several hours at a time.- It is water resistant (IPX6). Although I haven't tested it, I think it is good that it can withstand some water in case it accidentally falls into water or some water falls onto it.- I'm not an audiophile, but based on other previous speakers that I've had, both wired and wireless, I think this speaker has the best sound quality. It is very loud and the audio is far reaching so if it's on one end of your house, you can hear it from the other end. The audio is also clear and crisp, with a deep bass, so you can hear music, movies, or any media without loss of quality in the audio.- The Bluetooth 4.2 allows for it to connect and play from a device as far as around 30ft between walls and obstacles. I was able to listen to the speaker from my device while I was in other rooms in my house which is really good connectivity. Without any walls or obstacles, it says you can connect and play the speakers from about 100ft.Cons- The voice that plays when powering on/off, and connecting/disconnecting your device is annoying because it is very loud no matter what you set the volume of the speaker to, and there is no way to turn it off.- The speaker automatically turns off after a certain amount of time if nothing is playing while connected to your device.- It takes a very long time to charge the speaker, around 3 hours.- The speaker should be able to connect to other speakers in TWS mode (True Wireless Stereo mode) in order to play wireless stereo sound instead being able to connect to only Miatone speakersNice Improvements To Have- Volume indicator- Battery indicator- There should be an option to turn off the voice that plays when powering on/off and connecting/disconnecting your device, or replace the voice with simple sounds that aren't so loud- The speaker should stay on while connected to your device regardless if anything is playing or not. It should only turn off if powered off or if the device is disconnected.- The charging time should be lowered",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this along with a Ortizan x10 and Bolabutty X-GO speakers as a curiosity for sub $20 and $30 BT speakers.The Miatone Boom also has a linear volume response. It didn\u2019t lower bass or extend the highs at any volume but this also means for drivers of this size and power output tend to require higher listening levels. Thus this speaker has a sharp bass roll off around 100-120hz so it can sound punchy for bass.What appeals to me is the fit, finish and appearance of quality. The sound is definitely wider or fuller than the x10 and X-GO.I'm curious if this speaker sounded the same four years ago i.e. hardware supply changes and this tuning updates. I would recommend this speaker based on value and choice of colors it's available in.Lastly, i suggest playing music from a source with higher fidelity. It makes a huge difference in the dynamic range. If not it reminded me of a monaural old school clock radio sound.",

While the membranes in the side sound bassy when you hold them to your ear I wouldn\u2019t say the speaker has a particularly heavy bass sound to it but it is not tinny by any means. I like the fact it switches to aux mode just by plugging the cable in. Pretty good Bluetooth speaker. Nice size, easy controls and has a good volume.",

The volume is also pretty good, 50% volume is already a little loud to me. However, when playing music with heavy bass and on high volume, it struggles a little bit but not too bad. Overall, for its price, its really good compared to other speakers with this price.",

                "reviewText": "Knew those speakers from DankPods and found it funny, so when need arose for me to have some speakers I checked them out and found the price very good, so went ahead and purchased them.They don't disappoint. The build quality is rugged, the \"announcer\" voice is funny, and the sound quality... I can't voucher it as they are connected to a DOS and an Amiga machine, playing Midi and MOD files, so never tried with \"real\" audio, but for what I use them the sound is amazing, even when putting the speakers on an upright position. Quite powerful volume level. The battery seems a bit weak, but I really don't care that much as I have them connected to the main power, still lasts for hours and charge quick.Really happy with the purchase.",
