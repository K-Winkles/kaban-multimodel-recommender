The watch crown controls the volume, and this little speaker can get amazingly loud for its size! This speakers holds a charge well. My favorite part is the size. It\u2019s easy to keep tucked into a pocket or attached to a zipper pull.PSA Tip: it comes with a small lanyard attachment that you need to install. It\u2019s hard to fit into the intended hole.

It's definitely louder than it looks though, I've got lots of comments at work about how loud it is and people asking where I got it. Now two other people at work have the same one. I think I'm going to get some for stocking stuffers too. Great little speaker if you're wanting something that's super portable.",

It's staticy/muffled. It is pretty loud though. The audio playing just through my phone is better. If you are looking for a really small speaker to play loud low quality music then it will work.

                "reviewText": "This speaker is very small (fits nicely in my palm) yet indeed has a nice sound. If I did not know better, I would think the price is pretty good for what you get. However, when I purchased two of these speakers, I did not know I could get much better features by purchasing the B11-TF model of this speaker for just $1 more (ugh). This model (the BTS0011) is missing some great features provided by the B11-TF model. Namely, this model, although it can increase the volume, cannot decrease the volume whereas the B11-TF can do both (and the volume control buttons are easy to identify). In addition this model does not have aux input whereas the B11-TF (as implied by its name) has a slot for a TF card. The B11-TF is slightly larger, but still fits nicely in the palm of my hand. I also think the B11-TF has a little better sound. Considering both models have the same brand name, but the better model is only $1 more, I cannot honestly say this model is a good value for the price. If however, you do not care to have a TF slot or the ability to decrease the volume, this model might be a good choice for you (I like saving $1 whenever I can).",

This speaker is super small, weighs nothing and add a carabiner and this thing can be brought anywhere without even realizing you have it. Have only run it for upwards of 90 mins or so riding so far so I can\u2019t comment on battery length but I think 2-3 hours is probably max life. Used in light rain with no issue. Charges fast. In terms of speaker, I mean it\u2019s not perfect audio but not terrible, though at full volume the bass can be a bit too much for the small woofer so I tend to keep volume at about 75%. Still plenty louder than phone without losing sound quality. It\u2019s slightly smaller than a golf ball, that\u2019s like the closest thing I can think in terms of shape and size. Would buy again, serves its purpose and if you want a speaker for bike riding would definitely recommend this one cause you\u2019ll notice the sound but not the weight whatsoever",

These little speakers mount perfectly in the opening for the face shield on the sides. They're so small that they don't obstruct my view or come in contact with my face. I just affixed them with a little velcro tape, and I faced the speaker parts to the face shield so that they provide better sound and resonance. The audio quality is a little tinny, and there's only a little bass to speak of, but it solved a problem for me that I wouldn't have been otherwise able to fix. I have two of them, because it sounds a little weird listening to just one side, but it allows me to keep it on lower volume, and now if I'm out and want to play some music in an open space, I always have a set of speakers available to me.",
