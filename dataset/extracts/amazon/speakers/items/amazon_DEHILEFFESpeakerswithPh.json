                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this speaker, hoping for a seamless audio experience. However, I was left disappointed. The connection frequently drops, even when my device is within the recommended range. The sound quality is subpar, with muffled highs and almost non-existent bass. The battery life is nowhere near what was advertised, and I found myself needing to charge it after just a couple of hours of use. The design, although sleek, is not very user-friendly, with buttons that are hard to distinguish and a manual that lacks clear instructions. Overall, I regret this purchase and would not recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality audio experience.",
