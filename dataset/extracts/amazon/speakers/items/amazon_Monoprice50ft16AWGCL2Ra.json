                "reviewText": "Excellent pure copper, oxygen free speaker wire at a great price! While this wire was specifically made (& rated) for \"in wall\" use, I find that it's amazing for running under the carpet and along baseboards, as well as up the wall. I'm currently living in an apartment until our house is finished, and this wire is excellent as it blends into the wall and makes it much less of an eyesore, compared to standard copper colored speaker wire. As you can see in my photos, it blends in nicely when connected to my surround sound speakers. (It does have light black writing on the white outside casing, but its actually pretty easy to rub off, to make it look much cleaner)Being 14 gauge is great as well, though you'll want to make sure you strip & twist the wires correctly as it's a very tight fit if you have spring loaded speaker connections, and they can be a little tight when connecting them to banana plugs. That said, the positive & negative color coding is great. I really can't say enough great things about this wire. It's extremely high quality and Monoprice hit it out of the park with pricing. If you're looking for great high quality speaker wire, Monoprice is the way to go. Don't be fooled by the \"scary monsters\" out there, with their extremely overpriced wires & cables... Monoprice will have you rockin & rollin with their amazing quality & pricing.",

                "reviewText": "These might not be fancy, but they have unbeatable practical quality and a great price. If you need speaker cable, give this one strong consideration.A few features that make this cable worth every penny:- All-copper conductors- Low strand count = thick, durable strands- Color-coded inner jackets- Length markers on the outer jacket at each foot- Rated for in-wall installationThe 14 ga. notch on my wire strippers made a clean cut on the inner jackets without breaking any of the strands, so the wire diameter is perfect. The outer jacket is loose and doesn't have the appearance of a precisely manufactured product, but it works to your advantage because it doesn't restrict the inner wires during installation. So, I see no reason to complain.If you live in the Western U.S., you can buy this cable direct from Monoprice for cheaper. If you are located in the Eastern U.S. and have Prime, you can pay about the same and get it from Amazon much sooner. It's a great price either way. Expensive cables impress no one.",
