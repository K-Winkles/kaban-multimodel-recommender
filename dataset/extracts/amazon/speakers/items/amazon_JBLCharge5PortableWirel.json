                "reviewText": "For so long, I convinced myself I didn\u2019t need it, and yet when there was a discount on it, I concluded with one thing.I needed it.So of course I had to buy it and boy oh boy, is this such a great speaker. Speaking on size, this speaker was a lot bigger than I imagined. It\u2019s a lot bigger than the Charge 3, which was pretty big in my eyes, but this feels a lot bigger. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the most portable speaker, unless you have a very large bag or are comfortable carrying it around. This thing will definitely be staying at home with me 80% of the time. As you can see, this thing is a lot bigger than the Flip 6 while being a lot smaller than the Xtreme 2. Speaking on the quality, this thing looks absolutely amazing. I simply love the aesthetic look and the green just looks amazing alongside the Flip 6. It feels incredibly sturdy to hold and it feels lightweight! And from my experience, the battery life is pretty fantastic, but I don\u2019t believe it is the full 20 hours like advertised. And charging does take a bit, but the speaker being USB-C is a major convenience.Finally, let\u2019s talk about the sound. When I compared it to the Flip 6, I was quite impressed.For the size difference, the Charge 5 comes across as much louder and retains much of its bass as you put the volume up, and against the Xtreme 2, I\u2019m surprised at how well it held off on it\u2019s own. I definitely prefer the Charge 5\u2019s sound signature over the Xtreme\u2019s. The Charge 5 is a bass monster and you can really feel it during a lot of songs. With the adjustable EQ within the JBL app, I was able to tune the speaker to how I\u2019d like, which is always a helpful feature.Overall, the JBL Charge 5 is a loud, powerful, but also attractive and trendy looking speaker. In terms of whether you should buy this over the Flip 6, it\u2019s really up to what you need. If you a small speaker you can easily carry around, get the Flip 6. If you want a souped up, larger, but also more powerful speaker that is a little more difficult to take on the go with you, but that\u2019s not an issue with you. Get a Charge 5, but also wait for a discount.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my Charge 3 that I lost and highly recommend it. It uses a usb-c instead of a micro, which is nice because now everything I own uses the same charging cord. It has upper-middle sound quality, which is about the best you can get out of a portable Bluetooth speaker (it's just not possible to get really high-quality sound out of these types of speakers; this is as good as it gets). It is louder than anything this small has any right to be. There's nowhere in my 1600 sq ft house I can put this thing and not hear it everywhere else. It's great for backyard parties and setting it in a central location while you move all around the house.My only complaint is the battery life. I'm getting about 2.5 hours on it before the warning light starts blinking. That, to me, is pretty disappointing for a speaker that's more than $150 and meant to be portable. I basically have to use it as a wired speaker every other time I use it. Since I mainly use it in-house, that's not a deal breaker, but if you want to actually take it places, that could be a problem.",

                "reviewText": "These are excellent. I\u2019m a former high-end audio salesperson. I use my Charge 5 everywhere: in the house, in the garage, by the lake, on the deck. It\u2019s easy to connect to (my wife is a technophobe and she loves this thing). The battery lasts amazingly long, and the sound is remarkable for the size. I just bought one for a friend for his wedding - now he\u2019s loving his! I owned 3 cheaper Bluetooth speakers before this one and was worried I was spending too much on this. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s definitely worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "La bocina f\u00edsicamente es hermosa, y lo es m\u00e1s en este dise\u00f1o verde camo. Al principio ten\u00eda miedo de comprarla pues he tenido malas experiencias comprando bocinas JBL en internet (me han llegado bocinas falsas o copias). Aqu\u00ed no hay duda de que es una JBL Charge 5 original (Made in Vietnam), todos los acabados y materiales son de la mejor calidad, y obviamente el sonido es incre\u00edble.Tiene mucha potencia para el tama\u00f1o de la bocina. No esperes dejar sordos a tus amigos en una fiesta de 100 personas, pero s\u00ed tiene suficiente potencia para ambientar alguna reuni\u00f3n familiar y un poco m\u00e1s. En mi cuarto (que es como de 5m x 10m) la uso m\u00e1ximo a 50% de volumen y ya es mucho esc\u00e1ndalo.Quiero hablar de la bater\u00eda porque muchos compradores mencionan que les dura 5 o 6 horas, pero imagino que debe ser porque les toc\u00f3 una bater\u00eda defectuosa, o la usan siempre a 100 de volumen o de plano les toc\u00f3 una imitaci\u00f3n.As\u00ed que quise hacer una prueba bastante precisa sobre la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda en mi bocina Charge 5.Primero me asegur\u00e9 de vaciar completamente la bater\u00eda de la Charge 5, luego la cargu\u00e9 a full durante m\u00e1s de 4 horas. Y entonces us\u00e9 la bocina durante varios d\u00edas llevando la cuenta del tiempo exacto que la us\u00e9 cada d\u00eda, hice esto hasta que se le acab\u00f3 la bater\u00eda y se apag\u00f3 por s\u00ed sola. Estoy consciente que la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda depende mucho del volumen en el que la uses y el tipo de m\u00fasica que reproduzcas con ella. En mi lugar de trabajo no puedo hacer mucho esc\u00e1ndalo, as\u00ed que us\u00e9 la bocina a volumen de aproximadamente 30% durante esta prueba (que es un muy buen volumen para que ambiente este negocio sin llegar a ensordecer). La m\u00fasica que reproduc\u00ed fue mayormente rock y pop.El resultado fue este: Usando volumen de 30% con m\u00fasica rock y pop, la bater\u00eda me dur\u00f3 unas impresionantes 28 horas!No s\u00e9 ustedes, pero para m\u00ed este resultado por mucho super\u00f3 mis expectativas.Si, como yo, necesitas una bocina para ambientar un cuarto chico, mediano o grande, con muy buena calidad de audio (sin ser una bocina car\u00edsima para audiofilos) esta bocina es perfecta para ti, la recomiendo totalmente.",
