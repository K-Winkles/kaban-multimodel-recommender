I\u2019ve waited 2 weeks of daily use of the speaker to write this review to get a good feel for it.And let me tell you\u2026 for the price this thing isn\u2019t bad at all. Now it doesn\u2019t have a deep bass that you\u2019ll find with the more expensive brands, but the sound quality is there. I was surprised with how loud and crisp the speaker got.It\u2019s plug and play so you don\u2019t need to worry about setting anything up. You can connect it via Bluetooth or aux input. You do need a usb power adapter if you want to plug it into an outlet though because there isn\u2019t one included but that wasn\u2019t a big deal for me because I have a ton of them already.One thing that I really liked about it was the volume knob. I just prefer having a knob to control my volume because it\u2019s easier. It\u2019s also really lightweight so I brought this thing all around the house with me. I actually had it plugged into one of my cheap power banks and it didn\u2019t drain the battery for over 24 hours so it also didn\u2019t consume a lot of power.The RBG lighting is always nice, I have RBG lighting all over my room so it fit in perfectly with my desk setup.A few things I wish were different\u2014 I wish it came in white because black isn\u2019t really my vibe, but it\u2019ll be fine.Overall, if you\u2019re in the market for a Bluetooth speaker but not trying to spend an arm and a leg, i would get this one. Best budget friendly speaker!",

                "reviewText": "This soundbar has been a mainstay in my setup for the past 3 months. As an affordable sound bar it works great, looks great, sounds great. I really like the look of the charcoal fabric on the exterior. The rest of the exterior casing is plastic but doesn\u2019t feel cheap. The volume dial spins very smoothly too and the RGB is tasteful done. My only gripe is where the power cord comes out of the body. It\u2019s toward the top of the case so it sticks up like an Ariana Grande ponytail. I just wish this was located in a more discreet location. Other than that, I love it!",

                "reviewText": "It's cheap. The sound quality is mediocre, but I hope anyone buying this isn't expecting good sound from a $20 speaker. Build quality and everything is about where you'd expect it to be, not bad. I don't use the RGB, but I did test it and it works. Not as many options as you'd get from something like an RGB controller for your PC parts, but again, it's cheap and there's one button to set the RGB. It makes it simple.The sound bar itself is probably longer than it should be or needs to be, I'm assuming to give the full sound bar aesthetic, but it works well enough in my case even having to fit between two monitors. If it were a little longer or shorter I could have it sit slightly forward but with how my monitors happen to be spaced, any further forward and it wants to tip backward. I found that sound isn't really affected in my case by pushing it back a couple inches.I expected the cables to be longer, but in my case I still have a foot or so of slack. I was just a little surprised to open the package and see what looks like 1 meter/3 feet of cords.I bought this speaker for my office, just to replace an old broken pair. One was dead, one worked but volume on certain videos was almost completely inaudible. This thing actually gets pretty loud. I didn't expect half of the volume I got from it. Again, even at quiet volumes, the sound quality is not good, but I've definitely heard worse. I'd buy it again if I had a use for it, unless it dies on me prematurely, and in that case I'll update this review.",

                "reviewText": "At first I was really impressed with the sound quality of this sound bar, music, videos, etc, all had really good sound, but then I noticed that the system sounds on my computer were completely inaudible. Not a volume setting or mixer setting; the system sounds simply can't be heard even though everything is good. I bought a Nylavee soundbar and the sound quality, not just of the system sounds, but of all audio in general is vastly superior. The Nylavee has four speakers and two passive diaghrams, instead of just two speakers and two passive diaphragms in the Soulion R50. You get far suplerative bass, and the sound separation, which is all but non-existant with the Soulion R50, is excellent. it costs me roughly $35 more to get the Nylavee, but the vastly superior sound makes it well worth the price. I gave the Soulion away to someone who needed a speaker for their computer, and I am far happier, now.",

The leds aren\u2019t overpowering and I\u2019ve left them on when I go to bed, no problem. Overall a very very good value, considering the name brand speakers of similar quality are usually around ten times the price.",

Overall, a solid choice for those seeking impressive audio performance from their computer speakers, especially at this price point!It connects via Aux or Bluetooth, making it perfect to play music from your phone or plugged into your PC. The extra bonus of subtle RGB on the sides, which are customisable with 4 different modes is something else I love.I originally had a 5.1 surround sound in the set up this was in, but I honestly do not miss it now I have this. The way the speaker is angled, you still get the immersive sound when playing games that require you to have audio around you.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a computer speaker.",
