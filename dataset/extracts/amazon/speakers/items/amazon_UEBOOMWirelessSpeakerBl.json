                "reviewText": "After making a trip to Best Buy to listen to the available Bluetooth speaker models, I was impressed with the volume and sound quality of this small, water resistant speaker. Although the sound quality is not quite as crisp as that of the Bose Soundlink III that I also tried, the UE BOOM allows for significant volume without distortion, even when on battery power, and since I was wanting to use this to listen to e-books and music from my iPad and iPhone while I was working in the kitchen or getting ready for work in the morning, I appreciate the portability and water resistant skin of this model. Logitech also offers a companion iOS and Android app for the speaker that allows one to update the firmware wirelessly, turn the speaker on/off, adjust volume/equalizer settings, and even use the speaker as an alarm that plays music from a specified playlist. While the speaker boasts NFC connectivity, this feature is not compatible with the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus at this time (Android only), which I discovered after attempting to connect my phone because the literature included with the speaker provides little information on functionality.This refurbished version comes in a rather plain box, but it is well packaged and the exterior looks brand new. I can find no evidence of cosmetic flaws with either the speaker or the charging adapter. Functionality has been perfect so far, and the included quick start guide included instructions on connecting via bluetooth. If you need any other instructions, however, you will need to either search on the website or download the mobile app, which also has a help section.Overall, I'm very happy with the quality and value of this purchase and am considering purchasing a second one for my husband to use in his workshop.",

                "reviewText": "Let me just say....WOWFirst of all, this speaker is made very well and can be noticed by the solid construction of the outer shell. One way to tell if a product has been made well is to look at seams where pieces meet. In well made products, the seems are virtually non existent and are very smooth. This shows the level of production measures taken when crafting the item.Second, the sound is more than I was expecting from such a compact design. The sound fills a room with ease given the unique design and gives the user a fully engaged experience. What impressed me the most was the bass output by such a small speaker. Speakers of this size tend to lean toward the highs and can begin to sound sharp at high levels. Not this little guy. This speaker retained very clear sound output without any bass distortion what so ever. It actually sounds better than some other high end speakers I have and have used before.I also like the fact the it includes a very tight fitting cap/insert for the ports to retain the waterproofing and keep dust and debris out of the charging and headphone port. This speaker holds its charge for a very long time which is also a nice feature.What I like the most about this speaker though, is the fact that it comes with a unique app that lets you control the features from your phone. It even has the ability to tun the speaker on and off remotely. You can adjust the equilizer to fit your needs based on type of room/location or listening preference. You even have the option to play music from more than one phone and can even link a second speaker for even more surround sound.I am very pleased with this speaker and plan to give the larger model a try in the future. That or add a second unit of this model to put in another room downstairs to completely fill with sound.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered and Prime delivered in two days! Unit looked a little tired with a few scuff marks, had a dusty look (is that their black?) no instructions, came well packed but without the item that screws into the top so you can hang it from your belt, etc AND the micro charge fitting was very wobbly and appear ready to break where it plugs into the speaker on the bottom. I sent it back and got a refund in one day! The speaker does work well inspite of all these travails and I liked the sound too, not too much bass and very good high notes. It came charged up so I didn't need to charge it as I returned it. Now I see the description of this item on Amazon is a lot better and shows a picture of what you get, etc. I wish this unit had a base to set it on so it would charge, as now you have to turn it sideways or on it's head to charge it. Battery life looks impressive from the description although I never found out. Overall a good speaker at a good price. I ordered a new Boom 2 for $40 more and think I will be happy with it if it sounds as good as or better than the original Boom.",

I just received a \u201ccertified refurbished\u201d one and I think I\u2019d be better off risking being kidnapped and getting one from Craigslist. This speaker is beat to hell. Dirty and smelly too but the worst part is it\u2019s missing the cover that makes this waterproof. There is no center screw to attach it and no wonderfuly colorful charging cable that UE Boom are known for. Instead I get a dirty second hand generic 7-11 charger that\u2019s already hot from being plugged in for half an hour. How long till my house burns down?UE Boom are incredible but this outfit is doing them an injustice. The unit I got should\u2019ve been retired with dignity. It sounds good when plugged in ( no fire yet). No idea if battery will hold up but seeing how it\u2019s been ridden hard and put away wet, I doubt that it will last. I regret buying this from these folks. Should\u2019ve bought a new one. Beware.-Update! I've had this speaker plugged in for over 4 hours and it wont charge past 50%. I'm going to return it.",
