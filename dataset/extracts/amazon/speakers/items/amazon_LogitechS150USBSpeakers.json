                "reviewText": "Getting a new laptop some time ago with Vista Home Premium is one of my nearly daily regrets. Vista is so finicky, so user-unfriendly and nearly adverse to any additions (software or hardware) we have attempted to add.I was heartened to receive these speakers, noting it said \"Vista compatible\" on the box. We have a 17\" Acer laptop that we were hoping to watch movies on at times, however the existing laptop speakers were totally unacceptable as far as any volume when playing any DVDs.These however have made life wonderful! The sound is very decent (especially considering I paid less than $11 for them which included Free SuperSaver Shipping). I plugged them into a USB port and up popped a little window in the bottom right-hand section of the computer screen saying the system was installing them. Fifteen seconds later, the box indicated they had been installed successfully.Upon inserting a movie DVD, the sound was not that loud at first, however was very adequate (and a huge improvement over the speakers in the laptop). However getting into the Control Panel (Sound), I found a new addition there for the recently installed Speakers ~ where I was easily able to add \"Equaliziation\" and the option of a few other settings ~ plus adjust the sound of them to full volume. Now, we seldom need to turn them up past the halfway point (either by using the controls on one of the speakers or using the on-screen controls). The \"Equalization\" option also seems to give them more oooomph/depth and seemed to add a little bass to them as well.We have no problem with the sound of the music played on many of the DVD movies or any other sound for that matter. These are not high quality stereo speakers, they will not come close to imitating the sound/output of a boombox, but for the money, they put out a sound and volume far more than what we were expecting.The USB connection allows the freedom of not having to plug them into a wall outlet, the wires on them (speaker to speaker and from the one speaker to the USB port) seem ample and then some for our particular needs. And they are a nice little size that is proprtionate to the laptop. Also stable, not top heavy or wobbly, they stay where you put them.This is one of those products that I wish I had had the foresight to purchase long ago as they have definitely added to our DVD movie watching enjoyment. Amazon shipping as usual was fast and efficient. I plan on purchasing more of these for our other laptops as well.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Aesthetically looks great.- The LED light is quaint and doesn't bother me. I actually like it as it is a sign that my computer is on.- Sound quality is acceptable. I dare say it's even good. Perfectly fine for watching YouTube videos and the like. Don't expect to watch movies with this though.- Digital sound, meaning you only need a single USB port.- Doesn't have static sound coming out at all times like my previous speaker.- Volume controls are simple and include the essentials: volume down, mute, and volume up. No annoying knob to control.- Great price.Pro-tip: Use Windows' sound enhancers in the sound settings for this device. They don't sound too great without the enhancements.Cons:- They're from 2007. That makes them 12 years old!- They're way too loud. I don't know if this is a problem with my sound drivers or what, but at 1 volume, the volume is BOOMING. I don't get the reviews that say this is too quiet. It is absolutely NOT too quiet! Solution: Download \"Equalizer APO.\" It's a free program that allows you to set the volume lower than Windows allows you.- The volume controls affect only Windows sound (makes sense considering it's digital), but this leads to problems with it being too loud. It's the same as the volume controls on your keyboard, so it's kind of pointless in the end.- They're recognized as \"(USB AUDIO )\"... Yes, that's with the spaces. Doesn't look great in the sound device list.Other thoughts:They're pretty good. I only use them for system sounds and sometimes the quick YouTube video, and they're perfect for that. It's a shame that they're too loud and need a software solution, but it is something you set and forget. Honestly, I'm just super happy they don't produce static at all times like the previous speakers I tried to buy.",

You know from their size and USB power situation that they won't have ground-pounding bass or cutting edge clarity, but they still put out excellent sound quality and volume. I had trouble with them cutting out at high volume or when the bass kicked in in a song, but found out that was with them plugged into the front \"easy access\" USB ports. Once I switched the plug around to one on the back of the computer, they work flawlessly, so heads up on that.",
