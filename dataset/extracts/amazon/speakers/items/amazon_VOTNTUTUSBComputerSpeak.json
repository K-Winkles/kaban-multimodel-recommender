                "reviewText": "Was looking for a desktop PC speaker for a gaming computer-turned into every day computer. Went to Amazon's \"Delivered the next day\" tab and this speaker was one of many I searched. Since the overall rating was one of the best I chose one of these Votntut speakers.After almost 2 days using this speaker is a great addition to my computer set-up. I was unaware that a speaker could be plugged in using a USB but it works! And no additional need for an audio port plug, just USB this into the computer and you're up and running.Some features I like - 1) When turned on it stays on, unlike my bluetooth speakers that turn off after so many minutes of not using. 2) For the small size it does pretty good sound-wise. In the back of the speaker there's a woofer-type mechanism that gives you a tiny bass. 3) Although it's spherical it's small enough to where it can be placed in a cluttered area. 4) Good USB cord length. 5) Easy functions...just a simple speaker with volume controls (that you can manipulate through your computer's sound tab.The only place I'd knock this speaker down a peg is the price. At just under $12 USD, although not over the top, I do think this speaker should be priced between $6 - 10. (Prices may have been adjusted due to inflation.) I hate to be nit-picky about a few dollars but...honest review!I WOULD recommend this speaker if you're looking for something for running average sound.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this speaker. I like the volume control buttons and the mute button. It\u2019s a nice size and the sound quality is good, but I don\u2019t like that the sound will randomly not work. I need to unplug it from the USB port and then plug it back in to get the sound to work again. It\u2019s a bit of nuisance especially since my USB port is on the back of my computer tower, so it\u2019s easily accessible to unplug and plug back in.",

                "reviewText": "I got this speaker for using it as a computer speaker. I wanted a speaker that was smaller in size, yet had decent sound at the same time. I was thinking of the double-speakers, but found this one, and decided to try it out, based upon the user reviews.A little bit about my setup:I am running Ubuntu Linux, and using a USB Hub to plug the speaker into. The speaker works flawlessly with Linux; it does not require any driver or module support.I am SUPER impressed by this little speaker! It is plenty loud enough for me. I listen to music as well as use it for group Zoom video calls, and it works flawlessly...plenty of sound, even at 50% or less (from the max volume capability). Also, when I am using the speaker, other participants in Zoom cannot hear themselves from my webcam mic...so somehow, that all works as well.I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker. It is plug & play, and works without any drivers / modules. It is just as loud as if there were two speakers side-by-side.",
