You can listen to the sound without disturbing others if the speaker lies under the pillow in the center. It\u2019s a little unusual that there are only two control buttons, but this has its advantages. It\u2019s a pity that we can\u2019t recommend that designers make buttons more recognizable to the touch, but this is a matter of habit. The speaker is very, very pleasant to the touch, for me this is an important aspect.",

(See the \u201csale\u201d is still happening\u2026 the price is unchanged.) This item does not sound very loud but can be heard clearly when a pillow is sandwiched between your and the speaker. My complaint is that the speaker constantly vibrates and emits a high, near silent buzzing. It is so unpleasant, I can actually feel the buzzing in my ears and teeth. If I listen to it look enough, I get a headache. This is quite a deal breaker for me and super disappointing.",
