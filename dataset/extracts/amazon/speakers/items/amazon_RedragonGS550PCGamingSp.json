                "reviewText": "I use these speakers on my daily setup mainly because they are red and match all my red peripherals. the speakers have great aesthetic but they are lacking when it comes to sound. they don't get very loud i suppose that's what you get with 2 or 3 watt speakers but i have heard other speakers out perform these easily. even when i amp the speakers I don't get much gain in bump bass or loudness. they match my setup so good for me but not good for playing loud music.This is an update to to my prier review. Since my experience with the GS550 speakers wasn't the greatest in favor of the product I cant say that about Red Dragons customer service. Since review Red Dragon reached out to me in response to my dislikes of the product and supplemented the speakers I had for a whole new set of speakers the GS590. These are the same price range speakers and remind me of the Creative Pebble speakers in the construction of them. The sound quality of the replacement speakers is better then the ones I had but you have to take in concern what you are getting for the price. But what I can say for sure is that Red Dragon has amazing customer care. They value customer opinion greatly and take your experience's into consideration when it comes their product. So I would put a foot forward for then and say that Red Dragon products are worth the buy if you care about aesthetics and customer care if needed.Reviewing the GS590: pros: they look amazing nice speakers on the front and back of each speaker module, The ability to control the RGB lighting on the back side of the speakers is quiet cool you can set from different modes from progressive color changing to just a solid color to match your style, I believe the one setting changes according to the sound. They are substantially louder then the GS550 but really not that loud again but talk about that later. There are 3 ways to connect, 1 via USB, it has a sound controller I suppose in the little DAC on the line, AUX input, and Bluetooth. Volume on the controller is nice if you use some like that depending on setup. The speakers do have a good amount of bass due to the rear speakers on the modules. there's a headphone jack as well on the line. I really like the USB input feature it frees up for 3.5mm jack. I also am a fan of the way they look they are stylish i like more of a gamer appearance.Cons: The speakers speak when changing between connection modes I personally am not a fan of vocal responses because you have to hear it every time you tune your computer on and off from sleep. The volume is loud when you are in front of them its enough for one person but away from the speakers it feels muffled a bit, if I would explain it more it doesn't fill the room just isolated to desktop person listening which is fine but not what I would expect from them. I pushed the speakers with a preamplification of 4 amps and really cant get any more room from the speakers at most you probably can pull 1 amp higher then stock. This concludes my review of the GS590 Red Dragon speakers.Special thanks to Red Dragon Support Erin for being great I look to the future for more product testing.",

One important thing is I believe the speakers and wires are unshielded as they pick up my neighbors radio transmissions quite loudly. Haven\u2019t found a solution to that problem yet.",

                "reviewText": "The cable between them isn't very long, not even 2 feet. If you want to put them on either side of your desk forget about it. The most you can do is either side of a monitor. The cables were tightly put in the foam in the box leaving bent cords (doesn't change the quality of the sound but look bad if the cables aren't well hidden). In addition to the cable between the speakers there are two additional cables coming from the speaker with the dial and aux ports. I have no need for an aux port on the speaker itself and it just added more cables. If you haven't been able to tell yet I don't like cables.The red only LEDs turn off when you turn the dial all the way counter-clockwise. The LEDs do not evenly light up. Only 40% of the dial is well lit up (It looks light there are two LEDs in the dial on either side).b THE LOGO IS NOT LED, I was under the impression it was LED from the photos taken in a dark setting.The speakers were easily combined and won't fall apart. There are also foam feet pads to protect the desk from scratching.Sound quality is a downgrade from my 10 year old speaker. I wanted to replace my old speaker with a cheap decent replacement that looked better. I will be giving the new speaker to my brother and keeping my old speaker.Base is less than advertised. The volume knob is delicate.THERE IS NO MANUAL in the box and I didn't find a online PDF of the manual either.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I advise spending more money (closer to the 60-80 dollar range) for a decent speaker. Do not get a product that advertises as a \"GAMER/GAMING\" product unless the company is a big name brand like Razer or Glorious.In the end you get what you paid for. This is one of the cheap options on amazon for a speaker and if you need a speaker and tight on money sure buy it. But for anyone trying to add LEDs to their set up or trying to get sound quality and base for their setup don't bother with Redragon.Conclusion:I am by no means a expert, I am a competitive gamer building a budget setup. I knew opening the box that I bought a cheap speaker and wasn't expecting top tier sound quality and was still disappointed. The cables are messy and NEED to be hidden. The LEDs aren't bright nor light up the whole area. There was no manual in the box. I do not recommend this product. Spend more money for a speaker that gives you what was advertised.",
