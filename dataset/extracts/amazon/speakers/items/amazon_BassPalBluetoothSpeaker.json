                "reviewText": "I've always been a shower singer and about 10 years ago I got my first shower speaker to go along with that habit. I've had a lot of these speakers in the past, since many of the ones I've gotten don't last a full year. This BassPal speaker is hands-down the best one I've ever used.The sound quality is fantastic. I'd put it on par with my JBL bluetooth speaker that isn't waterproof. The bass isn't going to rattle your house apart, but even at the louder volumes needed to compete with the sound of the shower, the overall quality of the music is great. It's nice and deep, without getting that rattle that a lot of cheaper heavy-bass speakers will get.The sound is top-notch, but there are other features that also make this speaker a great choice. I love the screen on the speaker. It shows battery level, a clock, and the current mode the speaker is set to (for transparency, I only ever use the bluetooth, I didn't even take the radio antenna out of the box). Just knowing that my speaker isn't going to die on me in the middle of a shower is huge for me - I hate it when my tunes get cut out because I didn't think to charge the little guy.I do also appreciate that the speaker comes with a big ol' suction cup on the back AND a rope with a loop on the top. Most other speakers I've gotten only have one or the other, but it's perfect having them both because I can use the suction cup to place the speaker exactly where I want it, but I can use the rope to secure it to the shower head for when the suction cup inevitably loses its suction (this happens probably once a week). I've had other speakers that only have the suction cup and they all fall eventually. I've also had speakers that only have the rope and I can never position those right as they end up just hanging free from the point where the showerhead attaches to the wall and spinning whichever way it feels like in that particular moment.I did have one major problem with the speaker that I purchased. After about 3 months of use, the speaker died on me. It would display a red light when I tried to turn it on, but never do anything beyond that. Fortunately, BassPal was very helpful when I reached out. They asked that I send them a video of the speaker not working, but then sent a replacement right away as soon as I got the video to them. I was very happy with how easy of an interaction that was.This is the best shower speaker I have found. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who likes having some tunes while they get clean!Pros:-Great sound-Screen shows battery level as well as clock and mode (easy to read)-Buttons are nice and chunky so you can feel when they click-Holds a charge for weeks-Excellent customer support when replacement was neededCons:-My first one died on me-No distinct buttons for volume/tracks",

It is in the shower everytime and does get sprayed on and it works perfectly. It can get very loud even and just adds some extra enjoyment and relaxation to shower/bath time. Charge holds for a decent amount of time before needing to be charged again.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, first off, If you're looking for FM, look elsewhere. I fiddled with this thing for about an hour, I am university educated but despite this I think I have common sense and have a background in electronics and technology. I could not get this thing to stop on a channel or save it to a preset. It could be okay though; if your Bluetooth device has an FM capability, then you can use it and just use the speaker to pump the sound. Using it like this, it works perfectly- and you can use the clock too. As an aside, my music player has FM but it requires wired headphones for the antenna. When used like this, the sound still goes through the speaker which is nice but I also used the supplied speaker's antenna in my music player, and it picked up all my presets on my music device! Sweet!The sound is great. I set the bluetooth's speaker volume on maximum, 30, and then used my music device to adjust the volume. This way I have volume control away from the speaker. Now if you wanted to toggle the volume through the speaker, you can do that as well. You can also toggle the music device's songs forward and backward by long pressing the volume buttons.You can toggle through various light schemes too but I just turned them off to save battery life. When the unit is charging, the light is red and I assume it will either turn green or simply go off when it is charged.What could make this thing better? One, a flat bottom! When you unscrew the suction cup, the base of the speaker is conical. If it was flat or had feet you could set this on a table or something. Some rubber feet over the four assembly screw holes might make this issue non existent. The good news about the suction cup screw and the accompanying hole, it is a standard 1/4*20! Thank you for that. If you don't know, that's a standard thread for things like camera bases , tripods, and GoPro junk.Also, the buttons have a lot of designs on most of them but you can only press the centre of the buttons for the functions. You toggle the functions by long pressing. This is not a big deal but you can barely make out the function designs on the buttons. I may try to fix this with a wipe of some white or yellow acrylic paint and then wipe the button's high spots off. if I do this, I will take some pictures to show my results.Finally, I think this thing will be okay. It pairs easily, it has great sound, it feels really well built and rugged, and it was cheap. If it conks out like I think it will, I may attempt a battery replacement/ upgrade because at this price point, the battery will probably be the weak link.",

I use it everytime I shower and I even got my daughter one for her bathroom for christmas as she has been asking. Only issue is that the buttons that looks like it would say \"next\" or \"back\" only work for volume, I haven't been able to get them to actually make anything go next or back which it might be a user error I am unsure I didn't investigate into it too much. I like that it automatically shuts off if it's not playing anything for a bit, saves battery!",
