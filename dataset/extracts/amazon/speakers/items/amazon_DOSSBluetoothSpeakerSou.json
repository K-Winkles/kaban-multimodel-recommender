                "reviewText": "Well, true to the reviews, this one is a huge WIN. My wife and I are both musicians and love listening to music when we have the time. I have bought several Bluetooth speakers and will compare this one to the venerable older Jam Plus [the good blue one that people hunt for], and the Oontz Angle which I bought shortly after this one. The short answer is that in this price range I don't know of anything that will do a better job than the DOSS, with its well-reviewed shortcomings. To do substantially better, you need to spend substantially more.The Jam is great because it works everytime, is easy to pair, has good-enough battery life, and makes a lot of noise no matter where you put it. It has warmth, which a LOT of smallish BT speakers flat don't have. The very good Oontz Angle sounds great and is very simple: much simpler than the DOSS - it has no volume control so nothing to mess with there to confuse you. The Oontz fooled me - when tested by itself you would swear it is the best sounding mini-sized speaker on the market at the price range. But when I A-B'd it side by side with the Doss Touch, the Doss is clearly more capable. It is louder than the Oontz given the same source feeding both. It is almost too loud, too efficient in that if you want it very very quiet, you'll be very glad it has that touch-volume control on the top. The Oontz is not as Big sounding but is very warm because of the good design with a downward-port as well as the face port, so sound reflects the surface it is placed on. In an Automobile/Truck, as many Oontz reviewers have said, you can plop the Oontz in the windshield-dash \"V\" and it will make a lot of noise! Perfect for that if you need it. If I had not had the Doss I would have been thrilled with the Oontz - can't go wrong either way. But the Doss starts off clean and crisp and has great \"transparency\" of fidelity. Run the volume up high and it remains clear - Absent a signal so strong that it would \"clip\" at your iPad or handset or whatever, the Doss does not fade or break up. If you are looking for a Boom-Box this isn't it [the ones that are are expensive and often uni-dimensional, not hi-fi].I personally listen to Classical Music when I am working on computer or just busy around a room - the Doss is sublime for that type of music format. If you set it on a table in a spot where there is no under bracing, just a wood top, it is really in its element. Though not 'down-firing' in design, it moves that table like a diaphragm and the rubber feet and mass of the unit keep it well-planted. I sometimes place it in a \"hutch\" we have,... one of the old fashioned kitchen keeper hutches with a raised top and open area at the middle. The sound from back in that chamber is magic.Like other reviewers, I don't like the audible signals from the Doss - very annoying when someone is sleeping and you flip it on, but Doss has provided firmware switching so if you are even partly competent at downloading and installing the patch to a micro-SD, you can switch off the audible signaling [and more... see their support site]. The Jam, by the way, is also annoying in that respect but we've put up with it 'cause it is a good speaker that \"just works\".Bottom line: BUY IT.",

                "reviewText": "The Bluetooth Speaker DOSS sound-box was delivered very promptly on 3/April/2023, and I have been using it without functional issues since then. I do have a couple of criticisms which I will describe later.I am very pleased with this Bluetooth Speaker. It's seems well-made. It is surprisingly heavy for its size, but I like that. Sound is very good. Battery life is very good; it seems to go be able to go 12 hours on a full charge. It has never malfunctioned, even once since I've had it. I have had several other Bluetooth speakers, one by JBL, another by Phillips, and this Bluetooth speaker is far better than those. The price is also good, as far as I remember, it's cheaper than the JBL and Phillips.The criticisms are 1) (trivial) very small indicator light on USB C charging input. Sometimes it's difficult to see2) It has a 15 min cut out to save energy when not in use. I like the sound-box to stay on when I study because quite often I have to break for > 15 mins to think, or do work, but I do like it to cut out after 15 min when not hooked to external charge to save energy. This problem is fixed by sending an email to the manufacturer and getting a flash upgrade. I have done this but I haven't done the upgrade yet. I have only used the Bluetooth Speaker as an external speaker on my desktop computer, so I have not been able to evaluate its other functions.Remark added 29 January 2024: I bought this unit in April 2023. I use it every day and it has never malfunctioned. It's a beauty. I would recommend it.END OF STORY\ud83d\udfe5",
