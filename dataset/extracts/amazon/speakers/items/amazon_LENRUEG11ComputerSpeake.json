Let's start with the sound quality \u2013 it's impressive, but if you're expecting bass that can launch your coffee mug into orbit, you might need to recalibrate your caffeine-fueled expectations. These speakers are more Mozart than Metallica when it comes to bass, but hey, your mug will thank you.Now, let's talk about the real headliner \u2013 the entertaining lights. These speakers aren't just about the beats; they're about the visual feast! The lights along the edge are like a mood ring for your desk, slowly fading up and cycling through more colors than a chameleon on a Skittles diet. It's like a mini aurora borealis, right there next to your monitor.Pair these rainbow rhythm warriors with a similar light mouse, and your desk becomes the unofficial dance floor of the tech world. Your colleagues (Okay I work alone in my office but you can imagine) might think you're preparing for a disco duel rather than a spreadsheet showdown. To sum this all up the LENRUE G11 speakers may not knock your coffee mug into space, but they sure know how to turn your desk into a sonic rainbow. It's a party for your ears and eyes \u2013 who said work can't be a fiesta?",

It sounds more mono-like than if you had two individual speakers. The bar feels okay for the price. My real only complaint is that the cord is quite short and was hard to cable manage on my desk. The only other thing that bothered me was that RGB lights around the speaker bar are completely random. They all start off red but are programmed to slowly differ from each other so that you'll get a full rainbow effect after awhile.",

Sound was meh at first, had to go into Audio Console and play with Equalizer a bit to get a decent sound.3. LED light colors are random. One thing really annoys me is LED light automatically turns on every time you power on your pc. I prefer \"set it and forget it\" instead of having to press a button to turn off the LED every time my PC starts.Overall a decent and nice looking speaker, for the price this low I'm happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "If you're expecting excellent sound quality from a computer speaker, look elsewhere. It does the job. There really isn't anything special about it. The lights look cool but they don't sync with the sound if that's what you might think. It feels like you have to turn the volume knob quite a ways to even get a little bit of sound. It doesn't match up with the volume level painted on the speaker, so there isn't any way to know how high or low the volume is until you play something. (So be careful if you were blaring something the day before - you may have forgotten!) Otherwise, it's a good speaker for the money. I wasn't looking for anything special and it does the job I wanted it for.",
