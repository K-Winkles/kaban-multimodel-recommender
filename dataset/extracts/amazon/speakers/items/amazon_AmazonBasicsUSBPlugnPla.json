                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on the Amazon Basics Speakers, and I must say, they have been an impressive addition to my setup. These speakers come close to perfection, offering a blend of aesthetics and performance that I truly appreciate.Let's start with the design. The Amazon Basics Speakers have a sleek and modern appearance that effortlessly complements any setup. I particularly love the silver finish, which gives them a premium look and adds a touch of elegance to my desk or entertainment area. Additionally, the blue LED light at the bottom is a nice touch, serving as a subtle yet stylish indicator that the speakers are powered and ready to go.Sound-wise, these speakers do not disappoint. They produce a clear and balanced sound that enhances my audio experience. The highs are crisp, the mids are well-defined, and the bass, while not earth-shattering, is surprisingly adequate for speakers of this size. Whether I'm watching movies, listening to music, or playing games, the audio quality remains consistent and enjoyable.The Amazon Basics Speakers are fairly loud, but I must admit, I wish they could crank up the volume a bit more. For most everyday scenarios, the volume level is perfectly adequate and fills my room with sound. However, during more dynamic moments in movies or when hosting a party, I sometimes find myself yearning for a little more oomph. Nevertheless, for the average user, the volume range should be more than sufficient.One feature that stood out to me is the ease of use. These speakers were straightforward to set up, requiring minimal effort to get them working. I simply connected them to my device via the included audio cable, and I was immediately immersed in quality sound. The plug-and-play functionality is convenient, saving time and making them accessible to all users, regardless of technical expertise.Undoubtedly, one of the most appealing aspects of the Amazon Basics Speakers is their price point. At such an affordable cost, they provide remarkable value for the money. Finding speakers with a sleek design, decent sound quality, and added aesthetics like the blue LED light, at this price range, is quite a steal.In conclusion, the Amazon Basics Speakers are an excellent choice for anyone seeking a near-perfect balance of aesthetics and performance. Their silver finish and blue LED light add a touch of sophistication to any setup, making them visually appealing. The sound quality is good, though a little more volume would have been ideal. Nonetheless, they are more than loud enough for most users and deliver an enjoyable listening experience. The easy setup and budget-friendly price further solidify their position as a top-notch choice. If you're looking for a reliable and stylish set of speakers that won't break the bank, the Amazon Basics Speakers are definitely worth considering. They have earned my recommendation, and I believe they will make a welcome addition to any audio setup.",

                "reviewText": "Diesel speakers work way better than expected for such a cheap price. I mostly wanted them to be able to hear podcast and when I\u2019m on meetings, be able to hear a little bit better. They are quite loud for being so small. Definitely not deep base and I wouldn\u2019t use them if I was really into heavy music. But just as an added bonus to a business laptop, these things are amazing. All I had to do is plug them in no set up at all.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box, I noticed these speakers are not light weight, they feel very solid, weighing at 10.8 oz each speaker, with an amplification module included in the structure.I read a good part of the reviews before purchasing these Amazon speakers, The specifications shared were not very clear, so here I will clarify some of the basic information that I felt was important to me and include some photos.The speaker wires, from speaker to USB or speaker to the 3.5mm headphone jack is 54 inches long. These are relatively long and can easy reach a desktop on the floor. I can split the 2-wires to the audio source or USB power, however much I want. The power supply comes from the USB line. Folks who say you can\u2019t turn it off unless you unplug it, is setting it up wrong. These are computer speakers, they are intended to turn-off when your computer is turned off. The suggested setup is to power the speakers from your computer USB and turns off when the computer is off. The In-line volume control is 5 inches from the right speaker, which is short, but my volume can also be controlled from the source or from Windows OS.The sound is crisp and clear and it is has a clear mid-range beat to it or Amazon calls in \u201cSpringy\u201d. If I was looking for heavier base, surround sound, than these are not the speakers for me. Overall, I find the sound to be good for youtube, gaming or audio conference. It can be very loud if the source is amplified.The light is blue and I don\u2019t find it too bright in the day and is perfect in the night. The brightness might also depend on your USB source, as i have an older lower powered USB 1.0 hub. Hope this is helpful to you.",

I had trouble getting them to work because someone left a review that said you could plug them into an outside power source and they still work! Wrong! Once I plugged in to the USB and the audio plug... yay! The sound is so much better and I am enjoying the extra volume!",

The computer is alright but the built in speakers are terrible, very low volume and tinny sound.I thought these might be a slight improvement but I was wrong. They are a MASSIVE improvement; really great sound. It was especially surprising considering their size and price. They also have great build quality, they're very solid.",
