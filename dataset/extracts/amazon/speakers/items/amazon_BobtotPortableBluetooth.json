Perfect for using inside or taking with you to the fire pit or beach. Sound is great for it's size. Accidentally left it outside overnight after a gathering at the firepit and it got RAINED on for a couple hours. It still worked just fine!",

Handles phone calls, so its better than the misleading ear buds i purchased. Over all it works as required, but there are better options if you want to spend more and want more features - like volume control beyond your phone/tablet restrictions",

I\u2019m 50% deaf so I was having difficulty hearing my iPad speaker and I didn\u2019t care much for the speaker option on my iPhone. This thing is unbelievable. Crystal clear sound and has a microphone built in that I\u2019m told is really clear. You will never, ever find a speaker like this at this price. I\u2019m ordering more and considering giving them away as Christmas gifts.",
