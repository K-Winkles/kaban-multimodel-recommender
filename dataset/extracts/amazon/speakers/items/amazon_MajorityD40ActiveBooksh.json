                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Small speakers that pack a punch",
                "reviewText": "Majority has become a favorite of mine for audio equipment. I really enjoy the way they go the extra mile and provide a fantastic product for an affordable price. The speakers came packaged in a great way and included everything I needed to simply plug & play. I especially liked that the speakers included all necessary cables I could need including batteries for the remote. The remote has a simplistic but very useful design as well with independent bass and treble controls which I find some speakers I have used in the past lacking. I immediately tried connecting my phone to the speakers via Bluetooth which went perfectly, and the quality was fantastic. Afterwards I connected them via optical to my Samsung TV which was also a breeze and started putting them through the paces.I tested the speakers on different media such as music, video games and movies. The speakers handled them all well but really shine when playing music. I tried some classical music such as Piano Sonata No. 15 by Mozart. The speakers sounded crystal clear and represented all notes well. I am also impressed with the bass on the speakers relative to their size. I have other systems with dedicated subwoofers that give floor shaking bass but I cannot say I missed it all that much with the D40's. I found myself thoroughly enjoying watching the movie Luca with my family using the speakers and even had to turn them down at times because the action sequences were pretty loud.The finish of the speakers is also well done and provides a very appealing aesthetic. The nice black woodgrain design on the speakers really blends nicely into any system arrangement. The front glossy finish is very nice as well and overall, the design of the speakers has piqued the interest of visitors I have had, they are truly eye catching. They are truly unique in design as well, I have not used active bookshelf speakers before, but they provide much more placement options versus a traditional system. I like that I can spread them out farther apart if I want to create a more surround sound effect as the cord connecting the two speakers together is adequate length. I am sold on the active bookshelf design and hope to see new products from Majority in this realm.Overall, I am very happy with Majority thus far as they provide one of the best values to me in home audio equipment. All their products come with a 3-year warranty when registering online which truly takes no time at all. All of the products I have received from them have been excellent, including the D40's, the Teton soundbar (excellent value as well) and the smaller Atlas soundbar which packs a real punch for its size and is portable. I will continue supporting the company and spreading word of mouth about the excellent value Majority products provide to consumers at all levels.Pros:Very clear at all volume levelsExcellent fit & finishUnique design & appealImpressive bass for small speakersVery compact and do not take up much spaceExcellent packing by the company and value for providing all necessary componentsCons:Max volume alert on speakers could be lowerBuilt in sound profiles for Movie/Music/Dialog would be a nice additionA trigger to let you know what level the bass/treble is set on currently when adjusting itThe cons I listed are minor and can be overlooked in favor of the excellent value these speakers provide. In addition, they are from a great company that truly cares about providing the customer a fantastic experience overall. Buy them you will not be disappointed!",

They have a nice finish to them that makes them feel & look high quality as well as sturdy. I have them hooked up to my AT-LP60x and they sound clear and crisp with a nice touch of bass. The controls on this device are smooth as well. The controller works well and the Bluetooth setup was easy. I played from my phone and the connection was great. Only thing I noticed is the bass came out slightly muddy with the Bluetooth but it was probably from the way I have my Spotify eq set.Overall a great product!",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this is a very good set of powered bookshelf speakers with multiple connections. They are close to being an \"amazing value.\"Packaging:Good! Nice box, everything is packaged well and designed well.Build quality:Solid overall. The set comes with multiple cables that are standard for this price point. The speakers themselves feel well made. The finishing is good with no obvious imperfections or manufacturing sloppiness. The cabinets feel good, but not especially heavy. They are a good size and everything is clearly marked.Glossy (but not piano) black front and wood veneer cabinet look good and I don't think a front grill would enhance anything.The low point is that the remote feels really cheap. The options on the remote are clear and useful. The remote does work, but it just feels quite cheaply made.Also, the woofer appears to be smaller than the stated 4\".Miscellaneous:-The remote is functional with the ability to change treble and bass.-Multiple connection points are a big plus.-The wire connecting the right speaker to the left is hard wired and 58\" long. That should be fine for most applications, but it could be limiting for some.-Bluetooth 5.0 is listed, but no advanced processing is mentioned.Sound Quality:-Considering the price....the sound is good.-This is not an audiophile quality set of speakers. The sound is a bit \"recessed\" and almost like it's tuned to a \"concert hall\" setting. Some songs sound better than others and after listening for a few days, that effect seemed to lessen, or I just got more used to it.The woofers sound pretty good overall, but definitely can't handle the full range of low frequencies.The tweeters might be the weak point of the set without anything close to sparkling/clear highs. They are appropriate for the price point and sound fine, but I was really wishing the D40s would wow me.-Majority doesn't list any frequency/audio specsConclusion:-I think most will be happy with how these sound ..... especially for the price point.-I am happy with this set for the price, but I was secretly hoping the D40s would knock my socks off.-Majority offers a compelling and well built package for the price with lots of features.-I think you'd have to spend twice as much to get anything notably better.-D40 is best suited for a dorm room, basement, garage, etc where you want something good to listen to, but don't need super high quality sound.***I really think Majority could OWN the sub $100 market with slightly better components. I'd happily pay a little more for a better tweeter/woofer. The D40 is so close to being really good***",
