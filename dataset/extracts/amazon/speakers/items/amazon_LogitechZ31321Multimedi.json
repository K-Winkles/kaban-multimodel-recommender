                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very good inexpensive speaker set.",
                "reviewText": "I bought this set to replace 20yr-old Altec Lansing ACS45.2 multimedia speakers that gave a loud pop on a recent evening, finally giving up the ghost. The Altec Lansings were awesome speakers, and I think I paid more for them 20 years ago than I paid for these Logitech replacements. These Logitechs produce very decent sound for inexpensive computer speakers, but they pale in comparison to my poor, dead Altec Lansings. The subwoofer is about half the size (and weight) of the Altec's, so it isn't surprising that it produces less sound pressure overall, and that the sound is a bit muddier. The tone of this set is much sharper than the Altec's rounder sound. I certainly prefer the sound of the Altec Lansing ACS45.2, but they're not available anymore. These Logitech speakers will do for me, since I no longer listen to music on my PC. I think if I wanted to use these speakers for music, they would not satisfy me. Too sharp; not enough subwoofer, and no way to increase or decrease the subwoofer output. The sharper tone is good for voice clarity on YouTube videos and podcasts. I'm not a fan of the exposed driver look of the satellite speakers, much preferring the understated simple cubes with grill cloth of the Altecs. I also prefer the ivory color of the Altecs over the black and silver of the Logitechs. The remote-control pod seems largely unnecessary. It has a power button that turns the speakers on and off and a small green LED to indicate power status, but I can't see why I would use it. The pod also has a diminutive volume wheel, but I can't imagine using that either, since I control audio volume from the roller on my Logitech G910 keyboard. I just set the speaker control pod wheel to MAX and leave it there. Previously, I used a third-party (Radio Shack, I think) output pod that extended the speaker out and mic in from the back of my PC to a convenient location under the front edge of my desk; this was a simple little pod about the same size as the control pod for these Logitech speakers, but it provided remote headphone and mic plugs as well as a simple A-B button to toggle between them. The new Logitech control pod doesn't work that way. The power button toggles the power on and off for the speakers, but the headphone plug serves to mute the speakers whenever headphone or earbuds are plugged in anyway, even with the speakers remaining powered. I like to leave my headphones plugged in all the time, preferring the A-B switch of the old Radio Shack pod to select between speakers and headphones. With the Logitech pod, you can't leave your headphones plugged in without it causing the speakers to mute. The issue for me is wear and tear on the headphone plug. I switch back and forth between speakers (when I am alone) and headphones 2 or three times a day...that's a lot of cycles of insertion/removal for that plug. I doubt it's going to hold up for twenty years to compare with the Altec Lansings. We'll see how it goes. With my previous setup, the third-party A-B switch didn't matter. It was less than $10 and could easily be replaced anytime. The control pod on these new Logitechs is hardwired into the subwoofer (which also contains the power supply.) I guess all good things must end, and the Altec Lansing ACS45.2 were VERY good things! I didn't measure the cables, but they're plenty long enough to reach from the PC case (which sits on my desk behind my monitor) to both the subwoofer on the floor under the desk, and for plenty of separation between right and left satellite speakers on the desktop on either side of my 34\" Ultrawide monitor. The wire to the control pod reaches from the back of the subwoofer on the floor against the wall to the front edge of the underside of my desk, where I mounted it with gel tape so I can easily access the headphone plug.",

My only advice is to make sure you push the jack in all the way when connecting the speakers to the sub. It will feel like it doesn't fit at first, but push a little harder until it locks into place.",

                "reviewText": "I just set up these speakers and had to write a review because they are such a good value. These speakers are amazing for the price. I was a little nervous about what I would get for $29. My other computers have Bose Companion speakers but I did not want to spend $100 on speakers for a laptop computer I keep in my hobby room just for occasional reference and background music. Keep in mind, I do not expect performance like I get from my primary stereo with big Klipsch Heresy speakers and a lot of power but for office or laptop speakers these are great. The sound is crisp and clear and I can hear little nuances that I expected to be muddy on these inexpensive speakers. I do not consider myself an audiophile but I do know what sounds good and these do. My sub-woofer is not boomy like some reviewers have mentioned. I put it right beside my 2nd monitor rather than on the floor and it sounds great. All components have long cords and the remote power/volume with headphone jack is a very nice feature that I put right above my mouse pad. Right now I am listening to some jazz guitar on Pandora and I can't believe how good it sounds. I set the volume on my laptop at 50% and use the remote to control my listening volume. At that setting it will play louder than I can get away with if my wife is home. At high volumes, the sound stays clear, the speakers do not buzz, the bass stays balanced and I do not hear any clipping on the high notes. I really can't believe that these speakers only cost $29. Neil Young's Southern Man just started playing and the snare is coming through very clean behind the piano and lead guitar. You usually get what you pay for these days but with these speakers you are getting a sound quality that would compare to speakers for 3 to 4 times the price. Granted every environment produces different sound. I have my speakers about 2 feet away from me to the left and the right on a built-in desk and a wall right behind them so I am probably getting some reflected sound. The subwoofer is sitting just inside the right speaker. For kicks, I just put on some vintage disco stuff on Pandora and the bass still sounds good and at the right level and the balance is good here too. I am not using any equalizer software and just plugged the input jack into my headphone jack and starting testing different types of songs. These speakers seem very versatile since they sound good on a broad range of genres that I tested. I don't write many reviews on Amazon but thought this one was worth my time to tell people about a great value. By the way, Let It Whip by Dazz Band still sounds good after all these years on these little speakers, the intro on BTO's Let It Ride still rocks and the Gypsy Kings guitars sound great too. I know, now I 'm really letting my age show. If you are on a tight budget or just don't want to spend more than you have to, these are a great option and I think you will be happy with them. My wife says the speakers are too loud and I have to come to bed now. Good night.",

                "reviewText": "My sweet old Rockville powered near-field speakers died the other day :( I was looking for a temporary solution for gaming I could afford on my pension and after looking around I bumped into these.For$60 and delivered in one day I thought I'd take a chance after I read a bunch of reviews on the net. Most common complaint seemed to be that they don't tend to last very long. AND they are non-returnable to Amazon unless they don't work. So I bought the warranty - I'll get at least one new set or a refund.The biggest pain was getting rid of all the plastic wrap used on the wiring. Once I navigated through that, setting them up only took a couple minutes.I am a bit of an audiophile but now that I am retired and living in a one bedroom apartment I can't afford the sound I'm used to . . . unless I want to get evicted. The standard sound is boomy, badly lacking in midrange and the high-end is weak. But they cost $60, after all. I've spent that on three feet of speaker wire in the past.What I wasn't expecting was the reasonably low distortion at moderate to low levels. Using my Asus Connexant HD audio and installing a Win10 equalizer (Viper4Win freeware), with a little tweaking that included backing down on mid-bass, boosting the midrange a fair bit and a bump to the high-end, the sound is a LOT better than than it should be for the price.For now.I did see some reviews from people who have owned a set for over a year who were still happy. I'm guessing that as long as you don't push these beyond their capabilities you may get decent life out of them.Again, they cost $60!!!If you get a set that works for awhile, these are hard to beat - especially if you need a small foot-print. I've got to put the subwoofer on the floor but I'm sure if you put the sub on a desktop and use an EQ to tweak them, the boom would subside.For the price and noted reservations, these are RECOMMENDED",
