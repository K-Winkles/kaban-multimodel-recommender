                "reviewText": "You're looking at a pair of $16 speakers for a reason, right? Maybe you have a small room. Maybe you have a smaller budget. Maybe you want to try something out before committing to a larger investment. Maybe this is a component that complements you current audio setup. In any case, you're reading the reviews because you have one question in your head: Can a pair of $16 speakers possibly be any good?The answer is yes. These little speakers perform remarkably well for the price. And in some cases, you may even be able to remove the caveat \"for the price.\"I bought these to upgrade my home office. Listening to music through my Amazon Basics computer speakers just wasn't the experience I wanted. But for the smallish room (maybe 12' by 12'), I also didn't need something that was going to blow me out the window. I already have two turntable setups, and I didn't want to invest in a third system. The price tag, as well as the quick shipping, sealed the deal for me.I have them connected to a Pioneer receiver I had lying around after an upgrade a few years ago. I added a (very old) center speaker, mostly because why not? Honestly, these 3\" speakers do most of the lifting. I was surprised by how loud they can be. And while you certainly wouldn't expect a lot of bass with these, they still hold their own. I listen to a lot of fuzzy, low-end riffs, and these speakers performed much better than my computer speakers.I like that I can still keep these even if I upgrade my system. They're small an inexpensive enough to move to a garage or other exposed space. If you're like me, you have a box of old AV stuff somewhere (noteworthy - these don't come with speaker wire) - you can toss these speakers in and use them in your front yard for Halloween or give them to your niece when she goes off to college. The cost, size, and versatility mean you're not overcommitting yourself.I'm in that narrow space where I'm not an audiophile, but I'm still picky about audio quality. These get the job done for me.",

                "reviewText": "The bad: they're a bit hard to drive, I have them sourced from pre-amp out from a Marantz slim receiver (the output voltage is a bit low in these, maybe 2 volts) into an Aiyima A07 Max class d amp with the supplied 36v 6a power supply, which powers the Pyles. It's basically a pieced-together quadraphonic system, and I have the Pyles in the room's corner facing upward. (The Marantz doesn't run four channels very well.) That said, even with the low input voltage into the Aiyima, it should still be pushing 50ish+ watts.Their lack of low end makes the sweet spot of their response right in the range of the human voice, which definitely helps me hear dialog in movies. It's an affordable trick that makes the sound more atmospheric, and the speakers' small size makes them unobtrusive.For this specific use case, I like them. I wish they were a bit more efficient, but I imagine a more powerful surround receiver could get more out of them than a class d amp. Or . . . my setup with a preamp out that's more like 4 or 5 volts would probably solve the issue with driving them. These things are not standardized as much as you might think.",

                "reviewText": "These speakers are odd to say the least. Out of the box they looked fine, sound was as expected from a 3 inch speaker. BUT after I turned them up a bit I'll start to hear a small chuffing sound coming from the back. These speakers are supposedly sealed tight but after a closer inspection the solder joints of the speaker terminals on the back were not sealed with a gasket but rather just plastic on plastic sealed. Took the speaker out of the speaker housing and dripped hot glue down over the terminals to seal them. The spring loaded clip on the back also leaks air so I ended up just removing that entirely and hot glueing it in as it wasnt needed for my purposes anyway. On one of the two speakers the dust cap was partially removed and was rattling when playing but I put some super glue around it and it sealed up. Now to the sound quality after sealing it up correctly - Sounds pretty good all things considered. They can get surprisingly loud with no distortion and have great imaging across the board. If tuned right they can push a small and I mean SMALL amount of low-end. They will throw a little more low-end then you'd expect from a sealed 3 inch but again don't expect immersive bass. I don't know if i'd suggest these for audiophiles but then again I think if you pair them with something more bass heavy that these will help bring more clarity out. I have these paired with the Micca RB42'S and I hate to admit it but combined they sound really good, especially on a desk. Still gave these 5 stars just because they are cheaper but with a little glue and time they sound pretty good for (what I paid at the time) $16.",
