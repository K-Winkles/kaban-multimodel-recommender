                "reviewText": "I bought right before COVID a years back and I've never considered getting a new speaker since. I've thrown the speaker in pools, lakes, the ocean, and dropped it many times. It is indeed waterproof and for all you people out there wondering, it does somewhat float (to a certain extent), just dont expect the speaker to continuously play if you submerge it underwater. Despite my abuse, it is powerful and has amazing bass and treble, but sometimes the mid high notes gets drowned out when you crank up the bass.The app associated with JBL is hot garbage and keep in mind that only certain speakers within JBL can connect to it if you were considering a multi speaker setup. Some JBL speakers for some reason have an entirely different system.Battery life has been AMAZING to say the least. If I had to guess after like 4 years it still has about 18Hrs worth.I dont use this feature alot but it also has an extra port for charging things which has save me a few times and can charge your phone fully while still able to crank out 2-4 hours of music.Overall one of the best purchases I've every made.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced my Marshall Bluetooth speaker with this. I chose the Charge 4 over the Charge 5 because it included an analog input (never phase out the 3.5mm jack). Big & heavy, loud & clear, good battery life. I don't use this to charge my phone often but good know I have an emergency backup battery bank.At full volume the battery will drain even with it plugged into a charger. Current draw likely exceeds charging current.Connectivity is faster than any device I own. As long as the Bluetooth is on in my phone, the speaker connect less than 1 second after playing its power-on jingle.Audio quality is not impressive, but it's not bad either. Bass is great for a portable speaker, clear & bouncy, but the high end sounds like there's a blanket over it, lacking clarity. At close distance you can tell high frequency detail is missing, but in general, music played fills the room well.In comparison the Marshall speaker I had played high frequencies super clear, 'CD quality' clear, but the bass was flappy & farty. Given a choice I prefer the Charge 4's bass clarity.I bought a rubber case for it, allowing me to throw it around in the car or move it around in my backpack with more confidence. If you choose Black, the cloth covering will attract dust, hair, and grease.",

                "reviewText": "Initially, my preference was the Bose Soundlink Mini II with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in a small transportable package; that is, until I heard comparison against a JBL Charge 4 on YouTube. Based on that review and others, I purchased this speaker for its waterproof, multi-connect and sound.Great price: You can buy a Charge 3 direct from JBL for $129 with 12 color options, with price point being on par with Amazon.Sounds great; EXCELLENT better describes it. If you have a Charge 3 there isn't enough improvement to justify buying a Charge 4. The Charge 4 went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from 65Hz to a deeper 60Hz. When the JBL arrived we conducted our own comparison against a Bose Soundlink Mini II and - Wow. The Charge 4 is much clearer, has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room. It's a bit larger and heavier than the Soundlink Mini II which might turn some off, but to me; if I'm going to carry any speaker like this then I'm taking the same care and am sure I can find just a little more room.Good packaging but NO INSTRUCTIONS?! Not that charging and setup are all that difficult, but this is my first device that requires USB C, first anything that arrived with ZERO printed information, and rechargeable device that arrived with ZERO anything to charge it with. /// Setup was easy. I bought a USB C cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for 3 hours since it came somewhat charged already. Once charged, press the Bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device. For settings, I always recommend phone volume to be no more than 1/2 to 3/4 volume then using the Charge 4 volume from there. This affords you plenty of up/down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn't task the internal sound processor....this, since it's cheaper to replace/repair a Charge 4 than an expensive smartphone. You and someone else can be Bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time.Battery Life: The built-in rechargeable Li-ion 7500mAH battery is strong. Not only does it support up to 20 hours of playtime (at lowest setting, and figure 10 hours at half volume), but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the USB port. I strongly suggest buying a protective case for it which will hold your charger, USB C charging cable AND any spare USB cable needed for cell phones.It has the same IPX7 waterproof as a iPhone, Samsung or other higher end smartphone. We place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills, big splashes, being left in the rain, or even an accidental swim in the pool. Having that peace of mind alone is priceless.JBL Connect+: With Connect+ you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience. Put 4 in opposing corners of a large room, in different rooms, indoor and outdoors...heck, even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap.Bottom line - this being my FIRST Bluetooth speaker ever, and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have, I have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs. Bang for buck is spot on. I have excellent sound in a transportable package in a wireless speaker that is rugged, waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect. I now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials, events and private enjoyment. WIN!",

Definitely a strong speaker for its price, sound quality is good, high tones and low tones - no regret for purchasing. I wish it had RGB lights because mentally I\u2019m a child at times, but this seems to be equally as reliable and quality of a product as I was suggested that it was. The battery also is impressive - I mainly use it for sounds to sleep, so it\u2019s on all night for multiple nights in a row before ever needing to think of charging. Giving 5 stars for its price point.Side note: the Green variant is a nice tone, not too bold, not too light.",
