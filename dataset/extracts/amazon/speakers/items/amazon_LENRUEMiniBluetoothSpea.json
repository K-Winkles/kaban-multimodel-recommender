                "reviewText": "Update: 2/8/24. it has a very short battery life & the rudest noise that it makes when the battery is running tho. As noted in my review below, I use these speakers under my pillow on an hour timer on my iPhone. It lasted about 3 hours; I\u2019m guessing. My many previous speakers, lasted days longer b4 a charge was needed. However recharging often is not the problem. My other speakers just quit quietly, which is a much preferred notice than the horrendous screeching sound that I got from this one. I could not comprehend what was happening at first. I will keep this one & will probably order another for that unbelievable good price. This is just a WARNING, so be prepared. I can\u2019t believe no one even thought to mention this in all the reviews\u203c\ufe0fFor once in my life, & I have been around a pretty long time, I\u2019m speechless as to how I was able to find a speaker at such an unbelievably good price & it actually works\u2049\ufe0f it\u2019s cute & little & it took me a little longer to sync because I couldn\u2019t find the instructions. Tho I have been thru \u201cmannnny\u201d of these little speakers at different price points, I was amazed. I Have been sleeping with little speakers under my pillow for many years & this one worked great. I\u2019ve had little speakers at 3 times more than this that didn\u2019t even sync & I was stuck with it because it was a backup for another speaker; Exactly the same type.. So all I can say at this point is wow! How do you do it & with free prime shipping\u2049\ufe0f thank you,\u203c\ufe0fI\u2019ll update on how long it actually lasts; From 2-5-24 till \u2049\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17",

However, for the size, the sound is quite clear and loud. Pairing it with my phone over Bluetooth was no hassle. The battery life is quite good as I've only had to charge it once thus far. One of the sides shows the internal circuit boards which is just a nice cool touch. If you're on the look out for some cheap, tiny speakers, I'd highly recommend getting this one.",

                "reviewText": "This is actually a VERY nice sounding little Bluetooth portable speaker that has FAR bigger sound than what you would expect for it's really small size. It has a small, round active driver on the front of it and what appears to likely be an oblong passive radiator on the back to help all additional low-frequency response. All in all, the sound comes out great and you would be easily fooled into thinking that it was coming from a much larger speaker. There is a clearly plastic/Lucite cover on the top of the speaker that shows the mainboard for the device. Although this isn't really necessary, if you are the techie type it's really nice to be able to see the \"motherboard\" for the device through the top of the case. According to the specs, this device is running on the latest 5.3 version of the Bluetooth standard, which is nice. You can buy a second one and have the devices present a stereo sound if you like. If you are looking for a REALLY small portable Bluetooth speaker with a USB-C charging port and a micro-SD/TF card slot (for 32GB or smaller cards, MP3 and WAV file formats supported), this is certainly one worth considering. It's really small so it certainly can't get incredibly loud, but it puts out more than enough volume for personal listening in an average sized room. Highly recommended. Great little speaker!",

                "reviewText": "This speaker is so tiny! Its like a 2.5\" cube! The exterior is a clear plastic so you can see the chips inside which gives it a very sophisticated look. Its size makes it extremely portable. Its only weakness in durability is the exposed speaker cones. Those in general react badly to being mishandled so keeping the box for transport is a good idea. I actually just 3D printed a travel case.The speaker gives crisp highs and surprisingly rumbly lows. You are not going to blast it and shake any windows, but it is perfectly good for listening to music in my office or in a conference room. I listened to an amazing sounding metal album and a surprisingly crisp punk album. Classical is absolutely beautiful. Surprisingly the only mushiness i heard was on some mids from a Mazzy Star album... Not sure what happened there.Battery life is very good. It lasts many hours before needing a charge. i do want to grumble about the led light here. Its blue for pairing and red for charging. But nothing for when it is done charging. It'd be nice if it was green when full or even flashing while charging and solid when full. But this is a cranky complaint for something that works as well as it does.i would definitely recommend buying it.",
