                "reviewText": "I bought this soundbar for my 40 something inch Vizio TV that I use in my living room. This TV in particular seems to have speakers only on the back of the TV which means even with the TV sound turned all the way up the sound quality was terrible and I could barely hear a thing! It sounded like my TV was in a box! It was absolutely neccessary for me to purchase a soundbar.I wanted a nice middle of the road soundbar that would give me a good listening experience but that wasn't some big investment and I did a bit of research on them before ultimately deciding just to give this one a try. It came quickly and was packed very well. It was actually quite a bit of work to get it out of its manufacturing package.I was able to mount it below my TV that is on a rolling TV stand and place the subwoofer in the back of the room on the floor in a stationary place. The soundbar is the perfect size for my 40 something inch tv and has a great sleek look. It seems to be made very well and is comparable to any other soundbar I've ever seen in person.The subwoofer is also not too big or too small and it's not very noticeable at all sitting on the floor in the back of my room. It's very reasonably sized and blends in well. The only thing I don't like about the subwoofer is that the power cord plugs into the front of the subwoofer which looks pretty dumb.The remote it comes with works well. The soundbar is easy to figure out and use and the sound quality so far has been great. It really changes my whole experience when watching my TV. It makes me feel like I'm in a movie theatre.Being that this soundbar was very reasonably priced, is of great quality and has great sound I am 100% happy with my choice to purchase this specific soundbar and I think anyone else would be as well.",

                "reviewText": "This an excellent system for most people's dens, especially if you're at the \"advanced\" age where/when you've downsized. It works great with my 56\" flat screen TV, small by today's standards. Before this I had a system with a front speaker, 4 surrounds, and a big woofer. That was in a much bigger room. For 95% of people this system will be all you need or want. It sounds great with Fast and Furious and other action type movies.Very easy to set up, even for a guy who's well over 70 years old; much easier than my old system. Basically, plug and play. Blue tooth connectivity is great. No complaints so far, but it's only a week old.",

                "reviewText": "Setup was as easy as plugging it into the TV and I was up and running. The sound is fantastic and fills up the whole room.The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the volume adjustment delay. When turning the volume up or down, there's easily a 3-5 second delay before the unit responds which usually results in overcompensating on the volume setting. Overall great for the cost.",

                "reviewText": "Honestamente no tenia una alta expectativa de este producto, ya que su precio es bastante bajo a comparaci\u00f3n de otros productos en el mercado. Y puedo decir que estoy m\u00e1s que satisfecho con la compra. Cuenta con un sonido bastante bueno, no se distorsiona y los bajos se escuchan muy bien. Yo este producto lo compre pensando en usarlo para ver pel\u00edculas y series, y hasta el momento me hace sentir como si estuviera en un cine.El paquete incluye 1 barra de sonido, 1 subwoofer y 2 bocinas surround. Adem\u00e1s, trae consigo un cable de sonido optico, un cable de HDMI/ARC, sus respectivos cables para conectar las bocinas surround al subwoofer, que dicho sea de paso cuentan con un gran largo en tama\u00f1o, trae un cable para conectar la barra de sonido a luz y uno para conectar el subwoofer a luz, adem\u00e1s de un control y dos pilas AA.Uno de los puntos que me encantaron es que el subwoofer es inal\u00e1mbrico, por lo que no tienes que preocuparte por tener demasiados cables recorriendo tu habitaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s el control tiene una mini pantalla LCD para ver la acci\u00f3n que estas realizando.La barra de sonido cuenta con una entrada de sonido optico, una entrada HDMI/ARC, una entrada de cable Auxiliar, y otra de Auxiliar/VX, en la cual puedes conectar tu echo dot para utilizar con el teatro en casa, asi como una entrada de USB para poder reproducir m\u00fasica desde esta. Otro detalle importante es que cuenta con Bluetooth y para conectarlo es bastante sencillo. La barra cuenta tambi\u00e9n con una tira de leds las cuales te indican el sonido que la barra tiene al subir o bajar volumen, entre otros indicadores.La instalaci\u00f3n es bastante sencilla y r\u00e1pida.En conclusi\u00f3n, este sonido no le pide nada a productos de mayor precio o marcas reconocidas, por el precio puedes encontrar una gran calidad.ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N: Despu\u00e9s de un mes de uso sigo muy satisfecho con el producto, he probado las distintas configuraciones de sonido y todas son excelentes. El \u00fanico detalle viene el el Subwoofer, ya que en ocasiones se puede escuchar un tipo de ruido en este, pero no es algo molesto.",
