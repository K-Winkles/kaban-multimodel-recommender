                "reviewText": "I am typically a headphones person when it comes to Teams or other types of conference calls, however I recently went from a more open office situation where it was headphones or bust to a more traditional office where I can take calls out loud. The reason for my purchase is that I did not like the quality of the speakers on my laptop and wanted the sound to come from the monitor with the people on it (setup is laptop and two monitors and I put my meetings on one of the monitors).This device solved for my issue very nicely. The sound quality for conference calls is excellent. It is probably fine for office volume music as well, though I have not used it for this. I am able to hear and be heard from any where in my fairly large office space. Furthermore, the design of the device itself is thoughtful, with touch sensitive buttons on the front and the ability to wrap and hide any extra cord. Speaking of cords, there is only one USB C cable which provides power and audio (there is a built in USB A adapter if needed). I didn't think I would use it, but it turns out I like the mute button on the device over using my keyboard or mouse. The Teams button is not super useful, but I get it. When you get a noti that you have a call coming in or a meeting starting, you can push it and it will bring up the join call screen and make it your active window. It gets more useful as you get used to it, and it was a wonky experience at first. Obviously, I recommend this product.",

The MS Teams buttons make it simple to use for volume, mute and end call control.For listening to music, it is adequate. For it's size it sounds pretty good, but the bass is a bit weak. For background music it is just fine.The simple USB connection is very nice. No extra power cord, no worrying about charging or over-charging batteries, no messing with BT. One simple connection and simple controls. The USB A or USB C connection basically means it will connect to anything.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a speaker for my telework. I use Teams as one of my main tools. I had purchased the Microsoft Teams ready speaker thinking it would be my best option. I set it up and it worked fine but when I reconnected my Dell work laptop after needing to take it somewhere, it didn't work right (volume control wasn't right, etc.). So I went ahead and spent more money to buy this one and it has worked like a charm. The sound is better and it responds just as it should. I wish I would have just bought this one to begin with.",

                "reviewText": "My speaker stopped working after 1 week. May have just been a bad unit as Dell makes good stuff. The noise cancellation is pretty good but you have to adjust your settings in teams, zoom and Skype or you will get some artifacts from the microphone. The buttons are really sensitive and need to be careful as I accidentally bumped it and it disconnected a call. It's a good speaker but for 80 there are more affordable options. It also has no Bluetooth which would be nice to pair with my phone",
