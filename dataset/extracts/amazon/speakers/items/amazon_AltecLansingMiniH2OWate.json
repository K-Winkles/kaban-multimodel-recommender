                "reviewText": "I've had this little speaker for over a year now and it's still going strong. It is amazing! I use it at my hot tub. It lasts at least a week (use it maybe 3x a week for several hours at a time) before needing a charge. When it is about to die the blue light starts flashing and it beeps regularly. I can keep my phone in the house (maybe 10 ft away thru cement walls?) and it stays connected and I can even use it for phone calls (sim to speaker phone) I like that I can move the radio to random spots as I need it. Volume is great (put the volume up to a good level on your phone then you can adjust within a margin on the speaker with the arrow buttons). Speaker is loud enough and sound is good for me to hear over the jets but not blasting the neighbors (but I probably could make it do that to a point if I wanted). If you are looking for 'awesome stereo sound' then maybe it's not for you (be reasonable - the thing is tiny). But I think it's good and I listen to music and books while in the tub and several friends have been surprised at how good it sounds especially considering the size. (sounds good with books read by male or female voice - the 'tone' range is equal)My favorite story tho I want to share..... 2 days ago I wasn't paying attention when I put the cover on my tub and I knocked the radio into the water. I found it there floating in the water over 24 hrs later. I was devastated but had to try it.... This little radio started right up and only had a few minutes of 'tingy' sound then it returned to normal. I am stunned. the charging port is covered by a rubber cover that you have to press to make sure it's sealed (super easy to do). I'm sure because I had sealed this cover, the radio survived hot water dunking for over 24 hrs.I'm not sure this radio would work for something like a backyard party or be good for yard work when you are walking around and don't have the radio right next to you at all times. But. If you want it at your bedside, or in the shower/bathtub, or at a pool/hot tub.....this radio would be perfect. SUPER waterproof. Totally worth the price. Easy to align to your phone. No issues at all with wifi. long battery. I love this speaker!!!!",

                "reviewText": "This is a well designed, solid, very portable speaker. If you can catch one on sale, get it. The carabiner is a nice plus. Fairly water resistant, pretty resistant to being dropped, very small and decent battery life. The sound is good for a speaker this small, but do not expect great bass or depth. The speakers are just too small. But the music is very listenable with the speaker close by. Where it excels is for mid-range things like podcasts, as an external speaker for your laptop or phone, movies (sans bass), and so on.I have a nice Chromebook, but the speakers are too low volume. This mini speaker solves that problem well. Same for my phone. The sound is clear and very decent all things considered. Just be realistic in your expectations.It's also very solid and easy to operate. The bluetooth works very well. It connects in just a few seconds usually and does not disconnect too quickly if you have paused your music or whatever as some speakers do. It's plenty loud if you keep it close. It will NOT fill a room with sound. but one should not expect a speaker this small to do that. The voice when it turns on/off does not bother me that much as it is not painfully loud, but might annoy some. The controls (on top, from left to right: on/off, volume down, volume up) are a bit hard to see, but a minor issue as you quickly know them by position.Overall, this does exactly what you want from a speaker this size. I am very satisfied with mine.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:After a couple of months this has become my go-to little speaker. For the shower and for bike rides and trips to the dog run. It\u2019s a great shape to hold and the buttons work just right. It is loud enough and sounds good. The bass is ok but anything really deep will sound muffled and make the whole thing shake.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Needed a new little speaker for the shower and this seemed like a nice one - and it is. Sounds pretty good, a little distortion on the bass at high volumes but it's basically for podcasts and news and what not, so no biggie. Also, it's about the size of a deck of cards so it's actually pretty impressive. What is annoying is that there is no AUX port, even though it says there should be one on the product page. Ultimately I guess it's not a huge deal and I'll just use a different speaker for a physical connection, but I find it annoying because I called Altec Lansing and they confirmed they removed the port on the newer models but have not updated the page. SO, if you are hoping to use it with the AUX port you should beware. Otherwise it's good - the volume buttons are the +- with quick taps, and they FF/REW with long presses. It does have a microphone and takes calls - so at least they left that in. Despite being a \"new model\" it still has an older version of bluetooth because you can only pair one device at a time. So, if you want to switch devices you need to disconnect the first device before it will pair with another. Oldschool and less than cool. But, as I said it's a tiny and very rugged seeming speaker so I can live with limited functionality.",

                "reviewText": "Altec Lansing makes quality stuff. This little guy is no exception. He has great stereo sound that is acquired from Bluetooth connection to your cell phone, mp3 player, laptop, whatever. It's a quality little speaker.Don't expect loud volume, though. It's small and has limitations on volume. It's perfectly capable of filling a room with music, podcast, or audiobook with excellent sound at a reasonable volume, but don't expect a loud rock concert out of it.Also worth mentioning is that it's wrapped in rubber that makes it bounce not break. Helpful for those who are rough on their toys. This one is a little harder to break.",
