I have mine connected to my work laptop via USB-C, to take advantage of the extra sound power offered when connected over usb-c. Tested them with some YT videos and some songs and was blown away with the sound quality! Though this isn't the most bass heavy speaker unit, it does provide enough bass to make everything sound good! I mainly use them when watching videos so I'm not too worried about it not having desk shaking bass. Theae speakers don't sound like a tincan and they get quite loud. So far, this speaker has fit my needs perfectly and done so quite well. Doesn't feel or sound cheap and works exactly as described. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "This is a little USB speaker that is both powered and driven by USB. It appears as a USB audio output device on Mac, Windows and Linux. A single cable is all that is needed, which is essential for a clean look when mounted to the bottom of a monitor.The speaker is relatively small and light, which are essential when mounting to a monitor, particularly when the monitor is on an articulating arm. We don't want to add excessive weight on such a setup.Despite its diminutive size and weight, the speaker performs superbly well. The sound is rich, balanced and powerful compared to other products in its class that I have tried...and shelved because of their lackluster performance. This speaker is a little gem that belies its outward appearance.If you want to save desk space, have a clean look with a single cable, and don't want to compromise audio performance then give this thing a try!",

                "reviewText": "I have not tried the Bluetooth usage. I thought this was Stereo (It said it was on the listing), but found that I do not get a right channel out of it. Tested on multiple systems.I bought this for better sound on my monitor that I have connected to my bedstand. Sound is better than the monitor sound, deeper and fuller sound profile... but only on the left channel. No right sound at all.I have tested this on windows 10 and 11 on three different machines, just to see if it was a machine issue.I am not sure if this is a recent thing, or if it came this way, as most of the stuff I listen to with it does not really have a stereo need so did not notice it until I had something that used both channels independently. Surprise, could not hear right side.Pros:- Mono sound is good, deep and fuller sound than most default monitor sounds- Good volumeCons:- Only plays left side sound- Monitor grip is a little long for the top of the two monitors I have tried it on, so I have to lift it off a bit to stop it from occluding the screen, which makes it fall off every now and again and swing from the back of the monitor (I have it anchored at the back)",

                "reviewText": "For my Switch, I use a monitor that doesn't have a speaker, and so I bought this just for my Switch. I connect via USB, but got the BT version of this speaker since it was only 5 bucks more to have the expanded utility should I ever want it.It's easy to set up, stays put when clamped to the monitor, and the sound quality is quite good for a 30 dollar USB/Bluetooth speaker. However, I have two major gripes:1. The LED lights are large (compared to what I see on similar electronics), bright, and can't be turned off without disconnecting the speaker. I use a product called light dims blackout edition (you can buy them on Amazon for cheap, they're very useful beyond this product!) to block this LED so it's not an actual issue for me, but it's notable as an issue that you can't dim or disable the LED.2. There is a voice alert that says, I believe, \"PC connected.\" when it senses it has received a connection. I have never paired anything to it with Bluetooth, only USB. I can *maybe* understand this voice alert for wireless connection, but it's pointless with a wired connection, I know when it's connected, I plugged it in! This is an issue because, for some reason, this will occasionally sound \"PC connected\" when my Switch is in sleep mode. I suspect perhaps this has something to do with the Switch semi-waking to check for system/software updates or something, but it was quite the surprise when it sounded out in the middle of the night! I checked the (ahaha right as I'm typing this, with my Switch sleeping, it said it!) paperwork that came with the speaker and can find no way to turn this alert off. It happens a few times a day. This will likely cause me to return it, since I don't want it randomly making noise in my bedroom.",
