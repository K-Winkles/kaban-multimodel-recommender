                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using the iF012 for a month now and so far it has been great. I\u2019ve used it mostly in the shower, where it has been easy to control and puts out very respectable sound for a small waterproof Bluetooth speaker. Worth noting that it has connected both flawlessly and extremely quickly (typically in 1-2 seconds) every time I\u2019ve used it. One very small quirk to note - for me, the speaker often starts out at a volume that differs from what my phone is set to (often much louder). It\u2019s not an issue at all, as raising or lowering the volume a notch on my phone after pairing resets the volume to the desired level immediately. Just something for buyers to be aware of (it made me jump the first few times I pressed play and wasn\u2019t ready for it).The highlight so far though was on a recent camping trip, where we rented a boat for the day. Fortunately, I thought to bring the speaker along to have some waterproof music. The boat actually had a built-in sound system but it wasn\u2019t working, so the speaker came in super handy. It performed surprisingly well, keeping us all entertained - even as a rainstorm moved in and pelted us for a solid hour.Waterproof, check. Loud, check. Small and easy to pack, check. Long battery life (even at max volume), check. Well worth the investment.",

                "reviewText": "Second Edit: I wanted this edit at the top of the review. First unit had a problem, the seller contacted me and quickly replaced the one that wouldn't hold a charge (original, and somewhat irrelevant, review below). They explained that this was a rarity and I'm inclined to believe them because now the darned thing won't stop working. I waited to make this edit because I wanted to go through a few charge cycles and comment on how many minutes (hours?) of use I got from the speaker. Well, I've lost track. I usually listen to the speaker while I get ready for work, so 20 to 30 minutes a day, and I haven't had to recharge the speaker for a few weeks at least. The sound is really good for my needs, news or audio books. I don't know how a music lover would rate it. I did answer a phone call once when my wife called me from out of town. She was unable to tell I was in the shower with the water running but said I was easy to hear, as was she. The buttons are easy to use and clearly marked so even someone with \"old eyes\" can use the speaker easily. In all, I think this is a great little speaker and the seller really takes their business seriously.I liked this product well enough at the start, but after recharging it for the third time it will not play for longer than 10 to 15 minutes. I replaced a similar item with this iFox Bluetooth Shower Speaker. The speaker I replaced was very similar in form and function, except that the previous speaker was 5W output and this speaker is 3W output. The volume was less, but it was okay for my needs, which are listening to news, weather, and audio books in the mornings. I figured if the volume was enough, then the battery would just last longer between charges. My previous speaker would last about a week of getting ready in the morning, say 30 minutes a day, between charges. The first time I charged this speaker it only lasted 3 days and needed charging, I've read that sometimes Li batteries need to be charged a few times before they really hit their stride, so I wasn't overly concerned when I had to recharge it so soon. Sure enough, after that second charging the speaker lasted for over two weeks. Unfortunately, after the third recharge it only lasted two days. Now after 4 or five recharges it lasts about 10 minutes. The return period was only 30 days, but it took just slightly longer than that to realize the defect was permanent. My last speaker was very similar and lasted for just over three and a half years before the battery finally gave out, but it is no longer available. Based on my experience, I can't recommend this product.Edit:The above was my original review of the speaker. Almost immediately after posting the review, on a Sunday afternoon, the company reached out to me concerning this product. I added two stars for this effort since I consider customer support to be a major selling point for any product, and this company seems to really care about their reputation. Once I have a chance to use try the product again, I will add another edit summarizing my experience. Hopefully my next review will be five stars.",

                "reviewText": "With over 20k sold it caught my attention. My desire is to have a safe waterproof, spacer-saver speaker for the bathroom. I read several reviews of this product. Many in favor a small amount of reviews not so much. Nevertheless, here\u2019s mines. First I just received this today (as of this post) it was delivered sooner than I expected. Packaged arrived nicely and secured. Next: Included is a charging cable. It does not include a charging block. Connection: I followed the instructions as directed. The speaker performing nicely right out of the box. Pairing was effortlessly. Held the power button for 3 seconds, heard the pairing indicator and the Bluetooth linked to my cell right away. There\u2019s an option to manually activate it if it doesn\u2019t pair automatically. The size is just right and light weight! The volume is clear and I have no issues answering the cell phone or playing music from my cell. I tested it from a 1000 sq ft away and the speaker volume was clear and crisp. I am not using the suction but I tried it and it works. For those who said it doesn\u2019t work they may not have cleaned the surface, used an cleaning product that prevents suction, or the surface texture might be preventing the speaker from holding/sticking, or the suction is actually faulty. At any rate I read the seller is help if needing a replacement. Right now this device will be stationary and not used directly near water, so the durability should hold up. The waterproof options for me is to protect from the steam when showering. This device comes with a 1 year limited warranty. There is a QR code that will guide you in registering. If need it I\u2019ll update my review in the coming weeks or months should my satisfaction with this product change. P.S. This is not compatible with Alexa.",
