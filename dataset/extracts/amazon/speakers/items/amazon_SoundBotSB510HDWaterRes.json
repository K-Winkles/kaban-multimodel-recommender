Well I didn't think ours were either....because who would do that right?! 4 teenagers and 3 of them have done it we found out. Simple solution...speaker suctioned to the wall, bluetooth and jam away. Works great, excellent sound quality (has to be better than a phone IN the shower right?!). Only thing we have found is that bluetooth can get wonky so the previous user has to \"forget\" the device to make it functional for the next person. But thats no big deal.",

Anything that works without disturbance is good for me - and this fits that bill perfectly and maybe more. The suction is strong, at least on a glass panel where I've mounted it. The battery life seems to be good as well.One thing that surprised me was that it sends out a loud set of beeps if it reaches 20% battery level when switched on and no music us being played - it was very strange that it sounded like a smoke alarm at first and then when I traced the sound up to the bathroom, I found the source. I've actually come to appreciate this feature \ud83d\ude00",

                "reviewText": "I would say this speaker is not the best speaker, but it is still a very decent product. It's extremely easy to pair to a phone, and once you figure out how to adjust the volume on the speaker itself can get very loud.I am going to give this review a simple pros/cons so you can decide for yourself if it fits you.Pros)1) First pro I can give is once you stick it to the wall, it isn't going anywhere. I've had i suctioned to my wall for 3 months now without it falling or anything.2) It can get really loud, once you figure out how to actually adjust the volume, which is holding the right arrow until it beeps to signify max volume3) I don't use it an extreme amount, but the battery hasn't needed to be charged in the 3 months I've had since the initial charge.Cons)1) It uses a proprietary charging cable which is USB, so if you lose this cable, you may be in trouble finding one to charge your device with. I believe that it should had used the compliance of a micro usb cable like most devices use.2) It has virtually no bass, so if you listen to a lot of electronic music like me it can very flat.This is a basic device, and honestly its still a good bang for your buck, so I do highly recommend this over some of the more higher prices devices.That is why I give it 4/5 stars, as it does it job and it does it good, but due to the 2 cons, I knocked a star off.",

When it did work the sound quaility was pretty good given the price, but had I known it was not going to last more than 2 weeks I would have gone with a different brand.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is amazing! If you listen to audio on your phone this is a must-have. I bought this item with very low expectations, hoping maybe it could be useful as a shower radio. Upon ordering I was concerned about the quality and about the battery life. The idea of having to charge this thing on a regular basis did not appeal to me and the price seemed like there was a catch.This speaker is very well built, with an easy interface, and water resistant design.The speaker was loud and clear enough to listen to podcasts in the shower. You can even accept incoming calls on this thing. Though the call quality and volume were less than impressive, this was a feature that wasn't necessary to me. Turning it on and off is as easy as holding the power button, so I turn it off when I am not using and have yet to recharge the battery once. The battery life has impressed me. My favorite feature is the giant suction cup on the back. The suction cup is great, it works on so many surfaces. I would stick it to my shower wall, then pop it off and set it on my desk to do work, then pop it on the fridge when cooking, and finally stick it to a window outside to listen to music. Make sure to dampen the suction cup before applying for the best hold, though its rarely needed. I have used this product in so many more ways than I initially intended. \"Unbelievable\" is a word that is thrown around frequently in regards to pricing, but the quality and versatility of this product has left me stunned at how cheap it is selling for. This is one of those items that you think you don't need until you have it and use it ALL THE TIME. If you are a hardcore audiophile looking for a great speaker, there are plenty of more premium options that deliver a better sound experience. This is not an elite sound quality speaker, and I wouldn't purchase it if your looking to use it mainly for phone answering. If you are however looking for something to amplify your music when cooking/cleaning, or a versatile shower radio, or a highly portable speaker for outdoor activities, or a the easiest gift idea for anyone with functioning ears, then look no further. This is one of the best values on Amazon.",
