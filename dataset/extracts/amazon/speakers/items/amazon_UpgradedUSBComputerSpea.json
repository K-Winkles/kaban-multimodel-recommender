Q: Can I plug it into USB-Hub? A: Not recommended. The USB-hub has no enough power to drive our speaker, which may result-in cluttered, distorted or even constantly pops (audio cut-out) at high volume. Q: Is there a built-in microphone? A: No. There is no built-in mic, so it is recommended to use a separate computer microphone when having video calls.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Listen, this speaker isn't going to blow you away or do anything other than provide reasonable sound from a small footprint. I will say, the overall design and finish of the speaker is good. The sound quality, although not impressive by any means, sounds clean and clear and in that regard, works very well. If you are looking for a very simple audio source for listening to podcasts, audiobooks, or videos on the web, this will certainly get the job done. However, it most certainly would not be a great speaker for any kind of serious audio playback. In particular, I have a small form factor computer that does not have an internal speaker and this works perfectly for that. I plugged it in, windows 11 saw it immediately, and I selected it as an audio source. Sound is clean and free of any audible distortion.The touch buttons are responsive and since it is USB the volume increase and decrease actually control the audio levels on the computer so you don't have to fight with two different levels. The mute button works well, but does not actually software mute the computer (a good thing), just the speaker. It does indicate it is muted with a bright red light on the front. It also has some grippy feet on the bottom to keep it planted on a surface. Also, if it matters, there is no visible branding, which I very much appreciate.Now, the only real negatives I have are that USB cable is permanently attached. I would much prefer a removable cable just in case a longer length or different termination style is required. Upside is that you won't lose the cable. Also, and I know this is basically a $10 speaker (after current coupon as of this review) but a standard AUX input would also be appreciated. The only feature I might want would be adding a play / pause button with the other buttons to allow for a quick tap to control what you are listening to.Now, with all of that in mind, this is a very good little speaker that works very well for its intended use case. If you fit the criteria, don't shy away from giving it a shot.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. There\u2019s another reviewer who said this speaker is not gonna blow you away and I agree; but it got a great sound and I really like it with my computer. The instructions are pretty good. I thought you could just plug and play but for my computer I had to go into control panel into the sound file and enable it and disable my other speakers. I\u2019m using an older version of windows, so it may be different for you. I hope that helps cause it took me awhile get the sound working until I looked at the directions again; and the directions are pretty good.I give it five stars because of the price and the sound. I think it\u2019s pretty good for a laptop or desktop considering both. I do have a little bit better speakers hooked into my computer, but I would use this in a minute if something happened to those. I still can\u2019t believe what a nice sound coming out of this little box.I used no copyright and no attribution free music in the video so as not to infringe on anybody\u2019s copyrights. You can find that copyright music from no-copyright-music.com and I appreciate the author so generously granting the ability to show the quality sound from this nice speaker.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this and was excited to try it out.I plugged it into an USB port on the front of my computer leaving my larger 2.0 soundbar plugged into the 1/8 jack to see if they would both play at the same time so I could compare them together.Well, these overroad the other speakers because of using the USB port so they didn't play at the same time; thusly, I had to unplug my old speakers and try these out.I tried several hard rock and rap songs that were in true stereo because 1 instrument would play on 1 side and the other instruments would come in 1 at a time on the other side and then songs with some hard bass.These are too small to really tell the stereo sound effect of instruments on 1 side but not the other side while other instruments were playing on the other side; whereas, my old soundbar is twice the size of this and it is clear which side the instruments are on.With some hard bass songs, this doesn't have any punchy bass whatsoever! With the volume full blast, the treble really stands out and overrides the bass.Maybe if they double the actual size of this speaker to the size of my old soundbar speakers, it might sound a ton better; or, make this soundbar 1 channel and make another soundbar the same size that is the other channel and plugs into this soundbar to give you a way to spread out the speakers and sound to sound better.I'll keep these for my computer in my front guest bedroom but I'm keeping my old 2.0 soundbar speakers for my main computer.",

                "reviewText": "This USB Computer Speaker (\"upgraded\" version) is a nice little speaker with really good sound for being so inexpensive.I plugged it into my Windows pc and it immediately took over the sound output - I didn't even need to go into my sound settings and switch. It doesn't have buttons on the top, instead they're just touch-sensitive areas. Tap the icons lightly to adjust volume or enable mute.It's not going to give you the *volume* of a dual-speaker setup with a bass box down on the floor.But the sound *quality* is really good.Penguinz0's dulcet tones come through crisp and clear with no \"muddy\" sound.Listening to Sleep Token, I could hear every note of Vessel's beautiful range through the guitars and electronic mixes while still getting each snap of II's drums and his plethora of cymbals.I only wish it had two things...a detachable cord so that if the cord gets damaged it could be replaced individually instead of tossing the whole speaker, and a USB port on the back so a second one of these could be daisy-chained through the first.",
