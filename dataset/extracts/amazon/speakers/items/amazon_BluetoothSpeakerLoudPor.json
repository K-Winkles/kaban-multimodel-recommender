                "reviewText": "The Bluetooth Speaker offers an impressive set of features suitable for various occasions. With its larger than average 15-watt output, it delivers loud and clear audio, making it ideal for use in my shower which is why I originally bought this. I loved the IPX6 waterproof rating which ensures durability and reliability. Its FM radio function adds versatility to entertainment options, while the built-in microphone enables hands-free calling (unlikely to use this while rocking out in the shower LOL). Additionally, the speaker's TWS pairing capability allows users to connect two speakers for a stereo sound experience, enhancing the overall audio quality - this alone will have me buying another one for that stereo sound! With its sleek design and five LED light modes, this speaker serves as a stylish addition to any setting, making it a versatile and practical gadget suitable for all occasions.",

I have went through my fare share to finally get one that not only appeased me but it was exactly what I expected to get from description and pics I saw. My pros and cons are listed below.PROS:+when no wifi I can revert to FM radio+satisfying sound+light weight & perfect size to carry in bike basket+multiple LED light settings+charges rapidly+slot for storage cardCONS:-using cable for antenna works but reception is glitch-when switching to FM mode the volume comes on startling loud instead of staying at setting when previously usingOverall I would definitely refer this speaker to other as well as buy it again as gifts or personal use. I am simply thrilled to finally get what I was wanting in a portable Bluetooth speaker. Especially when it's my comfort when riding my bicycle for transportation. And some trips can be a bit lengthy. Thank you!",

And get this, it even has an FM radio built in, so you've got more options for entertainment. But the coolest part? The five LED lights that go with the music, turning any space into a full-on party zone. Honestly, it's a must-have for anyone who loves good tunes and good times.",
