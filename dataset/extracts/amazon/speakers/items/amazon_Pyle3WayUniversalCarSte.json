                "reviewText": "I was curious to see how well the Recoil BB-T bass blockers would reduce low frequencies, and I figured I'd compare them to my factory speakers while I was at it. I plugged them into a home stereo receiver that puts out 26 watts RMS per channel, so it's in the same range as most car audio receivers. Same distance each time, 75% volume, I played the first half of a song with lots of highs and mids and a subwoofer level bassline (Offspring-Hit That). The one that has \"1367\" at the top is a single Pyle. \"883\" is a factory 5 x 7 from my Mach 460 stereo. They're supposed to be higher quality speakers than the normal Ford factory installs. \"1325\" is Pyle + Recoil BB-T. This is a free-air setup, no enclosure, on a not so great receiver with no EQ controls, so it's just a comparison, not an actual evaluation of the speaker's performance. The number at the top is irrelevant, that's just where the peak was when I snapped the picture.The factory speaker had more bass but the highs weren't as crisp as the Pyle. Makes sense because the factory speaker has no added tweeters. The Pyle was noticeably clearer at high frequencies but it didn't win by much. I'd estimate it's about 15% - 25% clearer/cleaner than factory. The BB-T's did exactly what I wanted and blocked almost all the bass and a lot of the mids with no significant reduction on the high end. They'll get more juice and EQ / crossover treatment in the car so I'll update this if there's a huge difference, but I'm not pulling out the Mach 460 rear mount again just to compare it to the factory speaker. I'd rather eat lint.",

If you were gonna put these in a Box or a small radio would definitely recommend but anything else false advertisement and I definitely would not recommend these speakers because I'm a major gearhead and car enthusiast and I feel kind of misled on purpose just for sale and baited to buy these thinking that the medium quality or the high quality of 200 W for 2 speakers in a pair was a good deal turns out nothing is real online anymore you all have a nice day if you buy anything that you're trying to replace just go all out and pay the expensive price the quality last longer and chances are it's gonna be better off just to buy whatever it is For the money that it sold for",
