                "reviewText": "Packed full of features, this speaker is great for the shower due to its large suction cup. Most of the ones I've owned have a small one that is also made as a one piece design of the speaker, so if damaged you lose the waterproof capabilities of the speaker too. This has a suction cup that is attachable and is twice the size so it remains where you stick it. Connects right away and has a digital display, which is something you don't often find on a Bluetooth speaker. It shows your battery meter and is used for both radio mode (new one for me) and clock, which I haven't set up because I haven't any need for it personally. The controls are very straightforward and the battery lasts for several uses before needing a charge. You can also disable the lights to extend battery life even more if desired. It is the only shower speaker I use now",

                "reviewText": "You heard me, the reviewers don\u2019t seem to know what they\u2019re talking about when they refer to the sound quality. Yes, this speaker plays loudly, yes, it\u2019s easy to pair, and yes, it sounds amazing for most songs. But this speaker seems to be missing the melody that would normally play out of either a left or right speaker. It\u2019s like it\u2019s in stereo but without the second speaker.If you try and listen to a ballad like Dream On by Aerosmith for prime example, right at the beginning of the song during the instrumental, there\u2019s a little trill they do on guitar leading up to the vocals that\u2019s normally only heard from one side speaker in your car or in your headphones, well, it\u2019s completely missing with this speaker and it ruins so many songs because of that! Another example is Poison by Bell Biv Devoe, right at the beginning before the vocals the \u201ctap tap tap\u2026 WHAM\u201d 2 of those WHAMs are meant to be in a different speaker from the other two and you can\u2019t hear them! You can only just barely hear it because the speaker they\u2019ve chosen (left or right, I\u2019m not sure) to designate this speaker to wasn\u2019t meant to play that part of the song so it goes missing or incredibly faint. Not many people seemed to pick up on that before leaving a review, and I\u2019m paired to an iPhone 13 Pro Max with the latest update, so I doubt it\u2019s my phone.Now, I did request an exchange to see if I just got a bad speaker, turns out no, that\u2019s just how it is apparently, and I don\u2019t like that considering the old cheaper shower speaker I\u2019m replacing plays all sounds of a song just perfectly, just not as loud as this speaker. While I had both the exchange and the purchased speaker in my possession I noticed the instruction said you could pair two speakers together. I followed the instructions and\u2026 I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get the two speakers to pair together. I was hoping this would solve my problem and designate one as a left and one as a right speaker, then I would just let the return date run out and let them charge me for the second speaker. But no\u2026 I can\u2019t seem to pair them together as instructed, they only want to either play from one or the other.In conclusion, speaker sounds absolutely fantastic until you get a song that plays different elements in the left and right speaker, that\u2019s when this speaker shows its ugly head in bad programming. It\u2019s like it\u2019s set to \u201cstereo\u201d when it should be set to \u201cmono\u201d if you recall speaker settings on an old tv. It makes certain songs too difficult to listen to and ruins the vibe, I do not recommend this speaker for that reason alone. Everything else is just fine, even the forced 24hr clock that updates once you pair your phone, I can live with it. But the missing song elements is a major foul for me!",

Made sure it was completely dry before charging it and it was always shaken out after use. I didn't leave it on either. Turned it off after every shower. It turns on but after 5 seconds shuts off. Doesn't stay on. Usually that's what other speakers did when water got into the electronics. Had full charge.",

Das Verbinden hat problemlos geklappt. Nach dem Einschalten wurde zun\u00e4chst eine falsche Uhrzeit angezeigt, die sich innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit automatisch richtig eingestellt hat. Es kann zwischen verschiedenen Lichtmodi hin und her geschaltet werden. Gerade f\u00fcr Kinder d\u00fcrfte das ein interessantes Gimmick sein. Alternativ l\u00e4sst sich das Licht komplett abschalten.Nun kommen wir zum wichtigsten Kriterium eines Lautsprechers: Der Klang ist einwandfrei. Ich habe das Ger\u00e4t auf dem Schreibtisch ausprobiert und im Hintergrund laufen lassen. Keine Verzerrungen oder \u00e4hnliches. Die Lautst\u00e4rke ist schon auf der untersten Stufe laut genug, um im Hintergrund Musik etc. zu h\u00f6ren. Bei voller Lautst\u00e4rke ist der Klang immer noch klar, mir ist es dann aber zu laut. Vielleicht \u00e4ndert sich das im Sommer im Garten.Der Lautsprecher ist sehr handlich und kann \u00fcberall gut mit hingenommen werden. Gerade auf Reisen wird er uns sicherlich zuk\u00fcnftig begleiten und an Tablet und Handy angeschlossen seine Dienste verrichten. Dann werden wir am Pool sicherlich auch davon profitieren, dass er \"wasserdicht bei Untertauchen f\u00fcr kurze Zeit\" sein soll.Insgesamt vergebe ich eine klare Kaufempfehlung.",
