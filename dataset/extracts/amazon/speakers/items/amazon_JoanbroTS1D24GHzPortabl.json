I owned this just short of two years and now it is outside the warranty period. The unit stopped working and will not turn on. The base continues to work.I contacted Joanbro and they promptly replied asking me to try using the adaptor from the base. I did this and nothing happened. However, the very first thing they mentioned is that it had a one year limited warranty. I am continuing to work with them, but would not recommend this product given the lack of reliability and the company's support of its products. I will update with progress on the issue.Update: The company responded quickly again, said the speaker was likely broken and is sending me a replacement! Although the warranty is one year, they said they want to solve their customers issues, and so they have.",

This speaker helps bring the sound right next to me so the AC doesn't drown it out. The sound quality is good and the product is extremely simple. The instructions provided give plenty of details and options on how to connect the device. In my case, it was just one cable from the TV to the transmitter. I'd highly recommend this product for anybody that needs to get their TV sound closer to their position, whether they are hard of hearing or there are other distracting noises in the room.",
