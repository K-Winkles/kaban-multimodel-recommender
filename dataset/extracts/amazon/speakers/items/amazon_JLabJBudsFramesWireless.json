With that aside, these perform Better than all expectations in the class of device that they are meant for. I have the Bose Glasses (a member of the family has them, I wear prescription) so I can compare them 1:1.The Good1. They make for great phone calls as the person on the other end compared them favorably to iPhone speakerphone or other High End Earbud bluetooth devices, example apple airbuds pro.2. They make for great listing to podcasts, with loud crisp audio this is right in line for why these were made.3. They are good for watching Youtube and other streaming media videos. The Stereo and large Room Feel that they give you makes for a nice soundscape.4. They make for a nice \"soundtrack for your life\" if you put music on and compare it to a stereo playing in the distance while you go about your day and are able to interact with people.5. The price point!!!! I mean the price point. Currently 15$ I mean they are giving these things away.The Sound coming out of these for everything calls, music etc is comparable if not slightly better because its louder than the Bose (first generation) Sunglasses. If you don't mind the look of them on your Rims' I'd recommend these over the bose just for Volume and Price. But, when it comes to looks... there is no comparison, Bose wins.the Bad.They look a little goofy sitting on your glasses. That's just something you will have to get over. And before people knew what bluetooth was, that thing hanging on your ear looked goofy too.If you don't have large rims, it may be challenging getting them to stick properly. The sides are metal and they come with rubber feet so if you work at it, you should be able to get it to stick to thinner metal frames, but larger framed glasses and sunglasses are closer to the market for these.It doesn't quite have All Day battery life. but, who cares at $15. hell if you love em that much by 2. lol.Someone commented that they make your glasses heavier and it makes it heavier on your nose. Not for me. I have them pushed back toward my ear so far that its pushing up against my head and the tension against my head mitigates the weight on the glasses. In essence they \"hold their own weight\" with friction.I have over a dozen bluetooth headsets. I like getting them and trying them out. Many are cheap Chinese ones I just like to try. But I also Own AirPods Max, AirPods Pro, Sony XM1000s', In Ear Triple Driver UE's - in other words I don't mess around with sound. I will definitely be using these for convenience for calls and for podcasts and for those times that I just have to stay aware of my surroundings.Count me a Fan",

                "reviewText": "Overall, for the price, it's a very cool gadget to have this. I will point out that there are just some flaws here and there. First, For putting on glasses, if your glasses frames are too thin, then these JBuds will not stay on. Then, when playing on my glasses, I can definitely feel the weight on them. It was initially uncomfortable; however, after a little bit of time of wearing it, I kind of got used to it. Third, unless I use my hands to push my ears towards the speakers, the sound quality of these are just okay. It's not bad; however, if I really want to listen on music, I'd rather just use my Bluetooth earphones instead. As a side-note, however, phone calls on these are very great. Lastly, but not really a big big deal, the earphones are definitely noticeable to other people to the point where a few people do ask me what I'm wearing on my glasses. In summary, if you have a lot of meetings or phone calls, then these are great. If you want these for music, unless you absolutely need a non-noise insulating gadget, I'd probably just use Bluetooth earphones instead.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Works as expected, but they weigh down your glasses and people near you can hear too.",
                "reviewText": "Note that these are miniature speakers that you position near your ear, not over your ear. The JBuds Bluetooth easily connected with both my phone and computer. Since I work alone, I increased the volume to maximum and could hear all of the details in the audio without distortion. I listened all day at maximum volume for at least 8 hours on a single charge. These are not in-ear speakers, but external speakers, therefore, anyone close by in a quiet environment would be able to hear the JBuds. Also, they doubled the weight of my glasses and the pressure exerted by the nose bridge. The added weight and the loose fit of my glasses caused my glasses to slide down my nose when I looked down. (That's my fault for not getting my glasses fitted properly)The JBud headset and internal microphone connected and worked well with ZOOM. The photo shows the ZOOM Audio Menu with the Microphone as the \"Headset (JLab JBuds Frames Hands-Free AG Audio)\" and the Speaker as the \"Headset (JLab JBuds Frames Hands-Free AG Audio)\". The ZOOM audio was clear both through the JBud speakers and the meeting participants said the microphone audio was good.Pros - Easy Bluetooth connection, Long Battery Life (at least 8hrs), I experienced about 30ft Bluetooth range, listen to music without using an earbud that could fall out. Because it is not in your ear, you can carry on a conversation like you could with a stereo playing in the background. The JBuds come in very nice packaging and with a very-well done, illustrated and comprehensive instructions.Cons - Considerable weight for its size, people nearby can also hear what you're listening to and they are very conspicuous hanging on your glasses. The JBuds have a very complex menu system where multiple functions are controlled through the single button on each JBud. The pattern and sequence of the left side/right side button presses control the many functions of the JBuds. (Example: On/Off, Bluetooth, Volume, Track Forward/Backward, Answer Phone, Hangup, Reject call, Audio Equalizer).Conclusions: The audio (listening and microphone) works well with ZOOM Meetings. Keep the instructions close until you master the button sequences so you can use all of the functions.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing little gadget! If you see this on for $29.99, I HIGHLY recommend getting it for someone who can't wear ear/headphones, and isn't a major audiophile. I would say the sound is equivalent to about $15-$20 earbuds. Bass isn't super amazing, but I personally don't expect that from bud-less earphones.I can still hear my surroundings fairy well. At max volume I can't hear my surroundings very well and people around me can hear a very faint sound- take that how you will.I can't see them in my peripherals, and they're lightweight enough for me to hardly notice they're there.I will say that if these were on for regular price ($60) I might be a little more hesitant on purchasing, but on sale? Amazing. Chef's kiss. A treat.",
