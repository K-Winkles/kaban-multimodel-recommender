It also fits in a cup holder to give you an idea of its size.If you want a small sized speaker for portability, I\u2019d definitely recommend this one at its price point.",

My second one was an Angle 3 with the older style USB cables. I gave that one away after about 3 years using it to get one with USB C charging cable. I gave that one to a friend and they are using it every day for podcasts. I bought a new Angle 3 for myself for use with my phone. I use it all around the house. I garden with it and when friends are visiting on the patio, it comes with us.I\u2019m really happy with my little, mobile speakers. The charge they hold is great. The sound is really pretty good, especially for a little speaker. And I just bought the little Solo for use as a computer speaker.All four of mine have been reliable and consistant in playing. I did buy a new micro USB cord that was longer than the 3ft that came with the unit. It does not come with the plug-in but I have so many of those already, that I didn't care.",

Once you plug a 3.5 mm jack into the Oontz speaker it disables Bluetooth on the speaker. Great for portable ops since it's battery operated. It can also be used when it's charging and you can leave it connected too. Amazing how much sound you gat out of this little device",

The sound quality, bass and treble mix is surprisingly good, especially since I use it to play streaming music from my smart phone via bluetooth. Light and portable, with great battery life and quick USB recharges. And a great value.",

My previous shower speaker (one of the round ones with the suction cup on the bottom) put out barely enough volume to be audible over running water. This speaker however, despite its small size, is easily loud enough to be heard clearly even at half volume.At near full volume it is easily capable of being heard from at least the next room over, and delivers a fairly full bass sound and clear high range as well. My only criticism is that at maximum volume I did notice some distortion, however it is not at all necessary to set the volume this high if you are in remotely close proximity to it.I was so impressed with the device that I elected to use it more generally around the house in place of a smart speaker.On a single charge I was able to listen to use it for more than 8 hours, at a louder volume that the speaker in my iPhone is capable of outputting (which was roughly 30-35% of the maximum volume of the Oontz), and the battery was only depleted by 50%.All this for only $20. I can't recommend it enough.",
