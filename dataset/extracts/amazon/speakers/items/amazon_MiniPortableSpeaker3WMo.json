Normally, the power conducted through a 3.5mm audio jack would not be enough to damage the jack, but this speaker charges through a USB-A cable, and something shoddy is happening on that end. Whatever juice it's drawing from that source is unshielded and intense, enough to create a sudden and ear-piercing squeal through the speaker when that USB-A port is right next to the aux jack, as it is on most laptops and desktops. And when that happened to me, it instantly fried the L side of stereo on that aux jack, permanently, forcing a replacement.Buyer beware!",
