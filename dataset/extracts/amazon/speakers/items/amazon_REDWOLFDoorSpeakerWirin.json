I was worried about how far my new speakers were sticking out of the adapter compared to the originals but this adapter isn't as high/thick as the originals. I did add some velcro tape (fuzzy side) to one side of the adapters so they wouldn't rattle. I'm not sure if they would rattle but I don't want to have to take the door panels off again.I originally found these adapters that fit for my truck then clicked on the adapters + wiring harness plugs on the same product page. After getting them, I realized the wiring harness plugs are for a different year of vehicle. So be careful if you are wanting the wiring harness plugs, they might not be for the right year/make/model.",
