                "reviewText": "I tested these plugged into an iPhone 13. For how cheap these are, I can't believe how good they sound, with a surprisingly full sound that has more of a low end than I anticipated (I anticipated none), and they even look pretty cool. Build quality is better than you might expect too. Nobody would confuse these for expensive top-tier speakers up close, but they don't look like cheap trash either. Don't get me wrong - these are still sub-$10 speakers, and if they were pricier it would be easy to critique the slightly muffled low end and somewhat hollow midrange, but for casual listening at that price I have nothing to complain about.Frankly I got these expecting to get tinny, garbage speakers and for my use case, I would've been happy with that (I got these for a Zaireeka listening party, a quirky experimental album that uses four separate CDs on separate systems that play simultaneously across eight speakers, and variances in sound quality across the different systems are part of the experimental fun of the thing). But these sound good enough that I'm going to find another use for them. For serious music listening, you obviously shouldn't be considering speakers in the $10 range. But if your priority is price, then you get a ridiculous bang for your buck with these guys.",
