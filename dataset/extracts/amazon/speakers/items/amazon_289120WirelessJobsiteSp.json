One thing to call out; when reading reviews, I saw some stating they were stuck in AUX mode. This is because there is a step missing on the instruction sticker. The buttons are designed to switch between modes, so before holding the Bluetooth button down for 2 seconds, if it's in AUX mode (AUX light on), you must first press the Bluetooth button one time normally - don't hold down, to enter into Bluetooth mode. From there, you're able to hold it down for 2 seconds and pair mode will start.",
