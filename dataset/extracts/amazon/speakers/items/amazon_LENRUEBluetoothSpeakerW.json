                "reviewText": "I purchased one of these recently and was pleasantly surprised at how decent the sound was for something so small; the same thing I say about Kristin Chenowith actually. In the speaker\u2019s case though, decent was as far as I could go. But then I read a couple other reviews on here and saw that some other purchaser had said the same as I had planned to say but then suggested that having TWO of these babies instead of one was a quantum leap forward in the sound quality (i.e., pairing one speaker to the other then adding them as a pair to my iPhone\u2019s Bluetooth connection, it\u2019s in the minimal instructions for the speaker under the heading \u201cTWS Wireless Pairing\u201d).I thought this was either a really insidiously clever marketing trick to get me to buy not only one but two so-so speakers, or was it honest advice and worth risking another $17 (and thus depleting my entire retirement savings) for immersive sounds in my shower each day? Meh, how many years was I going to be able to stretch out $17 for anyway? I ordered another speaker. And\u2026well, wow, that was solid advice. Although the process of getting it all to work correctly is a little bit vague in the instructions and seems a little cumbersome to do every time I bathe and am anxious to torture / serenade my roomies with my vocal stylings (worth it) the difference in sound quality really is huge. It plays great stereo sound separated out to each speaker beautifully and fill the room; the bathroom anyhow. I stopped at four stars however in part due to the 1,473rd case of horrifically translated, supremely perplexing mess of a translation from Chinese to English that I\u2019ve personally encountered, and the one shortcoming I find in the majority of these types of speakers\u2026simply put, they not freaking loud enough. Or, they\u2019re loud enough to make my nanny / librarian hybrid of an iPhone to yell at me that it\u2019s \u201ctoo woud, and it could weally, weally hurt my widdle ears\u201d (spare me), but unless you consider using a microwave oven to be eardrum shatteringly loud that\u2019s a laugh. If these speakers put out about 25% more in overall volume I\u2019d say they were nearly perfect for the price. As they volume is now I\u2019ll say they\u2019re 85% perfect which will suffice for now. In the end having two of these really is the way to go. I very much recommend going that route. Twice really is nice\u2026unless we\u2019re talking poison ivy or marriage maybe. Then, probably not so much.",

                "reviewText": "1. Sound Quality 7/10This speaker really surprised me with just how big the bang for your buck is! Although far from perfect, I am very satisfied with this speaker. It does sound a little distorted once it reaches the higher end of its volume capabilities.2. Bass 4/10The bass is a little lackluster. It\u2019s not a JBL, it\u2019s a Lenrue. For the price range, still pretty great. I can actually feel the bass on my desk when I\u2019m working, but it\u2019s not fantastic.3. Waterproof 10/10The first thing I did was throw this thing in the shower. And the first thing the speaker did was keep playing music. I can confirm that it is completely waterproof and I use it in the shower a lot.4. Battery life 6/10It usually lasts me about 7 hours, I listen to music throughout my night while I sleep and I wake up to music still playing. I will say, the sound when the speaker turns off is pretty obnoxious.It\u2019s a great little speaker with good power. Probably best put to use in your room for studying or work or something like that.",
