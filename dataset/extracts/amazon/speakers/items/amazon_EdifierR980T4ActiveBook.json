So I had to spend MORE money to get some powered speakers, cause I didn't want to get a tuner and all that jazz...which I ended up listening to my Thelonious Monk records, but I digress. So yeah...got these speakers and my delivery person was cool and I thanked him....he turned and said, You're welcome!\" Not in a sarcastic way, but a way that seemed heartfelt. So the speakers are hooked up and sound great. You should get a pair to play your records with, or on....through? Your life could be complete if you did....but you keep playin.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these when they cost $89 and it was worth every penny. They say it is like only 12watts per a speaker but it sounds like way more. The base is thumpin and the highs are great. Every time I crank them up I'm surprised by how good they sound. My favorite feature is the duel rca inputs. You don't have to switch between them. I can play a movie off my PC 'pause it and start playing music from my phone and you don't have to touch or switch any input, it is automatic. I had them for a year and decided to give them to a friend 'cause he needed speakers and I want to hook up a sub woofer. So I bought the next one up \"same brand\" the model number is \"R1280DBs\" it is the next module up costing $159 the new one has double the watts 21 per a speaker for a total of 42. That's constant RMS not peak. The new model has Bluetooth for my phone, a remote, base and trebble and most important has sub woofer out. I bought a sub to go with it. I got the brand \"BESTISAN\" model \"Sw65D\" 50 watt. It should go perfect with this. I will review them as soon as I get them. OVERALL I would say you will be impressed by these speaker. Especially since the price went done to what $69 ENJOY",

                "reviewText": "This is a really solid purchase for those on a budget, but if you can afford to go up to the $100 or $150 range I'd recommend one of edifier's more expensive options. I'm not an audiophile by any means but do enjoy audio equipment so take all of this with a grain of saltPros:- Clear, powerful sound that does not distort if you keep it below ~75% volume- Awesome for movies and shows, solid for gaming - wide enough range to hear sounds you normally wouldn't on low quality speakers- Beautiful looking especially with the drivers exposed- REAL tweeter @logitech, these kick the crap out of any budget speakers made by PC peripheral brands- easy to connect with wall power, RCA to 3.5mm, and wires between the two speakers - all cables are long enough for use on a long desk- Good all in one solution for those looking to spend less than $100 and don't want to buy a separate amp- Sound even nicer with a DACCons:- pretty disgusting distortion at its loudest volumes - I would have rather had a speaker that couldn't reach such volumes than one that could but sounds awful when it does. Not a massive con though because it gets plenty loud enough before it distorts- Volume control is on the back which makes on the fly adjustment particularly annoying- Mids can feel somewhat recessed and overtaken by the lower frequencies- Not as balanced as I would've liked but they're inexpensive so it's hard to complain- very low hissing sound when nothing is playing but you won't notice unless your ear is a few inches from the driverIn the end they certainly get the job done and are a nice entry level speaker, but if you can spend more it's certainly worth it to get something of higher quality. I've had them for several months though and don't feel the need to replace which is a good sign for an itchy tech buyer like myself",

                "reviewText": "Allow me to level set: I am not an audiophile. I consider myself an audio hobbyist. I like high quality gear and good sound quality but I am not trying to achieve the best sound possible. I was looking for a decent pair of powered speakers that I could temporarily hook up to an old turntable and also permanently use as PC speakers. This product delivered on that goal perfectly. They are easy to set up and look pretty good, so they should work very well with any bedroom or small to medium sized walled areas.The sound is flat and the volume control is easy to adjust, with no distortion. It gets pretty loud but these will not blow you away, which they do not need to at this size or price. I think the crucial thing here is that the sound signature is neutral and flat, which is what I was looking for. I think they sound considerably better with the grill covers off. Just my 2 cents. Very good value, with a decent sound, I think they did well for themselves by making these simple and not gimmicky.",

                "reviewText": "I just hooked these R980T's up and played Benassi - Love is Gonna Save Us which I find to my ears a good test for bass and overall responsiveness and these speakers (for the money) are a fantastic value. I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Creative Gigaworks T20's (the left speaker was DOA). What are the points of the comparison between those two speakers? Well, they worked right out of the box, so that's one for the Edifiers. They are substantially heavier and made with real wood versus plastic for the T20's. They are substantially wider and deeper which probably explains some of the weight. They sound incredible for $100 speakers ($Cdn) it's almost hard to believe they are that cheap. Pretty good highs and mids and the bass is only ok, but together they sound very pleasant to the ears. I have some very nice atmos speakers for a home entertainment system along with a high-end sub that provides a sort of auditory-ecstasy, and of course, these speakers don't sound as good as that....but these are only $100. They do not have knobs for volume, bass, and power on the front which is a bit of a bummer for me, but I think that I will get used to using the computer volume control. I would recommend these to a friend in a heartbeat, in particular for a bedroom or even a small living room as they can fill a decent sized room with sound. They are super impressive bookshelf speakers. If you have $100Cdn (or much less in $US) then can't go wrong with these.",

                "reviewText": "These speakers work great. I was worried the 12 W per speaker might not be enough, but it booms plenty. They made some questionable choices in the design, like how they have two connections for the red/white RCA cords, but no connections for an auxiliary (headphone) cord, which is pretty standard for desktop computers, laptops, monitors, and phones. That's not a big deal though because they include a 3.5 mm to RCA adapter cord in the box. They also include an RCA to RCA cord, and some standard speaker wire that goes from your right speaker to the left speaker. I also thought it was strange that you can't toggle between the two inputs. If you connect your phone to one input and your desktop computer to the other, rather than selecting which one you want to hear, it just plays both simultaneously. I suppose that 'feature' might be useful to some people, but I don't see myself using it. I like how you can control the bass and volume (I set the speaker volume to max and use my PC's volume settings to adjust it on the fly), and how the grills come off so you can see the sound cones if you want. I paid $110 + tax for the speakers, so they aren't cheap, but you're getting a quality product here, so I feel I got my money's worth.",
