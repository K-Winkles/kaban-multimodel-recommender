Sounds just fine and the price is right.EDIT:Well, the speaker borked out the first day I used it on the road. It first developed a low-volume condition, where you could barely hear anything with the volume all the way up. Then, no sound at all. I suspect a bad solder joint inside there. I'll probably just pick up a used Kenwood or Motorola speaker on fleabay, recommend you do as well. This one isn't worth the trouble. A short or fault inside a speaker could easily damage a radio, and in a device as simple as a speaker there's really no excuse for such poor quality control.",

I plug it into my Ps5 controller because my monitor I play on doesn\u2019t have sound so laying in bed watching tv with headphones on sucks. It\u2019s amazing for the price. The sounds a little fuzzy but still decent for the price. It\u2019s what I needed while I figure out getting a tv. RECOMMEND GETTING",
