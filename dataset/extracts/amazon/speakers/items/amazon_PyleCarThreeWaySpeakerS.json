                "reviewText": "These arrived a day early: fast shipping. :)Great speakers, very eye catching color and very precise sound for their size. I can't think of a single thing about these that is a turn down. The bass is good even before a full break in has been conducted. Currently they are running from a 25 X 4 MAX amp, that I use for the front/rears in my home theater/ HiFi system. Before these I used Dayton audio B652 bookshelf speakers. Although there is nothing wrong with them, I felt I needed to upgrade. Pyle PLG6.2 were a great choice. my Daytons and a 10\" Polk audio subwoofer are going into a tower enclosure. These handle really well and are made of a sturdy Polypropelene ( can't spell that :) ) cone. Most are paper, and thats a problem. The tweeters are about 240% more efficient than almost all that I have seen in my lifetime. These are a great cheap PAIR of speakers. Don't hesitate to buy them, and for optimal performance learn a little bit about how to use speakers properly, don't assume you know, all speakers are different, it pays off. Grills are nice addition, really easy to mount and cables were small but had clips on them.I recommend this to anyone looking for a visually pleasing and great sounding pair of speakers. Any intelligent person can easily tell you that name brand isn't always the best. With about 3 1/2 years of experience in the speakers/electronics field, I can say that these ARE high-quality and if treated right should last along time.PS: Thank you UPS and Sonix Electronics for that fast shipping!Update: After alot and I mean alot of testing, these worked best in a ported enclosure. Which surprised me because they managed to reach 35 Hz without struggle. These can really take a lot of beatings, these have at least been moved between 20+ enclosures. The only issue is the tweeter on one of the speakers crackles a bit on rare occasion. Not a biggie. But a great buy for anyone.",

I connected the battery and turned the key over after I wired them up, my insides filled with butterflies in excitement to hear these little babies make my neighbors call the cops on me. The welcome word appeared on my head unit. quickly, my hands reached for the volume knob turning it clockwise as fast as it would let me. The soft taps against my phone screen hearing each click as I find the perfect song. Scrolling and scrolling... AH, there it is, I click on it, smiling from ear to ear staring at my steering wheel waiting for my terrible connection to load the song. The screen changes... and.. its an ad. I hear a walmart ad as the first thing on these lovely new speakers and it sounded incredle. I've never wanted to take a trip to Walmart, listening to my new speakers, so badly in my entire life. I recommend these speakers if this is the kind of experience your looking for! \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I hit these with some fairly high wattage and wow! They sounded fairly comparable to a Kenwood 6x9 concert series but not as warm sounding the test I used was the same 6x9 boxes running off of the same Kenwood hqr amplifier. After a time of using the tweeters started to sound a bit scratchy also I believe I give them a decent workout. Using a oscilloscope testing for distortion I'm able to dial in. The eight way idea is novel. They're okay really they're not a pro audio speaker they got some pretty nice sounding mid Bass don't expect deep lows unless you're playing at low volume. The magnet on the back side is gargantuan! I imagine this is what helps its performance. The look is something out of an '80s movie with the freaky scientist Neighbor Next Door Maybe. They're not horrible no they actually exceeded my expectations if it weren't for the scratchy Twitter and the less than warm sound they could have gotten five stars. Good value for the money remains to kind of be seen.",
