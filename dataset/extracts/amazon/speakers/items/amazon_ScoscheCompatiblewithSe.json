I had to get out my Dremel tool and shave off numerous tabs in order for this to work. Once that was done, it fits like a glove - but beware, you will need to double check closely and modify as needed prior to installation.Also, there is no mounting cushion provided. I installed 4 speakers only to discover that my doors rattled terribly when the bass is loud. I had to pull all 4 speakers and add adhesive backed cushioning where the part contacts the metal of the door. That solved the rattle but the cushioning should be included with this item.",
