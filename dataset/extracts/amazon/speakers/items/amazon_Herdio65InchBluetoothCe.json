I only tried with one device, so I don't know if it works for two.Documentation is pretty sparse.I put these into a new house where I was able to put the speaker wires in during framing. I used decent sized speaker wires (14ga) that fit the speakers' large connectors. The problem is that the actual device only fits 18ga wires or smaller. The terminals even have a little metal block that prevents anything larger going in there. I had to splice my 14ga down to 18ga before it would work.Also, the terminals face forwards, so you have to bend the wires backwards in a small space, I'm not sure that was intentional.Finally, the left/right aren't marked. The positive terminals are marked (they are the outside ones), but not which is left or right. I had to cross my fingers and test after install. The documentation and the printed circuit board have no information.",
