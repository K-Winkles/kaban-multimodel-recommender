                "reviewText": "I am sitting at a desk working on my primary computer. I have a set of Harmon Kardon speakers attached to it. There is a large sub woofer and the sound that those can put out is really strong. The desktops to my left and right both have Altec Lansing speakers attached and, again, one has a fairly large sub woofer and the other one has a much larger sub woofer attached. The sound output on each set is really good. I have another desktop sitting on a desk downstairs. I had an older Altec Lansing set of speakers attached to that one. Those had developed an irritating sound that would come and go and sometimes just stay on in the background. I finally just turned them off. We do not use that computer that much, but I wanted a bit more sound than a monitor can provide. So, I ordered this set.The installation is easy. Plug them into a USB port and they immediately turn on. Plug the sound jack into the proper port and you immediately have sound. Instructions are basically written in mice type, but are fairly simple since they work seamlessly. I do NOT like the short press this button and long press that button stuff but, fortunately there is not a lot of additional stuff to worry about. The little speakers have color changing lights on the front which might seem cool to some but I found them to be annoying. So I short pressed the LED button a few times to cycle them through the various colors and turn them off. I said what I said above about my other speakers to say this. This little set will not give you sound that is comparable to what you can expect with a set that has a sizable sub woofer and a couple of tweeters. In fact, the bass output is a bit on the weak side. But, they are still decent speakers and will work well in a setup where you just want decent sound. The set is fairly small, so if you want to transport them with a laptop, that will not be difficult to do.You can also set them up via bluetooth if you so desire, but I did not try that setting.",

                "reviewText": "I was just about ready to write a really bad review: I battled for an hour or two trying to get the speakers to emit any sound except \"connected\" \"disconnected\" and \"dududu\". While these sounds were good news because they indicated that the bluetooth connection worked, I just could not get any audio from my Mac Mini M1. Then I turned up the volume all the way to the max on the speaker control, in the system settings of my Mac, and in the application that I was using to play music. Voila! That worked.So, warning number one is that these speakers are not loud. Normal volume settings for my regular desktop external speakers was not sufficient to produce even the slightest sound. Everything set to the max was a little loud for me but probably not for a teenager.Warning number two is that the sound, once produced, is rather tinny. If you want concert hall sound on classical music, you'll need better speakers than these.Other than the foregoing, everything was OK. The colors were fun to play around with but an old toot like me doesn't really care all that much. I eventually just turned them off entirely (which, thankfully, is easy to do). The bluetooth connection was good and I did not detect any lag in the audio for several videos I played. I was able to pair the speakers with my iPhone. The volume seemed to be a bit louder when connected to the iPhone than when connected to my Mac.The issue with speaker volume might be partially a Mac issue. The Mac mini does not have a jack for external speakers -- its jack is intended to be a headphone jack. As such the Mac may well be trimming the volume levels down to avoid overloading the headphones (and eardrums).",

Tried everything to get it to work. Nothing, now its landfill. Don't waste your money on this, look for something with some quality.",

                "reviewText": "For 26 bucks I sure did not expect high-quality sound, but still more than they deliver.I have a permanent background noise as soon as I rise the volume wheel of the speaker. So, I have it maybe up at 20%. When I use just the Win11 volume adjustment, it does not seem to get as much background noise, but I am limited with the max volume. Although, questioning myself if I would even ever blast them.The sound is in general rather dull and boring. Quickly can sound like you watch somebody on youtube whose TV is running in the background.The LEDs are what I have expected, nothing bad to say about them.Cable length is good.They are okay enough if you get them for around 10-15bucks, but else, quality and price just don't match up.",
