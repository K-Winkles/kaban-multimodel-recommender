                "reviewText": "So... As mentioned by multiple other reviewers on Amazon, these banana plugs are a bit too small to securely hold 14-gauge speaker wires... yeah, I was able to get them to hold temporarily by screwing them in, but using just the mechanical screw-in method as designed resulted in noisy signals and eventual disconnects. So I soldered my speaker wires to these, and the results have been awesome! Sturdy connections, no noise, no distortion.Here's what I did:1. Stripped wire off by about an inch, and tinned the exposed copper wire.2. Unscrew the tip from the body and carefully tinned the inside top surface with a tiny bit of solder (careful not to let solder get onto the screw threads so I could get the tip back onto the body).3. Screwed everything back together and tightened with pliers to ensure solid mechanical connections.4. Stood the connector on its end by drilling a hole in a block of wood -- tip fits in diameter of hold so the connector stands upright with back end standing up.5. Using soldering iron at around 450 degrees Celsius (hotter than most applications) and a very large chisel tip, heated up the connector at the opening for the wire, until solder is able to melt and go into the opening of the connector.6. Filled the connector's opening with melted solder to the brim.7. Maintaining soldering iron on the connector, insert tinned speaker wire into the opening of the connector right into the molten solder.8. While maintaining wire in immobile position, set soldering iron aside until molten solder cools and hardens.9. Cleaned off flux.Wala!!! Solidly solder connection.Drawback? The plastic red and black rings on are not meant for solder, so they start to melt when the connector reaches soldering temperature. Looks not as nice as before (see photos), but results in very reliable connection.",

The tips unscrew which I still don't understand and I had to go to a random website on how to install speaker banana plugs. That said...HOW TO INSTALL SPEAKER BANANA PLUGS:1: Strip your wire at least a half inch and twist it tight2: Screw the tip of the plug into the middle portion tight, there's no reason I know of for this ever to be separated3: Unscrew the bottom portion from the middle enough just so it is BARELY hanging on but doesn't fall off4: Insert the wire into the rear of the plug until it stops5. JAM the wire into the back as hard as you can... seriously. It should go in another half inch. this is the wire splitting apart and bending over the threads6. Firmly keep the wire pushed in, and screw the middle and bottom portions together as much as possible. It may get hard but that's from the speaker wires getting in between the plug threads7. Give it a tug. Should be firmly seated inside. If it pulls out, start back at Step 1",

                "reviewText": "These plugs lost their springiness rather quickly and I had to take off their tips and squeeze the tips tip to end in a pliers to restore the springiness so they would stay in the inputs. Not sure how many times I can do that before the metal won\u2019t hold the expanded shape. I also found them to be a bit large for small class d amps. I learned I prefer the plastic plugs from Deadbolt on these smaller devices so you don\u2019t have to worry about shorting. The Deadbolt banana plugs were also easier to wire up.",

                "reviewText": "This is a product that gets the job done effectively, and at a good price. Banana plugs are used to clean up speaker wire - you can generally screw in speaker wire, but banana plugs provide a nice interface that allows you to plug in and remove speaker wire as needed.These closed plugs do a good job terminating / hiding the wire. They fit very well into various components and amps that I own.INSTRUCTIONS to install / use them: * Remove around 1\" - 2\" of the white casing to expose the red and white individual speaker wires * Strip each wire so ~1/2\" metal is showing * Make sure the plug end is screwed in tightly (this does not need to come out) * Unscrew the base of the plug from the other end * WithOUT twisting the metal wiring, insert the wire (match wire color with plug color; start with either one) from the bottom of the plug until the metal sticks out the top * Have ~1/4\" metal hanging past the plug * take the wiring and drape it down the sides of the plug (just the smooth side, do NOT cover any of the screw threading or it will be very hard to close it) * Spread the draped wiring around the plug as evenly as possible (makes it easier to screw in later) * Screw the two ends of the plug back together (the side with the draped wiring will go inside the plug) * If you get stuck while screwing it back in, unscrew and adjust the wiring * Repeat for the other side, and you're done!",

I had to read a bit about it before proceeding, but just like most things in life, once you know how to do it, it\u2019s easier. Would have been nice to come with instructions, but here I am, writing them for free on here.You\u2019re welcome, Monoprice.-Strip 1 cm of insulation, do not twist-Unscrew bottom part of the plug-Insert wire through the bottom piece, so that about 4mm stick out on the other side-Flare out wire strands out like a flower and bend back down around the rim, but not the threads.-Screw back the top part, twisting it as you insert. People complain about this part being removable - but that\u2019s how it locks everything in place. Tighten all parts by hand or gently with pliers. See photos. I posted them in order, but they get randomized by amazon. You get the idea",

Works great with Polk Audio S10 and S15 speakers, as well as Yamaha RX-V6A receiver. As others explain, you need to cut the bare wire to the right amount (not too long!) because the sleeve cannot screw overtop any pieces of wire. If it\u2019s really hard to twist, just trim back the wire that reaches the threads.",
