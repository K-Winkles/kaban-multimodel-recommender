                "reviewText": "TLDR: Found my wife's dream speaker in pink, waterproof wonder, clip-on convenience! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udca6I'm totally smitten with this speaker! I'm part of the Walmart crew, where we stock these babies in black, camo, and silver for 59 bucks. But guess what? I snagged it here for a sweet $20 less and in the dreamiest shade of pink!Quality-wise, this speaker is a rockstar. The first thing I did? Tossed it into the pool to test its waterproof bragging rights. And yes, it floats like a champ, unscathed and ready to party. It\u2019s perfect for chill water activities - think leisurely kayaking or canoeing, but maybe not for the adrenaline-pumping white-water rafting since it\u2019s adorably palm-sized.The sound, oh the sound! It\u2019s that classic JBL clarity and crispness, minus any annoying Bluetooth hiccups. Don\u2019t expect to shake the walls with its volume, though. It\u2019s loud enough for normal activities, but if you\u2019re planning to outdo your neighbors in a sound battle, this isn't your weapon of choice.Now, the clip is a game-changer. It\u2019s not your average flimsy clip. This thing latches onto anything - doorknobs, backpacks, belt loops - without a hitch. It\u2019s like, clip it and forget it\u2019s even there. That's how good it is.Battery life? They say 10 hours, but it feels like forever. I got a solid 8-9 hours straight out of the box, no charging needed.Okay, tiny gripe time. It has these little rubber nubs at the bottom, probably for grip. They're kind of annoying against the skin, but hey, 90% of the time, it\u2019s clipped onto something, so no biggie.To sum it up:Sound quality: 9/10 - Pure clarity.Volume: 7/10 - Just right for the average Joe.Portability: 10/10 - Clip and go!Waterproofness: 10/10 - Pool party approved.Battery life: 10/10 - Lasts almost an eternity.Color: 10/10 - The pink is even prettier in real life.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Stylish and portable design with a sturdy carabinerExcellent waterproof performanceImpressive battery life for long-lasting playtimeIdeal for quieter settingsDurable and built to withstand outdoor adventuresCons:Not super loud for noisy environmentsMicrophone quality not the bestThe JBL Clip 3 in Blue is an exceptional waterproof, durable, and portable Bluetooth speaker that has truly won me over! It's become my go-to companion for outdoor adventures and impromptu hangouts with friends. While there are a couple of minor considerations, everything else about this speaker is simply fantastic.The first thing that caught my attention was its stunning blue color, making it a stylish addition to my outdoor gear. Its compact size and sturdy build make it incredibly portable, and the integrated carabiner allows me to clip it to my backpack with ease. This convenience is unbeatable, especially during hikes and beach outings.As for its waterproof feature, I've tested it by the poolside, and it passed with flying colors! I don't have to worry about accidental splashes or light rain; the JBL Clip 3 handles it like a pro.The battery life is another highlight, offering up to 10 hours of continuous playtime. I can enjoy my favorite tunes all day long without needing frequent charging breaks.The noise-canceling speakerphone is a great addition, ensuring crystal-clear calls, even in noisy environments. My friends were amazed at the quality of our phone calls during our outdoor gatherings.Now, while the sound quality is impressive for its size, I did notice that the speaker isn't super loud. In quieter surroundings, it's perfect, but in noisy outdoor settings, I wished for a bit more volume.Another consideration is that I haven't tested the microphone quality extensively during calls. Although the speakerphone worked well for me, I can't provide a detailed assessment of its performance in various scenarios.Despite these minor points, the JBL Clip 3 excels in almost every other aspect. Its portability, durability, and waterproof capabilities make it the perfect travel companion, and the battery life ensures hours of uninterrupted enjoyment.In conclusion, the JBL Clip 3 in Blue is a top-notch Bluetooth speaker that offers remarkable portability, durability, and sound quality for most situations. Its versatility makes it an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable outdoor companion. Though not the loudest and microphone quality not extensively tested, its impressive features far outweigh these minor considerations. If you're looking for a compact and powerful speaker to enhance your outdoor experiences, the JBL Clip 3 is an outstanding choice!",

Good for travelling. Had a very useful clip. Right now, it\u2019s clipped to my shower rod for shower music and makes for amazing acoustics. Got it on a flash deal. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019d pay full price. I have a Charge 4 and it\u2019s a better quality and lasts longer. If you have another JBL,You can link them and have the same music playing all around your house. Super neat aspect to JBL",
