It cleans and feels so fresh for quite a long while after using. I would not advise for children or anyone who doesn't tolerate say, Listering and very strong/burny sorts of washes, it is potent! I pour an amount of wash into the cap and then fill with water, so even diluted, it is a freshness bomb and I enjoy it",
