It's made such a difference on how the way my mouth feels during the way, and it really has reduced my plaque and tartar. I used some plaque staining pills so show me the difference and there is a real, verifiable difference.",

However, the Amazon Basics version is pretty good, but still more expensive than, for example, the Walmart version.",
