My breath is also very fresh. I like the taste very much. It is not very irritating and is very gentle. I think this mouthwash is very helpful in repairing tooth enamel. I have always had problems with tooth sensitivity and acid erosion, so I bought this mouthwash to try. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so effective. After using it for less than a week, I found that my teeth no longer hurt so much, and the color of my teeth was also better. It has also become more uniform and not as yellow as before. The taste of this mouthwash is also very good, very refreshing, not as spicy as some mouthwashes, which makes me feel very comfortable. I think this mouthwash is the best one I have ever used. It can not only reduce tooth sensitivity, but also repair tooth enamel and protect tooth health. I am very satisfied.",

Also, the fact that it protects against cavities and helps repair enamel is a plus. Although, I will leave that up to my dentist to determine at my next visit.Make sure to not drink or eat anything for half an hour after using it.",

This was the perfect product for him.The mouthwash isn't aggressive but is refreshing. It helps his breath smell better while also potentially helping protect and repair his enamel. I'm not sure how you're able to see the results of that, but it's nice to know it has that potential.He's been using this mouthwash each day for about a week now and enjoys how gentle it is and how refreshing it makes his mouth feel.",
