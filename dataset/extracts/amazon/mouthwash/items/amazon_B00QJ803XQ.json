Can a person really be cavity-prone? An imbalance in your mouth causes cavities, and when dentists drill and fill cavities, they are only treating the result, not the imbalance itself\u2014and the decay returns. For many, it's a frustrating, reactive approach to oral health, but not surprising. Until recently, dentists were taught that you'd be free of decay if you have good oral hygiene. The problem is that it's just not that simple. Break the cycle of decay with CariFree. CariFree's pH-elevated products fix the problem at its source. Safe to use every day, our non-abrasive products are highly effective and scientifically proven to prevent cavities. CariFree Maintenance Rinse CTx3 Rinse is one of CariFree's most popular products due to its great taste and fresh feeling. This scientifically proven formula contains cavity-fighting fluoride, xylitol, and an elevated pH. Maintenance Rinse is non-staining, alcohol-free, and recommended by dentists twice daily for ages 6+. For best results, we suggest pairing our Maintenance Rinse and CariFree Gel 1100 - rinsing first and brushing second so that the nano-hydroxyapatite in the gel remains on the teeth for additional protection.",
