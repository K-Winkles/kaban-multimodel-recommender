Can a person really be cavity-prone? An imbalance in your mouth causes cavities, and when dentists drill and fill cavities, they are only treating the result, not the imbalance itself\u2014and the decay returns. For many, it's a frustrating, reactive approach to oral health, but not surprising. Until recently, dentists were taught that you'd be free of decay if you have good oral hygiene. The problem is that it's just not that simple. Break the cycle of decay with CariFree. CariFree's pH-elevated products fix the problem at its source. Safe to use every day, our non-abrasive products are highly effective and scientifically proven to prevent cavities. Maintenance Rinse is one of CariFree's most popular products due to the great taste and fresh feeling after use. This scientifically proven formula contains cavity-fighting fluoride, xylitol, and an elevated pH. Maintenance Rinse is non-staining, alcohol-free, and is recommended by dentists for use twice daily and for ages 6+. For best results, we suggest pairing the Maintenance Rinse and the Carifree Gel 1100 - rinsing first and brushing second so that the nanohydroxyapatite in the CariFree Gel 1100 remains on the teeth for additional protection.",

                "reviewText": "This alcohol-sugar sweetened Kool-aid tasting mouth rise is effective for minimizing periodontal disease related tooth decay and reduces enamel loss. CariFree does this with it's active fluoride, while minimizes dry mouth, and quickly neutralizes acidic saliva but that's mostly what it does. It is not anti-bacterial, anti-plaque, anti-halitosis, nor does it regenerate tooth enamel. The inexpensive chemical ingredients that make up this do not justify the 3 to 4 times higher price over commercial mouth rinses for a one month supply.",
