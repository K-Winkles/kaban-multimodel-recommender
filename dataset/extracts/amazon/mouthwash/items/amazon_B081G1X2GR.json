        "description": "Nano silver+ Xylitol + Calcium. Alcohol free. SLS free. fluoride free. Safe for kids. Non Burning. Neutralizes oral acid. Kills bad bacteria. Dentst formulated with plant silver. Sugar doesn't cause cavities, acid does. Despite popular belief, sometimes brushing more and eating less sugar still doesn't prevent cavities. Traditional oral care products aren't fighting the real issue, bad pH levels. Harmful oral acid is created when carbs we eat are consumed by bacteria . Carbs/Sugar + Bacteria = Acid. Most mouth rinse brands attempt to kill bacteria with formulas that only introduce more acid into the mouth. Our Nano Silver Rinse neutralizes acid, targets bad bacteria and delivers Calcium + Xylitol directly to your teeth. See where your current product lands on the pH scale. BFP Nanotech: Our patent-pending technology uses plant-based Nano SIlver particles to open channels in the BioFilm, aka plague, to allow the tooth to uptake much needed calcium & xylitol while neutralizing oral acid. We created this revolutionary breakthrough because, as dentists, we were frustrated by other products that merely bounce off of the BioFIlm barrier and have marginal effects on your teeth. Dentist Formulated: We are Dentists. We engineered this formula because we were tired of telling patients to brush more and enjoy sugar less, even though those things weren't solving the issues. Our revolutionary BFP Nano Tech breakthrough is changing the way dentists have looked at dental products for the last 100 years. Ray Nar. Matt Callister. Diabetic safe. ElementaSilver.com.
