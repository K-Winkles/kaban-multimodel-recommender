                "reviewText": "I usually like Closys. My subscribe and save is for the fresh breath one, however I was sent the Healthy Gums variety this last time. I hate it. I cannot use it anymore. I noticed the first time that it tasted different and my mouth felt really weird after. I still used it the next morning. Then, I couldn\u2019t taste anything for the rest of the day. I still used it again the second night, for a total of three uses over two days. I again couldn\u2019t really taste anything the next day. I would have thought I have Covid, except I had read that this sometimes happens when you start using Closys. But since I never had a problem with the Fresh Breath variety, I assumed I would be fine with Healthy Gums one. It feels like you are gargling peroxide. And now, I haven\u2019t used it in over 24 hours, I still can\u2019t taste, and my mouth hurts. Not like a bad pain, but irritated and dry. I\u2019m hoping I can start tasting again soon.",

                "reviewText": "CloSYS Sensitive Mouthwash has become my go-to choice for refreshing and gentle oral care. The alcohol-free formula, combined with a gentle mint flavor, provides a soothing experience without the harshness often associated with traditional mouthwashes. I appreciate the dye-free and pH-balanced features, making it suitable for sensitive mouths. The 32-ounce size ensures long-lasting use, and the effectiveness in promoting oral health is evident. Whether used on its own or as part of a complete oral care routine, CloSYS Sensitive Mouthwash deserves a solid 5-star rating for its commitment to a gentle yet refreshing experience.",
