                "reviewText": "I bought this mouthwash because it uses tea tree oil, which is reportedly very natural and healing. Although most people use mouthwash to freshen their breath, I purchased this product with the intent to not only freshen my breath, but also to see if the tea tree oil would heal any potential cavities and kill any bacteria not visible to the eye. I am about halfway done with the bottle; it has a very subtle flavor, Nothing too strong. I have yet to note any other differences however, I most likely would repurchased under the grounds that I am trying to live a more holistic lifestyle and use less toxic chemicals in my personal hygiene products. I do, however, wish that this was more affordable for the amount that you receive. I understand more pure, minimally processed products will cost more. I am just accustomed to buying a huge bottle of Listerine for half the price that\u2019s the only con that is unsettling. However, as far as quality, If I note any benefits through long-term use, I will provide an update.",

                "reviewText": "This tea tree mouthwash (as well as an identical one from Trader Joe's that they don't carry anymore) has proven to be the only thing that clears up my canker sores, which are raw patches inside the mouth that seem to flare up during the female hormone cycle. Not to be confused with cold sores, which are scabs on top of the lip - I'm talking about sores inside the mouth that cannot be seen unless you open your mouth and pull down your lip. I think it must be a hereditary problem as it affects my mother and daughter as well. Sometimes, I get flare ups so bad they go all the way around inside my mouth following the tooth line and make eating a chore.I was so happy I found this formula to be like the one from Trader Joe's which I had been missing for years after they stopped carrying it. This is a tiny bottle, but I found it doesn't take much to help, nor do I need to use it daily. I find relief within a day of using it on my canker sores, and otherwise use it a couple times a week. As a bonus, I had a patch of gingivitis that wouldn't budge for anything. It was red for at least a year and sometimes bled. It went away within a month after I started using this mouthwash.I am so happy to have found an effective mouthwash again and I highly recommend it.",

While I had a bad tooth and I had to wait to have it pulled do to lockdown this product saved me. It kept the tooth from getting infected and kept the pain at a minimum. Thankfully the dentist eventually reopened from lockdown and pulled my tooth. Now I will always use this.",
