        "description": "The patented TheraBreath formula in Fresh Breath Oral Rinse has used the power of oxygen to target bad-breath-causing bacteria deep below the surface of the tongue and at the back of the throat for more than 20 years. Dr. Katz\u2019s certified kosher and alcohol-free rinse doesn't burn or sting, making it easy to use every day and gentle on mouth sores. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse has been recommended by dentists and pharmacists for people looking for a clinically tested oral rinse that truly combats bad breath odor at the source. Our fresh breath mouthwash eliminates halitosis (the medical term for bad breath) \u2013 instantly. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is free of dyes, perfumes, detergents, and other harsh additives that can dry or damage the mouth. It has been approved by the ADA and is one of the United States\u2019 best-selling specialty oral hygiene treatments.Dr. Katz\u2019s oral rinse works by using oxygenating compounds to attack the sulfur-producing bacteria that cause morning breath and food odor. In fact, several studies have verified that TheraBreath is extremely effective at attacking bad breath odor for over 12 hours. This safe-to-use daily oral rinse formula does not contain alcohol, artificial flavors, or colors. It is pH-balanced to maintain a non-acidic environment in the mouth, which reduces burning and enamel erosion while preventing tooth and gum sensitivity. Unlike other specialty oral rinse formulas, TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is available without a prescription.This product is sold as a pack of six 3-ounce bottles and is available in an invigorating Icy Mint flavor - a taste that comes partially from the inclusion of xylitol, a natural sweetener with proven oral health benefits. As with all our products, TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is guaranteed to work to your satisfaction or your money back!",
