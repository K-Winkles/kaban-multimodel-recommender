I've been trying to make more eco conscious purchases, and wanted to give this mouthwash a try in my morning routine. It does not have a great fresh taste like the usual mouthwashes I've used and am used to, but if you can get over the flavor it is still a worth while product. As far as the whitening aspect claimed in the description I'm not sure I can vouch for that, but it may just be that my teeth are already in a good white condition, as I care for them more than the average person. But by all means this is a decent product, and if you're fine with the trade off of taste for the environment, then I'm right there with you brother!",

It doesn't taste good but I could get past that if it didn't irritate my gums just as much as the alcoholic famous brand mouthwash I used to use. I trusted the desert essence brand but in this product they dropped the ball IMHO. First ingredient WATER. Second ingedient GLYCERIN. Third ingredient POLYSORBATE 80. A preservative? I suspect you might be better off rinsing your mouth with certain pantry staples. One more thing: It's expensive for the size. 16 oz. It's opened. It's going down the drain. Money wasted.

                "reviewText": "It tastes so foul, I gagged on it. It tastes like plastic smells. Also, it's is NOT for oil pulling as one reviewer states. It's mostly water with some coconut oil added but it is not pure coconut oil. Oil pulling is done with only pure oil, not with watered down oil. As well, the instructions only say to rinse for a minute. Oil pulling is for 20 minutes. Outrageous price for mostly water. And I suspect the bad taste is from pepper. Why on earth did they have to put pepper in a mouthwash?",
