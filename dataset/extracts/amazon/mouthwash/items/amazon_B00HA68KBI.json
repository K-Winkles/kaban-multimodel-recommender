                "reviewText": "It all started with a slightly sore tooth and sore gums. Looking back this was my fault as my brushing regime was not at its best and I would constantly miss that section of the teeth/gums. (Front Right Lower)Not having the tightest regime introduced my mouth to some unwelcome guests and caused me some gingivitis. I realized this with an odd tooth ache and very sore gums around an area.Swiftly I started to brush that area constantly, and probably over did it too, but my mouth is not a bacteria playground so had to show who is boss of my mouth house. Bloody mess of a time.Brushing, flossing and regular mouthwash in my head was not enough. (at this point I am tearing up the mouth 4 times a day easy) Reading that a toothache with gingivitis could become a much bigger problem I got a little upset at these sneaky bacterial causing gingivitis infiltrators.This led me to go research more drastic measures. Key words like \u201cclinical\u201d measures. Play time was over.I stumbled on this product. Looking at its key ingredient \u201cCetylpyhridinium choride\u201d made it a no brainer. I mean look at the description of this stuff.\u201cCPC is a well-known, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent used in over-the-counter rinses to promote gingival health. It acts by penetrating the cell membrane, causing cell components to leak, which eventually leads to cell death.\u201dIf you want to get rid of something this is must be it.Next is where my errors started.Once I got my hands on this product, I used it a lot! Like a lot! Maybe every hour a lot. Was this a smart idea? Nope. But I never said I was smart either.At one point I should have stopped as I started to feel a burning sensation in the gums but in my head that was gingivitis trying to go on a counter offensive and I am not going to have any of that! My final mouthwash with this stuff was before bed and I made sure to give that bacteria hell.Fast forward to about 6 am and that is when the real fun started. I am awakened by this burning sensation in my mouth. Gums on fire. My tongue feels like I been making out with a flame. My jaw right under my ears so swollen that it felt like I was growing two small balloons. Ringing in the ears.This brought me to the reviews just to see if it was a known issue. And quickly realized I am not the only one that has fallen a culprit to this Mouth Napalm.On the plus side, besides the burning feeling like I just ate a freshly microwaved pizza pocket the gums are starting to look good! The redness is pretty much gone, toothache is gone. This stuff does work.I am not sure how others used this product to cause this miserable hell but from my experience do not use this as regular mouth wash. This is the grenade of mouthwashes.Once my mouth heals and swelling by the ears comes down, I will be using this at most once a week. And after mouth washing with this, I will rinse my mouth again with water to make sure none of the CPC is left in my mouth.Over all the products works great but do not treat and use it as regular mouthwash. It is not. It is Mouth Napalm.",

                "reviewText": "I've made good progress with maintaining gum health ever since I started using this moutwash and interdental brushes.However, the most striking thing is the flavor. It tastes and smells better than any mouthwash I've ever used, and (this is a big deal to me) I can eat something 10 minutes later without the mouthwash taking over and synthesizing disgusting flavors.It's like the effervescence in the mouthwash quickly fades, leaving a neutral clean mouth feeling. Then you can eat or drink without the mixed flavors of mouthwash and what you're consuming. Hopefully that makes sense.",
