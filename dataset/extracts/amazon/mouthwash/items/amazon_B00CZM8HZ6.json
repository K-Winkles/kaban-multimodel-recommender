        "description": "A bottle of Lavoris mouthwash has sold somewhere in the world every day for the last 100+ years. Lavoris was first used during the civil war as an antiseptic and later marketed as a mouthwash in 1903. Clinically proven to fight \"morning breath\" with zantrate. Zantrate is a trademark name to describe a patented process that makes lavoris \"unique\". Zantrate eliminates the bacterial compounds that cause bad breath. Zantrate 'zaps' malodors and gives you a clean mouth and longer lasting fresh breath. From 1980-1990 Lavoris with zantrate underwent several studies that illustrated that lavoris with zantrate lasts three times as long as other name brand mouthwashes. Further, clinical testing has shown that when lavoris is used before bed. It can eliminate malodors associated with morning breath. Lavoris uses natural clove and cinnamon. It is a low alcohol formulation- 4% as compared to 12% to 25% for other branded products. Includes four 15 fl oz (444 ml) plastic bottles.",
