                "reviewText": "This mouthwash is one of the very few non-sweet rinses I have found available on the market today. My understanding is that when you use a mouthwash or toothpaste containing sugars/sweeteners, the bacteria in your mouth break down these compounds and release acids as a byproduct. This process lowers the pH level of your saliva. The end product of this process under anaerobic conditions is lactic acid. This lactic acid creates extra acidity that can decrease the pH to the extent of dissolving the calcium phosphate in the tooth enamel, leading to the start of a cavity. The acids released include lactic acid, butyric acid, and aspartic acid. When the pH level of your saliva goes below 5.5, the enamel of your teeth begins to break down, which is the first step in the formation of a cavity. So, I am wondering as to why there are so few non-sweet mouthwashes or toothpastes on the market!",

This mouthwash is cleansing, refreshing, & very kind to your mouth. If you have sensitive skin or need a more mild mouthwash, this should work very well. I thought the price was a little high, but everything in the USA seems to be overpriced these days, compared to a few yrs. ago. Still, I think you can count on Dale Audrey products as a more natural & soothing alternative for your body than the more commercial, chemical solutions.",

It is a lot like swimming in the ocean, and accidently swallowing some sea water.If you are torn as to whether you should or should not give it a try, I need to point out that there is a free trial-size sample available for this product before you buy. Just head to your kitchen, draw about a third of a cup of water, put a pinch of salt in it, then add a shake of cinnamon, stir, then gargle. If you love it, then you can choose whether you want to continue drawing free samples, or go ahead a buy the product.",
