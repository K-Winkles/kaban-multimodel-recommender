                "reviewText": "After purchasing this from my dentist per their recommendation, I sought a refill on Amazon because it was the cheapest price available at the time.Because I have a night guard, it's important for me to use a Mouthwash daily buy regular alcohol or non-alcoholic mouthwashes were leaving my mouth dry and killing all of the good bacteria in addition to bad in my mouth.My dentist claims this Mouthwash does a better job killing the bad bacteria and leaving the good.I also have sensitive teeth and gums; this minty fresh tonic is perfect for cleaning without hurting my teeth or gums.The bottle is made of glass because the tonic inside looks a bit milky almost like a live probiotic in kombucha. It does not store well on traditional travel size plastic containers, because the tonic will find a way to leak through those materials. If you're looking for a travel size I don't think Amazon carries it yet, but the producer does on their website.Overall, I reccomend this product for someone looking for a more natural way to rinse their mouth or someone looking for something that works well with dry mouth and sensitive teeth or gums.",

After nightly use for about a month, I really see an improvement.It also lasts a long time--you don't need to use much and it can be diluted with a tiny splash of water to make the taste not as strong. I just bought my second bottle!",

It was recommended by my dentist after oral surgery, and I continued to use it.This is a luxury item, though, and due to price, I may eventually find something else. Whenever I'm actually at my dentist's office, I pick up a few bottles there and save a few dollars.",
