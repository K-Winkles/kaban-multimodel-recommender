I do prefer the minty saltiness instead of the burning alcohol effect of other types. Also, the fact that it contains trace minerals and colloidal silver as an anti microbial/antibacterial is a plus! It is very effective and has a rather short but list of useful ingredients (which is what I often look for). Everything I get from this company is great.My only complaint is that the lid came cracked. The plastic seal remained intact so the product was still good.",
