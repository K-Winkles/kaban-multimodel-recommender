I bought this product and when it was time to replenish, saw another bottle by the same manufacturer Nature's Answer. The other product is called Perio Brite. I looked over every single ingredient, and guess what? They're exactly the same! The only difference I could find in the two products was the label. I guess the one is \"Doctor recommended\" and the other isn't??? I've used both and they taste and work exactly the same. I'm not sure what kind of whacked out conspiracy this is, but unless I'm really missing something, the exact same product cost twice as much for a different label. So answer the question: do I want to pay half as much for the same product? Ummm... Yes???",

                "reviewText": "When the nutritionist had recommended this product there were some issues with inflammation around several areas of the gums. I followed the directions on the bottle (which are written clearly, easy to follow) and by the next dental visit the inflammation had gone completely. Just as with anything else in life in order to achieve desired results it is necessary to be consistent. The recommendation is to rinse for 30 - 60 seconds after having brushed with Periopaste Toothpaste. In my experience it is best to begin with a 30 second rinse as the product may feel a little intense. (This sensitivity may be caused by either the presence of inflammation~~~or perhaps it is a matter of getting used to the product). It is important to note that this mouthwash is fluoride free, preservative free, alcohol free, and sodium lauryl sulfate free. Is it expensive? Things are relative. Since this mouthwash was recommended by the nutritionist and my holistic dentist (during separate consultations) I feel confident that PerioClear Organic Alcohol Free Mouthwash 16 oz is safe to use without hidden nasties contained therein. Again...is it too expensive? In this case you get what you pay for. What goes into the mouth affects the body's cells and tissues...ultimately your overall health.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a natural product with no artificial ingredients, no harmful sweeteners (saccharin, aspartame, etc), and something that just works safely. Well, this is it! It has a pleasant herbal flavor, but not overpowering and doesn't have that \"medicine\" taste. It works quickly, and you only need a little bit. About a half cap will do the job, so while it might seem expensive it lasts a long time. I like it enough that sometimes I just skip the toothpaste and brush with the PerioClear. The ingredients are all responsible and safe, no garbage like the supermarket brands. Here's a complete list of ingredients from the package:INGREDIENTS: Phytoplenolin\u00ae (Centipeda Cunninghamii Extract), Bio-Chelated\u00ae Extracts of Calendula Flower, Chamomile Flower, Echinacea Purpurea Tops, Gotu Kola Herb, Prickly Ash Bark, Olive Leaf, Grapefruit Seed, Black Walnut Green Hulls, Green Tea Leaf, Goldenseal Rhizome, Essential Oils of Peppermint, Oregano, Rosemary, Lavender, Cinnamon, Clove, Lemon Balm, Eucalyptus, Thyme, Bio-SaponinTM (Quillaia, Yucca Extract, Sarsparilla Root Extract, Wild Yam Root Extract), Xylitol, Folic Acid, Aloe PhytogelTM (Aloe Barbadensis), Coenzyme Q10, Chlorophyll.Base Ingredients: USP Purified Water, Vegetable Glycerin.",
