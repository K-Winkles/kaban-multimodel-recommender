I use this combined with the Crest enamel and gum repair and my gums have never been this healthy before. My routine is flossing, brushing, tongue scraper and finish off with the mouth rinse. I do not drink or eat for 30 minutes after. Rinse and repeat AM and PM. I AM NOT A DENTIST NOR A HYGIENIST. THIS ROUTINE IS WHTA WORKS FOR ME. This really sealed the deal in helping my gums look and feel healthier. Will purchase again once I'm close of running out.",

                "reviewText": "I recently started using TheraBreath Healthy Gums Mouthwash in the Clean Mint flavor, and it has quickly become a go-to choice for maintaining oral health. Here's my review based on my experience with the double pack:Pros:Effective Antigingivitis Formula:TheraBreath's Healthy Gums Mouthwash is dentist-formulated with an antigingivitis formula. It provides effective support for gum health, which is essential for overall oral care.Clean Mint Flavor:The Clean Mint flavor is refreshing without being overpowering. It leaves a clean and pleasant taste in the mouth, making it a suitable choice for regular use.Convenient Double Pack:The double pack is a thoughtful and convenient option. Having two bottles allows for versatility, such as keeping one at home and sending the other with your husband on-the-road (OTR). It ensures consistent use in different settings.Subscription Option:Opting for a subscription adds an extra layer of convenience. Knowing that the product will be delivered regularly eliminates the need to worry about running out and provides a hassle-free solution.Economical Savings:Purchasing the double pack as part of a subscription proves to be more economical than buying individual bottles in-store. This can result in cost savings over time, making it a budget-friendly choice.Dentist-Recommended Brand:TheraBreath is a brand known for dentist-formulated oral care products. The fact that it's dentist-recommended adds a level of trust and confidence in the product's effectiveness.Cons:Preference for Different Flavors:While the Clean Mint flavor is well-received, some users might prefer a variety of flavors. Exploring different options within the TheraBreath range could cater to diverse preferences.Overall Impression:TheraBreath Healthy Gums Mouthwash in Clean Mint is a reliable choice for maintaining oral hygiene, and the double pack with a subscription option enhances its convenience. The refreshing flavor, combined with the dentist-formulated antigingivitis formula, creates a positive user experience.I recommend TheraBreath Healthy Gums Mouthwash to those who prioritize gum health and enjoy the benefits of a clean mint flavor. The subscription model, offering economical savings and consistent supply, makes it a practical choice for maintaining a healthy oral care routine at home and on-the-go. I look forward to exploring different flavors within the TheraBreath range in the future.",
