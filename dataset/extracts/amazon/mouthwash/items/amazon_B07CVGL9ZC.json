It is a bit odd, in that the charcoal makes it a black color\u2026which doesn\u2019t stain your teeth, but it does make a bit of a mess in your sink unless you\u2019re careful. (Hence the 4 stars).But it works and doesn\u2019t have alcohol, so we keep using it.",

I've been using their toothpaste and mouthwash for more than a year now, and I'm certain they're the best. After I floss and brush, I swish the mouthwash for several minutes, because the aloe vera has healing properties, and the coconut oil is what Ayurvedic medicine uses for \"oil pulling\" (look it up -- it's a proven detox method for removing toxicity from the blood, tongue and teeth).This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours, and does not have a sting or an overpowering flavor. Try it, I did, and now it's the only one I want to use.",
