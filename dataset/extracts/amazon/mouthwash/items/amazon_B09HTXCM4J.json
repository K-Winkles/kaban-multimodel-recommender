And I'm not sure that long-term oral use of hydrogen peroxide is a good thing.This Paradontax is much easier to use. No peroxide. No razor blades.Maintaining oral hygiene is not my favorite thing. But after a couple of weeks of using Parodontax, I just flossed, brushed, and there was no blood. Sometimes I remember to swish twice a day, as the instructions say. It all cuts into my sleep time. Hard to persevere.By the way, the mint flavor is not overwhelming. It's ok.----2\u00bd months after my first 3-pack...I'm back to buy another 3-pack. The colorless \"Clean Mint\" isn't available today. One thing that sold me on the colorless version was it has no unnecessary coloring ingredients. The blue \"Mint\" is available, and one reviewer says \"the blue one is better.\" Who am I to argue; I'll get a 3-pack of the blue \"Mint.\" I hope the blue coloring doesn't give me cancer in 30 years, just in case democracy and Planet Earth will be here in 30 years.",
