Your teeth can and should be whitened without the use of harsh bleaches that damage your tooth structure, leading to sensitivity. (16 oz - Pack of 2)",

So, we set out to scientifically show your brightest smile could be achieved with Lumineux and we have! With over 50 double-blind, university studies backing us up, Lumineux can proudly say we clean, freshen and whiten without harsh chemicals!",
            "Microbiome Safe: This one is unique. In fact, I would wager that Lumineux is the only oral care company on the market that can claim that we are certified non-toxic and microbiome safe. That means our products actually work with your body to achieve oral health by protecting your good bacteria and detoxifying the bad.",

            "Oils Vs Bleach: Most products use peroxide to remove stains, which removes enamel to get rid of stains. Lumineux uses potent essential oils that break up stains instead, whitening your teeth without damaging your enamel. Plus, they\u2019re yummier."

I get mint, clove, and even some citrus with every swish, and it keeps my mouth feeling fresh.Since I can\u2019t get fluoride treatments at the dentist due to severe gut reactions, I still use Tom\u2019s of Maine Fluoride mouthwash after brushing after breakfast, and also after brushing and flossing before bed. This is what I use regularly throughout the day to prevent food particles from sitting between teeth, and to prevent tonsil stones.With that, I believe my teeth were already as naturally white as they could be when I started using this product and the toothpaste a few months ago. I\u2019ve not noticed any whitening. But, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work for others. Plus, the taste is great, I haven\u2019t had a tonsil stone since starting, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean for hours after. Worth it.5/5",

I will definitely continue to use it. I will say when you pour it in your mouth it may SEEM tastefully unpleasant but as you swish, it\u2019s not bad AT ALL!",
