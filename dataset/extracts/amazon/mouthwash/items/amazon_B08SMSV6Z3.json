                "reviewText": "This was the mouthwash used by my dentist, so I bought it as it worked so well after a cleaning. It's a bit hard to find as not all stores carry it, though it's very available on-line.The most amazing thing I noted was that, after having my teeth cleaned, and after brushing morning and night, and flossing at night as well, I was waking up with almost NO feeling of that coating of bacteria and plaque on my teeth or tongue in the morning. And that went on for almost 3 months. I've NEVER had that great of an effect from a mouthwash in my LIFE.Now, it's a bit rough to swish for a full 30 seconds, (which, according to my dentist, is the minimum length of time you need to swish for the stuff to even work). It does burn. It'll help to stop swishing and just hold it in your mouth when the burning sensation gets too bad. That will calm the sensation down, but will still be soaking your mouth. Then start swishing again as the burn fades.I've even dipped my flossers into this as I do each tooth. (My dentist said that wasn't necessary, but this stuff works so well I figured I might as well get it all they way up under my gums.) So VERY worth the money!It will NOT work especially well if you do not brush and floss first and swish for at least 30 seconds. Just use it correctly; don't fight the product.HIGHLY RECOMMEND, BUT USE PROPERLY.",

                "reviewText": "I started to use this mouthwash because it was used by a number of dentists and hygienists that I have used or that I know. The fact that it fights tartar was a key to my decision, as I want as much protection from tooth and gum disease as possible. This mouthwash does it all.The only caveat I would like to point out is that the description makes it look like the 2 pack is of two 33.814-ounce bottles. It actually is a 2 pack of 16-ounce bottles and the pictures in the description do indeed show the bottles are 500ml/16 ounces.",
