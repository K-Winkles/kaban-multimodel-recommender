Fortunately, I found the new Crest Scope \"Get Fresh.\" (Why do they feel the need to mix both brand names? )After one or two uses, I say that the two are similar. It still isn't quite to the level of my old Crest Wintermint, but it'll have to do considering it's the best alternative.Pros: - Similar mint flavor - Same active ingredientsCons: - Mint flavor is overpowering - The need to include multiple brands like scope - Lack of options in Wintermint",
