                "reviewText": "I love this mouth wash. It really is tasteless. It is alcohol free so it doesn\u2019t burn. I use it to pre-rinse my mouth before brushing. Kind of a boost for the brushing. I use very little toothpaste. Then I rinse with the harsh but great mouthwash, followed by act fluoride rinse. I know\u2026but I am careful not to accidentally swallow any. The difference in my mouth health since I started this is so exciting! My breath is even fresh when I wake up. I do this morning and before bed.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouthwash because a clinical trail said it was good for gum health and prevented and reversed gum damaging effects. . I measured out the amount they suggest to use but it was a lot so I use about half of that amount. I swished it and spit it out but I didn't rinse after because it was recomended not to so the mouthrinse would coat my teeth, gums, and protect it or whatever.I used it before bed, figured a smart time to use it, it was around 11pm ish. It is Now 11:30 am the next day and i've tried eating a piece of cheese and eating a hotdog and Most of my sense of taste is gone. I can tell it is salty but I can't tell that it was cheese, I couldn't taste the meat. The Top surface of my tongue feels sorta numb.I went online to look up about this effect and found that on wikipedia \"Temporary loss of taste:In a small percentage of population, CPC can alter or eliminate the sense of taste. The effect generally goes away a few days after discontinuing use of the product.\"WTF?! Seems likt that sould be included in the warnings on the Product Label!I don't know how well the product works for deep cleaning or gum health because I've only used it 3 times but This is going to be a problem if I cannot taste my food.The Product works well to reduce plague and tartar because you won't want to eat any food!!! /Sarcasm8/3/2023I have started a return and have yet to take it to UPS and I'm tryig to find a way to use this. Y'know how you press your tongue against the roof of your mouth to stop Brain-Freeze? Well, I tried doing that while rinsing with this product. I basically poured it into my mouth underneath my tongue and sorta jiggled it back and forth with my cheeks before spitting it out, preventing any of it from coating the top of my tongue. I followed the rest of the dental routine with regular toothpaste, and then the Listerine alcohol wash and then the Act No Alcohol wash, all while keeping my tongue against the roof. This morning I was able to enjoy some seasoned eggs and I was able to taste them just fine. For me this is proof that I should NOT allow CloSys to come into contact with my tastebuds.Since I've heard good things about it, other than this, I may keep it and do this oddball tongue gymnastics while using it. Perhaps it can still give me a jumpstart on better dental health, but it is a certainty that I will NOT be purchasing it again once I run out, Unless my gums completery revert back to childhood quality!
