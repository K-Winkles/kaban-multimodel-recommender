Majority of them have fluoride as the main ingredient. Fluoride is found in all toothpaste. In particular I look for mouthwash that contains Cetylpyridinium Chloride. This bottle of Parodontax has it. CPC helps kill bacteria in the mouth that causes gum problems. All ingredients in mouthwashes and toothpaste have the aim of giving you a healthy mouth but those with CPC is a little better. This is alcohol free and tastes like mint.I'm in for anything that will keep my mouth healthy. Parodontax is as good as the other leading brands. Will recommend.",

The only downside is the higher cost.",
