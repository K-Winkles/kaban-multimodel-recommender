I was also wondering what this pink liquid would taste like, thoughts of bubble gum went through my head, but the flavor is actually very good! The label says it is \u201cIcy Mint\u201d which was not very minty to me but rather a very pleasant refreshing flavor that lasts a very long time\u2026 longer than other mouthwashes I have used. I like this mouthwash and won\u2019t hesitate to get it again.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very... zincy (Listerine Clinical Solutions Gum Health Antiseptic Mouthwash)",
                "reviewText": "Initially tastes much like any other mouthwash before fading to an initially fruity (almost bubblegum) flavor. Then the zinc kicks in. It tastes like a zinc lozengier and that taste sticks around for hours. That's got to be a good thing and suggests the zinc really persists.Contains alcohol but no flouride.Seems like a fine mouthwash with a zincy twist.",
