According to the American Dental Association (ADA), incorporating mouthwash into your daily routine also allows you to clean tiny crevices in your mouth that cannot be reached by a toothbrush. However, most conventional mouthwash formulas contain harmful ingredients, such as fluoride, alcohol and saccharin, which are bad for your oral health and can actually do more harm than good. Keeping your mouth moist and pH balanced is crucial for maintaining good oral health. Most mouthwashes fall below a 5.5 pH which makes your mouth extremely acidic and can lead to a dry mouth, bad breath, and even cavities.",

Our mouthwash is 100% raw, natural and clean in a BPA free bottle. All of our products are made in the USA. Chemical-Free The harmful ingredients in conventional mouthwash formulas can kill the good germs in your mouth, which are crucial for maintaining optimal oral health. Some ingredients can even cause tooth sensitivity and erode tooth enamel.

You won\u2019t find any alcohol, SLS, fluoride, or chemical of any kind in our products.

                "reviewText": "After extensive research for a \"healthy\" mouthwash, I discovered this one on Amazon. It excels in taste, scent, and effectiveness, providing a welcome alternative to major brands with their alcohol-y taste. I appreciate avoiding additional fluoride in my dental routine. Post-dental deep cleanings, it aided in healing minor bleeding and freshening my breath. Remarkably, it seems to contribute to teeth whitening. The hydroxyapatite ingredient is a plus for remineralizing enamel, promoting stronger, healthier teeth. Despite receiving a batch with floating colloidal silver, a quick shake resolves it. While some might find it unsightly, I don't mind. This mouthwash appears to be a permanent addition to my routine, and I'm eager to try the other flavors (Cinnamon & Spearmint) to find my favorite \ud83d\udc9a",
