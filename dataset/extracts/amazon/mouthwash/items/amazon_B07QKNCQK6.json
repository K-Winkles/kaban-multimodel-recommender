After finishing my first bottle, I can confidently say that it is a great choice for those looking to brighten their teeth. In fact, both my husband and I really like it, and he's usually quite picky about these types of products.Aside from its effective hydrogen peroxide formula, I appreciate the refreshing minty taste of the mouthwash, which leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. It also doesn't cause any burning or irritation, even with regular use.One of the best things about ACT Whitening Mouthwash is its great value. It's affordable and effective, making it a great alternative to more expensive professional treatments. In fact, I've already repurchased it after finishing my first bottle.However, as with any whitening product, it's worth being mindful of potential sensitivity or irritation.Overall, I highly recommend ACT Whitening Mouthwash to anyone looking to whiten their teeth. Its effective formula, refreshing taste, and great value make it a solid choice.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried other whitening products in the past and not been impressed. I found Crest Whitestrips messy and uncomfortable to use. I went through about 5 tubes of Crest whitening toothpaste and couldn't see any real change. So I was a bit skeptical about this product, especially the claim that you will notice a change after 4 days of use. I didn't see noticeable change after the first week. Still, my teeth took a lot of years to get discolored, so I decided to continue. As I was nearing the end of my second bottle, even this old skeptic became convinced that there was a definite effect. My teeth aren't \"Hollywood white,\" but they are improving. I'm hoping for continued slow improvement as I continue to use the product. So don't get discouraged if you don't see much change at first. This stuff is easy to use, the flavor is acceptable, and it may very well work for you if you persist. Plus you are getting the added benefit of the additional fluoride. Anything that lessens the likelihood of needing dental work is a win in my book.",

If this was whitening, I would not mind - but the value just doesn't seem to be there.",
