I think this product should come in its own box of some kind to prevent this issue as it seems common..... This mouthwash actually feels nice to use. It's not overwhelming like mouthwash you would find in stores. I personally cannot tolerate mint flavors well, so I was forcing myself to use the store mouthwashes for my dental hygiene. I do not experience that feeling with this product. The mint flavor of this mouthwash is very gentle and hardly lingers. The xylitol and aloe makes it ever so slightly sweet and gentle, while the silver is undetectable. I am enjoying this mouthwash a lot.",

The only thing I don't like is that the ingredients are not 100% complete; the Silver is their proprietary formula, which is fine, but ... for me -- I like knowing exactly what I'm consuming. Will likely buy again, though I am curious about the competition.",

He has struggled with dry mouth and wounds from accidentally biting himself in addition to bouts of thrush from his medication. This mouthwash has been the absolute best product we have found for swabbing his mouth to keep it clean and moisturized. His bites heal faster, his tongue is clear, and his breath is fresh. It is not an overwhelming peppermint taste, and he seems to enjoy his mouth care routine now. I highly recommend this for kids with swallowing disorders that require specialized mouth care.",
