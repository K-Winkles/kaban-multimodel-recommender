It didn't matter, my kids wanted absolutely no part of it. \"It BURNS!\" My youngest screamed at me after getting her to try listorine. This mouthwash? Soooo mild. Tastes Like strawberries. I've used it myself to test it out, and it seems to have the same cleaning power as the ones that 'Burn' according to my daughters. I paired this mouthwash with the toothpaste of the same flavor, and new electric toothbrushes. I don't even have to tell them to brush their teeth now. They inform me that they have already brushed their teeth when I go to remind them. It's a miracle. And the dentist has weighed in, and 0 cavities for all 3 kids. So worth the splurge to buy the mouthwash.",

So I immediately lost two bottles that were partially full because they tipped over and leaked into the sink. Plus the cap isn\u2019t a good portion control for distributing an accurate amount of fluid. Way too much. So she went through 3 bottles in no time. This mouthwash was so less expensive than Act. I can\u2019t be there to monitor it. And the Act is more convenient.",
