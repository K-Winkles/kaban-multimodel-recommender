What I don't like all that much is it does not travel well and leaked all over the inside of my bag! The self-containing cup in the lid that mixes the two formulas together doesn't stay on tight and the 2 mixes going into it don't pour out equally. These are the reasons that I said it is a mixed review. While it works, they really need to come up with a better design for mixing it and keeping it from leaking all over. As for what it does that is why I still spend the money on it.",
