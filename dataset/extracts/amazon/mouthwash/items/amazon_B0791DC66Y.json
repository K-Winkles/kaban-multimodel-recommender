For over 40 years, Aurom\u00e8re has been a leading importer of Ayurvedic body care products. What began as a small operation to help fund a residential spiritual community soon became one of the first companies to introduce Ayurveda to the US. In today\u2019s highly competitive market, Aurom\u00e8re continues to grow while still staying true to its deeper inspirations and purpose. 100% Non-Profit Owned: Aurom\u00e8re is entirely owned by a non-profit Integral Yoga ashram in Northern California, and is run by members and volunteers of the ashram as part of their spiritual practice along with other staff. All proceeds from Aurom\u00e8re products support the upkeep and activities of the ashram, as well as other Integral Yoga efforts in the U.S. and India. Supporting Auroville: a portion of all proceeds are designated to support the development and growth of the eco-conscious, international \u201cCity of Human Unity\u201d in Auroville, South India \u2014 an ongoing experiment in the transformation of consciousness, sustainable living, and the future cultural, environmental, social and spiritual needs of humankind.
