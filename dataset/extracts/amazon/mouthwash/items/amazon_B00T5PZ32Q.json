                "reviewText": "I have been using the toothpaste and the mouthwash for about 5 months now. Prior to buying I looked into the product. It made sense. It works differently than the other regular toothpastes and mouthwashes. I had a place or two that I was to see the dentist about. In about 5 days it started to feel so much better. At that time I was using only the toothpaste. Later that month added the mouthwash along with it and I haven't had any teeth problems at all! My teeth look and feel amazing! The mouthwash seems to coat the teeth and I can almost feel it going to work?! It Tastes nice... it's also thick so you don't need much. The dental community won't be happy if more start using this product.Thank you BioRepair!! I love your toothpaste and rinse!",

                "reviewText": "I used to use Apagard (the Japanese nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste), which is significantly more expensive than this brand. Biorepair, after a few weeks of use, has reduced the sensitivity, chances of bad breath, and visibly made my teeth look more naturally white (which is off-white, by the way... bright white teeth are unnatural). Unlike Apagard, the hydroxyapatite used in this toothpaste is bound to Zinc, which means it has the added benefit of controlling bacteria in the mouth (keeps your breath more fresh, reduces plaque buildup).I love how smooth my teeth feel, all day, even with just one brushing a day. My teeth look healthier, feel better, and my breath is fan-freakin'-tastic.The flavor is easy to handle, texture is good, and it foams up decently. Make sure you follow the directions for use! No food/drink for 30 minutes, brush for around two-minutes, making sure all your teeth are covered in the toothpaste. Use more than a pea-sized, because the ZnHA (zinc hydroxyapatite) that actually remineralizes your teeth needs to adequately cover all your chompers.I brush with this, wait 20-30 minutes (when time permits) and then follow up with the Biorepair Triple-Action Sensitivity Mouthwash. The mouthwash is accurately described by the company as being \"liquid toothpaste\"--they are not lying.",
