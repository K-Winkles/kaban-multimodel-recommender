                "reviewText": "Ive been using Supersmile products for 10 years. Im 60 years old this year and my teeth are in their best ever condition. I recommend all of the Supersmile products! They are priced higher than others but last forever, way beyond your expectations. You can not achieve these results even with the best regular store brands.I've recently tried their, \"extra whitening,\" line. The pre-rince is the first one so far. One teaspoon, and I mean only one teaspoon plus 30 seconds of swishing is enough to strip all the ick out of your mouth. It even bubbles food particles out from between my teeth and makes them ready for optimal brushing.Its tempting to use the same amount of product that you would have used with the store brands, but dont waste your time or money. Supersmile products work their best as recommended. The results are staggering and immediate. Your dentist will concure!",
