                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Only mouthwash flavor my daughter likes",
                "reviewText": "As a newbie parent to a child with braces (I never had them!) I felt discouraged when the orthodontist explained the recommended cleaning routine to my nearly 13-year old daughter (and fear at the disclaimer I had to sign explaining all the permanent bad stuff that could happen to her teeth if she didn't properly clean them with braces!). So when the doc told us she should rinse with a mouthwash each night before bed, I knew I was in trouble. My daughter dislikes mint flavor and every mouthwash at ALL the pharmacies, Walmart and Target contains mint of some kind even if there is other flavoring (like bubble gum, \"sparkle\", or fruit). Our orthodontist specifically told me Colgate Phos-Flur is his favorite and that while pricey, he thinks it worth it. I cannot speak to that (but I do really like and trust him, so I'll take his word for it). I almost choked when I saw it was about $15 a bottle on Amazon but then EXTREMELY GLAD when I realized it comes in \"Gushing Grape\" with no mint!! When my daughter has to take Tylenol or Advil \"grape\" is the only flavor she will take without issue (thankfully generic brands are usually fine too). So given this, price became no object (or nearly no object) in this case. I ordered 1 bottle to try, hoping she would like it. I was ELATED when this arrived, she tasted it and said she'd be willing to use it daily (SCORE!). The only thing I don't like about it is the bottle is a little hard to open (you squeeze opposite sides of the cap together while unscrewing to remove it). Both she and I can get the cap off, but my fear is that it might be easy to knock it over while doing so, and at ~$15/bottle and dollars would literally drain out in a matter of a second or two! I had intended to transfer the mouthwash to another vessel, but never found something suitable in my house (though I now have an empty kombucha bottle that might work). Thankfully my daughter has not spilled (or at least admitted to doing so). I did give her an old liquid medicine cup so she could measure out her daily 10ml serving.",
