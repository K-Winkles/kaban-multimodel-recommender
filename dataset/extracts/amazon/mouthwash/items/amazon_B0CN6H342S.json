Unlike some other mouthwashes that leave a burning sensation, this one is gentle on my mouth. The flavor is just right not overpowering like some mouthwashes can be. It strikes a perfect balance between freshness and subtlety. I appreciate that I can swish it around without feeling like I\u2019m inhaling a mint factory. After using the Breath Defense Mouthwash, my mouth feels incredibly clean and refreshed. The minty aftertaste lingers just long enough to leave me feeling confident about my breath. Some mouthwashes can be harsh on sensitive gums, but this one is gentle and soothing.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Listerine in various forms for decades now, starting back when there was still only the 'original' flavor of their standard product. My favorite is still their \"Naturals\" which is no longer made it seems.This one is zero alcohol, so not an antiseptic. It also does not carry the ADA seal like the other original-style products.It has a very mild flavor while swishing around in my mouth and then the real mint-yness comes later. This one is entirely for bad breath and doesn't treat other oral issues, so that's something to keep in mind when ordering. Due to price I'd recommend only if Listerine's regular products (zero alcohol or otherwise) don't work well enough for you.",

I like that it doesn't have alcohol, but that doesn't mean it doesn't burn. It still burns your mouth with that fresh and strong menthol taste, like Listerines of the past. I can't seem to hold it in my mouth the full 30 seconds every time. Usually I have to spit it out after about 15 seconds. I'm not sure if my mouth is just sensitive.

You just rinse 2x a day. However, I prefer to do the regular dental routine first - scrape tongue, floss, and brush... then rinse.I have noticed a more well-balanced moistness in the mouth (not dry or too much) and cleaner-smelling breath.The bottle is large but easy to grip. The cap seals nicely to prevent any spills.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for fresher breath!",

It\u2019s a thinner piece of plastic and definitely feels different from the classic black listerine cap. You really have to squeeze the sides to open.

                "reviewText": "Has a good taste, seemed familiar so maybe there's a common ingredient with other mouthwashes. This is not an anti-cavity mouthwash, since there's no fluoride, but rather for bad breath. It seemed to leave my mouth feeling much cleaner so that was a benefit, and I imagine this would translate to better smelling breath as well. Seems like a good clean mouth supplement after meals and in between brushes.",
