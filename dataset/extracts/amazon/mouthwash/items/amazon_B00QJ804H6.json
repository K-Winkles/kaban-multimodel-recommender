For many, it\u2019s a frustrating, reactive approach to oral health, but not surprising. Until recently, dentists were taught that you'd be free of decay if you have good oral hygiene. The problem is that it\u2019s just not that simple. Break the cycle of decay with CariFree. CariFree's pH-elevated products fix the problem at its source.

                "reviewText": "CariFree offers a carefully thought out line of products geared more earnestly towards improving your oral health than any other company I have encountered. I have rather bad teeth and so am extremely careful with them, and put a lot of effort into finding the best products; therefore I settled on CariFree.There are a number of reasons why this is absolutely superior to ordinary mouthwashes such as those from Crest or Listerine.1) This is alkaline. People often think that your teeth get back because of sugar; this is not the case. The sugar feed bacteria which then metabolize it to produce acid. It is therefore quite obviously desirable to neutralize this acid, which spikes after eating any food but particularly after eating/drinking sugary or acidic drinks (sugar free sweets are often full of acids to give a \"sour\" flavor). Most mouthwashes are actually acidic, as you can find upon a quick google search; according to Frey Smiles' blog, Listerine is around pH 4 and Crest Pro-Health around 4.7. Neutral is pH 7. CariFree is pH 8.2) This has no alcohol. Alcohol is generally not good for you; it's been linked with oral cancer, and definitely can cause dry mouth. Also, it just feels nasty in your mouth.3) This is antibacterial without staining. Xylitol is a generally effective antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal agent. Some studies do say you should not eat xylitol, but this is a rinse, not a gum. The other main antimicrobials are alcohol and cetylpyridinium chloride. Alcohol is bad for the reasons we've mentioned; CPC, on the other hand, can cause awful tooth staining (and it did this for me).4) This has fluoride. Many rinses do not- you have to look carefully on the package. Tooth enamel is a mineral that consists of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxide ions. In solution, as in your saliva, these ions are constantly popping off and on, but at a very low rate (acidity increases this rate, however). Fluoride ions are more electronegative than hydroxide ions, and so they pop back in instead of hydroxide and hold the structure together more tightly (decreasing the rate at which they pop off).In terms of usage, I also enjoy its flavor, and the fact that it isn't full of useless or possibly harmful dyes, scents, or other additives like most other mouthwashes. It's pretty straightforward: a bunch of really important ingredients that work together well. I also might add that although this product is very expensive, it was developed off real science; the likes of Listerine are products that have been sold in forms very similar to their current form for years. CariFree has a hard time competing with these big companies, but they do offer better products.Finally, I'd recommend looking into their remineralizing toothpaste. As I mentioned, your enamel has three ions that exist in a solubility equilibrium in your saliva: calcium, phosphate, and hydroxide (replaced by fluoride). It makes sense, therefore, that just adding one of these ions is not enough if you want to actually strengthen your teeth. CariFree's toothpaste contains bioavailable sources of calcium and phosphate ions, allowing your tooth enamel to actually rebuild, rather than just dissolve at a lower rate.I hope this helps you all.",

                "reviewText": "I think this is the best mouth rinse I\u2019ve ever ever used. I haven\u2019t had a chance to ask my dentist his thoughts about it yet, but in my opinion, it\u2019s the best mouth rinse I\u2019ve ever used!I have an issue with a dry mouth and it causes all sorts of issues if I don\u2019t stay on top of it at all times! Unfortunately when I was younger I didn\u2019t know what bad things could arise from having a dry mouth and leaving the symptoms to the hands of a busy, career-driven, young adult with places to go and things to do! And as a result, I had more fillings than I should have at that age (mid-30\u2019s)!When I eventually learned, the hard way, about the dangers from leaving a dry mouth untreated, I began using all sorts of products. And I\u2019ve found many that work and many that don\u2019t work. But I\u2019m not saying that this is the absolute best for treating a dry mouth. I believe it\u2019s the best at preventing bad breath though, which is one of the side affects of having a dry mouth.So yes, buy this if you\u2019re looking for a great-tasting rinse for prevention and/or treatment of bad breath! It only requires a minute of rinse and it (the mint) tastes sooooo delicious! You\u2019ll want to use it many many times a day!",

                "reviewText": "I always do extensive research when it comes to buying a health and beauty product. When I saw the review on this toothpaste I researched the website and reviews on and off of Amazon. I came across this product because my toddler has developed white spots on her teeth and I was not too excited about that.I originally bought the mint and used it on my toddler and myself. I love the mint. A little goes a long ways. It is a gel form but lathers well in the mouth. I have noticed when using this toothpaste that the amount of gunk I scrape off of my tongue after brushing is about 95% less than with normal toothpaste. That tells me that something is working in this toothpaste. Since using this toothpaste I have also received comments on my teeth. I have some sensitive spots when I floss and they are no longer sensitive after using this toothpaste.I ended up buying my daughter the grape flavor as it is more her flavor. She doesn\u2019t mind the toothpaste. Her teeth are looking better, the white spots have started to minimize. I have no tried the grape flavor but another adult in my household has and they too like it and has said it lathers very well.I ended up buying the mint mouthwash as well. I was a bit hesitant at first because reviewers were saying it burned their mouth when using it and they refused to use it anymore. I happen to love the mouthwash. It does almost always burn my tongue but that is because of the damage I do to it myself from eating sour and salty foods. The mouthwash gives me an intense clean feeling. I use it every morning and night before bed.I also love the fact that these products do not contain acid (for shelf life) like most other brands do. Acid breaks down your enamel and that\u2019s something you definitely want to avoid. I give his company a high five for that in itself!I\u2019d recommend this toothpaste and the mouthwash to anyone looking for a great toothpaste that does as it says and contains no harmful ingredients. This company truly wants to protect your teeth and gums. I will co tongue to buy this for myself and my family.",
