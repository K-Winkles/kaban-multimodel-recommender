                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Amazon Basics Antiseptic Mouthwash in the Original Flavor, and I must say, it's a solid choice for maintaining oral hygiene. The 1.5-liter bottle offers great value for the quantity, providing a plentiful supply of mouthwash to last for an extended period.One of the standout features of this mouthwash is its antiseptic properties. It leaves a clean and refreshing sensation after use, which is a testament to its ability to help combat germs and bacteria in the mouth. The original flavor is mild and not overly strong, making it suitable for those who prefer a less intense taste in their oral care products.The convenient packaging of the 1.5-liter bottle comes with a secure cap and an easy-to-use dispenser. The larger size is practical for families or individuals who want a longer-lasting supply without the hassle of frequently purchasing smaller bottles.I found the Amazon Basics Antiseptic Mouthwash to be effective in freshening breath and giving an overall feeling of oral cleanliness. It's a great addition to a daily oral care routine, especially after brushing and flossing. However, like with any mouthwash, I would recommend following the usage instructions and not swallowing the product.While this mouthwash might not have as many bells and whistles as some premium brands, it certainly delivers on its promise of antiseptic protection and a refreshing aftertaste. For those seeking a reliable and cost-effective option for oral hygiene, the Amazon Basics Antiseptic Mouthwash is definitely worth considering.In conclusion, the Amazon Basics Antiseptic Mouthwash in Original Flavor provides a practical and effective solution for maintaining oral health. With its generous quantity and reasonable price point, it's a product that offers value and functionality without compromising on quality.",

But as soon as I put it in my mouth, I immediately realized that it definitely was not the original. Something about the taste is off. Not by allot, but it\u2019s off. Prior to using this, if you had told me there was a more mediciney tasting mouth wash than the original I would have thought you were crazy. But the folks at Amazon solimo found a way to bring it to you at a low and enticing price.I remember when I was a kid, the generic aisle in the grocery store. Plain white no-frills packaging with straight forward labels like \u201ccorn\u201d or \u201cpaper towels\u201d. Now we have a multitude of off-brands, like Solimo, with packaging to imply you are buying something other than a cheap copy of whatever product you happen to be shopping for. I kind of wish we could go back to the no frills white labels. So we could better know what to expect.Nevertheless. It seems to be effective. I will finish the large $4 bottle I purchased but then I am going back to the original.",
