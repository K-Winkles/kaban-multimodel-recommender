But after using this mouthwash I can luckily say that I haven\u2019t had any problems, I was hesitant on purchasing because of using other brands \u201csensitive teeth\u201d mouth washes, but this one has definitely done it\u2019s job and has done it well.",

My teeth keep white and not yellowing, so it\u2019s really working on my enamel! Most other mouthwashes are too hot for my sensitive teeth, but not this. Also I have no sensitivity after using Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste and mouthwash every day! It\u2019s worth every penny as nothing usually needs doing on dentist visits either!Too thick (NO) what rubbish is that, it\u2019s just a liquid like any other mouthwash!",

Slightly thick texture which is also nice as it foams and really helps make my teeth feel cleaner. Will most certainly keep using/buying this product. Looking to protect enamel and this cane highly recommended by my Dentist.",
