To never have used that mouthwash.I have lived so long with these open sores, and the constant bleeding since, that I cannot remember what came before them. Has my mouth ever truly been without pain, or was that just a dream?Eating is my daily hell. When I eat I try to cut up my food into the smallest possible pieces so as to avoid all contact with the tender, inflamed flesh and exposed nerves of my cheeks and tongue. Contact with my gums is an agony that I cannot describe.The taste of copper is my constant and unwelcome companion. I dare not speak to others at risk of exposing my corrupt, fetid breath, rank from active decay, eager to escape and expose the shame of my mistake at the slightest lapse in vigilance. My muscles are sore from the effort of maintaining the airtight seal of my lips.My daily, no, hourly regret is ever to have used that mouthwash. There is no relief to be had and I see no end to this hell. I long for the sweet release of death.That was a different mouthwash, this one is my favorite. Highly recommend. 5/5 stars.",
