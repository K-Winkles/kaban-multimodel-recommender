                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this product for years and love it! However, when I ordered my stock this time, not only was the product, not as photographed they changed the packaging to make it more difficult to open. This is not appreciated! Because of my arthritis, I cannot even open this without help,, so I\u2019m having to move my mouthwash into another container which defeats the purpose. It should be in a dark bottle not a light bottle!5 stars for the contents ZERO stars for their packaging!!",

It smells so good and my mouth is enjoying this AMAZING product. Now I do dilute it with another natural mouthwash product and shake them up and then dilute with water and do a shot mouthwash. Works perfect, right amount of \u201czing\u201d to it and the flavor is PERFECT \u2013 NEVER change the ingredients!",
