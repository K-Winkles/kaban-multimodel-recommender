Keeps my mouth from getting dry, fresh breath all day, and very pleasant flavor with no burning. If you haven't tried this yet and your still using lister-burn then give this a try! I used to actually like the burning of other mouth washes, felt like it was cleaning my mouth, but this mouthwash does a way better job of cleaning and there's no burning sensation at all. If you're on the fence about trying this product, take the leap of faith and you won't regret it. I promise!",
