Soon his aprons found their way to a group of nuns who were doing double duty as seamstresses at a nearby hospital. The nuns asked A.L if he could make hospital garments \u2013 surgeons\u2019 gowns and nursing uniforms \u2013 so they could stop sewing and spend more time caring for patients. He said yes and the business was transformed. Almost two decades later, A.L.\u2019s son, Irving, took over. When World War II broke out, he added general medical supplies to his garment offerings, and the business transformed again, becoming Mills Hospital Supply Company. Today, Medline Industries, LP. is a fourth generation, family-owned company and the largest privately held manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies in the US. And, we\u2019re still happily headquartered in the Chicagoland area. Our story continues with you. You\u2019ve probably seen \u2013 and used \u2013 dozens of Medline products when you were in the hospital, emergency room, urgent care clinic or doctor\u2019s office. Our products \u2013 including gowns and scrubs \u2013 are found in thousands of care setting all around the globe. But now we\u2019re excited and humbled to be entering one of the most exclusive care settings of all \u2013 your home. We make healthcare run better. And now we\u2019re proud to make it run better for you.",
