                "reviewText": "So, for the kids this product is awesome. My children love to clean up correctly with brushing, flossing, and then the great swoosh of Listerine Bubble Blast. The problem is that the Amazon Fresh team of pickers look at the order and see 1 order of Bubble Blast, but this particular product comes in a 3 pack. Yet, I am always charged for the higher 3 pack price. They will never ship you the three as advertised. This is a problem for me as an Amazon shareholder. I have been credited twice for the full amount of the product (hassle free, thank you Amazon) but have been instructed to keep the 1 bottle. I know everyone loves free, but I rather see the shrinkage being kept in check and have our great team of Amazon employees rewarded. Please correct this issue. Tape all three bottles together and mark as \"do not separate bundle.\" I will order the product again and I hope you do to. Please send all three. Thanks.",
