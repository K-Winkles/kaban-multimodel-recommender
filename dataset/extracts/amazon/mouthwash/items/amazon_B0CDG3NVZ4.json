A couple of odd notes are the peach flavoring that I don't really get, and the addition of Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus could potentially be an oral probiotic, potentially aiding in cavity prevention, but it seems that research is still preliminary on that. Otherwise, nothing else really stands out to me in the ingredient list.It does swish and froth up really well, likely due to the castor oil (thankfully no sodium laureth sulfate in this stuff). Taste wise, it describes itself as a soft mint, but I think it's pretty strong myself, and that's coming from someone who used to pop Altoids like candy. My only real gripe is that the two packets I've used thus far haven't opened cleanly, so it took a pair of scissors. Otherwise, the actual mouthwash is really good. The box itself is a reusable plastic box, so traveling with something like this should be easy. All in all, good mouthwash, not so good packets.",

They give me confidence with my breath and help alleviate dry mouth too.",

These come in sturdy perforated packets that are easy to rip when need to and they stay closed when you dont, even when they're weighed down in a purse. Whether you want to use these up daily for a month, or have them in your bag at work to go, or even give them as little gifts at a dinner party, they will have multiple uses. These work great if you wear retainers at night and want fresh breath in the morning.It is very expensive though when you compare the cost of $3-5 for a big bottle that will last a family a couple of months, these packets come to $1 each for 12 ml one time use, yes the portability is great for travel, etc but they are pricy.",
