I ran out and found a larger bottle I think at Target. I\u2019m running out of it and thankfully found it on Amazon now.A lot of mints last only around an hour or so. Scope and Listerine tend to last a few hours. The combo will usually get me through a meeting, interview, or a date then I\u2019ve gotta replenish.TheraBreathe literally lasts all day of around 8 hours. This stuff does cost more than most mints and perhaps Listerine but it\u2019s very worth it. I\u2019ll be ordering again when my stock runs out.",
