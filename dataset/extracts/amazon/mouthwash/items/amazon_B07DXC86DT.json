Even those most dedicated to maintaining their oral and dental health can harbor around 1,000 to 100,000 bacteria on every tooth surface, surprising fact! You may not be able to remove all the plaque and bacteria by just brushing and flossing- here comes mouthwash. It reaches all of the surfaces and crevices of your teeth while helping to remove all the bad particles from your mouth. Now if we say that Dr. Brite Cleaning Mouth Wash is completely organic, toxin-free and delicious- bingo! An urge to completely go for organic oral care products that heals, nourishes, and nurtures smiles of all sizes is the single motto retained by Dr. Brite. It all started when co-founder and breast cancer surgeon, Dr. Paris Sabo, MD who was shocked to see that her toddler is eating toothpaste full of harmful chemicals so Dr. Sabo teamed up with sister, fellow mom and veteran dentist, Dr. Pooneh Ramezani, DDS to give us Dr. Brite. Dr. Brite presents Cleansing Mouth Rinse coming in 3 flavors: Coco Chai, Mint and Strawberry. All the flavors contain coconut oil that gently removes impurities and keeps cavity-causing plaque at bay; Aloe Vera juice that nourishes, disinfects and moisturizes while helping to fight gum disease and freshen breath; and Vitamin C that helps boost gum health- can\u2019t ask for more. All the flavors are refreshing, delicious, and promote healthy gums so choose your favorite one now.",

Feels good to wake up with a fresher breath than before, i brush my teeth also at night and I noticed with using this I wake up with no bad breath! Compared to before. No complaints, other than maybe the price point. But with natural products that\u2019s just how it is, still would recommend.",

Can't lose with that combination.",
