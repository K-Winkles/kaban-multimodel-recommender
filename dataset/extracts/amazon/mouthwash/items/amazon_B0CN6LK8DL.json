We ordered this primarily because we are senior citizens and try hard to continue to maintain the health of our teeth and mouth.We were intrigued with the idea that this mouthwash could help repair tooth enamel, strengthen teeth and prevent tooth decay. We are hoping this will be true and trust the Listerine brand to be more truthful than other off brands or imitations. We can not attest to whether or not this will accomplish what it is promoted to do.It does have a nice refreshing minty taste. We have a couple of travel sized bottles that we have refilled with this newer variety of Listerine that make it more accessible and convenient to use on a regular basis.",

                "reviewText": "Listerine is a legacy brand we all grew up with. I typically purchase this brand at the supermarket but in zero alcohol formula. This formula however, has both alcohol and fluoride. Fluoride gets a bad rap lately, but I am no health expert so cannot accurately assess the validity of such regards. I'll use it anyway without concern for that. I will say this formula tastes MUCH stronger than what I'm accustomed to using and it's going to take some getting used to. Maybe I am overly sensitive to this formula. It doesn't have a lingering aftertaste, which I'll chalk up as a plus. Seems high quality as you'd expect from a trusted brand. You are getting a HUGE bottle here so you'll be set for quite a while. I'll say this is a good buy, especially if you're not concerned with the presence of fluoride and alcohol.",

                "reviewText": "So happy I decided to try out this Listerine, it's now my new favorite. My go to usually is the original green Listerine, but this Alpine Mint flavor is amazing. It reminds me of a sweet mint chewing gum that I love, it's taste so good. It's more mild though, not as strong as the other Listerine mouthwash I've had before, but still noticeably minty. I use it two times a day and it freshens my breath right away. My teeth and gums feel much cleaner and my breath smells great! The bottle is huge and should last me awhile, since only a little bit is needed to get the job done. I'm very satisfied with it and will definitely be buying more once I'm out.",

                "reviewText": "This mouth wash is advertised as repairing tooth enamel, which seems like false advertising to me. The active ingredient is fluoride which can help prevent cavities, but does not actively repair enamel. Most all mouth washes you see at the store have fluoride, so it doesn't really set this apart. A lot of products that try to be healthier for you also try to make a product that doesn't contain fluoride, but this does not fit that description.This mouthwash also contains alcohol. Many mouthwashes brag that they do not contain alcohol, and there is a reason for that. The alcohol in mouthwash kills bacteria in your mouth, which can be good for preventing cavities, but it also kills the good bacteria in your mouth that is helpful, leaving an environment that can be taken over by bad bacteria. So, this mouthwash fails in that regard too.Because this mouthwash is full of alcohol and fluoride, it can make some quick work out of freshening your breath, but I would not recommend making a habit out of using it often because the ingredients have been shown to do the opposite of create good oral health.",

I would try to avoid drinking milk or coffee right after swishing, but still, no aftertaste. I could see switching to this rather than the blue version I usually choose.",

It does seem to foam up a little more than the ol Cool Mint I've gotten for years. Other than that, its the same stuff I've used for a long time!",
