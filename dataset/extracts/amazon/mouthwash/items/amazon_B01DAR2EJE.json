These go for about three dollars each when a full-size bottle goes for five so I had found it more cost-efficient to just refill bottles until the mess. I found these on Amazon for less than a dollar each making them very affordable. My husband will just save the bottles since they have the screw caps and we may end up refilling those but for the cost we can keep these stocked.",
