We've been using it for a couple of years now and it is working fine for us. It is on the expensive side which of course I don't enjoy, but I want to help keep our teeth healthy and this is part of our daily routine. We usually buy the three bottle pack each time we stock up and it lasts a while since we only use the recommended amount for rinsing.",

                "reviewText": "I'm absolutely loving this mouthwash! Unlike the ones I used to grab at the big box stores which had a taste I couldn't stand and did little for my bad breath, this one is a game-changer. My dentist recommended it, but their price was through the roof (over 30 bucks!), so I scouted around and found it on Amazon for a much better deal. I've amped up my dental routine with this mouthwash, along with nightly flossing and an electric toothbrush, and I can genuinely say goodbye to morning bad breath. Highly recommended!I've seen remarkable results with this mouthwash\u2014it's like magic in a bottle for bad breath, and the freshness lasts all day. Of course, maintaining good dental hygiene with nightly brushing and flossing is crucial, but using this in the morning is a game-changer. It effectively covers bad breath, and after about two or three months of consistent use, I noticed a significant improvement. Even though there are moments after eating when my breath isn't at its best, overall, the difference is remarkable. I highly recommend this product! Now, I stick to this one exclusively. I've struggled for years to find an effective product, and I believe I've finally found it. I opt for the three-pack whenever possible\u2014it's more cost-effective in the long run.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mouthwash!! I hated the taste of other mouthwashes I would get from Target and they never helped with my bad breath. I first tried this product when my dentist recommended it and I bought it from them (it was an insane price, over 30 bucks!) So I was like it has to be cheaper somewhere else and I found it on amazon for so much less! Obviously, compared to other mouthwashes in Target / Walmart which are much affordable, this mouthwash stands out to me and worth the extra few bucks. It really cleans without the bitter taste. I've gotten more into my dental hygiene and added this mouthwash to my routine (with flossing my teeth and an electric toothbrush) and I swear I haven't been waking up with bad breath! Overall, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I have had very good results with this product. It\u2019s like magic in a bottle for bad breath, and it lasts all day long. However, you do still have to have a good dental hygiene and brush and floss every day at night, but if you\u2019re doing that and you\u2019re using this in the morning, you don\u2019t need anything else all day. It really works and covers. Bad breath. It even feels like after a bout two or three months of using it. I didn\u2019t have bad breath anymore. Yes, I have my periods after I eat where my breath does not smell it\u2019s best, but somehow it feels like , overall the smell has improved. I really like the stuff and highly recommend it! Now I don\u2019t buy any other product but this. I still do buy Listerine because it kills the germs so I use that first and then I wait about 30 minutes and I use this mouthwash. I have been struggling for years trying to find an effective product and I think I found it. I\u2019ll buy the three pack whenever I can because it\u2019s cheaper in the long run.",
