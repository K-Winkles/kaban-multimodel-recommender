                "reviewText": "We LOVE this product. It's not only fluoridated so helps prevent decay but it also drastically helps bad breath. No more morning breath. I was worried this wouldn't help but it does. The size is much bigger on Amazon then in store and the cost is the same. We started with grape and now own the watermelon too. My son asked for watermelon and likes that one better I think. He's autistic and adhd and gets hyped up where it can be challenging making sure to get his teeth brushed perfectly. His teeth gets brushed twice daily for a few minutes at a time but with him bouncing around sometimes (not everytime) I worry that I'm not getting a few teeth as well as I need to. I think I do most of the time but this just gives that added peace of mind because he doesn't have to rinse with water after using the mouthwash and it helps overnight while he's asleep. He usually doesn't drink afterwards as we brush his teeth right before bed. Occassionally he'll want some water to drink just before bed and that's okay too. I still have better piece of mind. But the main purpose of this purchase is bad breath and it definitely works for that. He was also given a fluoride treatment to use nightly from the Dentist but she said it didn't have to be used nightly. My son doesn't care for the texture/ taste of it and it's a struggle on some occassions so we manage it maybe once a week. He always needs to rinse with water afterwards anyway which defeats the purpose of the product. He has sensory issues and so he doesn't like a lot of products. Thankfully with the mouthwash he doesn't want or feel the need to rinse afterwards so it works better for us. He looks forward to using the mouthwash. He doesn't have cavities yet (he's 7) and hopefully we can keep it did way, at least as long as possible. \u2764\ufe0f",
