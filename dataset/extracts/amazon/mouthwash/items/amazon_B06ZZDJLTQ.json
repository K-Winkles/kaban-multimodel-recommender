                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this mouth wash ever since the first time I tried it and love it. It tastes good and seems to really do the trick. The package of single use packets are perfect for traveling (trying to take the bottle would spill all over your luggage). The packets are also convenient for after dinner during a night out.The only quirkiness is that the bottle has four holes (two for pouring and then a breather hole for each of the two parts) and the seal they use for shipping can sometimes clog the smaller breather holes after it\u2019s removed. If this happens, it will not pour equal amounts - which is critical. So, after opening the bottle I always insert a toothpick in the holes to make sure they are clear. Never fails to pour perfectly after that little fix. A great and useful product!",

I would never travel for work or somewhere I\u2019ll be talking to a lot of people without the travels packs. I find that half a travel pack is enough for 12 hours. The multi-use package makes the price pint better, but leave that sucker at home and so t try to use it if you\u2019re already made up. I find it impossible not to dribble out of the dual dispenser, and it is also often impossible to get equal parts of the two fluids, so you end up with one left over. i have shopped around for cheaper or more convenient mouth wash types, but none have worked as well for me.",
