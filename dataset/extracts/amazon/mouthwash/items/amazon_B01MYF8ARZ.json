                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good taste, good ingredients",
                "reviewText": "I found this fluoride in my quest to find one that was free of alcohol and dyes (I'd prefer no artificial sweeteners either, but considering there is likely so little and I'm not really eating it, it's less of a concern for me; unfortunately, this probably also applies to the xylitol, which is listed last in the ingredients list). I also had a slight preference for stannous fluoride over other forms, which this one also happened to meet.It's not quite as convenient as pre-diluted fluoride, but it's still pretty easy: the directions say 1/8 fl oz of this with 2 oz of water, and they provide a (plastic) cup for easy mixing. (Don't skimp on the mixing, BTW. They provide a cap to make it easy to shake, where I thought I could get by with just swirling it around and eventually discovered a layer of deposits on the bottom of the container, which I suspect there would have been less of had I mixed better, and I probably didn't get the full dose every time before I realized this.) I'd like to think it's cheaper, too, and a quick calculation of the recommended dilution rates suggest it is with a name brand I can find at the store by at least a few cents per final concentration ounce, but I still like the idea of not shipping around something that's mostly water, anyway.Speaking of shipping, I had to return/replace my first purchase--it wasn't packaged well, and the dispenser (which comes separately from the bottle in the same box), likely because the bottle shook around and crushed it during transit or delivery. The plastic cup was also broken. Amazon, as usual, was great and replaced it without issue, but it seems like they could devise better packaging for shipment to avoid this hassle.",
