According to the American Dental Association (ADA), incorporating mouthwash into your daily routine also allows you to clean tiny crevices in your mouth that cannot be reached by a toothbrush. However, most conventional mouthwash formulas contain harmful ingredients, such as fluoride, alcohol and saccharin, which are bad for your oral health and can actually do more harm than good. Keeping your mouth moist and pH balanced is crucial for maintaining good oral health. Most mouthwashes fall below a 5.5 pH which makes your mouth extremely acidic and can lead to a dry mouth, bad breath, and even cavities.",

Looking at the ingredients\u2026 the makers could seriously back off on the mint stuffs. Yeesh\u2026I started using this right after my last regular dentist checkup. I floss and brush daily but there always seems to be a bit of plaque that I just can\u2019t be rid of. Adding things was the only change in my oral routine so I know it\u2019s what\u2019s improved my oral health. My dentist was giddy with excitement when she did my checkup and saw almost no plaque buildup lolI\u2019ll be sticking with this mouth wash! If the makers of this see this review, please back off of the mints! It burns so bad sometimes it hurts!",

Go slow and use a bit because it is very strong. I\u2019ll never go back to the other organic brands: this is the best mouthwash, period.",

                "reviewText": "I am obsessed with Simply Silver's mouthwash. I ordered the mint flavor, and I did not expect it to work so well. I've used Young Living Thieves Fresh Essence mouthwash in the past, and that used to be my favorite. The price has gone up drastically, and I am NOT paying 19 dollars for 8fl oz of mouthwash. I came across Simply Silver and was pleased to see it's made with only natural ingredients! The 16oz bottle lasted me about 2 months. It's spicy but doesn't burn, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my breath smelling good. This mouthwash is highly underrated. This is now my go-to. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "Nice product. You may find it is a bit strong on the gums. no problem, prefer rather than too weak. I just dilute it 50% and use it that way. And it lasts longer that way too. My gums do not like full strength. you may have a differing opinion. I hope it remains a stocking item.",

                "reviewText": "I've had teeth problems for ages and now that I'm an adult, it seems I'm getting a root canal every other year. Pain started setting in recently and was making it impossible to sleep. My usual pattern when pain started was to try all sorts of numbing cream on top of compulsively brushing my teeth and swishing with anything I could think of to no avail and eventually can't take the pain anymore and get my tooth yanked. I wondered if there was a mouthwash with colloidal silver in it and looked it up on Amazon. I decided to try this mouthwash first. It was a grueling few days while I waited for the product to get here. The first night I used it, it was pretty intense. I felt like my gums were made out of bubblewrap and the mouthwash was bursting all the bubbles. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. The next morning, all throbbing, aching, and temperature sensitivity was gone. Don't let the brown color turn you off, it just solidified to me that it IS all natural and doesn't have dyes or other junk like commercial mouthwash. I AM SO IMPRESSED AND HAPPY I CAN SKIP THE DENTIST APPOINTMENT! Just try it!",
