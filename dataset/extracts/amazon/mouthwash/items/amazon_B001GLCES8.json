                "reviewText": "In my life I have tried many different mouthwashes - starting with Listerine, until I finally decided the burn and the gross taste didn't necessarily provide superior benefits. I used mouthwashes that were supposedly good for dry mouth for years. Then I noticed a coupon for TheraBreath Plus on Amazon. The coupon offered a decent discount and the ad made some bold claims so I bit. It is difficult to smell one's own breath unless there is a really serious problem but, after several years of continuous use, my mouth has never felt cleaner. I rinse in the morning and immediately before going to bed. I never get up with a gross aftertaste in my mouth before brushing and rinsing in the morning. I have caught myself not brushing and rinsing in the morning because my mouth felt refreshed. Whatever is in this stuff does the trick - as advertised. My mouth feels fresh all day. I'll offer one small admonition. The instructions indicate using a capful. A capful is wasteful. I use less than half that amount and obtain very good results. Just swish it around in your mouth a little longer. The stuff is too expensive to be using a capful at the time.",

                "reviewText": "Seriously just buy this! I've been using this for 2 days so far, and my breath doesnt smell and it stays that way for the rest of the day YESSSSS. I'm someone who cannot stand when people have reeking breaths. i posted on my snapchat telling all my friends to do themselves a favor. hahaha. I use an OraBrush tongue scraper and that does a great job of cleaning my tongue before I brush. Then I use a regular toothbrush with Crest 3D white and that does a pretty good job of cleaning my teeth (and help them stay white longer). I rinse my mouth of toothpaste foam and use whatever toothpaste is left on the brush to give my tongue a additional scrub. That pretty much takes care of my whole mouth.But the reason why I had been searching for a breath savior was because I would still have germs, etc on my tonsils and throat where you cannot get at with a brush which would cause my breath to stink really bad after a few hours. Sure you can just use regular mouthrinse but i find that those were usually full of alcohols and basically just burn off a layer of cells (and i guess some germs along with it). Their effect dont last either. But this TheraBreath rinse is basically the evolution of mouthwash. It is slightly minty which I find very pleasant. Less minty than Dentyne ice gum if you need a comparison. It feels very smooth in your mouth that doesnt foam up which is great for gargling. By smooth i mean like the consistency of oil? (but definitely nowhere near as thick). The instructions say to measure the amount with the little shot cup provided and rinse for 1 min. I probably just do like 30 seconds. spit and measure another shot to gargle with. I do that. It doesnt burn my tonsils or throat. its very comfortable. I do find that it leaves a slight aftertaste of like licorice(?) that i find weird but very bearable.One thing I HATE about this product is the cap design. So the gray bottle has a regular cap you would find on something like Vitamin Water. and the shot cup for measuring just clicks on top of that. So it is veryyyyyyy annoying to have to uncap the shot cup, and then hold that somehow while your other fingers try to twist off the actual cap. I wish they would just use the shot cup as the cap directly.I cant believe I wrote paragraphs on paragraphs about mouthwash... (if you are the seller, can you consider sending me extra bottles as a thank you? please? thanks)",

                "reviewText": "I am going to copy this same review for the mouthwash. But I wanted to give a thorough review of my experience with this product. I battled with bad breath/halitosis for a very long time. I wasn't the most diligent brusher wear i wouldn't brush twice a day. I try to but i would forget before i go to sleep. But basically my routine would be brush my teeth with \"all natural\" toothpaste and all natural mouthwash. But they did not cause my breath to smell fresh for a long time. So what I tried to do was use the scope tooth picks and place a dime of therabreath in my mouth so when i floss my teeth the toothpaste and the scope toothpick would go between my gums and make it smell nice. I followed with brush my teeth normally and along my gums, inside my teeth. I would use my tongue cleaner and thoroughly brush it until it was clear. I followed up with the TheraBreath plus mouthwash I would swish it around as instructed for one minute. Spit it out and fill another capful for my throat for 30 seconds and spit it out. I must say this actually worked for me. I've bought many toothpaste and mouthwash over the years and they didn't last as long as this product. As a test and my friends laugh at me for this but i place my finger in the back of my upper and bottom rows because they notoriously smelled before because of food and bacteria. There was no smell and i lick my hand with my tongue and smell it. There is no bad odor. So finally after years i found something that actually works for me. I know it's working great because I am able to speak to my colleagues face to face and i don't see them move there faces away when they talk to me directly. That's what made me want to really take care of my mouth because that is embarrassing. I don't work for the company and i rarely do reviews but I really love this product. And when I woke up the next morning and did the same thing my tongue, mouth and teeth did not smell. So i've really been using this product for a while. I think one of the things I improved on was gargle the mouthwash in my throat because it says your throat could be the source of bad breath aside from your tongue. I believe it and I don't need to use coconut oil or salt remedies anymore. This does the trick for me and I highly recommend using the product. As someone who as battled bad breath or people turning there heads i know that it works so give it a shot.",
