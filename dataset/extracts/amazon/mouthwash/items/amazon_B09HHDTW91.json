It irks me to spend so much on something I am going to just spit out. I was a bit afraid of how this would taste because of the price, and the weird name. I know what a violet is, and what mint is, but \"violet mint\"? But I decided to try it out and am VERY glad I did. This will be my go-to mouthwash now! -- Dee",
