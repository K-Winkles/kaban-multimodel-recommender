I have been getting the Anticavity mouthwash/rinse from Amazon for some time now and for a while the 4 pack of Anticavity rinse was unavailable. I thought this was the replacement in a larger size for the same mouthwash/rinse. No, upon checking the actual fluoride content, this item had only 0.02% (0.01% w/v fluoride ion) whereas I prefer and usually get the 0.05% (0.02% w/v fluoride ion) for active ingredients. My bad... I intend on keeping the product, but just want to let consumers know it's not the same as the fluoride rinse which is now available again in a 4 pack at an increase cost.",

                "reviewText": "So I've tried therabreath due to the craze around it and switched back to generic brand. I don't have a particularly stinky mouth but I do care about my dental hygiene. At first use, this reminded me of the colgate no alcohol mouthwashes. Pretty standard in terms of use, average mouthwash but gets the job done. Dentist told me you don't really need fancy ones as long as it has fluoride.Therabreath definitely left a deeper minty sensation in the mouth afterwards. This one only left a slight taste- similar to the taste after brushing. If you're looking for a mouthwash that is super strong, I wouldn't recommend this one. BUT, if you don't care as much, this is a great affordable price and tastes decent.PROS- affordable- gets the job done- light minty tasteCONS- not strong in flavor",
