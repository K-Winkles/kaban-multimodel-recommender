It claims to be alcohol-free but it manages to burn and sting nonetheless. It also tastes horrible, peroxide tastes slightly better imho.The real killer for this one though is that it claims to be anti cavity but in the few months I've been using this variation I've gotten my first cavity in about 3 years. It hadn't advanced much but it was there. This product is gauranteed to work according to the bottle so I will be making a claim before tossing the rest and going back to the fresh breath variation that actually works.",

                "reviewText": "Despite what it says on the bottle, to me and my partner every time we use it we have a burning/tingling sensation. It makes the 1 minute of rinsing feel so long and by the time I\u2019m done, my tongue doesn\u2019t feel great. The mouthwash certainly works I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t recommend this if you have even slightly sensitive teeth.",
