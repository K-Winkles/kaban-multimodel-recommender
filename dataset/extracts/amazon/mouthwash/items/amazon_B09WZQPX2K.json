This product claims a lot of things and so far I am very happy with the way my mouth is feeling. I do believe it is slowly whitening my teeth too. I use it by leaving it in my mouth for a few minutes in the shower. I pull the solution through my entire mouth swishing it around all over. So far I am ecstatic with the results. I will update as time goes on. At this point I would highly recommend. Your mouth feels so much cleaner after each use. And I do know my gums feel great too. This product is a winner in my book!",
