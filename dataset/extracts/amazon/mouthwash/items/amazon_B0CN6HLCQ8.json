I use it after I brush in the morning and at night and it seems to help with cleaner teeth (less weird film on my teeth) and bad breath. I don't think this is necessary if you have good flossing and brushing habits though, but I do like the minty burn you get when you swish it around for a minute or so.Might also be a good option if you primarily use fluoride-free toothpaste but still want to apply some fluoride here and there, maybe a bit less regularly (I don't have that problem as I use this on top of fluoride toothpaste).",

You get roughly 50 uses in this bottle so it'll last a little under two months. It's not a bad value for what you get considering it's got flouride too.",

It definitely tastes much better than old-school Listerine, but that flavor still comes through clearly under the mint. That \"medicine\" flavor largely goes away after I rinse though. My spouse is a long time anticavity rinse user (as per our dentist) but she didn't care for the taste of this one at all. I have no way of knowing whether this is an effective anti-cavity rinse, but I trust the brand so I am comfortable in assuming that it will work as advertised.",

However, this stuff is so powerful I could actually taste how minty and strong it was. I had a generic mouth rinse that I was using prior to getting this bottle and this stuff is much stronger and makes my mouth a lot fresher after using. This is a great mouth rinse!",
