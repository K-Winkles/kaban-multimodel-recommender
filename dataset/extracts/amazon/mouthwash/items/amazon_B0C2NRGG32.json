At first, I was hesitant to buy it because I didn\u2019t know if I really needed it or if this was better than other mouthwash products. Then I purchased it to try for my short conference travel. During the day after meals, I wasn\u2019t able to always brush my teeth but this was a quick alternative/easy way to make sure I didn\u2019t feel stinky. It did definitely make my breath fresh and it was so easy to use carrying in my purse. I saw that some people put these in visitor bathrooms in their house, which is what I\u2019m gonna do now. I don\u2019t know if I will regularly buy this, but I think I will purchase it when I think I need it. The quality of the mouthwash is also very good and it doesn\u2019t have any bitter or weird aftertaste. This is worth it if you are a traveler or have to speak with people a lot.",

The cool fresh mint flavor is great and doesn't burn your mouth. I would even use if I'm not traveling because of the flavor, freshnesses and how you don't have to worry about the typical backwash when you use a bottle of mouthwash.",

I normally don't feel comfortable with individually packaged items because of the amount of plastic that we know ends up in the landfill but I do make exceptions at times. I travel light and have tried every travel capsule in the market but they all leak, so I decided to try these packets. They taste great and one sachet lasts me 2-3 swigs.",
