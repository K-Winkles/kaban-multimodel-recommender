SmartMouth eliminates* and prevents the production of sulfur gases in the mouth \u2013 the real source of bad breath \u2013 for 12 times the protection. Many people don\u2019t realize that a number of common mouth ailments are actually symptoms of gum disease, yet an estimated 75% of Americans suffer from it. SmartMouth Clinical DDS contains an FDA-approved active ingredient that safely helps kill germs and prevent plaque that leads to gingivitis and gum disease.",

This new packaging which now has the eliminator and activator in 2 separate bottles (instead of both being in a partitioned, single bottle) was what we had hoped for all along. No more problems with one fluid running out before the other, and no more accidental spills from the old partitioned bottle which dumped out mouthwash even when tightly shut. Smart Mouth is still the only mouthwash we've used which can keep our breath fresh for extended hours at a time, and sometimes through 3 meals! It's totally worth the price.",
