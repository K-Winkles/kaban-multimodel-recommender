                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars So far, so good! ~ a review from a fluoride skeptic",
                "reviewText": "Long story warning! ~ I bought this rinse to try after having enamel/cavity issues. I went fluoride free for two years (jumped on the hippie bandwagon for my health), only to learn the horrifying truth that this was actually leading to my enamel loss, decay, and tooth sensitivity. :/ My teeth were horrible... receding gums, six cavities, and areas of decalcification despite having excellent oral hygiene. I had been using Earthpaste and/or baking soda, flossing with Oral B Pro Health floss, and rinsing with a xylitol mouth rinse. Upon experiencing my new tooth problems, I visited two different dentists and they both scolded me for not using fluoride. I expected this to happen, and it only made me irritable because I did NOT want to use any fluoride. I saw a third dentist... I heard he was amazing. I actually broke down and cried when he walked in to greet me at the office... \"I don't want to lose my teeth! I need advice!\" I cried. He asked me to tell him everything about my oral hygiene practises, diet, and oral health history. He was very patient, and then he spent a good five minutes looking at my teeth and gums. He then calmly sat back, looked at me, and then shared with me ALL the information he had about tooth health, and fluoride. He agreed that yes, it is toxic, but it's all about dosage. Iodine is an example of a toxic substance, but our bodies need it small doses. Contrary to what some people say, CALCIUM fluoride IS a naturally occurring mineral. There is also a synthetic version (SODIUM fluoride - aluminum waste byproduct that you will hear people talking about). He explained what happens to the tooth surface on a molecular level when fluoride ions make contact... it actually fills in many of the tiny pores, which strengthens and protects the tooth. He was very thorough and answered all my questions. What I really liked though, was that he didn't scold me or force me to give in to fluoride. He simply suggested that, I might be the sort of person who has more of a specific type of oral bacteria that contributes to tooth decay, meaning I could benefit from using fluoride topically in a rinse. This made sense to me, because even though I brush and floss regularly, I still developed cavities. However, my dad and my brother never floss and only brush once a day. They never get cavities! I took all this information to heart, and decided that I would try using fluoride again ONLY if it could be delivered in a safe, natural product. I found this rinse here on Amazon and thought \"THIS is what I'm looking for!\" I bought this with a heavy heart, still feeling a bit disappointed to go back to fluoride (I can't find a rinse with calcium fluoride. Even this one contains sodium fluoride, which is why I give it four stars). What I really like about this product is that it contains no dyes, or the harmful chemicals that other conventional rinses have.A few weeks after using this rinse (I rinse every night before bedtime), I noticed my sensitivity had gone away, my gums were healthier, and my teeth were glistening! I mean, they actually shine like glass! The super-white decalcified spots have also faded a bit and are less noticeable. My next dental checkup and cleaning is in April... I will give an update on my dental health at that time. Hopefully there will be no issues. :)Thanks for reading. -Laura",

                "reviewText": "I have used many types of mouthwash throughout my life and none of them have actually helped with my tooth sensitivity. After a week of using this mouthwash, my mouth is feeling much, much better - only rarely do I feel any mild sensitivity at all!I like this mouthwash because I was looking for something without all of the added dyes that so many have and without the alcohol, but I still wanted fluoride (easier said than done apparently). It is important to note that this mouthwash really does taste like the fluoride rinse many of us used to get from the dentist years ago (which doesn't taste great...). However, after doing it for the first week, I got used to the taste and don't mind it anymore.Be sure to shake the bottle before you use it, and make sure the cap is screwed on TIGHT before you shake it, or it will make a mess.Overall I am impressed with the difference that it's made in my dental health.",
