Accepted by the American Dental Association (ADA), this germ-killing mouthwash for bad breath is clinically shown to reduce plaque 52 percent more and reduce gingivitis 21 percent more than brushing and flossing alone. Adding a 30-second rinse of this refreshing mint flavored oral rinse to your morning and evening oral hygiene routines is all it takes to get 24-hour germ protection against those that cause bad breath, plaque, and gingivitis. From the #1 dentist recommended brand** of over the counter mouthwashes, Listerine Cool Mint Antiseptic Mouthwash contains the antiplaque and antigingivitis ingredients eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate and thymol. *Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction after a dental cleaning. Rinse is not intended to replace brushing or flossing. Use product only as directed. *when used twice daily **IQVIA survey May 2022-2026 Amazon.com Fights Biofilm Germs that Brushing Leaves BehindDid you know that even after brushing, there are millions of stubborn germs left in your mouth? These germs build up and form a sticky layer called biofilm that covers every surface of your mouth, and can lead to the gum disease gingivitis. LISTERINE Antiseptic's triple-action formula penetrates biofilm, kills germs, and protects you from plaque and gingivitis for up to twelve hours.COOL MINTLISTERINE Fights Germs with Essential OilsThe power of LISTERINE Antiseptic comes from a formula of four essential oils that kill millions of germs on contact. LISTERINE's fixed combination of eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol continues to deliver unsurpassed results. No other branded mouthwash has this formula.What is Biofilm?Biofilm is a more recent term for the bacterial film on your teeth we call plaque. Biofilm is an organized community of germs in a gooey matrix that enables them to multiply and survive inside your mouth. Brushing and flossing help disrupt and remove this biofilm, but sometimes may miss hard to reach areas-prime real estate for gingivitis causing germs. LISTERINE Antiseptic rapidly penetrates the biofilm to kill plaque and gingivitis germs.LISTERINE ANTISEPTIC has Over 100 Years of Safe UseLISTERINE ANTISEPTIC was shown in a clinical study to reduce 52 percent more plaque and 21 percent more gingivitis than brushing and flossing alone. It is the only nationally branded antimicrobial mouthwash to receive the ADA Seal of Acceptance for fighting plaque and gingivitis. LISTERINE ANTISEPTIC has over 100 years of safe use and 50 years of research, making it the most widely used and extensively researched mouthwash in the U.S. \"The ADA Council on Scientific Affairs' Acceptance of Listerine Antiseptic is based on its finding that the product is effective in helping to prevent and reduce gingivitis and plaque above the gumLine, when used as directed.\"A Whole-Mouth Clean is as Easy as 1-2-3You know the drill: 1) brush twice a day, 2) floss, and 3) rinse. But occasionally you forget some of these steps. You do many of the things you know are good for a healthy mouth, but you can do better. All it takes are small changes to your routine.Here are a few simple things you can do to get a healthier mouth:Replace your toothbrush every three or four months--sooner if the bristles are frayed. A worn toothbrush won't do as good a job of cleaning your teeth. Keep a few extra toothbrushes--like the REACH TOTAL CARE Multi-Action Toothbrush--on hand, so you can easily swap the old for the new.Visit your dentist twice a year for professional cleanings and oral exams. The more you go, the healthier your mouth will be--and those visits will seem less daunting.Maintain the healthy 1-2-3 oral-care routine: brush-floss-rinse. Make it a goal this week to brush and rinse twice in one day, and floss once. That extra 30 seconds of swishing, with a mouthwash like LISTERINE Antiseptic, will make your mouth so clean and healthy, you'll love the feeling and do it again the next day.The combination power of REACH and LISTERINE has been clinically proven to reduce gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis could progress to advanced gum disease, which emerging science suggests is associated with many other health problems.

Our dentist recommended that she use the Listerine Cool Mint a couple times each week to keep germs down without destroying all the good bacteria in her mouth. She uses a little medicine cup that we've saved from some other liquid medicine, to swish a small amount around in her mouth while she \"sings\" the Happy Birthday song in her mind, in order to swish it around long enough to do the job, then spits it out. She's been doing this for several years, and has had good results. So this is a helpful alternative for someone who cannot safely use dental floss.",
