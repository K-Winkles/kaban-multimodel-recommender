                "reviewText": "I'm so sad that I just now found this. As someone who has dealt with halitosis all my life (due to some metabolic thing, according to docs), this is an actual game changer in the truest sense. I literally almost wept & am recommending it to everyone. Until you know how bad breath affects every part of your life, you won't appreciate why this stuff is such a miracle.Getting started with it was tricky. First off, I was a bit thrown by the instructions for getting it set up to use. Once I understood that part, I didn't get all the plastic torn off of one of the 2 dispensers so only the clear liquid was coming out. Got THAT sorted and all was well. ( So... TIP: make sure that the plastic covering is completely off BOTH chambers before first use or you'll end up with just one of the liquids needed.)The taste is, of course, nothing like alcohol-based mouthwashes. It doesn't bother me while I'm swishing & gargling but there is a bit of after-taste. It's a very mild hydrogen peroxide flavor. I do not care. This is worth whatever as long as it keeps the bad breath away - and it does.I have used almost every kind of remedy there is for halitosis & some worked okay but only for a short period of time. This is the only one EVER that lasted all day & longer. I used it at night & woke up with clean breath for the first time in my life.The one thing about this setup is that you can't travel with it. The travel system looks like a 2-bottle situation but that will be worth it!You have to tell everyone with a breath problem about this. I am hoping that the travel bottles work as well. In the meantime, I am going to get some of the mints for use away from home.",

I took a paper clip to make sure there was nothing blocking the hole. Like a film from the thing you tear off. NOTHING. It still pours out of one hole. I called customer service and I got directions that are written on the bottle. Like I'm too dumb to read. I thought it was 100% guaranteed. Sort of makes me mad. It might work. But maybe in shipping, something happened. I wish everyone else much better luck.update.........I bought a different kind of smart mouth for dry mouth. This time I studied it a lot more. I used a toothpick and I got that bottle to work. I saw that when I tore off the cover there was a film left over the hole. So I went back to my other bottle and took that one apart. Then I got that one working again. I think they need to make a better bottle.",
