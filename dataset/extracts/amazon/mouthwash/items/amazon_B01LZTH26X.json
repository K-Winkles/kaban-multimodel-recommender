                "reviewText": "This is good stuff. If you want a natural version of a regular mouthwash. It has a relatively pleasant taste, keeps your breath fresh, there is nothing really to complain about. However, if you have serious problems like I do, you are going to have to use pure neem oil no matter how bad it tastes. The technique is called pulling. After that you're going to want to rinse with a regular mouthwash oh, maybe even this one, although it seems redundant. I'm not a dentist so I can't give medical advice but when I began swishing pure neem oil I had loose teeth. Dentist more than ten years ago told me I was going to lose all my teeth within a year. I haven't lost a single tooth.If you don't have gum disease I recommend this product, there is probably enough neenan there to prevent you if I'm getting a bacterial infection in your gum line.",
