Focusing on good oral care habits, and sticking to them, includes regular visits to your dentist, and a daily regimen of brushing, flossing, and rinsing with Listerine. The truth is that brushing reaches 25% of your mouth. Listerine cleans virtually 100%.* The power of the swish fights bad breath bacteria in your whole mouth, including on your teeth, tongue, and gums. Use Listerine mouthwash twice a day to reach its deep-clean effectiveness. After all, bad breath germs are in your mouth all day, every day, and rinsing twice a day provides 24-hour germ protection. For Listerine rinse to reach its full powerful potential, use as directed and rinse vigorously for 30 seconds twice daily. *Study # FCLGBP0028, conducted in 2010. Listerine Antiseptic Gives You a Whole Mouth Clean With over 35 years of clinical support, Listerine is the world's most clinically researched mouthwash brand*. Its bold tingle has been America's favorite. Listerine Antiseptic is the key to getting your whole mouth clean. You\u2019ll get 24-hour germ protection with twice daily usage, and clinically proven oral health benefits. Listerine Antiseptic has the power to kill germs that lead to bad breath, plaque and gum disease, and 21% greater gingivitis reduction and greater reach than brushing and flossing alone. Listerine Antiseptic provides virtually 100% coverage on teeth, between teeth and along the gum line, and is the only nationally branded antimicrobial mouthwash to receive the ADA Seal of Acceptance for fighting plaque and gingivitis**. * Panorama 2015 **ADA 2018 99% germ-kill study # FCLGBP0028, conducted in 2010. How to Swish What happens each time you swish properly? Research shows that antimicrobial Listerine mouthwash kills oral bacteria within 30 seconds for a difference you will notice with continued use. In fact, the bacteria in plaque and saliva samples were killed within 30 seconds of coming into contact with Listerine rinse. Don\u2019t give germs a fighting chance. Swish the full 30 seconds to make sure you\u2019re getting a truly clean mouth.",

Gingivitis can be so mild, in fact, that you may not even recognize it. Gingivitis is caused by the buildup of bacteria in our mouths, which combine into a sticky substance called plaque. Plaque infects and inflames the gums, developing into gingivitis. Symptoms may include redness and swelling of gums and bleeding while brushing. How can you prevent gingivitis, and what are the benefits of mouthwash? The best way to prevent gingivitis is to maintain a healthy oral care routine, including brushing twice a day, flossing once a day, and rinsing twice a day. Good oral care habits keep your mouth clean and healthy; remove plaque, maintain a healthy diet, and see your dentist at least once every six months.",
