Since then, I haven't stopped using it, and let me tell you, it's transformed my oral hygiene routine. The cool mint flavor is incredibly refreshing, leaving my mouth feeling clean and rejuvenated every time. Not only does it provide long-lasting fresh breath, but I also appreciate its effectiveness in killing germs that cause bad breath and plaque buildup.Without a doubt, I highly recommend Listerine Cool Mint to anyone seeking a dependable mouthwash that truly delivers results.",

The bottles were not damaged and the caps were just fine. No cracks. My mouth feels fresh and clean after using the mouthwash. I can feel it working. No unpleasant burning sensation. This is a great choice for your oral hygiene.Good deal for two bottles.",
