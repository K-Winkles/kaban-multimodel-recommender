                "reviewText": "I have endured years of dry mouth and oral bacterial colonization. Of course, it is common knowledge that bacteria inhabit almost every cavity in the body. That isn't what I'm talking about here. What I'm talking about is not normal and manifests as white film on my tongue. I have tried every major toothpaste and mouthwash to date. None of them worked, until I stumbled on Riven Probiotic Mouth. Within two weeks of using this product, I knew I had found my answer. Not wanting to run out, I ordered two additional bottles. The manufacturer was out because I think many had discovered it too. I don't know if this product works so well because of the care the manufacturer takes to ensure that the bacteria in the formulation that's delivered to one's doorstep are viable for the entire duration of use or whether it's because of the synergy of the ingredients used. The short of it is, this product is life-changing and I would dare say miraculous. I use an antimicrobial, fluoride-based toothpaste. I give it about an hour to work before using this probiotic mouthwash. I'm able to do this because the bacteria in the formulation are viable at room temperature and is ideal to take anywhere.Opinions may change over time, but I see this product as the future of oral care. Period. It's that good.",

The first time I tried it I used it right before bed, which I learned was a mistake because the aftertaste is terrible and I ended up having to taste it all night long. I decided instead to take it in the mornings, and that worked out better. It still has a bitter aftertaste, but if you eat or drink a little something an hour later, it takes care of it. I did like the way my gums felt after using it. However, I am not sure how effective it was in restoring the flora balance\u2026I actually quit using it and seem to be recovering better without it! That being said, I feel like it was too expensive for the mixed results I experienced",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this probiotic mouthwash from Amazon and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with the results. After just a few uses, I can already feel the difference in my oral health.What sets this mouthwash apart from other drug store alternatives like Listerine is that it contains probiotics, which help to balance the natural bacteria in your mouth. Not only does this help to improve your overall oral health, but it also helps to prevent bad breath.The taste of this mouthwash is also much more pleasant than other brands I've tried. It has a subtle mint flavor that doesn't leave an overpowering aftertaste or burn like some of the other mouthwashes on the market.One of the things I appreciate most about this product is that it is alcohol-free. This means that it doesn't dry out my mouth or cause any discomfort, which can often be a side effect of using other mouthwashes.Overall, I would highly recommend this probiotic mouthwash to anyone looking to improve their oral health. It is effective, gentle, and has a great taste. I don't think I could ever go back to using other drug store alternatives like Listerine after experiencing the benefits of this product.",
