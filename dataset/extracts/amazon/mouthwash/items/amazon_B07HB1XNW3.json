So do not swish vigorously! Doing a one minute rinse is impossible if you do! It foamed so much on me, I'm glad I tried it before using with patients. Fluoride will immediately strengthen teeth, reverse some cavities, and help reduce swelling, which aides the healing process. The 1.5% hydrogen peroxide is the highly promoted in the dental field today to reduce microbial population to safe levels to obtain a stable oral health status.- Registered Dental Hygienist",
