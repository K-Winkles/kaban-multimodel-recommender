                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised by this mouthwash. After trying it the for the first time I was hesitant that it was going to work. It does not have a strong flavor, I would like there to be more upfront flavor. I am so used to other mouthwashes being so overpowered with flavor that I assumed this would be like that. But I was pleasantly surprised after waking up the next morning with my mouth feeling fresher than it ever had with other brands. My breath was better in the morning, my wife confirmed this. I highly recommend this mouthwash. It is amazing, although I would like a little more upfront flavor.",

                "reviewText": "My dentist recommended this. He told me to stop using Listerine immediately, as it kills ALL the bacteria in your mouth, even the GOOD bacteria your mouth needs!This mouth wash is so refreshing. Like rinsing with water with a hint of mint. I wish I would have switched sooner!!!I use this in conjunction with the Therabreath Pre Brush. Never had a freshener feeling and cleaner mouth than this",

                "reviewText": "After much research, I decided on TheraBreath Fresh Breath Mouthwash. I've been using this product for a few years after brushing my teeth. There is a noticeable difference between how my teeth feel, how my breath smells, and how long my mouth feels clean after using this product, vs just water alone post brushing. I recommend swishing for 30 seconds, that appears to be the optimal time for cleaning.I don't like Listerine, with alcohol, or other non-alcohol products, how they taste, or how my teeth feel afterwards.",
