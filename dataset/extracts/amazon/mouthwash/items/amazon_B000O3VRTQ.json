With CloSYS Mouthwashes you can protect your mouth from harmful bad breath germs and freshen your breath without the painful burn. CloSYS is one of the first mouthwashes to receive the American Dental Association seal for reducing bad breath. This gentle but powerful mouthwash is perfect for all ages because its patented formula is pH balanced and so gentle you\u2019ll actually use it longer for better results. A 30-second rinse in the morning and evening after each brushing is easy, and all it takes to get great results. CloSYS Ultra Sensitive Mouthwash comes unflavored so it's like water and even tastes like water. But if you want to add your own flavoring it comes with an optional flavor dropper (mint) so you can add a little, a lot, or not at all. Nothing overpowering or painful. Just a clean, fresh, soothing mouthwash you\u2019ll actually use, because CloSYS is the Gentlest Oral Care Ever.",

If using it with everything else will keep me and my loved ones out of a dentists chair nothing else matters to me. *A little FYI you can get a weird taste in your mouth if used after eating certain foods.

This brand is great because you can get it unflavored.It works well for those who have sensitive gums.Your breath smells fresh and clean.It does come with peppermint essential oil (food grade) that you can flavor the bottle to your liking. It's a large bottle too, so I feel like I'm getting a great deal on a mouthwash that works for my mouth.",

                "reviewText": "The bottle top is much smaller on my bottle, with a flange on its base that was broken. There are no instructions as to dosage on the bottle, nor any visible markings to that effect on the top. The flavor dropper has very tiny instructions around its perimeter. I couldn't tell that its contents added any flavor to the mouthwash, even as a single drop in the filled top. The incredibly mild taste doesn't exactly inspire confidence that the product is doing anything for my oral hygiene, so don't trust my ratings as a user.",
