                "reviewText": "It'd been a long time since my wife and I had used mouth wash, but our dentist recommended it and gave specifics about the bottle needing to have \"Fluoride\" or \"Anticavity\" in the title, so it worked out that this ACT product had both. We bought the six bottles for $32, which isn't the best bargain I've had on Amazon, but I figured they would last a while and would not go bad.We have used it for at least a week now, and I must say there are at least three great things about it:1. The bottle design is really innovative. You squeeze the bottle and liquid squirts out into the top from two little spigots and then sits there for you to pour into your mouth from the bottle. I'm probably not describing it well, but it's smart, simple, and effective. It saves the need to pour into a cap or a separate cup. There is also a fill line drawn near the top of the bottle, so you just squeeze until the liquid hits that mark.2. There is no alcohol in the product so the burn factor is limited. I remember mouth wash being kind of painful. This still burns a little, but not nearly as much as the traditional product.3. Great taste. It's hard to go wrong with mint, but it's still something to be appreciated.Good stuff!",
