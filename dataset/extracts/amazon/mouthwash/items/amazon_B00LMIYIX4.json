                "reviewText": "For the last 10 years, I've had growing issues with gum recession due to stress, depression. My home care was never the issue, so it got very stressful and terrifying - felt like I was doing everything I should, but the gums still got lower and thinner. Not cool - nobody wants their teeth to fall out! So I went on my journey to lower my stress and take care of my health. I started using this tonic after learning about it from a natural dentist. Well...it is the best mouthwash I've EVER used. I love this brand. I've also used their irrigant, which is nice. I know the product IS pricey, BUT, you pay for quality. It uses all natural ingredients (no chemical colorants to make it oh so blue) and it tastes amazing! You know you're actually giving your mouth a deep clean with safe ingredients. Also, you don't need to use a lot because it's potent.",
