                "reviewText": "A journey towards superior oral health and self-assured interactions commenced when SmartMouth DDS Activated Clinical Mouthwash made an entrance into my daily regimen. The adventure began three months ago and it's been a stride of fresh breath and healthier gums ever since. The ease of use is as delightful as the clean mint flavor that dances in the mouth, leaving a trail of freshness that endures.Unlike other mouthwashes that merely mask bad breath, SmartMouth engages in a duel to eliminate it, courtesy of its clinical strength. This potency, however, doesn't come at the cost of comfort. The absence of that burning sensation, often a companion of many mouthwashes, was a refreshing reprieve. The robust packaging of the trio ensures that this elixir is a lasting companion, promising days of confident conversations.The nuanced blend of ingredients in this mouthwash doesn't just fight against gingivitis, but champions gum health, setting a higher bar in a market flooded with fleeting freshness. It\u2019s indeed a noteworthy stride towards embracing not just a product, but a lifestyle of confident interactions and superior oral health. SmartMouth stands tall not as a fleeting moment of freshness, but as a dawn of enduring oral health and self-assurance. The journey of fresh breath is a long one, and with SmartMouth, it's a journey worth taking every day.",

                "reviewText": "If you have gum issues, this stuff is for you. I've tried lots of stuff, including prescription mouthwashes to heal an area of inflamed gums . Nothing worked. I tried Smartmouth DDS and after a few days, the inflammation started going away and the burning and pain associated with it also diminished. The key here is to use it faithfully. As far as the breath claims...it works! No bad breath for almost the entire day and when you wake up, no morning breath. The only drawback to the breath issue is this will leave a funny taste in your mouth all day. Not really right after using it but hours later, it tends to leave a taste in your mouth that is so-so. Now for the bad...the delivery system is horrible. It is almost impossible to pour equal amounts of this stuff just by turning the bottle over. It will just spill all over the place. I've resorted to holding my finger over 1 port while I pour the other liquid and vice versa. At least I am getting an equal portion of each liquid with no waste. Finally, this stuff is WAY too expensive and will probably prohibit me from continuing this every day as you only get 16oz per container for $13.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this and the dry mouth version both work great! I quit smoking almost 9 years ago and thought the nasty taste in my mouth would go away, it didn't. I go to the dentist regularly, I brush my teeth, gums, tongue, inside of cheeks the whole works and within 10 minutes the terrible taste in mouth was back. I am unable to tolerate the well known or generic versions of mouthwash it just burns too bad and the few times I forced myself to tolerate it within minutes that icky taste in my mouth was back. This doesn't burn, I can swish it as long as I want. Even when chewing gum, breath mints, hard candy I couldn't get taste out of my mouth. Since my mouth tasted so bad I was sure my breath was just as bad. I came across this by accident I wasn't searching for something, I had given up hope. I'm so glad I did! After the first use that taste in my mouth was gone and has stayed gone! Since I'm single and have no concerns over morning breath and on a small budget I only use this in the morning but that's enough to keep my mouth tasting normal, clean, and fresh! It's so nice to be confident my breath does not smell bad and to no longer worry about talking to people especially in close quarters such as sitting next to each other. I have not had any of the problems others have complained of with it spilling during shipping. Mine has always been sealed. Also I have not had problems with one side of the mouthwash running out before the other. I'm wondering if it's in the way some are holding/pouring it that causes that. I hold mine approx 4\" above cap, and tilt bottle forward with both openings facing directly forward and both sides pour out evenly. Just like you'd pour milk into a glass. I do not angle the bottle sideways which would result in one side pouring out more than the other. Just tilt the bottle forward w both openings facing forward evenly and pour. I highly recommend this and will never be without it. It has made such a positive difference in my life greatly increasing my confidence. Try it you won't be sorry.",

Still excellent product.Ive tried most the popular highest rated mouthwashes on Amazon, and they do not even compare. I might as well be swishing water with the others. There is some kind of chemical effect that happens with this mouth wash, but it definitely lasts all day, and if you use it daily you do feel the change.Of course, the only complaint is the price. It lasts a little over a month. We are probably paying double the price of fellow US citizens. I would say its worth it for actually working, however.",
