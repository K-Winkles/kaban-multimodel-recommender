It\u2019s like it\u2019s job is to kill the bad odor and not just to cover it up with this overwhelming minty taste that doesn\u2019t last. This product last for probably 10 hours at a time. Coffee and garlic will weaken its power. I normally only use it during the daytime but I was curious if it would work overnight so I tried that one time. My breath wasn\u2019t perfect the next morning but it was much much better than it normally is. Wonderful for travel and so convenient.",

I hate hate hate bad breath on myself or anyone I am around. ESPECIALLY morning breath between you and your significant other. This product is incredible. Each of you use it prior to bed and in the morning each of you will have perfect breath. Use it before going out for the night and entire evening your breath is fresh and non offensive. I have used this for at least 5 years and was grateful when the company created the travel package. I use them every day.. And my dentist says I have the healthiest teeth and gums and attributed it 100% to my brushing, water pic, and Smart Mouth habits. I will always use this product if it remains available. Thank you for being a perfect product for me.",

                "reviewText": "I gave SMARTMOUTH in the duo pump bottles to all on my Xmas 2022 list. All recipients said it was \u201chands down, the best-ever mouthwash of [their] lives.\u201d The recipients also travel for business, pleasure & do mid-day speaking engagements. These travel sized packets are IDEAL to tuck in a pocket or satchel! Yesterday, a friend told me she gave her daughter travel packets for her daughter to use on a week-long business trip to VietNam. These are a \u201cnecessity\u201d NOT a \u201cluxury\u201d. Stock up - you\u2019ll use them- colleagues will note your fresh mouth & suddenly you\u2019ll either hoard or (as I prefer) share & introduce with others! This is a win-win item!Note to Amazon: the manufacturer offers a larger quantity- sadly, the mfgr does not ship to my zip code, so I\u2019m stuck with Amazon\u2019s offers of 3 packs. Please offer the larger quantity of travel, one-time use packets! Thank you!!!",

I\u2019ve been using it for at least a year now but I noticed the difference in my breath almost immediately. It\u2019s not even detectable in the morning.
