                "reviewText": "I have always been a Listerine person, it has been the brand I grew up with. But Crest has been one of the regular brands for toothpaste in our family since before I was born. I still like the original formula of the other but it\u2019s is getting hard to find as the trendy flavors are becoming more popular. So today I decided to give this a try. The most obvious thing I noticed is this has a far more intense flavor, which can be a good thing for some and a bad thing for others. I think I like being able to feel and taste what\u2019s being put into my mouth so I consider it a good thing. I also believe the breath freshener aspects of it as a mouthwash will last longer and that\u2019s why people use it.VALUEThe price of the other brand has continued to skyrocket, which I don\u2019t get, it must cost Pennie\u2019s to make. Crest is also a major brand but not quite such a hit in the walletYES NO MAYBEI can\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to decide based on other people\u2019s opinions, mouthwash is kind of a personal thing. I think I will continue to use this brand, at least for a while, which means I like it.",
