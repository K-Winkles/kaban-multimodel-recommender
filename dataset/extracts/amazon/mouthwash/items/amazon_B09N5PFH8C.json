We were impressed a product could survive that long. We suspected the product was in existence because it was tried and true. We were curious. The French/English word usage on the label suggested, to us, this \u201coriginal\u201d mouthwash originated in England or France. That intrigued us even more. The vintage label even suggested nothing had changed, in all those years. You do not mess with success.We were fooled. There is little in the way of this being original, as to formulation. Back in the day, the EUTHYMOL brand supposedly used a formulation of eucalyptus and thymol. These ingredients do not appear in today\u2019s formulation, but the taste is said to be like the toothpaste, which we understand still contains at least the thymol.What\u2019s Thymol?Thymol is a derivative found in thyme oil, extracted from the plant family referred to as Thymus vulgaris, a flowering plant in the mint family. So, it makes sense this has historically had a mint type flavor, that some people identify with a root beer kind of taste. Now, since there is no accounting for taste, we will not try to persuade on the good or bad of that. But at least give you an idea. Thymol had been to have a pleasant aromatic odor and strong antiseptic properties, so makes sense it was being used in mouthwash. However, today, with the absence of Thymol, the manufacturers use other formulations for antiseptic properties, and colorings, thickening agents, and flavorings to mimic the past formula, the toothpaste and that pink color, which reminded us of Pepto Bismal in color and viscosity, to some degree. This is not a gel but seemed thicker than water.As for claims of benefits, there is none listed. We did learn of a study that suggested using this helped increase residual fluoride concentration in one\u2019s saliva longer. Finally, EUTHYMOL\u00ae mouthwash was expected to improve availability of active ingredients and long-lasting freshness. Alcohol is a listed ingredient on the label. Used as we would any other mouthwash, followed-up with a water rinse. Compared to other mouthwashes, this has a premium price. It\u2019s really geared to those who want to continue with that EUTHYMOL\u00ae taste, and pay for the privilege of having such.We are okay with all the above, however, what strikes us in a way that we must address, is that although this may have originally been a brand outta England, it\u2019s now made in Korea. We are okay with that, but we just do not care to be led down a path that suggests differently. Also, we think the failure to picture the back of the label, with its current ingredients and location of manufacture was not the disclosure that could have been. At this time, we cannot say we would select this again.",
