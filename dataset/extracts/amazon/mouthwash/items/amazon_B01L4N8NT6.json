I stopped using mouthwash a couple of years ago because a lot of it messes with the PH in your mouth. This stuff works great! helped with sensitivity within a day or two and my teeth feel better in general. My dentist also said I made a great choice picking some of this up.I highly recommend!",

I do see a lot of people confused about the bottle size difference with the 18oz and 32oz. The 32oz has less fluoride because it's meant to be used TWICE DAILY. It's not \"2x\" because of the size. The 18oz has more fluoride in it because you only use it once a day. I use it at night. I hate using mouthwash in the morning, so I bought the 18oz so I only have to use it at night.",
