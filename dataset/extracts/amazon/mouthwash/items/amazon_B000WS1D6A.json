I flossed every day and still had an ache and unexplainable discomfort in my gums. (Yes, I go to the dentist regularly). With a week ahead of us, away from home, I came across this wash in a Whole Foods in Richmond, VA. A few swishes of this (very strong tasting and smelling\u2014 in a good way) wash and my ache subsided. I used it for the remainder of the week away and had NO discomfort from, what turned out to be a need to have a root canal. A rotten freakin\u2019 root, that caused discomfort and a weird smell that- the OLD dentist missed for maybe 2 years- No joke, this wash works.New dentist is great and a 4 hour procedure gave me a lovely porcelain crown.In addition, my husband had an itchy \u201croof of mouth\u201d thing going on and within 2 swishes, it was gone. Maybe it was allergies... we don\u2019t know.It feels good, it smells good.. it\u2019s REALLY strong. I recommend this if you\u2019re having a weird mouth thing.",

This is the best product and I have since ordered 2 more bottles and will continue to purchase. It has soothed my gums which is fantastic. I also got my husband to try it and guess what he loves it. Thank you.",
