But, nobody wants bad breath, so I was interested in trying this alcohol-free formula.I used this at night with my regular dental routine. The formula did give me some tingles, but nothing I couldn't handle and much less intense than regular Listerine. I did choose to rinse out my mouth because I'm not a huge fan of mint taste. One observation - it did make my mouth feel quite dry afterwards.I asked my spouse to check my breath that night and he said it didn't smell like anything, which is a win. Upon waking the next morning, my mouth felt much fresher than normal. I asked my spouse to check again, BEFORE brushing my teeth, and he said it still smelled like nothing! That's a win for me.",

This mouthwash definitely has an after taste! -- although not bad, I feel it leaves the mouth feeling very dry - yet clean. What makes this mouth wash different is the advertised clinical breath defense. I have noticed it really helps with mouth odor. You know that unpleasant morning odor? Yep, this helps get rid of it, along with a good toothbrushing session and flossing too -- as everyone should be doing this anyway. Will definitely purchase a bottle once we finish this one in my home.",

This mouthwash has a more medicinal flavor and smell than the standard mint mouthwashes they sell, but it\u2019s not too unpleasant. I can\u2019t say that my breath smells all that different than it usually does a full 24 hours after using this mouthwash, as the bottle claims it should. However, my mouth does feel fresher on the mornings and early afternoons when I\u2019ve used this mouthwash even after I\u2019ve drank coffee and tea. I think the price is a little steep for this mouthwash but it may be worth the investment for someone who is struggling to eliminate bad breath caused by bacteria.",

                "reviewText": "This mouthwash has less of a sting than my original mouthwash which is kinda nice, although I usually rely on that sting to let me know that I have gotten all the areas of my mouth thoroughly. It seems to do its job really well though. It keeps my breath smelling good for long periods. At least until I eat something that changes that. I am not sure any mouthwash can claim fresh smelling breath all day if you are a person that.. ya know actually eats food.",

                "reviewText": "This Listerine is a bit more mild than the normal one - likely due to the fact that it is an alcohol-free version. It has a pleasant mint flavor and you still feel a bit of a tinge as it works, but not the burn of traditional mouthwash. I do wish that the cap had measuring markings on it. I recommend this if you prefer alcohol-free or don't like the strength of regular Listerine.",
