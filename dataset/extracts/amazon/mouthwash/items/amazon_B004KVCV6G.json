                "reviewText": "I purchased it and waited until the moment to use it came, up until the very first time I used it I was always a non-believer. But, after that, I suggest that anybody who`s contemplating this product, for the same reasons as mine, go ahead and get it, don`t worry about second-guessing any thoughts you might have. It`s not about a miracle, but it does take away any inconvenient sensation in your mouth, and, after using it three times, my mouth was healed. The inside of my mouth reacts badly to any kind of burning and it usually takes time to heal, but this product gave a good deal of comfort, at the first use. I am certainly getting another one today.",
