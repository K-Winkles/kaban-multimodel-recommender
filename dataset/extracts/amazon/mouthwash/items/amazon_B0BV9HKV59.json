I guess I just wish it was mintier.The bottle is fairly small but you get three and they're great for travel.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know what to think about this. First I was excited to have a compact mouthwash to take on travel and in the go. When I got it, I looked for instructions. But the only thing in the box I could find in the way of instructions was located in the front label(see photo). It says swish twice a day. So I eagerly pumped some in my mouth. And it was like taking a mouth full of hydrogen peroxide. The foam expanded and filled my mouth. It didn\u2019t taste anything like I was expecting. I am use to strong minty flavors. This was not very minty. It started off minty then became this odd flavor. Yes the mint flavor continues to be there but it was quite subtle. The bubbles from the foam became overwhelming in my mouth while I attempted to swish. They went into my throat and I felt like I was going to gag. I coughed a lot, it sort of felt like it was choking me but certainly not really doing so. Once you spit it out when you inhale you can feel the mint. I went to look at the advertisement and there appears to be some instruction online. You are suppose to spit it out, of course. I decided to look further at the ingredients. Much to my surprise Garlic Extract is the first item listed. I tried researching the effects of this in bad breath but I couldn\u2019t find anything but hundreds of articles about garlic contributing to bad breath. I\u2019m confused. Anyway, the foam is just too much for me to take. Coughing and gagging and a slight burn at the back of my mouth / start of my throat are reasons I won\u2019t be a repeat customer. I also didn\u2019t notice that it gave me fresher breath throughout the day. Maybe it did but I didn\u2019t notice. I don\u2019t often have halitosis but I do get dry mouth that can lead to that. I like the small containers and I think they would be great for travel. Give it a try and see if you can take the foaming bubbles.",

In 3 pumps of this small container, you will have enough to pretty well sanitize your mouth. It tastes slightly minty but feels like hydrogen peroxide. The foam changes consistency and it feels like your mouth is getting a deep clean. You'll want to rinse several times after using but then you have that \"just brushed\" feeling even when you didn't. It's a small bottle, easy to keep in your purse or in your desk at the office.",
