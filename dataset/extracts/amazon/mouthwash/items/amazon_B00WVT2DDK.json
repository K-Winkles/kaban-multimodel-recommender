I don't know what the ingredient is that's irritating me, but I do know it's not fluoride because I can tolerate Tom's toothpaste just fine.For five years I've been hunting for an alternative to the regular stuff and it's all crappy. Nothing seems to leave me feeling fresh and they don't work. I've been struggling with staining, yeast and bacterial overgrowth, and plaque since I switched. This mouthwash combined with one toothpaste makes the perfect combination. I used this mouthwash in the first afternoon that I got it and again before bed. By morning the chronic yeast problem on my tongue was gone! Over the last week I don't have anymore new staining. (Now I just have to get the old stuff removed)At almost $10, it's a little pricey, but not so much that I can't manage it. Totally worth it! Tastes really good, burns a little but not horrible, and actually WORKS!",

Amazon did good job shipping and securing with air bags however upon opening the items box I received a used or tampered item, very discussed! You can see the seal floating In the liquid and the foil safety lid sticker was clearly broken off. This is a HUGE concern as this could possibly be a health problem. Sellers has not address anything to me. Buyer beware!!",

It's light, crisp, and the bottle is minimalist - giving dapper vibe.Only complaint is that the amount is somewhat small but I guess I'm too use to the larger mouthwash sizes. It's more me than the product on that though.",
