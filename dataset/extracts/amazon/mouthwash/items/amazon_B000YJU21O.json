I tend to use flouride just before bedtime and I do not need the \"burst of flavor\" to wake me up. After several months, most of that bottle of mint remained unused. I tried this flavor at my hygienist's suggestion. It is much \"smoother.\" The flavor is not great but not bad, especially if you grew up chewing old-fashioned bubble gum. The fill device is also quicker to use. Squeeze the bottle until the attached cup is full, then empty that cup directly into the mouth and swish.",
