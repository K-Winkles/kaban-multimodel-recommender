Great taste and it's the only mouthwash I've ever found (Crest and Colgate included) that actually feels like it cleans the teeth. A lot of people have told me to go with the regular tea tree mouthwash by Desert Essence but it tasted horrible and (in my opinion) only did a mediocre job of cleaning my teeth and no whitening to be seen. This does taste pretty strongly of mint so if that's not your cup of tea I'd avoid it but if you're looking for a good cruelty free mouthwash that freshens breath and leaves your teeth clean, TRY THIS. Better than both Jason and Auromere.",

While I prefer spearmint to peppermint as far as minty flavors, this one is excellent for a peppermint. It really zaps your mouth with a clean taste and makes your mouth tingle with a cool, fresh taste. I definitely will buy this one again. Too early to say if it does a great job of whitening yet, because I just got it, and that usually takes a little time and regular use, so I'll let you know about that later. For now I'm really happy I tried this one!",
