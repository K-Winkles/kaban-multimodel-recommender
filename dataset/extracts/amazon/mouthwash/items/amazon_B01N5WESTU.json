                "reviewText": "This is a terrific mouthwash, honestly. I have teeth implants & foods get stuck under the plates as my implants have 3 teeth on 2 implants. Because of this I must use a water pic & there\u2019s always a poor taste in my mouth hours after eating. This mouthwash is all natural & by swishing it in my mouth for 30 seconds it keeps my mouth fresh all day literally so, & no poor taste from my implants any longer! No alcohol, nor harmful chemicals that other mouthwashes certainly have. The skin is the largest organ in the body, & the mouth is even more sensitive,(this is why many medications people take are dissolved under the tongue because it enters the bloodstream immediately). So, when you use regular mouthwashes those harmful chemicals included within them go directly into your body\u2019s bloodstream. Toms natural mouthwash has no alcohol & no harmful chemicals, so I feel safe using it, it keeps my mouth & breath fresh all day, & it\u2019s cost effective to purchase a case of them from Amazon,(saving me gas, wear/tear on my vehicle because I don\u2019t have to drive to the store to purchase it, I don\u2019t have to go to a crowded store with Covid & Monkey Pox prevalent now, & can have it delivered to my home, saving me even more with free shipping and handling, because I purchase Prime with Amazon & S/H essentially pays for itself with in one month for our household). A win-win purchase all around for my Family & Myself! Thank you Amazon.",
