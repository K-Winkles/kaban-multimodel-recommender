                "reviewText": "I got this for my 90yr old mom who has Sjogrens. It definitely helps. It does not reverse her problem it just helps it maintain moisture by helping to activate saliva. The pepper in it is definitely tolerable and actually helps the activation of saliva in the mouth so I get why it is in the ingredient list. If she is having a dry mouth flare up, which basically means more bacteria in the mouth, then she does have a harder time with the rinse. Keep in mind the ingredients are not making her dry mouth worse, the Sjogrens does this especially if you are not eating healthy. Great product with great results for her and great ingredients. Can't go wrong here.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Lumineux Moisturizing Mouthwash since January 2019 when my dentist recommended that I change to a mouth wash that would assist with saliva production. He recommended a brand that is chemically manufactured which I am totally against. This mouthwash has been amazing. I used to have to keep candy in my mouth to produce moisture. Sometimes I still get a very dry mouth and need something to assist with moisture production but since using this Moisturizing mouthwash reguarly, that has become a \"now and then\" instead of a constant. This change has decreased my cavaties and made for easier cleanings at the dentist. The flavor is a little weird and takes some getting used to but don't let that stop you from trying something that works for dry mouth. Shake well, pour quickly into cap and pop into your mouth. The flavor is tolerable and the ingredients will help improve your oral condition.",

Such a disappointment because I know that the whitening aspect of the mouthwash probably works well considering all of the other Luminex products that work so well.
