This product doesn't sting or make my eyes tear up, it has a pleasant lingering sense of fresh breath, and helps me feel good about maintaining a \"keto\" eating lifestyle. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like the usual unpleasantness of regular mouthwash, whether or not you are eating a special diet where \"keto\" breath might be your concern. It may be a bit more expensive than the standard OTC mouth wash, but I seldom use the other stuff because it is so stringent and harsh; this is very fresh feeling without harshness.",
