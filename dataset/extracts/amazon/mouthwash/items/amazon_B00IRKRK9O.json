I got the icy mint and I am a big fan! It is tingly but not burning. The after taste is pleasant and I wake up with a normal tasting mouth, not morning breath. If I rinse after a meal it takes away food odors and is mild enough in taste I'm not worried about an orange juice and Toothpaste kind of bad flavor. I don't have to rinse my mouth after using to get rid of the burn and it doesn't hurt/burn my cheeks or gums. I prefer this over any I've tried because it leaves my mouth feeling clean but not overpowering with strong flavor or discomfort of any kind. I appreciate that the liquid is clear as well so If you spill a drop or two there's not an ugly blue stain on the sink or counter. Will recommend and repurchase!",

                "reviewText": "So this review is gonna get a bit personal. I brush my teeth and do all the things I am supposed to but still had bad breath. I didn\u2019t understand what it was and was even at times to the point I felt so self conscious when needing to speak to people especially if up close. I decided I really had to do something one day when I got in the car and my wife actually asked me did I remember to brush my teeth. I got mad at her and realized quickly after I was only angry because I felt bad about me. I had previously seen therabreath but figured it was like every other mouth wash that promises results. I decided to try it and it is only one week in but on day one (I tried it as soon as it arrived) I went and blew in my wife face and she said it smelt good I can\u2019t recall the last time I felt confident with my breath. Better yet after doing it before bed I woke up and there was no morning breath. My breath actually smelt better than my wife\u2019s. I actually a, confident now at random times of the day going and asking my wife how my breath smells. I feel confident at work and since starting I have been using as instructed and have had no signs of bad breath. I feel like I can live again because of this. My only concern is with doing two capfuls twice a day (as instructed) it seems I will go through one bottle a week and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need to keep so many on hand. I haven\u2019t found where they sell a large bottle just two bottles together. Would rather it come in a larger size.",

The minty flavor is not too over powering. It\u2019s very unique to say the least. I bought the two bottles package so I\u2019m going to try this out and see how it goes.",

I tried every possible thing in my reach, the funny thing is I visited Otolaryngologist thinking it might solve this, I ended up spending 2000$ but in vain. I am not exaggerating but I became suicidal. I look Good, have quite good teeth, good smile but bad breath played a devil in my life. I did lose quite a lot, some places I was rejected, some places I rejected myself because I knew I would be rejected ultimately. While talking over phone to anyone I could play the master and win, but if I use to talk to anyone in person, Gosh you can guess \"Bad Breath\". If you are facing this then look no further it will do its work.",
