                "reviewText": "When originally buying the toothpaste version of this flavoring, I enjoyed the taste instead of mint (mint tastes spicy to me that's why I buy non-mint toothpastes/mouthwash). When I opened the package and looked at the bottle I accidentally bought it not knowing this didn't have fluoride (MY MISTAKE). Now when I actually bought and tasted this, it had a watermelon taste but under that flavor tasted like salt water! It wasn't like I drank seawater with a hint of watermelon, but it was like swishing saltwater to relieve a sore throat with some watermelon flavoring added. The aftertaste was better as there wasn't any hint of salt in it. I'm not sure why the taste is there, from reading the ingredients I would assume something like the aloe vera in it, but I didn't really go in depth researching the reasons why the direct taste would be salty. In short, The mouthwash's direct flavor had an under-taste of saltwater but was not in the aftertaste, will probably not buy this again.",
