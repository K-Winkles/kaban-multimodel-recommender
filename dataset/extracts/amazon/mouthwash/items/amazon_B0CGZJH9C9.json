                "reviewText": "This alcohol free mouthwash is very effective at freshening breath, and is gentle on the soft tissue of my mouth. I love the lime and mint flavor, though it is a bit heavier on the cinnamon taste than I expected. This mouthwash is easy to dispense into the upper collection bulb, by squeezing the bottle and letting the liquid flow upwards. The caps stay secure through movement, and the small bottles are great for travel.This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling tingly fresh without the harsh, drying effects of other mouthwashes- many make me feel like I've swished with paint stripper.This mouthwash is the best one I've used, and the freshness lasts for hours. It quickly eliminates coffee breath, makes my mouth feel and smell like I've just chewed mint gum, and the inside of my mouth feels clean and comfortable.HM - Smile Clear Concentrated Alcohol Free Mouthwash, Advanced Dental Care-Smart Ingredients,for Bad Breath, whitening Teeth, Healthy Gums (Lime, Pack of 3 (3x2Fl Oz)",

                "reviewText": "I stumbled upon these HM Smile Clear mouthwash bottles while looking for an alcohol-free option, and I'm pleasantly surprised! It comes in a mixed pack. The spearmint is my favorite, fresh and minty, while the lime is a zingy twist, and the strawberry is sweet and fruity. They all leave my breath feeling clean and refreshed, without that burning alcohol sensation.The concentrated formula is cool too - a little goes a long way, so the bottles last ages. Plus, I love that they're eco-friendly and cruelty-free. Overall, a great find for anyone looking for a gentle, effective mouthwash with some fun flavors. Just be aware, the spearmint is definitely the strongest of the three.",

The neck of the bottle has little measurements on it to help you measure. It does not come with another container to put it in so you will need a little cup, or to mix the entire contents into a used mouthwash bottle or a jar. It may take a little math and trial and error to figure out the exact formula that you desire. The liquid has effective germ killing ingredients without alcohol. You can definitely taste it when mixed one part to 20, but you may want stronger flavor. Having to mix the product with water is a little bit inconvenient, however these little bottles will be perfect for traveling, and overall are more environmentally friendly then a large bottle. My husband and I both like the flavors.",

                "reviewText": "Since this mouthwash is a concentrate, it has a thicker consistency than any mouthwash I have ever used before, and has to be mixed with water before use. In some ways that is good because you can control the strength and intensity. It does mean you have to use a cup with this one since it doesn\u2019t come with one. Most mouthwashes have a cup shaped lid that can be used as a cup for rinsing. This brand however does NOT include a lid large enough to be used as a cup, which was the main reason I dropped a star. I don\u2019t normally use a cup, so I have to remember to keep one in the bathroom to use with this mouthwash.This does have a fabulously fresh taste though, it is different, and takes some getting used to. But it made my mouth feel amazingly clean after rinsing. It has a zingy, citrus zest mixed with rosemary kind of taste. I wasn\u2019t too sure at first, because the freshness doesn\u2019t fully hit for a few minutes after spitting it out. Once the freshness strikes though, it is really nice.Overall, I am happy with the quality of this mouthwash. You get a lot for your money; I just wish the lids could be used as a cup. They do include a bonus travel sized atomizer bottle though, for freshness on the go \ud83d\ude0a.",

The issue is for me that I felt less fresh as a result and I really missed my usual powerful minty freshness. They are a little bit harder to use than regular mouthwash to as you have to mix them with water as they're a concentrate and I don't want to spend the time measuring exact amounts twice a day so estimation is all I would be doing on a long term basis. The flavours aren't bad but they also aren't my favourite. I feel like for me it's best to stick with my regular but I can see the appeal for some. The bottles are also super small which is a great space saver in the bathroom!",

It's not difficult but for a lazy person like me it's still a bit of a faff.The taste is mild, even at the correct dilution it tastes watered down. I know it is watered down but it's noticeable, I think it could be stronger. The strawberry one tastes very much like my daughters children's mouthwash it's that mild.They do leave a fresh / clean feeling after using them though which is good. I've rated 5 stars because the only negative is really just a reflection of my laziness. It actually does what it says, cuts down on plastic waste and is a good option for travelling so I thought 5 stars was appropriate on that basis.",
