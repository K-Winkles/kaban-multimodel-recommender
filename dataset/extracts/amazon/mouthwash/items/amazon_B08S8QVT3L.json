                "reviewText": "I needed to find a mouthwash with no alcohol with a mild flavor because those really strong flavors and mouthwash are offensive to me this one checked all the boxes it is a very light flavor to it also it does more than just freshen your breath it has the following benefits as well as freshening breath including fights cavities restores minerals strengthens enamel cleans between teeth which helps with added flossing benefit so this is the natural with fluoride whole care anti-cavity mouthwash fresh mint 16 oz bottles I ordered it in a three pack and it was a very reasonable price cheaper even than they had at Walmart and I got my free Prime shipping so if this is what you're looking for highly recommend",
