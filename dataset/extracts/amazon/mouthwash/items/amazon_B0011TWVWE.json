                "reviewText": "I purchased this because I am pregnant and have been struggling with nausea/sensitivity to strong scents and my usual minty mouth products were overwhelming to use. I found this and an orange toothpaste and switched off the mint- it has helped! I don't have to psych myself up to battle for dental hygiene! There is no burn or unnatural sugary feeling while using this- its not a fight to keep it in your mouth long enough for it to work! The flavour is more like an orange Calippo or popsicle than it is to orange juice but it rinses clean without leaving any coating behind. I can immediately have food and drink without worrying how mint is going to make my yogurt taste horrible. My partner got curious and envious (because mint mouthwash + cereal & milk = gross) and tried this too- and loves it! Now we are switching longterm and this is our regular mouthwash.",

Initially it tasted like a flat orange soda and now it's sort of tastes a bit like puke lol, so I don't use this every day: I switch between a non-alcoholic Listerine that I have and this, but it has definitely helped diminish my teeth bleeding from using a water Flosser and being a smoker. Maybe next time I will try the peppermint flavour even though its more expensive than this orange one LOLI also don't find that it helps to keep your breath fresh, this really is like a carbonated orange soda that has gotten flat, but my main reason for getting this was for my bleeding gums which has definitely helped hence 4*",
