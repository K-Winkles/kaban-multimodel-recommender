                "reviewText": "This mouthwash has a very fresh and pleasant taste. I use it as an adult even if it\u2019s for children because it seems to have safer ingredients than the harsh alcohol-based mouthwashes that rid your mouth of even helpful good bacteria. My husband also switched from his harsh mouthwashes to this one. This is a hit in our house!",
