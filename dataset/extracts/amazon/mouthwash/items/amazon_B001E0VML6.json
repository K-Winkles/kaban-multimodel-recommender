Since we began using this mouthwash (a couple of years ago, now), we've noticed a marked decrease in the occurrence of canker sores, and any wounds or near-wounds we do incur heal much quicker than they used to before we began using this product. We're also longtime users of Eco Dent floss. Enthusiastically satisfied with these products-- thank you.",
