                "reviewText": "This rinse has really helped improve my overall dental health. My teeth are not as sensitive, my gum health has really improved, and for the first time, I didn't have a report of cavities. Probably because I could stand it longer. My dental health has always been less than average despite all I would do and had to have a lot of dental work done over the years. I've developed an extreme fear of the dentist sadly after some incidents, so that has also influenced my dental health.It took a long time, but I finally found a dentist and clinic that really works with me. They've rebuilt my confidence and trust little by little. Thanks to them, I have really begun to want to try and take even better care of my teeth. Finally did more extensive research after getting a little more comfortable with the subject. I came across the Bentist (his tips/advice are true because even my dentist confirmed them) and he influenced me to look into options that are better and maybe even more gentle. My gums are sensitive especially after getting oral surgery for wisdoms and deep cleaning. My dentist recommended to me a specific toothpaste and mouthwash that didn't have alcohol. So I used the non-alcoholic version of the brand I used and a few others but couldn't keep up because they tasted awful.This mouthwash came up in my searches and I read a few reviews. One said it helped their sensitivity quite a bit and another the whitening effect. I found it also had the right stuff, a bit more costly, but decided to get it. Taste isn't unbearable, it reminds me of a sugarless, flat, cream soda. It doesn't burn everything and if I do swallow some on accident, I'm not in any pain. Alcohol has never agreed with my stomach and the lingering effects of an accidental swallow of even just a couple drops of Listerine (or any with alcohol) made me ill.I can see the flavor being very bizarre for some, and honestly, it took me a day or so before I got completely used to it. Other than that, it does everything others stated and my gums are no longer inflamed. It is very soothing too and you really don't need a lot. I found around a teaspoon or so is all thats really needed. The foaming of it helps get into places I finished flossing and brushing for a more thorough clean.All in all, I would recommend this, especially for sensitivity or if you have braces. I recall having sore areas when wearing braces that made using some mouthwashes uncomfortable.",
