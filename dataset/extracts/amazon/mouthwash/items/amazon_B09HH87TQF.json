Taste is about right & not too much mint. I use this 2 times a week and do soak the string floss in this rinse, btw. The front/back labels peel off very easily if you do recycling. I have not had a cavity in the last (wait for it) 50 years, so fluoride rinse probably is helpful. If you have cavity issues i want to encourage you to see a dentist and to not be afraid of making that decision and finally you should follow thru with that big decision.",
