                "reviewText": "Product came banged up and leaking. I bought the mint and also the bubblegum for my son. Was not aware it contained polysorbate 80. Not happy about this. It's got a very weird consistency. It's got a thickness I find unpleasant. A bit like slime. Expensive and every time I used it, whether I use the cap or administer straight from the bottle, when you put the cap back on, the neon yellow mouthwash drips down the white metal container and is just a mess. I also don't like metal container because even though may people think it is healthy/safe, it is not. The metal typically leeches into the product. I am not saying it does with this one, however toxic heavy metals are the worst toxins out there. I wasn't aware the bottle was metal when I purchased it and I don't believe they tell you in the description. At $20 a bottle, and having gotten 2, I am not pleased. My son doesn't like the bubblegum, either, saying it's not pink, but also doesn't like the taste. Also, the reason I got them to begin with was to avoid unnatural preservatives. Only to find out once we get them they contain polysorbate 80. I may not have read the list of ingreds carefully enough (all other ingreds are natural) but omg what a freaking ripoff, for a gross, messy, metal-contained, bottle of mouthwash that, quite frankly, visually resembles toxic waste.",

                "reviewText": "I like bubblegum flavor but I'm not a huge fan of it, but this is very good. It's got just enough flavor to taste good without being sickenly sweet or strong tasting. It's just pleasant. There's a little bit that's weird about this. The bottle is metal and feels weird for mouthwash, and the mouthwash itself is a yucky color of yellow and thicker than I would have ever expected a mouthwash to be. How much prefer to just get a swig then to ever look at it. If I just get a swig and don't look at it I have a very pleasant experience overall and like it. If I look at it first well, it looks on appetizing and that's a little bit of a downer though it's still good once I get in my mouth and start using it. It does a great job of freshening breath. It's got a little bit of a burn but it's not a strong burn like alcohol. The rest of my family is also using this mouthwash and we all agree that we like it but we don't like to look at it- maybe we're just all used to pink mouthwashes because our normal brand that we have used for years is pink.",

                "reviewText": "The Cinnamint flavor is delicious! Cinnamony but not hot cinnamon with a touch of mint.The packaging is unique! It comes in a metal-like bottle. I am unsure of what the bottle is made of, but it has that on the go drink container vibe. Unscrew the cap and you will notice the mouthwash is a yellow color. Don't fear! It's supposed to be. It's also thicker than standard mouthwashes. That's also good because it gives a pleasant mouth feel.You don't need a lot of this mouthwash to get results. Try a little at first and increase as needed. The thickness goes a long way when you swish around your mouth. You will immediately feel like your teeth are smoother and cleaner. There is no burn, at least there wasn't for me.The refreshment lasted about two hours. I find myself wanting to rinse my mouth a few times a day with this product, as it has such a nice taste and feel. I did not expect that from mouthwash and am really pleased. I did not notice my teeth looking whiter but I've only used it a few days. My teeth for sure feel smooth and clean after using.",
