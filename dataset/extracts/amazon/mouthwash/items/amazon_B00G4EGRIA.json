                "reviewText": "Not sure why I went for the full 6 pack, but I'm glad I did. The zero alcohol makes it so much easier to swish without burning your face off. We've got enough to last us at least a year. And plenty to share if anybody stops by and needs a swish. We're about to have the healthiest teeth and gums in the community.",
