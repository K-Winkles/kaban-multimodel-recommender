                "reviewText": "My sister told me I should buy this mouthwash after I told her I had thrush on my tongue. When I tried this for the first time, I actually like the taste, compared to Listerene Scope etc mouthwash that has alcohol in it. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s had some minor role in me getting thrush which is an overgrowth of yeast. I wasn\u2019t keen on the price however my tongue went from WHITE to Roses PINK after using this mouthwash after 3 or 4 weeks. It really freshens your breath. I will be purchasing another bottle of this. I believe I found my lifetime mouthwash. This isn\u2019t a miracle mouthwash, however I believe in using natural products from nature (There is a reason why God made these things, plants, oils, herbs, spice, etc) I believe God-made products are the best compared to most man-made products period! I don\u2019t believe you will be disappointed with this mouthwash except spending the higher dollar amount compared to over the counter products. But even some OTC products are ridiculously over priced. For my budget as a single mom this was a little higher than I would had liked to pay but considering the results, it seems it was an excellent purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I was sceptical when I first purchased this years ago. It's pricey, it tastes a bit funny and sweet, and I wasn't sure there was enough active ingredient in it to live up to its claims. But I've been swearing by this stuff for years now.A few months after I first started using it, I went in for a dental cleaning and the hygienist wanted to know what I was using--and the dentist asked me the same thing. I was convinced it'd caused damage somehow (you don't want to hear \"...seriously, what have you been using on your teeth?\" when they're poking around with steel hooks) but instead they were both shocked by how great my gums looked, how much less tartar I had, and how the few shallow gum pockets I'd had were completely healed. I have a family history of gum disease, so hearing this was absolutely amazing news. Both the dentist and hygienist asked me to write down the name of this mouthwash for them so they could recommend it to their patients. Granted, maybe it's just me, or maybe I was doing something different that was an external factor (change in diet, etc) but my dentist was based in a major teaching hospital and in charge of the department. She wasn't prone to acknowledging alternative products, so that all came as a pleasant surprise.The neem in this is the winner and if you've ever smelled neem on its own, you'll be pleased to know you can't smell it in this mouthwash. It's a little bit sweet and you want to swish it around as long as possible (2-3min minimum if you can; the longer, the better) for maximum effect. I usually use Sarakan in the morning (gentler flavour, but not as effective) and this after I've brushed my teeth at night and before I hop in the shower so that I can swish as long as I'm in there. I've tried the cinnamon flavour, as well, but the mint has a nicer aftertaste.We went a few months without it and I could feel my tartar buildup starting again, and my partner started complaining of bleeding gums while flossing. (She's the one who prefers Sarakan.) We added this back in and within a week, we're back to normal.Aside: I should add that a major improvement in gum health and tartar buildup was noticeable when we switched first to a paleo diet, and then transitioned from there to a ketogenic paleo diet (LCHF), as both reduce sugar (which is a prime source of food for tartar-causing bacteria) and encourage fermented foods. We use this mouthwash in conjunction with Dr Tung's floss (fantastic stuff) and Urtekram toothpaste (tea tree is nice, same with green tea and licorice).",

Bc its all natural might not appeal to all, but get rid of horrible ingredients , including many mouth rinses/washes with alcohol . etc If never tried recommend for people to try. It's also said to prevent gum disease. Personally I have never encountered a person from India with bad teeth ! Making a little light of it ...but think about it, its true ! Might seem pricey to some but it goes a long way. Started 1 daughter off with the same brand toothpaste. VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AMAZON , TAKING MY ISSUES SERIOUSLY...DELIVERY PEOPLE RING MY APARTMENT DOOR & ITEMS ARE BEING PROPERLY BUBBLE WRAPPED ! HUGE SINCERE THANK YOU !
