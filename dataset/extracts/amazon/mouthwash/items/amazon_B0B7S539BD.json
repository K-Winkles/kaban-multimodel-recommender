                "reviewText": "I recently tried the GuruNanda Oil Pulling mouthwash, and I must say it has become a staple in my oral care routine. The 8 Fl.Oz bottle comes with a delightful combination of Coconut and Peppermint Oil, providing a natural and refreshing experience.One of the standout features is the inclusion of a tongue scraper inside the box. This thoughtful addition enhances the overall oral care routine, ensuring a comprehensive cleaning process. The tongue scraper is easy to use and adds an extra layer of cleanliness to promote overall oral health.The formula is alcohol-free, which is a big plus for me. Traditional mouthwashes with alcohol can often be harsh and drying, but GuruNanda has managed to create an effective solution without compromising on comfort. The oil pulling method is known for its ability to help with fresh breath, teeth whitening, and promoting healthier teeth and gums.The coconut and peppermint oil blend not only leaves my mouth feeling clean but also imparts a pleasant taste that lingers for a while. It's a refreshing change from the strong and artificial flavors found in some other mouthwashes.I've noticed a positive impact on my oral health since incorporating GuruNanda Oil Pulling into my routine. My breath feels fresher for longer, and I've observed a subtle improvement in teeth whiteness. Additionally, my gums seem healthier, which is a great sign of the product's effectiveness.Overall, GuruNanda Oil Pulling is a fantastic addition to anyone's oral care routine. It's natural, alcohol-free, and comes with the added bonus of a tongue scraper for a more thorough clean. If you're looking for a mouthwash that promotes fresh breath, teeth whitening, and healthier teeth and gums, give GuruNanda Oil Pulling a try \u2013 you won't be disappointed!",

I find that even after a few days of oil pulling that my teeth and gums are much less sensitive. It may take awhile to work up to swishing for the recommended 10 mins, but even starting at 2-5 mins will give you results. Do yourself a favor and switch to using this brand!",

I use about 1/4 of the cap; 2x a day, once in am in shower and at night after flossing. Taste is really good, no coconut taste at all, just right amount of peppermint. I recommended this to my husband, who hasn\u2019t gone to the dentist in the 5 years I\u2019ve been with him, so that will be the true review.",

It gets better once you start swishing (swish for 5 to 10 minutes). I did 10 minutes (you could do it). Remember to spit it out in a trash can because the oil could clog your pipes over time. My mouth, teeth, tongue, breath feel clean & amazing. I'm so glad I open a subscription to continue getting this product. Dose: 1 Tablespoon = 15 ml (use measuring cup, along with the tongue \ud83d\udc45scrapper, soft toothbrush\ud83e\udea5, & dental floss--all included). This the beginning of a healthier mouth.

Tongue scraper great (dont gag urself) but the extra little flossers were terrible, broke every single time, first attempt.

                "reviewText": "Saw someone on tiktok recommend this brand to use to oil pull along with waterfloss.I've used coconut oil before to oil pull, but decided to try a mint flavor to see if that helped with taste.I was expecting a mild mint. It generally is, unless you accidentally swallow it, then it is extremely minty and intense. I do NOT recommend trying to gargle with it, it will make you gag and want to throw up instantly.Which is kind of frustrating because I can't push the oil too far to my back teeth or else it will hit the back of my throat and make me gag. I like being able to gargle it as well to get the anti bacterial properties all throughout my mouth/tongue.I'm definitely going to keep using it cause it feels like it's helping. But maybe using flavourless next time. If you can handle strong peppermint then this might be great for you.Everything else about this is nice and the extra tongue scraper is great. It also comes with a little measuring cup of you want a precise amount. I don't like cleaning it out so I just squirt it directly into my mouth lol",
