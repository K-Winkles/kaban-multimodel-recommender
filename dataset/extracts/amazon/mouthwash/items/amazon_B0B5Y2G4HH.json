                "reviewText": "Listerine Zero Alcohol Mouthwash has been a staple in my oral care routine for many years, and the Cool Mint Flavor has become a new favorite. This alcohol-free oral rinse not only delivers the trusted germ-killing power of Listerine but also offers a refreshing and less intense taste for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.The primary goal of any mouthwash is to keep breath fresh, and Listerine Zero Alcohol excels in this department. The Cool Mint Flavor provides a burst of freshness that lingers, ensuring that bad breath is kept at bay throughout the day. The effectiveness in maintaining oral hygiene is commendable, and I appreciate the confidence it instills in my daily interactions.The decision to go alcohol-free is a game-changer.

The flavor is invigorating without being overpowering, striking the perfect balance for a refreshing oral rinse. It's a welcome change that adds variety to my oral care routine.Introducing my daughter to Listerine Zero Alcohol was a wise decision. The Cool Mint variant, with its appealing taste and germ-killing benefits, became an instant favorite for her as well. It's a testament to the broad appeal and versatility of this mouthwash.In conclusion, Listerine Zero Alcohol Mouthwash in Cool Mint Flavor is an excellent product that combines freshness, effectiveness, and a delightful taste.

Then I noticed it only claim to kill germs that cause bad mouth smell. It doesn't say it will be helpful for tooth like killing plaque causing germs. I happen to have a alcohol containing mouthwash to compare. The alcohol version clearly says it will kill germs that causes plaques. so probably next time i will still stick to the alcohol version since i want that effect as well.",
