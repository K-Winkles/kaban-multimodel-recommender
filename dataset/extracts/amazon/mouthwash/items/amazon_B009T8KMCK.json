                "reviewText": "I love Oxyfresh products. The lemon toothpaste is my go-to. It\u2019s been tough for me to get to the dentist this year so I\u2019ve been doubling down on home care: Waterpik, Sonicare, and adding fluoride to the mix. The Oxyfresh Cavity Protection mouthwash is so much better than normal commercial mouthwashes. I have dry mouth so an alcohol formula is out, but I\u2019m allergic to ~something~ in the non-alcohol formulas I\u2019ve tried. Even Biotene gets a little weird. The flavor of this Oxyfresh formula is nice\u2014a very mild mint formula, not too viscous, not drying, doesn\u2019t take a lot. Sometimes I add it to the Waterpik reservoir. It\u2019s tricky to not drink for a half hour after use\u2014see dry mouth, remembering to take meds, etc\u2014so I use it once a day at most. I can\u2019t attest to it changing anything major (I\u2019ve made it to my early 30s with no cavities) but if you\u2019re looking for a fluoride rinse that\u2019s better than the usual suspects, it has the same active ingredient in a much better formula.I also like the lemon non-fluoride version too!",
