                "reviewText": "Portability is something I value. Mouthwash tablets are such a great idea! You can keep them in your car, in your purse, with your camping supplies, in your pocket, anywhere you may need to freshen your breath, but carrying a bottle around isn't practical. Put a few tablets in a small container and you're ready. Just make sure you have the ability to spit it out!The best scenario that came to mind would be going out to eat on a first date. Italian. Garlic. Cheese. Garlic! You would like to freshen up, but you don't have any mints or gum. You dig in your purse and you find your mouthwash tablets! The day is saved. The only thing you have to do is to convince your date to use one.When I tried out my first tablet, I hadn't brushed. I only used one tab and did not use water. The tablet is soft and there are mini minty crunches that give the burst of peppermint. When you chew it, saliva does increase a little bit. It may seem odd at first, but I was able to swish it around my teeth well. The downside of using it without water is that you cannot gargle or get the back half of your tongue covered. Since I didn't brush beforehand, my tongue still felt left out of the peppermint party. The minty freshness doesn't last as long as regular mouthwash I noticed. In a camping scenario with little to no drinking water, this is so much better than nothing.I think using two tablets would work out better, but I like to follow recommend guidelines. Still, I would like to know if it would be safe. I would also like to know if this would be safe if swallowed. Is it safe for nature if you spit it out on the ground? These things are not mentioned on the jar.Consider if these fit into your lifestyle. I think everyone could use a backup besides mints and candy. Kudos to the jar for being eco-conscious.",

Great product for making the switch from toothpaste and mouthwash. I don't like buying products that are only free product for a good review. Which is why i took a star away. Normally I stear clear of buying from Sellars who do that, it's so unfair. And no way to know if they are actually truthful. I bought the vanilla mint toothpaste tablets, which got actual reviews, and really like it. So yes I thought this would be a good after rinse, not disappointed at all with the product, just the free product for a review is disappointing.",

It did not appear to be used but it's hard to say, I feel like hygiene items should always come with a seal. I was reluctant to use it and it actually took me some time but one day I was in a pinch and this was all I had. I chewed the tablet and to my surprise it dissolved well and quickly. It left my mouth feeling fresh and minty. I know keep these in my office for quick emergencies. I simply spit out the excess after it dissolves. I am pleasantly surprised at how well they work. I would like them to work on a safer seal but other than that the product is great.",

                "reviewText": "These mouthwash tablets taste good, are easily chewed up, and do make your mouth and breath feel fresh. They are an innovative product. It's a great idea to be able to bring a few with you to work or on a trip and not have to worry about an unwieldy bottle full of liquid spilling.I've used one with just saliva and one with a little added water--not much difference there. They really do make your mouth feel fresh and refreshed.I have only one objection to them. There is no mention of whether you can swallow the pill or not. I wouldn't swallow it, but there is no warning that you shouldn't. If it isn't safe to swallow, it would be good to know that in the directions; if it is safe to swallow, it would be good to know that too.In any case, as they are, I wouldn't swallow them after chewing, so, even though they are convenient, you do have to plan on having a place and a way to spit. I think it would be super convenient if you could swallow them after chewing, but I wouldn't consider it safe with all the chemicals in them.I'm glad I got them, and they are quick and easy to use. I'll definitely bring them along in my purse or travel bag to freshen up. They are much more effective than candy-like breath fresheners and are advertised as having some teeth protecting qualities (unlike candy breath fresheners). All in all, this is a good product.",
