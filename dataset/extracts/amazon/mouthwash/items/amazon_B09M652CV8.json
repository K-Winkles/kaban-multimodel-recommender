I just use the mouthwash, and spit it right out. So convenient. And my mouth continues to taste fresh and good for 10-30 minutes after use, after a while the taste fades a little bit naturally.",

Absolute loss of sensitivity, even after the very first time I used the paste.I wasn't a huge fan of using mouthwash, as it feels weird to me to use a good toothpaste, then rinse the effects of it away.

We\u2019ve only been using it for a few days but it leaves teeth feeling clean and fresh, so far we like it!",
