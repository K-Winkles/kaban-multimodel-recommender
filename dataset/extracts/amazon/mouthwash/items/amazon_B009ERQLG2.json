                "reviewText": "Bought this because I've been experiencing toothache in different teeth for about a week. Worse whenever I chowed on whichever tooth was hurting.I'm currently at home recovering from a fractured hip, meaning I can't get to a dentist.Quick search on line suggested a possible gum infection as more than one tooth was hurting.I ordered the sensitive version just to be on the safe side.Product arrived quickly and undamaged.I've used it twice a day over the last 6 days and an happy to say I've been pain free for about 2 days now!One thing I should mention is the taste is rather strong! Not unpleasant but quite sharp.I will continue using it for another week or so but so far, so very good!!",
