                "reviewText": "How I found item: I noticed TikTok advertisements floating around regarding this product. These advertisements led me to Amazon and this is where I purchased from.First Impression(s): Swishing for 10 minutes almost made me gag, but the blend of essential oils made it easier in my opinion. I should add that this solution does not foam up or increase in volume as you swish.How I use: I floss first, swish with water, swish this formula, spit, scrape tongue and brush with residual oil left over on teeth.Why I got this product: My teeth were stained from coffee and teas and I really wanted to get off of fluoride altogether. Fun fact: FLUORIDE MAKES YOUR TEETH YELLOW! Don't believe me? Research it. Fluoride does a lot of other things far more harmful for your body than I care to go into but I will add this: Fluoride is a byproduct of a type of fertilizer manufactured in Florida. So anyway, if you are like me, you want to be healthier and this is one approach to healthier gums and teeth.What comes in the box: Swish, Cup, Floss Pics, Tongue Scraper and MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TOOTH BRUSH 'Butter For Gums' (softest brush of all time).Effectiveness: See attached pic from only 3 weeks. My wife asked me to smile for her last night and couldn't believe how much whiter my teeth appeared. She's going to order some as well.Value: I am marking this as high as it is all natural, includes extras and ACTUALLY WORKS as advertised.Rating: I would rate this product at a 10 and would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their smile and overall oral health. 10/10 for me!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this product to do Oil Pulling as that is what it\u2019s meant for. I\u2019ve been doing oil pulling for a few years now and like the results I get with cold pressed organic coconut oil! I\u2019ve seen Guru Nanda pulling oil on social media sites. People claimed amazing results! Supposedly the ingredients are suppose to be sustainable and harvested in the best places around the world. I thought this oil would be the best as far as organic and most pure in ingredients! Upon opening the box & researching the Guru Nanda web site, it is not organic or cold pressed it is Fractionated so it can be marketed with out the oil solidifying! Not for health benefits! It\u2019s processed and is not organic! It comes in a cheap plastic bottle, not glass! Oil leaches the chemicals from plastic bottles! I thought the plastic bottle would be BPA free at least! No where on the box, bottle or website does it say BPA free! I haven\u2019t seen a health product on the market in the last couple years using oral products in plastic that\u2019s not at least PBA Free! The ingredient stevia is just to make the product sweet, it has no health benefits what so ever, when I put the oil in my mouth it was way to sweet I had to get it out of my mouth quickly! It would be best just to use regular cold pressed organic coconut oil for pulling, use some organic herbs if you desire!",

                "reviewText": "I like how clean it makes my mouth feel! I did notice some whitening of my teeth using it alone, but when I combined it with Hello Brand Charcoal w/Coconut oil Toothpaste and MySmile Whitening Strips, the whitening process really amped up. Using each one alone didn't really do as much as I expected.I also use a Waterpik and an electric toothbrush. Mainly because of the charcoal toothpaste. It's so messy.I love the ultra-soft fat head toothbrush though, and tongue scraper that came with it. I use this toothbrush in between regular brushings. It's soooo soft!!! I will admit that Amazon had to send a 2nd shipment because the scraper was missing from the 1st shipment, but I still give it 5 stars because of the quick response and even quicker replacement shipment.I don't know about the other health benefits that oil pulling profess since I'mnew to it, but if it keeps me healthy and causes shorter visits with the dentist, I'll continue doing it. I'm all for a healthier liver and toxin free body!!",

                "reviewText": "I've done lots of oil pulling with pure coconut oil, but in the Winter it's kind of gross to dissolve the solid oil in my mouth, which is why I came looking for a liquid alternative, and I stumbled upon this product.First of all, I've used it for three days only and have already noticed whitening (my teeth are pretty white already, but they've gotten even better). I'm all about using natural ingredients, avoiding hyper-processed products and all that, so that part is great! I'm absolutely sure this is a much healthier option than regular toothpaste.Now, this thing tastes absolutely disgusting to me. MUCH WORSE than pure coconut oil. It makes me gag as soon as I put it in my mouth (and swishing it for several minutes takes serious effort). Every time I open my trash can I'm reminded of it, which is a challenge on its own.This product is thicker than coconut oil, it does not feel \"fresh\", and I would never let that taste remain in my mouth, so I must brush my teeth with regular toothpaste afterwards (which kind of defeats the purpose).Unfortunately I bought the biggest size (I honestly thought it would be a great upgrade from pure coconut oil), so now I have to put up with it (because I'm not about to waste my money), but I don't think I'll ever repurchase.I'll either just go back to virgin, unrefined, cold-pressed coconut oil (SO MUCH CHEAPER AS WELL!) or create my own concoction using some essential oils (Dr. Axe has a nice recipe for mouthwash that can definitely be adapted for this).",

                "reviewText": "It's only been less than two weeks and I've noticed some sensitivity is already gone. I read some people get nauseous/gag reflex from having oil in the mouth, and I did the first time I tried it. I was used to regular mouthwash taste and consistency. But figured out if you exhale before (so you don't smell it - it doesn't smell bad at all, just helps), and tilt forward so you keep it in the front of your mouth when you start to swish, that takes care of that issue. Also, have to work up to 2 minutes, then 4, etc. to strengthen your facial muscles. (and if you just stand in front of the sink that whole time, time drags. Helps to find something to do during that time)",

                "reviewText": "Suffering with toothache mainly and got recommended this along with a natural toothpaste called Biomed.Never heard of oil pulling before and it\u2019s a bit weird at first. The taste is fine, like a minty mouthwash, a bit thicker but pleasant. Been using for over a week now and the difference is really noticeable. Used before brushing with the Biomed toothpaste, try to swill around for 10 mins before rinsing then brushing. Mouth feels really fresh. Breath is fresher longer. Smooth teeth and toothache has gone now. Could be a coincidence though. Will be using this going forwards as it definitely works for me.",

It also tastes like minty coconut and not just raw coconut, which I hate. My gums and teeth feel so much healthier. And the toothbrush that came free was the softest brush ever which was great for my sensitive teeth! Definitely recommend! :D",

However, I was informed about this procedure from my dentist (a very well respected Harley Street Dr) and told to go on Amazon and look it up. Many to choose from but this one stood out as it was the whole package - mouth wash, tongue scraper and tooth brush. Surprisingly non sweet as I was expecting. Using in conjunction with Dr. Wolff's Bioniq Repair Plus Toothpaste. Teeth and gums certainly feel clean. Cant comment on whitening as I haven't used it long enough. Seemed good value for money.",
