                "reviewText": "When you have some stank breath you better get some of this. I drink a lot of espresso and I found out doing some research that unless you really wash your mouth and tongue out good after drinking something like coffee it causes some kind of chemical reaction which causes your breath to absolutely stink. Hence the term, coffee breath.This stuff takes care of that. It's amazing but it truly takes away bad breath whether it's from coffee to garlic.Why you should:this stuff has a great guarantee, if it doesn't work for you you can get your money back. Everybody is different so different things will work for different people but I highly recommend this product because it has worked for me. Lifesaver right here!Why you shouldn't:one thing you have to know about this product is that it will not freshen your breath like something like scope will. It will not freshen your breath like gum. It will not keep your breath feeling fresh all day. Is it still working and doing its job throughout the day? Yes, it is! But it will not give you any indication that it actually is working. About 5 minutes or less after using a product your mouth will not feel fresh and clean anymore, at least in my experience. But you can safely know that even though you don't feel fresh that you are.something else that I found to be very difficult about this product is that if you want to travel with it you have to buy the special travel pouches, not these bottles. these bottles contain two different liquids inside of them that need to mix in order to create the magnificent formula that freshens your breath. Unfortunately though, the way that the bottle is designed is not designed to be travel friendly. It will leak on you if you travel with this product.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is, frankly, amazing. I've had a chronic bitter taste in my mouth ever since I had sinus surgery almost two years ago. I figured the natural flora that lives in my head (sinuses, mouth, throat) just needed time to adjust to the changes and that everything would eventually be fine, but the bitter taste got worse and worse and worse. Sometimes it's so bad that I'm nauseated from it, and I often can't taste food properly. I've tried tongue scrapers, various toothpastes, other mouthwashes, homemade toothpaste that are supposed to kill bacteria. I even started taking chlorophyll tablets and absolutely nothing worked and the bitterness got even worse. So I figured the $40 spent on these was at least worth the gamble. And. Holy crap. I used one of them once. ONCE. And the taste was almost gone. I skipped one day since buying these because I had no bitterness and so I forgot, and the next morning the taste was back a little bit, and as soon as I used one of the three that day it was gone again, and it hasn't come back. I use the Clinical in the morning, the Dry Mouth if I need it during the day, and the Original before bed. The packages all say they can be used three times per day, so I figure one of each is a great way to use them. I'm so sorry I didn't know about this stuff two years ago, but thank goodness I finally found it now. No more nausea. No more being afraid to kiss or have a conversation close to another person. Food tastes like food again. What an incredible difference. Seriously.",
