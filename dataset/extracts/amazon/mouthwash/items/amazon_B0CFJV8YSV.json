                "reviewText": "I don't use mouthwash because of the reports that have come out about how alcohol-based mouthwashes are really bad for your oral health. I was, however, intrigued when I saw that these don't contain alcohol or anything harmful.In this box you get 20 packets of mouthwash and 20 floss sticks. The mouthwash packets, you just tear off the top of and pour them in your mouth. There is plenty of mouthwash for a good swish around but not too much where it overflows and drips down the sides of your face. The flavor is very minty and pleasant due to mint extract. The floss sticks have less surface space than the floss sticks I use at home, but it makes sense because these are designed to use when you're out and would be perfect to handle that piece of food caught in your teeth. And if the floss doesn't get it, the sticks have a pick on the end which will no doubt do the trick.The main thing I love about these is that you can toss them in your pocket or purse (the picks are indiviually wrapped) which makes it really easy to have on hand should you find yourself out somewhere with food in your teeth or a need for instant fresh breath.Great product and so appreciate that the mouthwash is more natural.The ingredients: Purified water, sorbitol, glycerin, hydrogenated castor oil, biological Lysozyme, honeysuckle extract, bletilla extract, mint extract, jasmine extract, essence, Xylitol, menthol, Potassium sorbate, Cetylpyridinium chloride, citic acid",

The included dental is a bit on the smallish side and doesn't feel super sturdy but does the job in a pinch.Made from mint extract without alcohol or sugar but does contain xylitol which I am not too pleased about. The mint flavor is pleasant and does a good job of freshening my breath.It is nice to have this ready in the car for when you are eating out and want to clean/freshen up your breath right after your meal.",
