                "reviewText": "I have a super sensitive mouth and have never been able to use any mouthwashes or many toothpastes because they burn like fire and ice in my mouth and even make the skin peel. This is amazing light minty fresh without the bite and burn. I knew there had to be something between bubblegum taste and the bite of all other mouthwashes out there. It's great to finally have clean fresh breath without smelling like a piece of bubblegum",
