It has been recommended that children between ages 6 and 12 need to supervised when they use a mouthwash. Many companies use child-resistant caps to help you out. Be sure they spit it out. Children younger than 6 years may have trouble controlling the swallowing reflex, so mouthwash is not recommended for young children. Don't let family members distract you when you're performing your oral care routine; distraction might make you forget to spit and you may swallow the mouthwash by mistake. Go into the bathroom and shut the door. Swallowing small amounts of mouthwash may leave you feeling a bit queasy or may even cause diarrhea, but these symptoms should pass. However, if your child or someone you know overdoses on mouthwash by drinking and swallowing a large amount, take these steps: Check The Label. Check to see which of these potentially poisonous products the mouthwash contains: fluoride or ethanol. Severe symptoms of a mouthwash overdose related to these ingredients may include dizziness, drowsiness, trouble breathing, or, in serious cases, convulsions or a coma. In severe cases, head for the emergency room, and bring the mouthwash bottle with you if possible.",

I use this just in the morning. If you use it morning and night, you will see quicker results, which I have done before. Now I just use it in the morning, and it works well that way for me. I find it easier, cheaper, and better than using mouth strips and gels. It is so easy to just use this than to mess with anything else, and I have done it all. Better compliance in that way.I drink coffee daily, so I need something to keep stains at bay. Also, sometimes I use a periodontal mouth wash that over time adds gray/blackish color. It is weird, but it is totally manageable by using that at night, then follow up with this in the morning. My teeth stay a healthy looking white.It isn't meant for killing germs- so keep that in mind, but it will freshen breath. As mentioned, I use this in the morning before brushing my teeth. Usually I follow up with a germ killing mouth wash before heading out for the day. At night, I brush my teeth and use a germ killing mouth wash, etc.I like it and will continue to use it.",
