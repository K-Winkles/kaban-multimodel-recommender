I bought this because it said \"Peppermint\" and I thought that'd be a nice try from all the typical mint flavors you see. But I didn't know it was straight up gonna taste just like their toothpaste. lolThe flavor kinda gets old after a while, because it just tastes like you liquified a peppermint candy cane and put some drops of it in the mouthwash. lol But it only burns a tiny bit when you're swishing it around. After use, I do feel like my mouth is refreshed and cleaner. However, I can't help but feel like it just isn't doing a good enough job. You can tell it has lasting effects to help ward off funk on your teeth, but it's just a bit lackluster. I'm still going to finish it all, and it works just fine. Definitely a good value for price.",

                "reviewText": "I have used this Colgate Total mouthwash 12 hour protection for a few months now. What I love most about it is how it cleans out the gunk between my teeth that the toothbrush cannot. It seems to have a slippery element to it that surrounds gunk between teeth and flushes it out. Regular mouthwash doesn\u2019t do that, at least not for me. I have a very difficult time flossing as my molars are so tightly packed, so this mouthwash makes a HUGE difference! It\u2019s shocking how much gunk is still left between teeth after brushing alone. This mouthwash really works well! No, I was not paid for this review, I just LOVE this stuff. The flavor is a cool minty fresh, and doesn\u2019t burn my mouth like those with alcohol in them. The price is great as well!",
