            "Safe and Easy To Use - This mouth rinse is safe for all ages and easy to use and administer. Early and regular use will aid in protecting against dry mouth and uncomfortable oral complications, and help in the healing process of current mouth sores and ulcers. We recommend rinsing 3-5 times a day when undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments. Adults and children ages 2 and older should gargle or swish around in the mouth for one minute, then spit out.",

We provide a line of oral rinses and mouthwashes that are free of harsh chemicals and ingredients, always naturally flavored, and dye- and alcohol-free. We also offer fluoride free options!

He said the wash has enabled him to eat and is very soothing to his throat and has helped him avoid a feeding tube. His diet is very bland but being able to swallow food is a great thing. I have ordered more. Great product !",
