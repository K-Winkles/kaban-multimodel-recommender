                "reviewText": "I use ACT as a part of a protocol developed by Dr. Elle Phillips.1) First I rinse with Closys to alkalize my mouth2) Then I brush with Crest (original formula) (ADA approved).3) Then I rinse with Listerine (the original formula - again, you want the one that's ADA approved). It kills the strain of bacteria which causes tooth decay.4) After a one-minute rinse with Listerine, I do a one-minute rinse with ACT. (The Listerine dries out the mouth; the ACT solves this problem)Then I wait a half hour before eating or drinking anything.Does it work? For me it does. I haven't had any cavities since starting this protocol. Two small cavities that I did have, healed up.One funny thing is that my dentist always comments on how great it is that I'm flossing; but I'm actually not. The regimen I've described removes plaque from your teeth more effectively than flossing.",
