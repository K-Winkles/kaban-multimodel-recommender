It is even too high for the large size bottle. I just bought a large bottle from my local grocery store and it was half the price of this tiny bottle! How many folks know how large or small a \"40 mm\" is? The listing should emphasize that this is a small, like travel size, bottle! The product itself is perfectly fine but the description is quite lacking.",
