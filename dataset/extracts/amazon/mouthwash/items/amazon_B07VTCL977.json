I only use it at night just before going to bed, and I can make it for about 4 hours. I re-rinse and I\u2019m good til I get up. The rest of the products come in handy: the drops in the car, the gel and spray for odd times. I have them positioned around the house and cars so I can grab one when needed. I like the package I bought because I could try the different ones without having to buy a larger size in case there was something I either didn\u2019t like or it didn\u2019t work for me.",
