I bought this in July, use it every day and still have not ran out (it's mid January)! Best part of it is that when I went to my most recent dental appointment my hygienist said, \"What have you been doing differently since your last check-up\" Worried, I replied, \"Nothing really. Why?\" She said, \"Your gums have noticably improved from your previous check-up.\" Relieved, I told her the only thing that changed was I switched to this essential oils mouthwash. She said, \"Whatever you're doing, keep it up!\" Strongly recommend this to everyone looking to improve their oral health!",

My teeth feel softer and my mouth hydrated a lot more than with Listerine, Crest, TheraBreath or even Biot\u00e8ne. This mouthwash will definitely replace commercial and chemical ones.
