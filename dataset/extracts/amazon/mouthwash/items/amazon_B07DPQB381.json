Now I refuse to buy ACT from Amazon because they increased the price by 75% in a day. My package was delivered, torn open. That's why their picture of proof of delivery is staged to show the ripped side down. I receive my packages as soon as they're dropped off. The USPS didn't deliver it, neither did UPS or FedEx. Amazon delivered it. The other item I ordered was in there but the package was torn into & my mouthwash was stolen. I didn't receive it & there's no way for me to get my money back. It was within Amazon's chain of custody until they dropped it off at my door, I retrieve my packages immediately because I'm home all day so I see when they deliver. So nobody had time to steal it, nobody is on my security cameras stealing the item. Now they've jacked the cost of this mouthwash up by 75%.",

This has been true for several years, but good, old Amazon has it right here, and at a good price. We'll be regular customers now that we know this!",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this mouthwash! I'm allergic to mint and this is totally mint-free! No mint derivatives like menthol, etc. either. It also has xylitol, which is great for dry mouth. It isn't as helpful as other dry mouth products I've used in the past, but it way cheaper and easier to find. I really like how easy it is to measure, too. Only thing is that it doesn't come with any kind of cup to pour it into. I'm using the cup from my old mouthwash right now. I'm not sure if they expect you to drink right from the lip of the bottle? The cap is certainly too small.The amount of xylitol in this is not enough to make a meaningful impact on my dry mouth, but because mine is so severe, I figure some is better than none. If I can't find anything better in the future, I will buy this again. It goes great with my cinnamon flavored Tom's of Maine toothpaste (with fluoride).",
