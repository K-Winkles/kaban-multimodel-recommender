Buy the Behemoth bottle at Sam's/Costco, because they don't sell this 8.5oz size of bottle that can't be carried in your suitcase. My wife threw away my last small bottle and I had a \"tissy\" Dam't Darlin leave my crap alone. So I went back to Amazon and Wha la, they're still selling that \"Right Size\" Bottle, thank you amazon ! TSA requirement are a pain in the ass ! I wonder who gets to keep all that stuff that they seize, Wherever or whoever. I bet the security folks will never have to purchase Mouthwash or Tooth Paste for a life time, wana bet me ?",
