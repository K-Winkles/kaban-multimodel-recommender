I wish it would be improved. As well as the bottle. The design is terrible. It makes a mess every time. At first it was t fully punctured so it was even messier. It would be better if it was just two separate bottles that you combine. Would be cleaner. I have to rinse the bottle cap every time I use it and wash my hands because it\u2019s everywhere. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll purchase again. The flavor is bad and the design sucks, and is just not worth it.",
