When a tooth\u2019s surface is weakened by decay, fluoride can be absorbed into the weakened tooth surface to strengthen the enamel. Both kids and adults need fluoride. You never stop needing fluoride, and the simple truth is that most people \u2013 kids and adults alike \u2013 don\u2019t get enough. Many bottled waters do not contain optimal levels of fluoride. And, some types of home water treatment systems can reduce the fluoride levels in water supplies. How can I have healthier teeth? Using fluoride toothpaste daily is vital for oral care. But you may be shortchanging yourself if you rely on toothpaste alone. Some ACT Fluoride Mouthwash formulas contain the maximum strength of fluoride available without a prescription, making them a simple solution to get the fluoride you need.",

                "reviewText": "This mouthwash was recommended by my dentist, a highly skilled practitioner who my family have relied on for 20 years. I like it very much, and was baffled to see some misguided comments in some 1-star reviews. \"Not enough alcohol\" - it's labeled \"No alcohol\", and in Utah, where I live, many people avoid alcohol, so this is a plus not a minus. \"Does not pour out\" - it says \"Hold the bottle upright and squeeze\", and then the dispenser gently fills up to the 10 ml mark; then you can pour it out. A vry ingenious feature. Inverting the bottle does not work! \"Contains toxic coloring\" - You are warned not to swallow it (presumably because excess fluoride is not good for you, so this criticism is also a little off-target.I'm satisfied - I've just ordered another 3!",

You obviously pay for the quality, but this beats buying it overpriced at your local drugstore. I hope they offer it again in the future with alcohol.
