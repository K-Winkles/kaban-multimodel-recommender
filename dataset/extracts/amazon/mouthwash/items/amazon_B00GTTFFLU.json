A little goes a long way with this mouthwash, you mix it with water when taking. A bottle can last a long time, using a dash at a time. Product delivered fast. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. I think this is the healthiest mouthwash on the market.",

After the first use (1/2 water, 1/2 mouth wash) my mouth did feel cleaner and my teeth were shiny, but my taste buds are destroyed. They are both burned off and offended. The taste of this product is like swishing with old lady perfume. It\u2019s horrible. The bottle says there\u2019s no need to rinse after use. I can assure you I rinsed-many, many, many times. If I\u2019m brave, I will keep it up for a week diluted 2:1 water, mouth wash and see how it goes.",
