        "description": "Revolutionary oral care. Nano silver + xylitol + calcium. Neutralizes oral acid. Kills bad breath. Soothes dry mouth. Whitens teeth. Dentist formulated with plant silver. BFP Nanotec: Our patent-pending technology uses plant-based Nano Silver particles to open channels in the BioFilm, aka Plaque to allow the tooth to uptake much needed Calcium & Xylitol while neutralizing oral acid. We created this revolutionary breakthrough because, as dentists, we were frustrated by other products that merely bounce off of the BioFilm barrier and have marginal effects on your teeth. Dentist Formulated: We are Dentists. We engineered this formula because we were tired of telling patients to brush more and enjoy sugar less, even though those things weren't solving the issues. Our revolutionary BFP NanoTech breakthrough is changing the way dentists have looked at dental products for the last 100 years. Kill bad bacteria. Fluoride free. Sugar Doesn't cause cavities, Acid does. - Dr. Ryan Nolan, DMD. Despite popular belief, sometimes brushing more and eating sugar less sugar still doesn\u2019t prevent cavities. Traditional oral care products aren't fighting the real issue, bad PH levels. Harmful oral acid is created when carbs we eat are consumed by bacteria. Carbs sugar + bacteria = acid. Most mouth rinse brands attempt to kill bacteria with formulas that only introduce more and acid into the mouth. Our nano silver rinse neutralizes acid, targets bad bacteria and delivers calcium + xylitol directly to your teeth. See your current product lands on the PH scale. Cavity producing levels. Neutral. Effective. Battery acid 1.0 PH; Soda pop 2.5 PH; 3.9 PH/4.9 PH; 4.3 PH. 7.8 PH. No animal ingredients. Diabetic safe. ElementaSilver.com. Test Your Rinse: Order a free acid test kit to find out where your current mouth rinse lands on the pH scale at ElementaSilver.com.

Well, my teeth feel cleaner and do not seem to have any bad breath any more, or the formation of the tonsil rocks (as I call them) I am also not seeing plaque forming on my teeth. Can't wait for my next Dental appointment to see what they have to say. This might seem expensive, but I only use a small amount and it seems to be lasting a long time for me.On same bottle for 3 months. I was using twice per day and have now cut back to just in the morning.",

I did have to replace my first order because the bottle I received was very dirty, it looked like some of the rinse was draining down the outside. The replacement was quick and the new bottle looked much better! The flavor is great and the rinse doesn\u2019t burn your mouth! Don\u2019t be caught off guard when it comes out an orange-ish color, cause I was. Overall this seems to be a great product that I will continue to order.",
