I didn't think it was amazing or anything until I ran out and was able to recall what morning breath was again. Yikes. It obviously does its job better than I had realised, albeit in a subtle way, and I've become a repeat buyer since. An important note for me, as an \"invisible braces\" wearer, is that this stuff causes no issues with my hardware and rather keeps it sparkling. The flavour could have more of a minty punch, but that's just personal preference... or maybe my expectations of what a mouthwash \"should\" taste like is an illusion. I'm a fan of this stuff regardless.",
