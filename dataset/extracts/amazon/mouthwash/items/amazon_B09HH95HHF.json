However, I've noticed that my local market is sometimes out of stock, so, I decided to look at Amazon. I found that they have their own brand, and decided to try it. I am glad to say that it tastes just like the same stuff I'm used to using, and leaves my mouth just as fresh, plus the price is comparable. So, I just started a subscription to receive this item every 2 months. Highly recommended!",
