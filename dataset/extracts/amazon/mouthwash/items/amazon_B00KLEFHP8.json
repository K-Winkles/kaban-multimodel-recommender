                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars >>> DOES THE JOB",
                "reviewText": "> Not harsh. Very mild. Hard to believe that it is serious mouthwash -- but it is.> Kinda taste like lemony soda-pop with artificial sweetener -- which mostly masks a very slight chlorine flavor (like swimming pool water).> Not actually expensive as some reviewers complain, since a cupful (the recommended \"dosage\"), is a very small amount --- probably about 1/4 or less of the amount recommended of other mouthwashes. I was going through a big bottle of Listermint every two weeks. I'm just finishing up my first bottle of Oxyfresh after 3 months (i.e., about 12 wks). By my calculations, Oxyfresh is actually significantly cheaper than Listermint -- IF you only use just a capful of Oxyfresh at a time.> Oxyfresh is said to be better for your teeth and gums than standard mouthwashes, and more effective in combating plaque and gingivitis. It contains no alcohol, and therefore does not dry your gums. Studies have shown the ingredients to be more powerful than chlorohexadine (the standard mouthwash prescribed by dentists, periodontists, endodontists, etc. after oral surgery). Caveat, that's overlooking the difference in concentration of a prescription medication (chlorohexadine) versus an over-the-counter mouthwash (Oxyfresh). Nevertheless, Oxyfresh is still recommended for post-surgery use, because it is milder on gum tissue than other OTC mouthwashes which contain alcohol and/or other astringents, which might cause pain, bleeding, or interfere with healing.> Tastes so mild and pleasant (albeit less than \"good\" tasting), that it can be easy to forget and swallow it. DON'T. I swallowed once and got a bad stomach ache --- this is serious mouthwash. Follow the instructions and spit it out. You won't forget twice, trust me. I'd be especially careful allowing children (who tend to swallow anything) to use Oxyfresh.> Some folks dilute Oxyfresh to use in water-flossers. Sounds like a good idea -- you can get the oxyfresh deeper between your teeth and gums. Whether it is Oxyfresh or not, you need to use a little antiseptic mouthwash in your water flosser to prevent growth of bacteria (black gunk) in the machine. My routine is to use 1 capful of Oxyfresh in the water flosser, and (after water-flossing) then to swish a capful in my mouth. The recommendation on the bottle is \"at least a minute\"; my periodontist says \"at least 2 minutes\". > CAUTION -- Oxyfresh alters your taste perception for about an hour, not in a good way. After breakfast (if you are concerned about bad breath) and just before bed (if you are concerned about your teeth and gum health) are the best times to use Oxyfresh. For a dinner date, use the Oxyfresh more than an hour before you expect to dine.> In any case, it is very nice to wake up to a sweet lemony taste in your mouth in the morning (if used before bed, and if you don't rinse, as recommended).FLUORIDE> Oxyfresh does NOT contain fluoride. Particularly if your (non-municipal, or/and osmosis filtered) water supply does not contain fluoride, then you may need some additional fluoride for your teeth. In that case, I recommend using a high-fluoride toothpaste.DRY MOUTH> Recently, I began tucking a Spry mint beneath my teeth and lip to help keep my mouth moist at night (I have a CPAP, and breath through my mouth at night). The main active ingredient in Spry mints (which are specifically sold for reducing dry mouth) is xylitol.> Then I remembered that xylitol is also a significant ingredient of Oxyfresh mouthwash. In retrospect, I remember noticing that I woke up with a less horribly dry mouth after starting the Oxyfresh. Apparently Oxyfresh promotes moist mouth -- by first, not drying out your mouth with alcohol or other astringent, and secondly by the xylitol promoting the flow of saliva. So, if you have dry mouth, particularly at night, Oxyfresh will help. If you need more help, I recommend Spry Xylitol Mints.",
