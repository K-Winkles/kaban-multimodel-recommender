                "reviewText": "If you're thinking about buying IoRinse, then you've probably done your homework on Molecular Iodine and what it can do. Here's what I can offer: 1) the Soft Mint has no taste at all other than a slight minty taste - any \"iodine-y\" taste you get will be after you spit it out, on an in-breath, and after 4 months of use, that is barely noticeable; 2) It has cured, or severely mitigated a gum infection that was turning painful and concerning; 3) having lived in West Palm Beach for a while, I can tell you that there is a large, firmly-entrenched sub-culture in the area that is both knowledgeable and serious about their health supplements (IoTech is based in Boca Raton, very near WPB;) 4) I can't afford to even sit in a dentist's chair without dental insurance. So, I researched and tried to educate myself on affordable, doable solutions. Molecular Iodine is one. After trying all OTC toothpastes, mouth rinses and folk-remedies, I came upon Molecular Iodine after putting iodine on a nasty scrape and thinking, I wish I could put iodine on my gum infection, even knowing that in its concentrated form iodine is a poison. Ah, science! Research led to the IoTech company and IoRinse. I'm grateful to have found it and sorry I wasted all that money on advertised products that did not touch the root of the problem. While not a substitute for high-end dentistry, IoRinse can help with many mouth and gum issues, and incidentally provides soothing relief for mouth/gum/tooth pain.",

                "reviewText": "So I've been having a whirlwind of dental problems and have been in and out of dentists for the past few years. I landed an appointment with a very well to do dentist in my area, (finally caved with the expensive consult fee as the other dentists I had seen were more on budget but not helpfulI and i needed answers I was not getting from the lower end of the spectrum.) The initial thing that stuck out to me the most during this visit was when they had me do a \"quick rinse.\" In the past, this had been done with mouthwash. This doctor had this mouthwash. Naturally I snuck a pic and ordered on Amazon same day. I was using it daily and when I went back to that dentist, I had mentioned during my \"quick rinse\" that I had purchased the same mouthwash and he promptly informed me that it was no for everyday use. It is specifically for after oral surgeries when you need to keep your open wounds clean and daily use after the prescribed time frame would result in your teeth weakening and they would turn purple. I stopped daily use, used as prescribed and once the bottle was empty I never re ordered. Im posting this review for the folks who are desperately looking for any help they can get with their teeth and wanted to let you know that although it does work as intended, this is not for daily use and there are undesirable results when used everyday. (For anyone wondering, I passed on the expensive dentist and his 90k estimate.)",

                "reviewText": "No matter what brand, I think all mouthwash is supposed to taste like it should not be ingested.That said, the flavor of this mouthwash isn't that bad. I didn't choke or gag. It does leave a very tingly feeling in your mouth for a little while, but not the burn that some other brands leave.My gums were slightly inflamed, and this took it away instantly. I am a little concerned about the potential for discoloration of teeth, so I will use this as needed instead of twice daily.Overall, I think it's a genius product and it will definitely be a mainstay in my home.",
