I saw this mouthwash was ~15% alc. so I ordered it to use as mild disinfectant.This mouthwash is great by the way. I had never been a mouthwash fan because Listerine is awful but Amazon mint is totally cool with me. I'm going to keep reordering this. I actually enjoy using this mouthwash and I think it tastes good. It's a great value.Some weeks later I attended my appointment at a new dentist clinic. Was told the filling that came off was totally unnecessary so no work needed to be done. Did some prophylactic cleaning and life was good again.",
