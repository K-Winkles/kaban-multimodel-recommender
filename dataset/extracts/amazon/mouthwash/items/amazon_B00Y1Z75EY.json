This refreshing, alcohol-free antibacterial rinse doesn't burn or sting, so it\u2019s easy to use every day. TheraBreath Mild Mint Oral Rinse is certified kosher, gluten-free and vegan. It is also free of dyes, perfumes, detergents, and other harsh additives that can dry or damage the mouth. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is our flagship product and has been dentist- and pharmacist-recommended for more than 20 years. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is an ADA approved product and has become one of the United States' best-selling specialty oral hygiene treatments.Fresh Breath Oral Rinse by Dr. Katz attacks sulfur-producing bacteria, morning breath, and food odor. In fact, clinical studies have verified that TheraBreath is extremely effective at attacking bad breath odor for over 12 hours. This powerful mouthwash eliminates even the most severe cases of bad breath or halitosis (which is the scientific name for this condition). Dr. Katz\u2019s proven oral rinse formula does not contain alcohol, artificial flavors, or colors. It is also pH-balanced to maintain a non-acidic environment in the mouth, which reduces burning and enamel erosion while preventing tooth sensitivity. This product is safe to use twice daily and is available without a prescription.This product is sold as a pack of six 3-ounce bottles and is available in a Mild Mint flavor that is easy on sensitive teeth and gums. As with all our products, TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is guaranteed to work to your satisfaction or your money back!",

                "reviewText": "I am really self conscious of my breath smelling as I have struggled with tonsil stones my whole life.Disclaimer: I have used peroxide in the past and it does help but it tastes awful and foams up and in my experience it helps you for a short period of time like an hour after rinsing. I read a review saying that this tastes like peroxide and it does not.You know when you close your mouth and open your glottis a little bit and you feel like a bitterness in the back of your throat (where your tonsils are) and you know that means you have stinky breath, well I have to really almost swallow mouthwash to get rid of that, and it only lasts for a short amount of time, sometimes I feel the stink\u2019s still there but the smell of the mouthwash masks it.Well I tried this mouthwash: gone. It didn\u2019t go away right away, I rinsed twice the first day, then before bed, then in the morning and midday I noticed that bitterness in the back of my throat was gone. Like it doesn\u2019t come back. I hope this helps longterm but I know it\u2019s working throughout the day.",

I used to use a liquid from Aveda with was a couple drops in your mouth no need to spit but apparently they no longer sell it. Since the TheraBreath gum worked so well I thought I'd try this. Unfortunately, for proper use the directions say 3 tablespoons. While that is for 24 hours you only get about 3 days worth in each bottle. That makes this very expensive and not a practical option. I have been using a capful right before I meet with someone which does help. I still use the gum but looking for a small bottle of some mouth refresher.",
