For my first two, I stuck to a specific brand because others just couldn\u2019t match up \u2013 whether it was poor fit, leaks, or low quality. This Amazon brand of diapers has been a game-changer. The quality is top-notch, no leaks to worry about, and the sizing is spot on. As someone who values good value, subscribing to these diapers was a seamless process, and the product itself is fantastic. Highly recommend for busy parents!",

Decided to give these Amazon ones a try, and I must say they seem nearly identical. These Amazon ones offer a wetness indicator whereas the hello bello ones don\u2019t (at least for size 4). Our baby also sleeps through the night, but so far we haven\u2019t had any leakage. They feel/look thin at first but again, they contained our 6 month olds pee over an almost 12 hour period without issue.In the photos, the left is hello bello and the right is Amazon mama bear plush for comparison.Very impressed and will be purchasing these again!",

                "reviewText": "These diapers have everything going for them. Soft, stretchy, absorbent, and good price point. I especially loved the super stretchy tabs.I would buy these diapers exclusively, except for ONE issue I had. My daughter was constantly getting a diaper wedgie. Not just a little, not just a couple of times, not just when a certain person put the diaper on her, but every single time.This contributed to a couple leaks, and is obviously uncomfortable for my daughter, so we will not be buying them again. This is the only reason, and you may not have the same issue on your child- therefore the final verdict is: worth a try!!!",

                "reviewText": "It all depends on *How Frequently you change your baby's diaper. If you expect a diaper to hold multiple urinations before you touch it... you're best off going after a name brand like Huggies or Pampers Overnights. 50 cents or more per diaper, I can't justify unless it's for overnight or going out in public with less opportunity to change.For the parents that are stay at home and change asap every pee, that pay attention to that blue stripe wet indicator and address immediately... This is a deal. My favorite diapers are the eco-friendly Pampers Pure or Seventh Generation, but they're not cost effective for changing for each wet. These Mama Bear diapers, you get what you pay for. Do not expect it to hold an impressive amount of urine. I noticed they leak overnight if I'm not waking up to change her at least 3x in the night. Idk how the premium brands could advertise \"12 hour overnight protection\"- I've never heard of a parent letting one diaper go all night without waking up to baby sleeping in a puddle. Maybe my baby is just extremely hydrated lol idk. Ideally, Mama Bear diapers for the daytime when changing most frequently... and a premium brand diaper that will justify its cost with overnight absorption, that might go for 6 hrs before a change. Don't waste your money on Huggies in the daytime if you're a frequent changer. These do just fine and the snaps stay on, no gimmicks diapers that are 3 to a dollar.Cautionary warning... if your baby is sick or has wet poops in general, do not use these diapers. I have not experienced a blowout that wasn't *barely contained, but the side frills were certainly pooped on and that makes it especially important to secure the diaper properly in the thigh crease to avoid disaster.*Cheap and good diaper, but only for expert changers. Lazy changers or those with deeper pockets---> pass this deal and pay more to get more",

                "reviewText": "I am a mom of 2, so I know a lot about diapers. I have used Honest, Huggies Snugglers, Huggies Little Movers, Huggies Special Delivery, Luvs, Pampers, Kirkland and now Mama Bear. I wanted to like these diapers, but after 48 hours we were literally running to the store to get her any other brand so she wouldn't have to be in these for 1 more diaper change.Here are the details. The number 1 reason we couldn't do these diapers any longer is they caused irritation on the baby. They are sooooo cheaply made that this was the biggest concern. When we started using these my baby was 11 months old. Only tried them because her regular diaper shipment wasn't arriving for a few more days. My husband and I were just commenting the other week how great it was that we didn't have to worry about diaper rash with our second kid. She never had an issue and we barely ever used butt paste. Well then we get these diapers and after 24 hours we started seeing irritation. They obviously don't wick well and the chemicals used in the production had irration marks where the diapers rub.These diapers also feel so much thinner and cheaper than our regular brand.Out of all of these diaper brands, I hands down recommend Huggies Special Delivery. Diapers are definitely not created equal. Having a baby with a happy, dry bottom is crucial. Worth the extra pennies, plus just think of all the money you save on less diaper creams, medicines and doc visits. Huggies Special Delivery is the best diaper on the market.",
