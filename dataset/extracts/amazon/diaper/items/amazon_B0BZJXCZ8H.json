They have a long absorbent layer, can hold at least half a days worth of wetness, and the tabs don\u2019t deteriorate even with generous application of water soluble lubricants underneath. No slips, drips, easy tab grip and hold. We haven\u2019t had a leak yet. The only negative we can find is in comparison to some previous brands we loved that went out of business, these do get droopy when full and have no wetness line indicator. Though maybe the droop is the unintentional indicator. Overall love these and will be sticking with them until potty trained!",

                "reviewText": "Subscribed to receive Hello Bello diapers every month for my 1 and a half year old son. After 48 hours of receiving the diapers and him wearing them consistently, he developed a severe, blistering rash on every part of his body the diaper was touching. At the time, I just thought he was getting diaper rash in general, not because of the diapers. It continued to get worse and looked and felt so painful, he would scream our in pain even if he sat in cool water in the tub. We took him to the doctor and the doctor confirmed that it wasn\u2019t a fungal infection, bacterial infection, and that it was essentially a form of SEVERE diaper rash. For the record, he is the healthiest little boy, has not had any medical issues or scares, and has hardly experienced diaper rash in his life until now. And even the one or two times he did have it in the past, it was so minor that it would resolve immediately after using butt paste or Desitin. Super bummed out about the overall experienced with trying these diapers. They have caused my little one excruciating pain and became so severe, he had to just wear a light cloth-like diaper for a week in order for the rash and intense blistering to heal.",

My daughter had been getting a peely rough patch on her hip from another brand so I quickly jumped on the Hello Bello bandwagon and I have no jumped off since! Especially since she loves to choose which design she wears, it makes diaper changes with an active toddler a tad bit easier. She\u2019s been wearing these from newborn to now (19 months)! *An important note to add is I sized up as I wasn\u2019t sure what size would fit her (normally wears a 5 but wears a 6 in HB) but my daughter is also very tall so these smaller packs are great for size testing or just throwing in a diaper bag for a day or two away!",
