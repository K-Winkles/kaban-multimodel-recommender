                "reviewText": "HONEST IS A GARBAGE COMPANY WITH A GARBAGE PRODUCT Honest has garbage diapers and garbage customer service. The tabs rip off in defective packs (some are fine, some rip 100% of the pack) and Honest will only honor returns within 90 days and not sold by third parties (Target, amazon, etc). I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and purchase directly from their website, and had this ISSUE HAPPEN AGAIN, and they refuse to honor an exchange past 90 days. They are such stiff diapers, the night times leak and honestly, it's not worth my time OR MONEY to keep purchasing from this garbage company. I'd rather let my credit go to waste then spend another single penny here. So disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "Our 2-year-old has had persistent diaper rash for many months, and after trying multiple different oral and topical treatments, and giving him time with his diaper off during the day whenever possible, the pediatrician said we need to change his diaper at night so he doesn't have a wet diaper on for 12 hours straight. The thought of disrupting everyone's sleep every night filled me with dread, so I thought let's try overnight diapers first and see if that helps....and it has! We've been using these for about a week and the diaper rash is much less irritated and inflamed looking. The diapers feel much drier in the morning compared to the Pampers Pure we use during the day. The fabric itself is a bit weird and stiff, not as soft as other diapers we've tried, but he hasn't asked to take them off or anything so they must feel fine to him.I didn't really pay attention to the reviews saying the diapers run small, because our son is about 28lbs. and he's 2, so he doesn't have the chunky baby thighs anymore, although he doesn't have skinny legs yet either. But he very comfortably fits into all other size 4 diapers without any issues. These however are SMALL. Like really small. The tabs barely make it over his hips to close the sides, and the diaper itself is narrow. I would think if your baby is over 30lbs. there's absolutely no way a size 4 would fit, even though it's supposed to go up to 37lbs....no way! If we order more of these we'll go with the next size up.",
