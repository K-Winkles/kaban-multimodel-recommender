Like Chase and Marshall would say, our highly trained paws are at your service. And diaper leaks? We\u2019re on the case with nonstop leak protection. Luvs Triple Leakguards absorb quickly to help stop diaper leaks before they happen. But our leak protection doesn\u2019t stop there. Secure cuffs and stretchy sides keep leaks locked in where they happen the most. Forget about cheap, leaky diapers and spend more time enjoying this ride known as parenting.
