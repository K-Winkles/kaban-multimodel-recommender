However, I would say they are comparable to big box store brands.What I like most about these wipes is the packaging. My babies are no longer in diapers so we don't go through wipes like we once did, but I'm never without wipes in my car and in my bag. The package is more compact than other wipes, which I appreciate, and the closure system has both the resealable adhesive AND the plastic \"door.\" This helps to keep the moisture in so they don't dry out as quickly.

                "reviewText": "I knew that these baby wipes were scented when I ordered a box of them. I just thought, How bad can the scent be? They\u2019re made for babies.When I received the box (It was quite heavy. Never thought baby wipes were so heavy, but there were a lot of them.), I brought it inside the house and noticed a mild scent which was similar to a detergent scent. However, when I opened the box, the scent changed and became very strong. I cannot even describe the scent except it smelled like a very heavy awful perfume. I could not stand the smell to the extent that I could not even bring myself to open a pack of wipes. I could not even keep them inside the house. I took the box out into the garage. The next day I went into the garage, and it smelled so bad I had to take the box outside.So I am not sure what was wrong with the box of wipes I got or if they are just in general so heavily scented. I am not sure why they have to be scented like that to be used on babies. I admit I am a bit sensitive to scents, but my husband could not stand the smell either.My review does not include any comments on the wipes themselves as I never even opened a pack.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are decent when compared to other wipes I use. They are plenty moist. I'm not a fan of scented wipes only because they can cause reactions to the skin. The scent itself is fine. The wipes are a little smaller than I prefer. I like them a little larger to help clean up big messes.",
