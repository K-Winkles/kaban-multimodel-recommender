                "reviewText": "FOr my 3M old, we were looking to shop for well priced diapers. So far we were using ALDI ones but because of Covid they have put a limit of just 2 per visit which gets about 80 piece and last a week. So certainly I am in no mood to make those many ALDI visits to get it and therefore was looking for bigger pack at Amazon. Found this one and with subscription, the price got better than ALDI. Was not sure about the quality as never heard about this brand before but since its on Amazon, I didn't hesitate to order. The item was delivered sooner than promised. When we ran out of ALDI diapers and finally opened this big box, we were up for the surprise. My older daughter who opened and got this diaper for her little brother was so excited by the look of the diaper and said this looks an expesive brand. We now used these diaper for over a week and it has not leaked even once. My little baby too seems to be happy with it. Great product and at a very good price. Buy it with confidence.",

                "reviewText": "A pretty great buy... The diapers were all in good condition and got here quickly!You can't ever go wrong with this brand...I started using them in 1990 when my first child was born and when my granddaughter was born Feb of last year I bought a box for my daughter for the baby. Once she finally used up all the packs of higher priced diapers that were gifted to her she was blown away at how well they stood up to those other brands and honestly even better than a certain one of those brands as far as overnight leakage is concerned...Now Luvs is all she uses and she is able to save a little extra money that can be put to use elsewhere!I swore by this brand in the 90's and I am happy to report that they have only improved over the years as well!I really think if you gave them a try you'd feel the same way...Besides, you'd have to be crazy to pay more for diapers when there's an alternative like Luvs out there.Well, that is unless you have money you don't mind throwing to the wind, then by all means go on and pay more for a diaper that's identical to Luvs!",

So as soon as we got home from the hospital we ditched the pampers and went with loves. They are the only diapers I\u2019ve found that have overnight leak protection in infant sizes, besides honest.We have exclusively bought loves since we\u2019ve been home except when we were out of town. I couldn\u2019t find a small package of luvs so I bought huggies because they were on sale and they leaked after three hours! Never again, huggies, never again.From now on it\u2019s luvs all the way or if I can\u2019t find them, then honest diapers.My husband did point out that they don\u2019t have the yellow \u201cwet\u201d strip, but seriously, you can\u2019t see and feel when a diaper is wet without the strip and the strip only tells you the diaper is damp, not full.",
