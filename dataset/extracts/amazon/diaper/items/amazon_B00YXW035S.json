I just became one 11 days ago, we have a tiny (2,7 kg 48 cm) gorgeos baby, we have 0 complains about the diapers, in fact we find them very confortable, specially me,- They have the brand on the front so you dont miss the side, so it help you to do things right very quickly- they have a big frill so they cover around the legs of Emma to avoid spills, non so far- They ar very soft- they look like they will fit her for about 3 month or more, in other word they ar big but adaptable- they come in a very flat presentation en folded, so they fit in the diaperbagfor the price best choice, in my opinion, just wrap your baby with love a care, her or he will repay with normal numbers 1&2 hehe love you all",

The first pack we purchased were great, we didn't have any diaper explosions and she didn't get a rash and there weren't any leaks at night. The second pack we purchased either were made wrong or my daughter has a serious problem. She either leaked almost every single day we've used them or she had a major diaper explosion. This last diaper explosion was so bad it got all over her car seat, legs, arms and hair. This has never happened with any other diapers and I was completely surprised because we've used these before and we loved them. Long story short, I don't believe I'll go back to these anytime soon.",

They\u2019re incredibly soft and we\u2019re so comforted knowing how natural they are. If you find them pricey I\u2019d suggest opting for the subscribe option. They may not be quite as durable as typical popular brands, but truthfully that brings me even more comfort knowing they\u2019re not made of plastic and awful chemicals. We don\u2019t experience leaks or blowouts at all! Love them and recommend them to everyone.",

We never had any leakage.Our little one wore them for the first week or so during the meconium poo phase because cloth would be permanently damaged by the tar-like poop. He was comfortable and even though the diapers were a little big on his newborn bum, rolling down the front twice and securing firmly made them fit perfectly. I'd do it again! The price was a little bit much, but I think the environment is worth it--plus, I'm not buying these regularly (cloth was always the goal). Still--100% recommend!",

At first I thought like others that they just looked way to big, comparing to other brands. I used the Huggies NB diapers the hospital supplied for the first few days because of this. His bum got a bad rash right away, as they hold his stool and voidings way to close to the bum. The Aleva diapers provide enough space so it is never really plastered to his skin, but sitting in the diaper below instead. When putting them on there is a slight learning curve as they do sit higher up at first then other diapers (My son is just over 7 lbs.). You also have to tighten them snuggly overlapping the velcro (Picture one). The inner elastic fits nicely preventing blow outs and leaks, even though the outer leg openings look large/loose (Picture two). I have had no problems, his bottom is now rash free and I will never use another diaper!",
