They do have a baby powder scent which I am really not a fan of. If you like the scent then this will be great for you, but if you are sensitive to scents then I would not recommend these. The middle side edges have a nice stretch to them and an inner stretch wall that helps keep solids and liquids in. We have not had any leaks with these diapers and there have been some fuller diapers. The top front edge and top back edge do not have any stretch to them. The back tabs do have a nice stretch to them and the velcro holds well.As I said, of all the Pampers diapers I have tried these are by far my favorite. Just make note that there is a very strong baby powder scent to these.",

Huggies absorbs more pee better, Pampers has a weird powdery stink that I havent had with any other diaper companies, and the material is so stiff on my baby that it actually makes it hard for her to move. Very disappointed since I though from reading other comments it would be alright but nope not worth it",
