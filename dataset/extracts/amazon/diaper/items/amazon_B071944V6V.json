I haven\u2019t tried it without a disposable swim diaper under yet since he it hasn\u2019t gotten warm enough in our home pool - don\u2019t want to risk ruining swim classes for everyone for a day. The waist and legs are pretty snug on this so I think it would be fine on its own. My son is 13 months old, 22lbs and 31\u201d tall. He doesn\u2019t have very chunky legs and it longer and this still has a good seal. It stretches well so I think it would be ok on a baby with chunkier legs. Dries fast also.",

                "reviewText": "My baby is 6 months and I signed him up for swimming classes where they required these. I originally ordered size 6-12 months but it was way too snug on my baby (he is 20lbs for reference). I ended up sizing up and the 12 month size fits great.They do stretch and are supposed to fit snug but if you have a chunky baby like myself definitely size up.",
