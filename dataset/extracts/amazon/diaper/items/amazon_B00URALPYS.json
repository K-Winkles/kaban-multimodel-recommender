                "reviewText": "We and my wife have been buying these for our daughter since about the time when our daughter hit the 6 month mark. We had tried some other brands at first like Pampers, Disney, etc. but found that in some of them the absorbent material in the diapers could not hold very much urine. I have no clue what Merries diapers uses for their adsorbent but holy cow does it soak up urine! The diapers are not only far more adsorbent than any \"Western\" brand, but the diapers are also very soft, comfortable and breathable! The soft bands of the diaper wont hurt your kids or chafe. The pull up diapers are excellent and we have also used the velcro type diapers when our daughter was younger. I highly recommend this brand of diapers to anyone who is kinda disappointed in the pricey and low quality \"western\" diapers. Not only will ya save money, but your precious baby will thank you!Although we havent always bought from this company, this company has excellent delivery and the diapers are always delivered in excellent condition! Thank you guys!",
