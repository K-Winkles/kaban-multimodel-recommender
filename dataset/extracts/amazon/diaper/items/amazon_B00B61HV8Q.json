                "reviewText": "I have been using Pampers diapers since September of 2016, and I am a very happy customer. When my son was born, I tried just about every brand of diaper to see what fit our needs the best. My son didn't have any allergy issues to any of the diapers I tried, so I chose based on what leaked the least and fit the best. I used Pampers Swaddlers until he was walking, which was roughly one year. Then I moved him into Pampers Cruisers. Now, I have a one month old daughter who I am also using Pampers Swaddlers with. I tried all of the different brands I got samples of with her as well, and these are my favorite.To start, these diapers fit well. I do move my children up in size before they hit the next recommended weight as I find that moving them up earlier prevents blow outs. However, the tabs you use to close the diapers stick to every surface of the diaper so they fit many different waist sizes. The tabs are sturdy and don\u2019t come undone accidentally or tear off, but they are still easy to remove when it is time to change the diaper. The shape is designed well to prevent leaks, and these diapers also have an inner leak guard that helps contain stool.These diapers also have a line that is yellow and turns blue when the diaper is wet. This helps when your child has small amounts of urine and you can\u2019t tell if they are wet. For boys, this line is obvious through the front, but with girls you may have to look further down on the diaper because the different anatomies puts urine to different areas of the diaper.I think these diapers feel softer than other major brands. I do prefer the Pampers Swaddlers to the Pampers Baby Dry, but they are a little more expensive. I still feel like the Swaddlers are priced appropriately, though. I will continue using Pampers until my children are no longer in diapers.",

                "reviewText": "We have tried a couple different brand of diapers as we were gifted several different ones. We had read that Pampers Swaddlers were great but as our kid was our first, we did not have any experience with different brands.As we were close to running out we decided to also buy some Kirkland diapers from Costco which everyone seems to love but nothing has compared to these swaddlers diapers.Particularly at night we have had issues with ALL diapers except swaddlers. Even the baby dry doesn\u2019t seem to work as well. Our little boy gets a bottle right before bed so he doesn\u2019t have time to pee much before sleeping and leaking was a huge problem with other brands.The wet line on these is better than any other brand we have tried. The fit is also much much better! The straps hold better, they\u2019re easy to put on and take off. The diapers unfold and lie flat making diaper changes easy without getting caught on one another. We hadn\u2019t poop everywhere because of issues with the Kirkland diapers sticking to one another because of how their Velcro works. And then of course the nighttime effectiveness of these can\u2019t be beat! They can hold so much more than other diapers without leaking!We have a few more diapers from other brands which we are finishing up but we only use those during the day and ALWAYS use these at night!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter is almost 6 months old and since she was born, I've had the opportunity to try hundreds of brand-name diapers that were given to me at my diaper party. These diapers ranged from Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs. Within the Huggies & Pampers line, I had different \"models\" at my disposal, such as Pampers Swaddlers & Pampers Baby Dry as well as Huggies Little Snugglers, Huggies Snug & Dry, and even Huggies Snug & Dry Plus. However now that I've run out of those, I am now purchasing my own diapers. Based on my experiences, Pampers Swaddlers are ***THE BEST*** diaper I've used thus far. And because of that, I will never go back to any other diaper. I've literally given my unused packages/boxes of Huggies diapers to local charities for those in need.The reason I love Pampers Swaddlers is that they are the *ONLY* diaper that does not leak. The fit absolutely perfect and I've never had an issue with them. EVER! However, this is not to say that all Pampers diapers are good. I've tried Pampers Baby Dry, which is a more economical version of their diaper, and that diaper does not come close to the performance of the Swaddlers line. Baby Dry would would leak and/or sag to cause more leakage. The Huggies brands however, are even worse. I can't tell you how many times my daughter's daycare had to change her clothes due to constant leakage of the diaper (EVEN WITH 2 hour change intervals). Huggies is simply garbage because it soaks up literally nothing. I'm left to wonder if various boxes of the Huggies diapers I've used even has any sodium polyacrylate in them. FYI, sodium polyacrylate is the \"super absorbent polymer\" that absorbs moisture in all brands of diapers. While Pampers Swaddlers would \"bulge up\" and absorb my daughter's urine, the Huggies line never bulged up. Meaning they never absorbed anything. Leading to the urine-soaked clothes that my daughter experienced every day.The color-changing wetness indicator is a nice touch. The equivalent brand version of Huggies that has this is the Little Snugglers. But just as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, it leaked and never seemed to fit right on my baby. Although I'd pull them up as high as they could go, there seemed to be a huge \"pocket\" around my baby's bottom, which would be one of the reasons for the sag/leakage.Another reason I like the Pampers Swaddlers is their shape allows for a snug fitment. Pampers is the only diaper with \"tags\" on both ends to provide a 360 degree full fitment around the waist. No other brand of diaper I've seen does this.The Pampers Swaddlers line goes all the way up to size 5. I'm glad because it's the only diaper that I trust. So I'll be buying these until my daughter grows out of them. I stand by my review 100% and have NEVER been disappointed by the Swaddlers line.",
