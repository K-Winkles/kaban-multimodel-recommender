                "reviewText": "I purchased this Huggies bundle for my active toddler. The Little Movers size 4 diapers fit my daughter well and contain messes reliably. The stretchy tabs and snug fit around her thighs prevent leaks when she's crawling and playing. The Natural Care wipes are soft on her delicate skin and get the job done quickly during changes. Overall, this diaper and wipe combo works well for our needs. My daughter seems comfortable and I haven't had any issues with leaks or irritation. For an active kiddo, I'd recommend these Huggies products.",
