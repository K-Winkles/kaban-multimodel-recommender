When it comes to pull-ups and easy-ups, Pampers easy-ups are SOOOO much better than Huggies pull-ups. They are so much softer (especially on the sides where Huggies pull-ups tend to leave a rash) and much more absorbant and underwear- like. They are extremely soft and comfortable for my daughter and these are what she always wears to bed. I couldn't imagine her sleeping in a rough pull-up! But yeah Pampers easy-ups take the cake! They are one incredible underdog product!!",

Even though they are much more expensive than the Parent's Choice that I usually get, they are so much more absorbant and softer. Many times she peed and I could not tell! The color changed but they still felt dry. These would be very comfortable for a long trip or overnight. If I could afford them in the budget I would get them more often. There is also less per pack than the walmart brand. They are well worth the money which is why I gave them 5 stars. There is a reason why they are more expensive than Walmart brand :).",
