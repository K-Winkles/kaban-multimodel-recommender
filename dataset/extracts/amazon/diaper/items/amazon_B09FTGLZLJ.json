She pees a lot and she\u2019s extremely petite, so I couldn\u2019t keep stuffing absorbent layers in the cloth diaper. She also has ridiculously sensitive skin and is prone to rashes. The cheeky panda diapers do not irritate her skin AT ALL, and they are super absorbent. She sleeps for 10-12 hours through the night and we\u2019ve yet to have a leak. The fit is good, haven\u2019t had any blowouts yet and the diapers are very trim. Baby-cakes is a very tiny 15 month old and fits in the size three. I would absolutely recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "My now 2 year old has been wearing bamboo diapers since birth. My favorite was Andy Pandy, which is almost never in stock. I also like Dyper and Eco Boom (on left of first photo). Finding bamboo diapers has become increasingly difficult as he grew--supply issues, price gauging, etc. I decided to try Cheeky Panda because they were the best value when I needed to restock. We've gone through one package and so far, I think these are my overall favorites.I bought size 4, which says 19-30 lbs on the package but 22-37 on Amazon. For comparison the Eco Boom is XL 26+ lbs. As you can see, they look similar in size. My son is 27-28 lbs and has plenty of room to grow. CP has bigger wings on the sides, which I like--better coverage means no \"Tarzan's loin cloth\" look that happens with some of the other brands.Absorbency is great, comparable to AP, Dyper and Eco Boom. They've been 100% leak free for overnights,no blowouts, and no signs of diaper rash or irritation.They are so soft! At first, they seem thinner than the other good brands, but that's probably because of the bigger wings (be gentle when stretching the sides open). The quilted liner runs all the way from the front to back waist and does as good a job at keeping my kiddo dry.These are supposedly as biodegradable as the other popular brands, and although a lot of other environmental conditions factor into how well these diapers actually breakdown, I like to think they at least have a smaller footprint than non-biodegradable diapers. Plus, they don't smell like a perfume counter and they've kept my son rash free!Needless to say, I highly recommend these! I might even say they'll be my first choice from now on.",
