                "reviewText": "I ordered this pack of diapers through the Vine program but I've been a loyal Bambo user for two-plus years and going strong. These are my absolute favorite diapers on the market! Tight velcro-style hold grips securely and keeps diaper in place, snug and secure. Leg ruffles hold in any blowouts and inner core is absorbent without having any problems staying together 99% of the time. We've had maybe 10 diapers fall apart or leak over the course of hundreds of packs used, even through toddler poops, long overnight sleeps, even when the kids had a brush with norovirus. Best of all, they're ecologically friendly and decompose much quicker than traditional diapers, so I don't feel nearly as guilty about using all of the disposables this way.If your'e on the fence about choosing bamboo diapers and wondering if they work as well as traditionals, I really invite you to give these a try! I'm super satisfied with the performance of these diapers from newborn into toddler phase, and when my next kiddo comes along I feel certain I'll be back to start all over again. Recommended!",

My son never had an issue overnight but my daughter was having some leaking if she happened to also have a bowel movement overnight (she\u2019s 3 and special needs). I ordered these when they ran a sale at first and I kid you not in the few months we have been using them she has not had one blowout! I was having to get her right in the bath, strip her bedsheets, and even lost a few pairs of little sleepies Jammie\u2019s. These overnight versions are an absolute must now for her - I was skeptical since she was already in the Dream ones overnight but they are legitimately different. #sweepstakes",

For me, it's all about figuring out if the balance is worth it for the eco-benefits. In this case, I would say the benefits of using eco-friendly diapers outweighs the drawbacks, and these products are good (just maybe not quite as good as the common diaper brands).My particular use of these is for my three year old who is potty trained but still wears diapers overnight to avoid any accidents. These are pretty good at absorbing overnight pee, but if he sleeps longer than about 10 hours (which can occasionally happen), there can be some leakage. Comfort-wise, I'm relying on my son's account. He says they're fine. He doesn't really notice much of a difference between these and others he's used, but I'm pretty sure he's not thinking deeply about the comfort of the diapers he's using. However, he would complain if there were an issue, so I guess there isn't one. They do feel noticeably slightly less soft than other brands, but that's likely due to the eco-friendly processes and ingredients. It's also nice to know that even the packaging they come in is paper and recyclable or compostable.Bottom line: They're priced similarly if slightly more expensive than common grocery store brands of diapers, and they're almost as good in terms of functionality. The eco-benefits should be enough for many parents to consider using these. They may not be as good for the environment as cloth diapers, but they offer most of the conveniences of regular diapers.",

                "reviewText": "My baby has always needed overnight diapers. Regular diapers do not work for us - we have woken up soaked in pee too many nights. Very pleased to say that these Bambo Nature overnight diapers work well. Absolutely NO leaks by morning. My little one is an active sleeper - tosses, turns, and sits straight up in the middle of the night. In the morning, the diaper was full, as expected, but no leaks at the stomach or leg openings.These are soft inside and out, although I would not say more than other brands. The back waistband is not that flexible, but the sides are very flexible.I particularly like that these have no fragrances, phthalates, parabens, lotions, preservatives. Great for my little one's sensitive skin.Overall these are great diapers and worked well!\"MATERIALS: Textile backsheet (outer side) of poly-propylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Absorbent of polyacrylate (SAP) and cellulose (TCF fiuff). Inner side of nonwoven (PP). Acquisition layer of nonwoven (PET/CO-PET). Hook-and-loop fastening of nonwoven (PP/PE). Glue made of synthetic rubber no optical brightener added. Elastication made from elastane. No perfumes or moisturizing lotions have been used in the product. Non-toxic water-based ink has been used on the outer side for design purposes.\"Made in Denmark",

                "reviewText": "Maybe it was just our son, maybe it\u2019s the quality of these diapers, but they simply didn\u2019t work for us. They seem to be less absorbent than other regular diapers and we had more leaks with them too. They also seem to run a little smaller than other brands. They work okay if the environmentally friendly aspect is that important to you- I think as a brand they do a lot better job at that than others. If it isn\u2019t your top priority, I think there are better options.",

He sleeps 12 hours or more at night. I don\u2019t know if these will hold up to that. My daughter has been using Pampers Swaddlers Overnights with great success but they are 10\u00a2 more per diaper.I will update this review, after I hear back from my daughter about the performance of these diapers.At the time I ordered these diapers, they were competitively priced at 58\u00a2 each.\ud83e\udd17 Thank you so much for taking the time to read this review, have a FANTASTIC day!!\ud83d\ude0a5\u2605",
