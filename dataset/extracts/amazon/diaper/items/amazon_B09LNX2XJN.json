And I make sure to always pull the safe guards out.I also love how these diapers don\u2019t get wet on the outside like Huggies and I truly feel I need to change her less with these over Huggies because they\u2019re more absorbent, so I go through less!",

I know they\u2019re a little bit more than your average run-of-the-mill diapers, but the fact that 87% of the product completely biodegrade within eight months is amazing! It\u2019s nice to know that we\u2019re not polluting the environment with tons of plastic",
