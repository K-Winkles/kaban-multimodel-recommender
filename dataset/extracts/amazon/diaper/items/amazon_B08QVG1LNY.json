                "reviewText": "Excellent product for babies with poop-splosion tendencies and/or watery poop (such as due to breastmilk or GI issues). This has reduced the amount of baby laundry because even if there are still blowouts (can\u2019t always be avoided), they are far less extreme than with just the diaper by itself. That means I may only have to wash the baby\u2019s clothes vs clothes plus the entire crib sheet, mattress protector, nursery wall, etc. If you\u2019re still reading this, you baby probably needs these. They are especially useful when the baby is between diaper sizes because it can help you figure out if the diaper size needs to change right away or if you can get away with the smaller size plus the extender for a while.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these intending on using them to help my daughter not soil the bed at night. She sleeps on her stomach and she typically leaks through her diaper by the morning from the top. I tried these for a week trying to get them to work, but they just don't - somehow, in the morning I would find her soaked through but the inside of the extender would be totally dry. But the outside (side against her clothes) would be wet. It appears that somehow they leak where the velcro attaches to the diaper... I tried so many different things, including using two at a time! And it never worked. Try a different brand of diaper extender if you're looking to contain front, urine messes for belly sleepers.",
