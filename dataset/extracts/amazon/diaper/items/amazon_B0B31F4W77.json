Four snugs, baby-hugging tapes keep the diaper safe and secure to the front panel, which is reinforced with plastic to allow for tape readjusting to get that perfect fit! Likewise, our stretchy leg gathers ensure that all that extra thick padding fits comfortably between baby's legs. Enjoy the age regressed fantasy of a trip to outer space with LittleForBig\u2019s all-over Astro Babies diapers - in a mixed pack featuring THREE unique front panel prints! LittleForBig signature Astro Babies characters return to take you to the stars, with \u2018dry\u2019 printed stars that disappear when wet! This retro-inspired design is too cute for words - just like you! All of our items are supposed to be shipped in discreet packaging. That said, Amazon is pushing for shipping in original packages.

They\u2019re also fantastic if you have heavy periods and tend to leak at night.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these diapers because amazon had them as a next day delivery item, and I needed diapers to get me through, until my regular diapers arrived since I was running low. Wearing diapers is not a choice for me, so I needed something fast. These arrived yesterday, so I used them overnight.I am blown away at the quality, comfort and absorbency of these diaper. I use Rearz and Incontrol Diaper brands full-time, because of the quality. These Little for Big Astro Babies diapers are every bit as good as my regular diapers.ABDL diapers are typically the best diapers made for dealing with incontinence. And this diaper is an incredible option. I highly recommend them for anyone. If you need diapers, and are apprehensive because of the print, just give them a try. These are more comfortable and effective than medical brand adult diapers.",

                "reviewText": "So the Astronaut diapers are one of my new favorites! They have a really cute design and I love the fading stars!! They hold quite a bit and are super comfy as well. If you\u2019re going out in public with these on, I highly recommend wearing some plastic pants or underwear with jeans over them, they are VERY crinkly (something I love in a diaper). The only thing bad that I have to say is that there is a bit of a consistency problem at the manufacturing level. Some bags have diapers that are folded nice and neat then others, like this most recent bag, are folded up haphazardly with some of the folds on the tapes. So LFB if you\u2019re reading this, please pay a little more attention to your quality control, for what I\u2019m spending the quality should be the same with each bag. I really wish Amazon let me give half stars because this is a solid 4.5 out of 5, better quality control would make it a perfect score.",
