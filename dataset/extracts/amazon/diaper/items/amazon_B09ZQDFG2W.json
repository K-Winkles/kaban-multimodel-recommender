I've NEVER felt anything as soft and soothing as these diapers. I have a problem with general pads and have to look for all cotton ones because I always get irritation. These worked so well for me I couldn't believe it. Now for my baby's reveiw lol she has NEVER had a rash, thats a blessing because my sweet son who is now 9 years old didn't get to have the best diaper experience and had bad rashes. I know it's 100% the product's fault because even I get a rash when I use certain brands. I agree with some of the reviews regarding the shipment and wait time I've also had to order more than I need so I'm okay for a couple of months but I dont mind that.",

                "reviewText": "When looking for a diaper for my son, it was important to me to find a brand that was absorbent, hypoallergenic and as non-toxic as possible at an affordable price. Many of the non-toxic diapers I have found during my search are expensive and while I would love to try them, this momma balls on a budget.I have been using the diapers on my baby for a few weeks now and so far there\u2019s been no rash or irritation on my baby. They are absorbent and I have had fewer leaks than other diaper brands I tried like Hello Bello, huggies special delivery and pampers. To be honest, I have yet to find a brand that is completely leak free so fewer leaks works for me.As advertised and like many of the reviews stated, these diapers are extremely soft and velvety to the touch. My favorite part is that they are paraben, phthalate, bleach, fragrance, additive and TCL free!I am very pleased with these diapers!",

                "reviewText": "These diapers were the best thing I have found since we canceled our Coterie subscription because it was getting too expensive. They are the same price as Kotori, but the difference is you can buy less at a time so it\u2019s easier to budget. They are extremely soft and absorbent and they don\u2019t cause diaper rash, which is important because my son has the most sensitive skin and struggles with eczema because it\u2019s so dry where we live! Every other diaper we have tried has given him a rash.However\u2026All those good things aside, I highly recommend you try to purchase their diapers directly from their website because we have had nothing but shipment issues through Amazon! It takes a month or longer to arrive so we are constantly having to go to the store and get Millie moon diapers to hold us over until they finally show up! I always try ordering them way in advance, it still took over a month and we had to buy more Millie Moon. One shipment kept getting delayed month after month so I called and canceled and Amazon placed a replacement order. It still has not shipped and it\u2019s been over a week! So I\u2019m just done. What\u2019s the point of ordering diapers if they never actually make it to your house? It\u2019s basically throwing money into the wind and when the diapers decide to show up they show up, while also blowing money on other brands while we are waiting around.",

He wears a size 6 and I was concerned as they didn\u2019t have much extra room to attach the tabs but they stayed put throughout his play and overnight so they have nice strong grip to keep up with his activities. Overall, very pleased! I was surprised the price wasn\u2019t much more than regular brands and since I only have him a few days a month they\u2019ll last for awhile. He\u2019s just starting potty training so I won\u2019t need much more but he will be comfy until then. I highly recommend giving them a try!",
