                "reviewText": "This Coterie Newborn Essentials pack is something that I would have LOVED to receive as a baby shower gift! Would I continue buying them? Probably not.That being said, the diapers are incredibly soft - including on the OUTSIDE of the diaper, which has an almost fuzzy texture. Lots of stretchy bits for a perfect leak-free fit and SUPER absorbent. The individual packs are a good size to keep out on the changing table shelf and have a perforated tear-line on the top so you're not groggily wrestling trying to open a pack during a middle of the night when your little one has a blowout!The wipes are also super soft, thick, and cushy! Perfectly moistened. They do have a little bit of a scent that I wasn't expecting - just a very light, \"clean\" smell, sort of like hand sanitizer. They're nested folded individually, not connected together perforated - so you pull one out and only one wipe comes out.While I love that this set comes with both the newborn AND size 1 diapers, new moms should be aware that some bigger babies might skip the NB size altogether and be in size 1 right from birth, so you may not get as much value out of this bundle!",

                "reviewText": "I'd heard about coterie from several influencers and was curious. At first glance, the diapers appear pretty basic and thin, but they're very soft and when i tested them they held a lot of moisture \u2014 more moisture than a newborn or young baby would ever produce before you'd be changing them. I love that they're made with cleaner ingredients: This is especially valuable to me during the newborn stage and early months. The fact that this set includes two sizes of diaper is very useful and I liked that it's heavier on size 1 than the actual newborn size. This would've come in handy coming home with my first two kids! One minor thing to note: while some diaper brands can distinguish between liquid and actual urine with their blue line, these diapers turn blue when exposed to any liquid.I've used a whole package of wipes now and they are STURDY. And big. So big that I feel like it's almost a waste, especially for a younger baby. I was constantly trying to contain all messes to one wipe just because I was aware of the price and how well-built they are! We usually use the Kirkland wipes, and these are even larger and thicker than those (which I thought were the perfect size!).All in all, this is a great starter set, at it's a premium price. But, you're definitely paying for quality. It's obvious a lot of thought has been put into these diapers and wipes, but if you aren't as concerned about materials (and this brand really does materials well), there are plenty of other options that work just fine.",

                "reviewText": "This set would be a dream gift for any expecting parent! The variety of sizes (newborn and size one) plus the packs of wipes is the perfect mix to be set up for success during the first couple of months. The quality is unlike any other diaper we have tried! They are so soft and seem so comfortably fit while also being very effectively absorbent.I personally love a plain white diaper! Although patterns are cute, they tend to show through lighter and neutrally colored clothing and I prefer the sleekness of an all white diaper.The wipes are just as good as the diapers! They are a great size which means you end up using fewer wipes during each diaper change, and they are the perfect wetness and thickness to effectively clean their bum while keeping your hands clean, too.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to try this product as I heard so many good reviews. Unfortunately this was not the case for me. Everytime my child does number twos, the diaper always leaks. It also does not protect against blow puts either. The only good thing from this brand are the wipes. The wipes are nice and large and durable. Other than that, I am very disappointed in this and it is definitely not worth the expensive price tag.",
