We've tried all kinds of diaper combinations, wrap-arounds underneath pull-ups, triple pull-ups, menstruation-absorption pads, everything. This is the FIRST product that has entirely covered, absorbed and protected him overnight. Never have we woken up in the morning with absolutely no leakage or residue on his clothes or overnight bed coverings (chucks) before trying these.We weren't sure if they would be worth it when we looked at the price, and though they are on the expensive side, if you absolutely need something that will cover and protect during long periods of inactivity, these particular kinds will 100% be your best bet. We may just turn this into a subscription order.Thank you to the manufacturer for getting these right!",

We ordered the medium as it recommends on the package 28\" to 34\" and 30\" to 38\" for medium. I would say if your close to the next size to order the larger size. otherwise they worked",

                "reviewText": "These have a lot of the features you\u2019d want in a diaper, but those features weren\u2019t done very well. I like that these have a waistband in both the front and the back, but it stretches way too easily, and isn\u2019t as effective as it could be. The tapes on these are a combination of Velcro like and sticky tapes, and are actually some of the best tapes I\u2019ve seen on a diaper. These actually seemed to fit me perfectly, and the sizing seemed very accurate. The absorbency was okay, but I would definitely not trust these for overnight wear. These do have leak guards, but they are not very tall. These were very comfortable when dry, but these were super uncomfortable when wet. These may work for some, but I honestly can\u2019t get past how wet I felt when wearing these.",

In addition, it's so bulky and long the other way, coming up to her chest. So I would say it's probably a good product for a tall person, and one who is slenderer around the hip area.",
