They look really big when you take them out of the pack but they fit very nicely. They're definitely high waisted so we waited to use them until the umbilical cord fell off and couldn't interfere. I feel like they fit my baby longer than other brands and remain a favorite to date.They are incredibly soft and thin but we never once had a leak. Another favorite, perhaps unintentional, feature is that you can see the poop through the white diaper so you don't just rely on the wetness indicator stripe.",

They are light, breathable, thin and soft. But it didn't take much for my baby to go potty and you can feel the wetness on the outside. My baby is 18 months old and doesn't pee as much so it was disappointing to see they hypes on this diaper and comparing them to other brands I'm familiar with, but I wouldn't agree. Every baby is different and different diaper brands work better for each babies needs.",

Which makes very difficult to change her again. Because of that she wakes up and its hard to put her back to sleep again.Its very annoying. Im not satisfied with this product. I will say it was waste of my money. My baby is only 3 months old. This product can be use only on new born thats it.Very very disappointed in this.",
