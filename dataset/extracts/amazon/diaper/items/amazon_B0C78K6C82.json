Babies' skin is extremely sensitive, up to 5x thinner than adults & much more absorbent. They'll spend almost all day every day in a diaper, so we understand the importance of being transparent about our ingredients & the quality of our products. A lot goes into a good diaper! We've seen other diaper brands pour liquid in a diaper and show that the liquid doesn't leak out, but what about the inside where it touches your baby? You want a diaper that doesn't leak AND keeps your baby dry! We've also seen other brands perform tests where it's clear they don't put the same amount of pressure on their diaper to make it look better! We tested a Terra plant-based diaper against two other popular diaper brands to see which one absorbs the most liquid, AND which one stays the most dry. We used a 5 lb. weight so there's no way to fudge the results. Honestly, the video speaks for itself\u2014scroll to the top and click through all the images to see the video!",

I will use these until I can't anymore! My girl drinks a lot and pees a lot during the night, not one wet onesie at all! These are so thick and hold so much liquid. I had honestly never heard of this brand before but I'm so glad I found them. Non-toxic, organic, fragrance free diapers are so limited and this is everything I didn't know I needed!",

Hard to say if the little redness I see is from the diaper itself or just it being on her from 7pm-7am. They are SUPER absorbent - heavy when she wakes up but not wet at all. Seems very moisture-wicking.",

We\u2019ve also started wearing her true size during the day and it\u2019s kind of amazing how dry the diaper is even when it\u2019s relatively full.

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like these diapers as they are one of the most accessible \"non-toxic\" diapers in Canada. They also feel incredibly luxurious and soft. However the first night I put my 4 month old in the size 3 (he is 16lbs) I had to change him in the middle of the night ! The diaper fit properly and the leakage did not happen from the legs. The actual diaper itself had soaked through so much that when I put it on the table it left a wet mark. He sleeps roughly 8-10 hours at night and I have never experienced this with the pampers pure diapers. I'm hoping to have more success with ecopea or ecoriginal diapers (Both of which are difficult to get in Canada). Very disappointed given these diapers are nearly 1.00 per diaper! I gave it a 3/5 star because they hold smaller pees during the day well. Unfortunately a wet breastmilk poop will saturate them too :(",
