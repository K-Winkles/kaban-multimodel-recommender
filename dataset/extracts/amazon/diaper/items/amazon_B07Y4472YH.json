The strong tapes really help get this girly diaper good and very snug on my husband ! This diaper is very discreet under his pants making them the perfect diaper for shopping or dining out ! They also do a great job of humiliating him just as they should !! Diapers like these really put a husband in his place ! I have Already ordered more for my sissy husband. At first he was hesitant to be diapered but now he thanks me for it every time and he really focuses on my needs , wants and desires These diapers are perfect for putting any guy in his place. Also for those who actually have medical needs The rearz diapers on amazon blow away the actual medical diapers hands down !",

If you\u2019re concerned about others finding these, maybe give it some more thought. Only narrowly escaped getting put on blast. Otherwise, they\u2019re nice, maybe not as fluffy as I would like, but the large size fit decently on me. The scent is also pretty nice, left a pleasant cloud of candy smell in my room after the fact. Again though, be aware that the packaging may or may not get you flooded with questions by friends and family.",
