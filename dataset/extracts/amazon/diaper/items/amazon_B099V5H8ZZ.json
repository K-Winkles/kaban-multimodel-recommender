They fit great, don't leak, they're really soft, not too bulky, and there's no weird smell (looking at you Pampers). They do run large, so unless you have a very chunky baby, you want to get a size down from the recommendations on the box. My 19.5 lb son is still very comfortable in size 3 (12-18 lbs). My only wish is that they were more readily available.",

                "reviewText": "I swore by bamboo nature and have used them for many years but unfortunately they recently stopped producing the classic diaper to come out with a new over night version. In the meantime I was out of luck and didn't know what to do!!! I am SO glad I tried these diapers! I am comfortable with the materials used, they do not smell, they are lightweight and not as bulky, but are still super absorbent! My daughter was about 20lbs when I started these and used to wear a size 5 in bamboo nature because their sizing is so crazy. I found a size chart for these diapers somewhere online and it said to get a size 3 based on her weight. When asking about scents within the Amazon comments I was told to order a size down from what you would normally. I was super confused so I ordered a size 2 thinking they were going to be horribly big. The size 2 I would say was a bit small but they still fit and did not leak! It looked like she was wearing standard underwear! I was able to use up the whole box before ordering a size 3 which I feel is a better fit. If you're looking for a great option in place of bamboo nature I would definitely say take a chance. They are so much more cost effective and I am still taking care of my baby girl by choosing high quality materials I feel she is safe wearing. You won't be sorry giving these a chance! I bet they will become your new favorite as they have for me.",
