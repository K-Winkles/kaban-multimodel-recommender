The 1st layer is a soft airy surface, an airy wavy mesh enhances breathability, allowing air to pass through to the 2nd absorbent layer, and then air passes to the 3rd all around breathable sheet layer. Breathability that removes moisture and stuffiness is so important!",
            "Ultra-soft, fluffy and breathing: air soft surface contains 2 convex shapes: large and small. Large convex shape allows quickly absorb pee and poo, while small convex shape is intended for preventing spreading of poo around diaper. Both side parts are made of multiple fine waves(=convex-concave)! The wavy surface reduces the skin contact area so that it does not stick to baby's skin! Newly mounted on center part's volume-absorbent zone!",

The corners are rounded and made of a soft material that is gentle and does not scratch the baby's skin. When the strips change color to dark blue, it is time to change the diaper! There's no design around the strips, making it easy to see when the color changes. Merries diapers come in a bundle with Americas Toys branded wipes."
