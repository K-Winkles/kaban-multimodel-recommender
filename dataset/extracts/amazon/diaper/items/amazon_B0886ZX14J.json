                "media_text": "Not Alone If your child wets the bed they\u2019re not alone. Five to seven million kids in the U.S. alone wet the bed some nights or most nights. And, although challenging, bedwetting is normal in child development and simply a part of growing up for many kids. Common Causes of Bedwetting Your child could just be a deep sleeper and not awaken to the sign of a full bladder.Their bladder may be too small to hold urine through the night, or communication between the brain and bladder is still developing.Constipation can put pressure on your child\u2019s bladder and lead to problems both holding and emptying urine.Mild illness or stress in your child\u2019s life can cause them to wet the bed, or it could be related to a family history of bedwetting. Tips for Managing Bedwetting Be honest\u2014Remember it\u2019s not your child\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just a normal part of some kids\u2019 development. So be honest with your child and let them know it\u2019s not their fault, and they\u2019ll most likely outgrow it soon.Stay positive\u2014Be sensitive to your child\u2019s feelings and offer support. If you don\u2019t make a big deal about it, chances are they won\u2019t either.Note habits & set a routine\u2014Be aware of your child\u2019s daily urine and bowel habits. Limit large amounts of fluids (especially sugary and carbonated drinks) before bed and have your child use the toilet right before getting into bed. If possible wake your child 1\u20132 hours after going to sleep to go again.Protect their bed\u2014Even under the best circumstances, accidents aren\u2019t always preventable. And when they do happen, nighttime protective underwear like Ninjamas help keep your child and their bed dry while controlling urine odor. When to See Your Doctor Bedwetting is a common childhood issue, but below are some instances when you may want to talk with your doctor. Your child has been completely toilet trained for 6 months and starts wetting the bed.While urinating, your child experiences pain, burning, or strain, or dribbles after urination.You notice your child\u2019s urine is cloudy or pink, or they have bloodstains on their underwear.Your child has both daytime and nighttime wetting or has poor bowel control.",

                "media_text": "FAQ's What sizes do Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear come in? Ninjamas are available in sizes S/M and L/XL. S/M fits children 38\u201370 lb. (17\u201332 kg), and L/XL fits children 64\u2013125 lb. (29\u201357 kg). What causes bedwetting? Bedwetting is common in childhood development. It affects 5\u20137 million children in the U.S. alone. The causes of bedwetting vary from child to child, but the most common cause is normal bladder development. To better understand your child's bedwetting, talk with your child\u2019s nurse or pediatrician. Is there a difference in the protection provided in the pink and green packs of Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear? Both the green and pink Ninjamas packs feature the same superior overnight absorbency with Pampers Lockaway Channels. The only difference is the nighttime underwear designs offered in each pack. So no matter which designs your child prefers, they\u2019ll wake up feeling Ninjawesome! How do Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear absorb wetness? Absorbent gelling material (AGM) is widely used in bedtime underwear padding to absorb wetness and lock it away. It is perfectly normal to see some gel on the skin from time to time, especially if the bedtime underwear is heavily saturated. It can easily be removed by wiping your child's skin. This material has a long history of safe use in a variety of products and has been in Pampers products for more than a decade.",

With ninjamas he has only leaked out once and we just finished our second box. It\u2019s been about 75 days and I\u2019ve only had to wash wet sheets on one occasion. They are much softer than other pull-ups brands and they have a fresh light powder smell that is nice and not overpowering. I rate these 99.8/100. My kid has been in disposable butt covers for 8 years and these are the top of the line. They are also a little cheaper than the good nites brand.",

Took a chance to give these a try (seen a lot of reviews stating they suck ) but I\u2019d figure I\u2019d try for myself since these were a bit cheaper this time around than my usual brand I bought the large and find they fit the same as goodnites size large for my son. Have only been using a week now but no leaks so I\u2019m extremely happy with them - I would buy again if I need too and only if they\u2019re cheaper than the other ones since nowadays with most of us it\u2019s all about saving money(or it is with me anyways with all the price gouging going on ) only thing I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THESE AND ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BREAKER IS THE DESIGNS AND COLORS \u2014 quite ugly for a boy actually . Kinda pinkish greenish Color\u2019s are the ones I received , but that\u2019s nitpicking to me . They are soft and do have a light scent to them as well. Which I don\u2019t mind scented diapers as it doesn\u2019t affect my kids any and helps keep the pee smell down a tad but not much) however some people may not like that feature .",
