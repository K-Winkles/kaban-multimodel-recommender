She did everything with gusto and jumped and splashed and pulled on everything.I was impressed at the pool\u2019s durability. I originally used a car air compressor to blow it up and then bought an electric air pump as a precaution thinking I would have to keep inflating. But I did not need it. It was used two months with no problems. The sprinkler was a big hit with all three.The Candy Zone pool was placed on a patio under a deck on a mat so sun really did not hit it. I liked the two drainage holes but needs to have bottom raised to let water drain out. I will look into getting a couple short pieces of hose or tubing to drain next year. I pd.$88 which I thought was too much. But since we were Covid home bound figure that was a bargain for so much fun outdoor entertainment for three kids. Really happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "These are so much better than the Huggies brand. I found that the huggies brand do not hold any liquid in at all which I understand to a point because they are made for swimming but it would be frustrating if we put them on and my son would pee before we got to the pool because the pee would just run down his leg all over the place. The Pampers brand however does hold a bit of urine in them. The pampers brand also hold up a lot better than other brands I\u2019ve used, other brands tend to rip easily as you pull them on where these don\u2019t. I love these and will continue to purchase these and recommend them to everyone I know with little ones.",

Keep the #2 in them if it happens while she is in the pool. Worth the premium price for the comfort and quality vs store brands. Recommend to all parents of water-loving little ones.",

We use our for weekly swim classes. Don't count on these for full absorbency - they don't hold that much and aren't thickly lined. If you're planning a day at the pool or on the beach make sure you're prepared for multiple changes. These aren't going to last long. They do the job for short duration pool excursions.",
