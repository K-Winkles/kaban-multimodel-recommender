            "Exceptional quality: only top-quality materials are used for the production of Japanese pull-ups. Therefore, the cases of diaper rash or dermatitis are especially rare even through the baby's skin is sensitive. An exceptional feature of Japanese diaper pants \u2013 they have no \"chemical\" odor which becomes especially pungent when diapers are full!",
            "Closer to nature: Merries pants are manufactured using only ecologically clean and safe materials which do not contain formaldehyde, phthalates or petroleum-based products! Merries pull ups do not contain lotions, fragrances or synthetic aromas!",
            "Reduce stuffiness - one factor of skin irritation: the fabric includes a 3-layer air-through system. The 1st layer is a soft airy surface, an airy wavy mesh enhances breathability, allowing air to pass through to the 2nd absorbent layer, and then air passes to the 3rd all around breathable sheet layer. Breathability that removes moisture and stuffiness is so important!",
            "Ultra-soft, fluffy and breathing: air soft surface contains 2 convex shapes - large and small. Large convex shape allows quickly absorb pee and poo, while small convex shape is intended for preventing spreading of poo around diaper. Both side parts are made of multiple fine waves(=convex-concave)! The wavy surface reduces the skin contact area so that it does not stick to baby's skin! Newly mounted on center part's volume-absorbent zone!",
            "Size of disposable diaper pants: as you have seen from product pictures, there are many sizes available just in Merries brand. As babies grow, their postures and skeletal structures change. Also, the amount of urine increases and the state of stools changes too. That's why, as the size of the disposable pull ups gets bigger, not only do the length and width increase, but the dimensions and shape of the absorber change too. Merries pants come in a bundle with Americas Toys branded wipes."
        ],
        "description": "INSPIRED \"Merries\" comes from the English word \"merry\", which means cheerful and smiley. It is also inspired from the musical merry-go-round mobile hung above babies' cribs to make them smile 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Merries wants babies to be happy, comfortable, and smiling. We believe that the happy times which happy babies and happy parents spend together are vital to the baby's growth and development. Merries will constantly innovate to help parents enjoy their child-raising years and ensure that their babies live as happily and comfortably as possible.FEATURES:NEW TECHNOLOGY! Stretches 2.5 times more compared to before stretching (according to KAO research)Super absorbent, highly breathable and ultra-soft so your active baby stays dry and comfortable! Instantly draws in and locks away pee, leaving the diaper surface drier for longer usage!The polymers in Merries diapers can absorb up to 200 - 300 times the weight of fluid relative to its weight. You can have a peace of mind even on mornings when your baby has peed a lot overnight! The wavy surface traps and holds poo! The recessed areas of the soft sheet effectively trap the soft poo and prevent it from dispersing. Block leakage with double gathers! 3D side gather prevents side leakage. Back gathers for a snug fit helps avoid leakage for S, M, L, XL sizes. . When the strips change color to dark blue, it is time to change the diaper! There's no design around the strips, making it easy to see when the color changes. The corners are rounded and made of a soft material that is gentle and does not scratch the baby's skin. And the reusable seal is so convenient!.Gathers around the legs. Fits perfectly around baby's legs!Fit snugly in all positions, stretch gently around your baby's waist.No red marks or abrasions at the crotch area!",
