                "reviewText": "These diapers are very absorbent, soft, and don\u2019t have any harsh scents. We had originally been using pampers, but after about 2 days our baby developed a bad diaper rash. We decided to switch to the regular newborn Huggies Little Snugglers, which helped the diaper rash, but every time our baby would pee the diaper had an odd and strong chemical smell. When we switched to these (Huggies Special Delivery), all of our problems resolved! We really like that these diapers are plant based and have no chemical smells. We also really like the absorbency because they keep baby dry, helping to prevent rashes. The cute designs on the diapers were also a cute feature.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely love these! So far these diapers have been the best fitting ones for my son as they aren't too bulky in the middle and fit great around the legs. As I have used some other diapers by other big name brands that were too fitted and tight around the legs. So far the absorbency has been wonderful as well and my son pees a lot and they don't seem quite that full compared to others I've used. As for scent, they don't have a smell to them at all which is perfect for those who want fragrance free diapers. For me it doesn't really matter if they have a scent or not.",
