                "reviewText": "I am using this diaper for the hypoallergenic feature but it just doesn't have acceptable absorbency. I am so tired of the leaks! We used the regular 'day time' version of this diaper and had leaks at almost every single nap and bedtime. It was exceedingly frustrating to say the least! I left a review sharing that and was contacted by a Seventh Gen company rep. Unfortunately, she never mentioned that there is a night time version! So some time later I stumble upon this one on my own and give it a shot. I still have most of a case of the day time on hand so I'm using these only at nap and bed time (a fresh diaper before each). And I still have leak issues! It's not every day now, but this morning my son woke 2 painful hours early because he was laying in a giant puddle of pee! It seriously looked as if he didn't even have a diaper on and had just wet the bed. I also have issue with fit. You would think the size 4 night time would fit the same as the size 4 day time but it is noticeably tighter. And really, why do we need separate day time and night time versions? Shouldn't they all be maximum absorbency? One functioning version would be fine. The only reason my son is wearing these is because of an allergy issue. He wore the big brand diapers fine for two years and then suddenly developed an allergy. It was extremely rare that he would ever have a leak in one of those diapers. He is not an above average urinator. Why can't hypoallergenic diapers perform the same?!?! The Honest Co diapers were even worse than these.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't start using these on my daughter until she was close to 2, at which time the cloth system I'd been using on her at night began to repel water and I was unable to adequately strip all the inserts within a few tries. I gave up and switched to these for nights she was with my mom or going to the babysitter first thing the following morning. I also sent one with her to the babysitter's for her nap.They worked great. I have zero complaints. I don't remember them ever leaking. They never tore and I had no problems with the tabs. They fixed and adjusted well, she was always comfortable in them, and I liked knowing they were as green and nontoxic as disposables can get.This was the only brand of disposable diaper my daughter could wear without breaking out in horrible rashes. She has really sensitive skin, so even Seventh Generation gave her a rash if I kept her in them more than a week or so. Other diapers, one change and her poor bottom would blister up into what almost looked like boils.Seventh Generation overnight are not sold anywhere within 50 miles of where I live, that I could ascertain.",

They'd work well for during the day diapers (which is what I now use them for), but they cannot handle over night wetness. They usually leak badly by morning.HOWEVER, may be my son wets more than some kids. I have yet to find ANY overnight diaper that will actually keep him dry. I've been equally disappointed with every overnight diaper I've ever tried.My son goes to bed at 8PM. I wake him for a diaper change around midnight and put him on an overnight diaper. Otherwise he wakes in the middle of the night bc he's wet through. By the time he wakes for the day at 8am (a total of 8 hours in the overnight diaper), he's soaked through all the way to soaking his sheets. This is true of ANY overnight diaper I have tried and is not a problem specific to this brand.I still buy these diapers and do recommend them. They're a good diaper and are better for our environment.",
