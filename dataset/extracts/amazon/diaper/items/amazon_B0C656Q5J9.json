It\u2019s sturdy and the sides mostly bent out on their own for me without having to steam it. I still might put some blankets in it to shape it more but it might not need it and I still have plenty of time. For the review that said it didn\u2019t come with the diaper caddy, it does you just have to order that one. You can either order it with the diaper caddy or the milestone set. I saw in that review that they ordered the milestone set one. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t come with the diaper bag. So just be careful and read carefully before ordering. I however didn\u2019t want the milestone set because I saw another review that said the 1 month one says 1 months. So I\u2019m just going to order a separate milestone set. But I\u2019m in love. I can\u2019t wait till my little bundle of joy is here and I can really test it out!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Great Moses basket for diaper changes! The rope is soft but just the right amount of stiffness to maintain its shape it\u2019s definitely high enough on the sides to keep baby in without being too high to reach over. It does come folded and I would say you MUST STEAM IT to release the creases and help give it the right shape again. I do also love that it came in a big linen-feeling drawstring bag that would be great for storage between babies (if you\u2019re crazy like me and do this more than once\u2026 or twice). The pad sheet is suuuper soft and really pretty, and the waterproof lining is indeed fairly waterproof (I tested it) and seems high quality. The foam pad is around 2 inches thick if you steam it as well, you\u2019ll see it puff right back out as it does get pretty compressed during shipping. No weird/chemical smells at all. I threw the sheet and liner in the wash immediately after opening and they washed and dried beautifully on normal settings with no signs of wear. No loose threads to be seen on basket or linens. Delivery was super fast!",
