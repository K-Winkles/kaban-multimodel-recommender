The size 3 ranges 13 - 24 pounds - big range. I just have to keep 1 out against the other diapers and use when the time comes up. I don't think I will reorder, these are pricier than a major name brand diaper or pull up - I was wanting to save these for \"big girl\" potty training mentality. If I had gotten the size 4 it would have better fit my goal for introduction to potty training. They do say \"ulta thin\", so I cannot deduct stars for it being thin.",

Thickness they are similar to the leading brand and I found threes more absorbent than pull ups.

Plus the sticky tab makes this so much better during messy changes! 100% recommend, and will be ordering these from now on! Attached you\u2019ll find a 4/5T pull up next to the xl BaiBezi. They are a little shorter but I find the overall fit is better this way.",
