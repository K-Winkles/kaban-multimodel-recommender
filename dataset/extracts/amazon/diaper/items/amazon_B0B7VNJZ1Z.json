                "media_text": "Not Alone If your child wets the bed they\u2019re not alone. Five to seven million kids in the U.S. alone wet the bed some nights or most nights. And, although challenging, bedwetting is normal in child development and simply a part of growing up for many kids. Common Causes of Bedwetting Your child could just be a deep sleeper and not awaken to the sign of a full bladder.Their bladder may be too small to hold urine through the night, or communication between the brain and bladder is still developing.Constipation can put pressure on your child\u2019s bladder and lead to problems both holding and emptying urine.Mild illness or stress in your child\u2019s life can cause them to wet the bed, or it could be related to a family history of bedwetting. Tips for Managing Bedwetting Be honest\u2014Remember it\u2019s not your child\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just a normal part of some kids\u2019 development. So be honest with your child and let them know it\u2019s not their fault, and they\u2019ll most likely outgrow it soon.Stay positive\u2014Be sensitive to your child\u2019s feelings and offer support. If you don\u2019t make a big deal about it, chances are they won\u2019t either.Note habits & set a routine\u2014Be aware of your child\u2019s daily urine and bowel habits. Limit large amounts of fluids (especially sugary and carbonated drinks) before bed and have your child use the toilet right before getting into bed. If possible wake your child 1\u20132 hours after going to sleep to go again.Protect their bed\u2014Even under the best circumstances, accidents aren\u2019t always preventable. And when they do happen, nighttime protective underwear like Ninjamas help keep your child and their bed dry while controlling urine odor. When to See Your Doctor Bedwetting is a common childhood issue, but below are some instances when you may want to talk with your doctor. Your child has been completely toilet trained for 6 months and starts wetting the bed.While urinating, your child experiences pain, burning, or strain, or dribbles after urination.You notice your child\u2019s urine is cloudy or pink, or they have bloodstains on their underwear.Your child has both daytime and nighttime wetting or has poor bowel control.",

                "media_text": "FAQ's What sizes do Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear come in? Ninjamas are available in sizes S/M and L/XL. S/M fits children 38\u201370 lb. (17\u201332 kg), and L/XL fits children 64\u2013125 lb. (29\u201357 kg). What causes bedwetting? Bedwetting is common in childhood development. It affects 5\u20137 million children in the U.S. alone. The causes of bedwetting vary from child to child, but the most common cause is normal bladder development. To better understand your child's bedwetting, talk with your child\u2019s nurse or pediatrician. Is there a difference in the protection provided in the pink and green packs of Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear? Both the green and pink Ninjamas packs feature the same superior overnight absorbency with Pampers Lockaway Channels. The only difference is the nighttime underwear designs offered in each pack. So no matter which designs your child prefers, they\u2019ll wake up feeling Ninjawesome! How do Ninjamas Nighttime Underwear absorb wetness? Absorbent gelling material (AGM) is widely used in bedtime underwear padding to absorb wetness and lock it away. It is perfectly normal to see some gel on the skin from time to time, especially if the bedtime underwear is heavily saturated. It can easily be removed by wiping your child's skin. This material has a long history of safe use in a variety of products and has been in Pampers products for more than a decade.",

Pampers never really held in the pee that great & even though the weight range should have fit her they were too tight. And unfortunately they only go up to a certain size & that\u2019s it.These pull ups are amazing!! They fit her soooo much better. She\u2019s in a 7/8 clothes & the small in this size is perfect. They also hold the pee much better. Rarely does it leak out & to me they also seem a lot softer. Would definitely recommend. Switch now!!!",

                "reviewText": "My 6-year old still experiences bed-wetting and as we all know: larger kids = larger pees. She was wearing a 6T overnight pull-up and we kept experiencing leaks that were frustrating for both of us. We tried the \u201cPeejamas\u201d and what a disappointment. Loads of laundry, loads of embarrassment. Enter the Ninjamas! These things DO NOT LEAK. If it weren\u2019t so gross, I\u2019d share a picture of her diaper from last night. She\u2019s been sick and sleeping really deeply and it was completely full but did not leak into her pajamas or the bed. They\u2019re amazing!!",
