                "reviewText": "After trying many diapers for nighttime use including 2 other brands nighttime diapers, I tried these. They actually worked. Prior to buying these, I was having to do a middle of the night change due to a leaky diaper at least 3-4 nights a week. This meant changing the diaper, the pajamas, the sleep sack, and the sheets. This also meant a very awake and very unhappy baby. I saw that I could order these in her size and we have not had a diaper leak yet (one week in). Our baby has extremely full diapers in the morning and she is a very active sleeper but these have not leaked once or caused a rash. They stay in place because of the extra Velcro like secure on the tab and the elastic back waistband. They are almost like a cross between the little movers and a night time diaper. Highly recommend to anyone having multiple leaky diapers a week.",
