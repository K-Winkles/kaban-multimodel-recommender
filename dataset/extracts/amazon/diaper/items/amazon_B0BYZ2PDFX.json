First off, the sizing was larger compared to the size 4 diapers I usually get.The top of the diaper, where the straps and the front cross over, is just more material than other diapers I\u2019ve used. I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of it, and it didn\u2019t seem to add any benefit or security. It honestly looked more bothersome.Also, maybe because it was bigger, it just didn\u2019t fit as snuggly around my sons legs, and I felt the diaper sagged more.It seems decently absorbent. And they are soft. But kid of a lot of money for a smaller count of diapers, and I didn\u2019t just love them.My son doesn\u2019t have any skin sensitivities though, so maybe for some these would be worth it.",

Normally I would purchase either the big box brands or the typical brand name ones since that's what I'm used to after a few kids but was curious to try something out of my comfort zone. These diapers are very soft and for someone who may be new or experienced may even consider them flimsy. They are flimsy but don't let that fool you in that they are absorbent. We use them as nighttime diapers and due to our laziness sometimes we don't change our little one until sometime after we are awake and it's kinda funny how big they get. Anyway I'm surprised about them and they're great for packing on the go since they feel lighter than others but that could just be me",

This diaper per count was the most expensive even before if signing up for any repeat/subscription program. This diaper was also widest in the groin area - and had less \"V\" shape to taper wider for around the waist - so my worry was leakage so wore these only during the day or when not expecting a bigger deposit in the diaper. This diaper also had the weakest, loosest elastic for the leg/groin area and with being wider and not a \"V\" shape this fell 4th on my review to the bottom. Only because of my comparison before use was I aware of the risk areas to even give it a 3 star rating.",

They're extremely soft and light on the skin which is another plus. The size seems a tad larger than the American counter part.Quality:Soft material, really really absorbent insert that locks in the liquid without any issue. Stretches fine and sticks on tight, thinner than big name brands.Price:At the time of this review, it is priced at 36c each or $27 for a pack of 74. The price here is a bit cheaper than our local big box store when they are regularly priced, competitive but we usually buy bulk when they are on sale, so it might be a good option if we ran low. The diaper market is just so competitive here.",
