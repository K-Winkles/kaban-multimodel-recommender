It typically goes away in time, as hormone levels adjust & the bladder grows. What are Goodnites? Goodnites are disposable nighttime underwear specifically designed to fit & provide protection for children who only wet at night. Goodnites even come in an XS size for children who are potty trained, but still experiencing nighttime wetness. Should you talk to your doctor about bedwetting? Yes, it\u2019s important to speak with your child\u2019s doctor & figure out the best management program for your family. Be sure to include your child, too. When kids hear they\u2019re not alone, it instills confidence & understanding about the condition. Why should I choose Goodnites Nighttime Underwear instead of training pants? While Pull-Ups are ideal for potty training, Goodnites are best for nighttime protection. Our small sizes provide a better fit and offer 40% more protection that the leading training pants, so even when lying down kids are less likely to leak. What advice do you have for parents? Trust yourself and don\u2019t put too much pressure on how you think it\u2019s supposed to go. Every child is different. If your little one is still wet at night, just know you are not alone and it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about - they will grow out of it!",
