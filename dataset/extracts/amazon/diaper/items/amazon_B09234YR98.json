                "reviewText": "Literally the BEST diapers I have ever used! We\u2019ve tried other brands and nothing compares to Believe! They don\u2019t leak at all, they don\u2019t make my daughter have a diaper rash and they are so soft and comfy. I love how they fit a bigger in size than Huggies or Pampers which makes more room for her chunky legs and tummy without having her feeling squeezed or causing leaks or diaper rash. We subscribed to a subscription via their website and got a free pack of wipes with every order. Great value for the money!! Also I love how Believe company donates diapers to families in need with every purchase. Great cause and outstanding product! Will forever be a customer!",

We literally just changed him and we\u2019re carrying him around and pee gushed right out the side. It\u2019s something about the future around the leg is absolutely terrible! They are soft and non toxic which is great! Don\u2019t waste your money on these! Joonya is the only non toxic diaper that seems to work for my son!",

                "reviewText": "Two kids and 20 diaper brands later, I found these and they are absolute luxurious heaven. They are So Soft, lightweight but durable. No leakage yet, even when my little had diarrhea. The diapers also don\u2019t smell either (some all natural diapers amplify the pee smell). I love that these are an all natural brand with stellar functionality. I cannot say enough positive things about them.",
