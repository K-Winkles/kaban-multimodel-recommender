                "reviewText": "I absolutely loved these diapers when I had my daughter. I would tell everyone who would listen how amazing these diapers are. I had given a bag to my sister for my nephew and she complained of leaks. I didn't know what she was talking about about because I never had any problems with my daughter. However years later, I now have a boy. I usually just bought Huggies because they were cheap. Last month these had an amazing deal so I bought them and to my surprise, almost every time my son pees, they leak. I think maybe because the diapers carry it differently for boys. He is older so I would think he also has higher volumes than say, a newborn. So if you have a girl, I highly recommend. However if you have a boy, have a few back up pairs of pants.",

It was with 2 of the packs and it started with a new design and box, so I thought this is the new\u2026.But to my delight the 3rd pack was the tried and true perfect fit and dependability, that I look forward to in honest. Theses never leave rashes and severe irritation. It looks slightly like burns like a chemical burn on my child. I have use this brand for I don\u2019t even know how many years I just I\u2019m so thrilled that they continue to make such a high-quality product that doesn\u2019t have chlorine bleach in the lining that burns the bottom of my child practically say goodbye to diaper bomb not saying it\u2019s not needed at times but these cut down on rashes from urine burn",

They seem to twist and would probably leak if she were to be peeing more at night. She also finds them less comfortable, always saying something hurts or is scratchy.They\u2019re cute and she does like the graphics.",
