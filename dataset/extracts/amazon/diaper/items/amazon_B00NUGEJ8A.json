The elastic is durable, it wont come out if you pull it strong ( i have a giggle baby that wont let me put the diper at the first try) , easy to use. No real dioer rash or allergy to baby, i can tell you for me it was a winner but the price compared to other brands its higher and for economy i went to a cheaper one in bulk.",
