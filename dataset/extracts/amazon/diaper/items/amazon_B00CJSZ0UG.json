She only wears diapers at night, and sleeps a solid 12 hours, but I've never experienced leaks or anything. I moved her to these size 5's and they are trash. I've used the \"nonprinted\" diapers many times previously, but these are like thin cheap paper. When I got her up in the morning, the pee had collected in a ball between her legs that she could literally shake back and forth...not to mention she had pee all over her jammies. So needless to say, these diapers are awesome until you get to size 5.",
