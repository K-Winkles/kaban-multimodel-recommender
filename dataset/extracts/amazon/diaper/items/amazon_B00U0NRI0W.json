It typically goes away in time, as hormone levels adjust & the bladder grows. What are Goodnites? Goodnites are disposable nighttime underwear specifically designed to fit & provide protection for children who only wet at night. Goodnites even come in an XS size for children who are potty trained, but still experiencing nighttime wetness. Should you talk to your doctor about bedwetting? Yes, it\u2019s important to speak with your child\u2019s doctor & figure out the best management program for your family. Be sure to include your child, too. When kids hear they\u2019re not alone, it instills confidence & understanding about the condition. Why should I choose Goodnites Nighttime Underwear instead of training pants? While Pull-Ups are ideal for potty training, Goodnites are best for nighttime protection. Our small sizes provide a better fit and offer 40% more protection that the leading training pants, so even when lying down kids are less likely to leak. What advice do you have for parents? Trust yourself and don\u2019t put too much pressure on how you think it\u2019s supposed to go. Every child is different. If your little one is still wet at night, just know you are not alone and it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about - they will grow out of it!",

                "reviewText": "I have 2 autistic children that have been quite hard to potty train. They are now 9 years old, and I finally got one trained, but the other still needs to wear something. Well since he is 9 years old, regular diapers won\u2019t fit him, and he\u2019s still too small to wear adult diapers, so these perfectly fit the bill! They are on the pricey side compared to diapers, but they are WELL worth it. These have soft stretchy sides that do not tear easily\u2026 there are no diaper tabs to come loose\u2026 they fit basically like underwear. But they are SUPER absorbent and have yet to leak in all the years I\u2019ve been using them. There\u2019s no gross plastic covering either like diapers, they are very breathable. Also another thing to mention, they don\u2019t have those weird strings in them that are inside regular diapers. Autistic boys like to constantly rub themselves for some reason, and it causes diapers to break down and some kind of stringy things get wrapped around their genitals and it seems very dangerous. But that is NOT a problem with these. These just have soft cotton inside.I absolutely LOVE the new sizing of these as well. One of my twins is very overweight for his age, and the new XL size came out just in time to meet his needs until I got him trained. These can be worn under clothes and they\u2019re not big and bulky at all. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "My son is 3 & still in diapers, but *almost* ready to potty train. He outgrew his trusty size 6 Hello Bello Night diapers, but nothing I tried seemed to compare. We tried Ninjamas first; I loved the softness, fit, and how high up they went. Unfortunately, he pees right out the side of them. I\u2019ve gotten Good Nights before and love how they fit, but hated them because he always leaked! Turns out, all we needed was a good booster pad.He\u2019s 34 lbs and wears 3t & some 4T clothing. The XS is actually a little big in his waist, but it still works. Adding a good booster pad helps it fit better. For some reason I ordered size Small last time, and they ALSO worked with a pad. I even put these on him for long car rides and naps, and so far he hasn\u2019t had any accidents.They\u2019re not as soft as other diapers, but they\u2019re not as scratchy or rough as Pull-Ups brand. They fit like underwear and are easy enough for him to pull on and off himself. Occasionally I rip one while pulling it on, but it\u2019s not as often as Pull-Ups brand.Get these and the Good Nights booster pad inserts!! For extra protection at night, I use Super Sposies. Both work great but the Good Nights pads fit these perfectly.Hope this helps \u263a\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "We are incredibly grateful for the availability of the extra larger size in Goodnites, as it has allowed our son to continue using these convenient products rather than moving on to larger, bulkier adult options. The absorbency and standing gathers in these underwear have been effective in managing his high urine output during the day and preventing leaks between cathing.However, we have faced occasional nighttime leaks, requiring us to change him before we go to bed or switch to a more absorbent product for the night. One notable drawback is the difficulty of removing these for catheterization or changing when on the go, and they can tear when seated in a wheelchair. We've found that with Pull-Ups or briefs, we can open and fold them down when using adaptive side-zipping pants, which is a more accessible option.It would be a welcome improvement if Goodnites could incorporate hoot-and-loop sides, similar to Pull-Ups, to address these challenges. This adjustment would not only make catheterization and changing more manageable but also eliminate the need to remove shoes and pants, streamlining the process for caregivers and users alike.",
