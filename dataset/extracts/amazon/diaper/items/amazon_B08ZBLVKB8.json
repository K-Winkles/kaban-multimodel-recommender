                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve done my research in diapers and have went through thousands of diapers at this point of many different brands. From Coterie to Nest to All Good diapers - just to name a few.What caught my attention in a good way with Coterie diapers is that their safety report was posted publicly online for everyone to see. Thinking that all diaper brands should at least provide that documentation if asked - I emailed Ecoriginals.Their response was less than helpful, a little off putting even. They responded to my request with all of the ingredients that they have written word for word on their website. But no safety report. When I brought to their attention that that is specifically what I would like to see, it was all crickets. Not a single response back. So of course as a parent, that brings some concern that a company that prides themselves on being so \u201copen and honest,\u201d cannot provide a safety report of what their diapers are tested for.If that is not a cause for alarm for you, then here are some pros and cons I\u2019ve observed in the past few months of use:Pros-Generally quick in absorbing-Great for sensitive skin (LO has really sensitive skin and this diaper has been one of the best in that space.)-Plain design (won\u2019t really show through clothing)-Stays on fairly well once on-One of the softer diapers on the market-Thick-No dyes or coloring-Pretty soft for a diaper (Some other brands are like sand paper. This one feels cushiony.)Cons-The tabs to close the diaper get loose very easily-Can leak if wearing a onsie (Prepare an outfit change.)-Thick is good but also means super hot in the summer.-No blue line to indicate wetness (this may also be a pro however as no inks are used then for that purpose.)-Not transparent about their safety report ***I hope this review helps you figure out if this is the right diaper for you!",

                "reviewText": "I really liked these diapers for functionality and quality but I was only willing to pay such a premium for them because they claimed to be made in New Zealand. Once we received the diapers it says clearly on the package: package made in New Zealand, Diapers made in China. Given the number of eco friendly brands that cost less and don\u2019t mislead the customer about where their product is made I wasn\u2019t willing to pay the higher cost to reorder. They are great diapers though. If cost is not an issue for these then I would recommend these.",
