If the fit is snug or if your baby is between sizes, we recommend sizing up (which will also provide extra absorbency). For additional sizing guidance, please refer to our sizing chart. Where are Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers made? Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers are made in the USA. What does \u201czero waste to landfill facility\u201d mean? Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers are produced in a zero waste to landfill facility. This means that none of the waste that occurs during the production of our diapers is sent to a landfill. The waste is typically reused or recycled. How often should I change my baby's diaper? Diapers should be changed whenever baby has peed or pooped; the wetness indicator lets you know when baby is wet. A good rule is to change every 2-3 hours. This includes before or after feedings or naps, right before bedtime and when baby wakes up.",

Then I wanted to save money and went with Costco brand. Then I wanted to save MORE money and tried out this brand. And I\u2019m not disappointed. I\u2019m actually highly impressed. These diapers hold A LOT, and they are great quality for the price. Now these aren\u2019t going to have all the extras on them like the leading brands - no designs and no crazy textures and cushion. They\u2019re plain and simple. They feel thin but don\u2019t let that fool you, they\u2019re absorbent. There have been 2 occasions where I get a bit of a faulty batch, but I\u2019ve been using these for almost a year. Yes these on occasion have had little bits of the silica leak out on the skin. But it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as the expensive name brands I\u2019ve tried. And the diaper has to be mega wet for silica to possibly start showing. I\u2019m talking like being on for 12 hours wet. I feel like there has been less leaks in this diaper brand too. No nasty added fragrance which is a huge bonus. Didn\u2019t have any skin breakouts with these. If you\u2019re looking for a diaper that is straight to the point and a great price, these are the ones. I definitely recommend these to everyone, wish I knew about this brand sooner!!",

                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5 stars)I've been using Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers for the past two years, and I can confidently say they are some of the best diapers on the market. These diapers have been a lifesaver for our family, offering both high quality and affordability.High Quality and Leak-Proof: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50The most important aspect of any diaper is its ability to keep your little one dry and comfortable, and Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers excel in this department. In two years of consistent use, we've only experienced one episode of leaking, and that was during an overnight sleep period when our son ate an excessive amount of watermelon. Even then, the leak was minimal, and it was more of an exception than the rule.These diapers are designed with a gentle touch in mind, providing a soft and comfortable fit for our baby's delicate skin. The stretchy sides and adjustable tabs ensure a snug fit, preventing any unwanted leaks during the day or night. The diaper material itself is absorbent and keeps moisture away from our baby's skin, reducing the chances of diaper rash.Affordable Price: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50One of the standout features of Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers is their affordability. While some diaper brands can break the bank, these diapers offer high-quality performance at a fraction of the cost of many competitors. As parents, we appreciate the opportunity to save money without sacrificing quality, and Mama Bear delivers on this front.Reliable Performance: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Reliability is key when it comes to diapers, and Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers consistently perform. Whether it's during playtime, naptime, or a full night's sleep, we can trust these diapers to keep our little one dry and comfortable. This reliability has allowed us to worry less about diaper changes and focus more on enjoying precious moments with our child.Recommendation: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I cannot recommend Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers enough. These diapers have been a constant companion in our parenting journey for two years, and their high quality, affordability, and reliability have made them a staple in our household. I would wholeheartedly recommend them to any friend or family member looking for a diaper that delivers on all fronts. Mama Bear has truly impressed us with their Gentle Touch Diapers, and we wouldn't dream of switching to any other brand.",

                "reviewText": "We've purchased these diapers on several occasions and found them to be a solid choice, especially considering their price point. While my preference leans slightly towards Target's diapers for regular use, these have been a convenient and reliable option for online ordering.One of the standout features of these diapers is their durability. We've had no issues with leaks, which is a significant win in the world of toddler care. They've also kept up with our daughter's movements, providing comfort without compromising on protection.Another aspect worth noting is their gentle nature. Our daughter didn't experience any rashes or redness, suggesting that these diapers might be a good fit for those in need of hypoallergenic options. However, I always advise reading the product details thoroughly to ensure they align with your child's specific needs and sensitivities.If you're in the market to try a new diaper brand, these diapers are worth considering. They strike a balance between quality and cost, coupled with the convenience of online availability. Just remember, as with any product for your little one, a quick check of the product specifications is always prudent to ensure it's the right fit for your family.",

These fit him well, he hasn't gotten a reaction from them, they don't have a funny smell, they're a good price. Only problem is about 5-10 out of the box will have a defect. Usually still wearable though.",

                "reviewText": "Mama Bear diapers are amazing. My baby's skin is so sensitive that rashes last for months. I have tried every brand for her. You name it, and I have tried it. However, after wearing Mama Bear diapers, she has never had rashes. The diapers are extremely soft and absorbent, and I use the same diaper as nightdiaper, even no rashes so far. It is just right for me in terms of price. I highly recommend Mama Bear diapers to anyone looking for a gentle and absorbent diaper for their child. It's a great product and the price is also very reasonable. I have been using it for over a month now, and I plan to keep using it!",
