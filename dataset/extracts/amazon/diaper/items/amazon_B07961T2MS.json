                "reviewText": "Sorry for the long review!! I had a hard time figuring out what size to order, so I hope this helps someone.....In short: these are great swim diapers that work better when they fit snugly. The style is very similar to Pampers 360s; the sides are the same and rip easily at the seams when you need to remove them, but they\u2019re a little more fitted and not as tall in the waistband. They have the same coverage as 360s in the back. I had no idea what size to order, since my kiddo normally wears a larger size than the suggested weight guides on the box.For size reference: he\u2019s almost 2, about 29 lbs & wears 3T clothing. In diapers, he wears size 6 Pampers 360s, and size 7 Huggies Little Movers. First I ordered Large, and after a week of wearing those, we sized down and ordered Medium.Size Large fits exactly how I like his regulars diapers to fit, but in water they get really water-logged and start slipping down too much (hello, baby plumber butt \ud83c\udf51). It\u2019s better when a swim diaper fits snugly, so the Mediums are perfect. They aren\u2019t too tight in the leg openings and don\u2019t leave any red marks...Compared to Huggies Little Swimmers, these are way softer and don\u2019t have scratchy velcro sides. I think these are much easier to pull up, especially when your little one is wet or has sunscreen on. Huggies look more like pull-ups and these fit more like a slip-on diaper.I\u2019m happy to report these work perfectly and don\u2019t fall apart, even after wearing one for 2+ hours in the pool. If you\u2019re unsure what size to get, SIZE DOWN from what you think you need. They stretch a lot, but if they\u2019re too big you\u2019ll be squeezing buckets full of water (or pee) out of them.Not the BEST diaper to use for regular wear or when dry. They don\u2019t absorb urine, so it just collects & pours out. Haven\u2019t had any #2 accidents in the water yet, but i don\u2019t expect to see any escapees.I highly recommend them!*MOM HACK: Since these aren\u2019t great for holding pee when dry, I found a great solution when you have to drive to a pool or beach. Simply put a regular diaper on first, but don\u2019t tape it shut. Layer one of these over it. Dress as usual. When you get to the water, simply pull the regular diaper out! Voila!! Otherwise, if you putting this on or a 20 min car ride by itself, you\u2019ll have a VERY wet car seat.Hope this helps! Happy swimmin\u2019! \ud83d\udca6",

                "reviewText": "I used these with my son 6 years ago, and am using them again with my 9 month old.They don\u2019t absorb too much of the swimming water and seem to get a lot of the urine to absorb. But the biggest concern of any parent with a non potty trained child in a swimming pool is not pee, it\u2019s the #2. This keeps it in! It\u2019s happened several times while they\u2019re wearing these and Nothing comes out. It stays in so we\u2019ll, sometimes we didn\u2019t even know it had happened.The washable baby swim diapers work well too, but I stopped using them after the first time a #2 happened, because no one wants to clean that up and wash the diaper to use again. It\u2019s not worth the hassle.These are easy, dependable and not too $$. They are the only disposable swim diapers that I really trust.",

                "reviewText": "My 2 yr old made the biggest dump in these during swim lessons in a pool on at least 2 occasions and nothing came out of the diaper thankfully. However, the poop covered the entire inside from front to back when we finally took them off, so thankfully we were prepared with wipes to clean him down.The diapers will not absorb much liquid so if your kid pees in them it will leak out. These are really to catch poo.A few pro tips:- you can tell which is the front by checking for a little bow \u201ctied\u201d or laces (depending on the design) in the front waist.- to get them off, just tear the sides of the diaper open instead of pulling them down*I purchased this product with my own money and my review reflects my honest and unbiased opinion. I hope you find it helpful. Thanks for reading!",

Ojo no esperes ese material absorbente como el de un pa\u00f1al regular, es decir si lo trae pero en menos escala, yo dir\u00eda 1/3 del absorbente que trae un pa\u00f1al regular, y cuando lo vas a retirar procura hacerlo en un lugar donde puedas acostar a tu beb\u00e9, porque si lo retiras de pie estoy seguro que se puede escurrir, recuerda que este pa\u00f1al es para evitar que su interior salga a la alberca, lo cual cumplir\u00e1 perfectamente ya que sus resortes se ajustar\u00e1n perfectamente a sus piernas. Le\u00ed notas aqu\u00ed mismo que dec\u00edan que requieren entre 3 y 5 pa\u00f1ales por d\u00eda, yo me arriesgue y solo compr\u00e9 un paquete para unas vacaciones de 5 d\u00edas y hasta me sobraron, en mi caso mi hija solo usamos la mitad del paquete, ya que si estamos en la alberca y era cuando los usaba, al salir le colocaba los regulares. Eso es digamos algo a considerar ya que asist\u00edamos a las albercas o mar 1 vez al d\u00eda o m\u00e1ximo 2 as\u00ed que por eso no necesite tantos como las notas dec\u00edan, porque repito no tienen la misma absorbencia que uno regular.",
