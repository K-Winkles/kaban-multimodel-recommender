They works great and do the dirty job! The smell still hits you in the face when you open the diaper pail to toss in another toxic waste load from our pretty baby, but both the name brand and off brands do this. I don\u2019t notice any odor when it is closed at all. I give it 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I first chose these diaper pail refills as a more cost-friendly option for my Diaper Genie diaper pail. This 4 pack equates to $0.01 per diaper held while the Diaper Genie brand equates to just over 2 cents per diaper held.After 3 children and years of diapers, we\u2019ve definitely come out ahead using these bags!! As a mom, I can't express how convenient and essential the ChoiceRefill Compatible with Diaper Genie Pails have been for me. This 4-Pack, 1080 Count set has made diaper disposal hassle-free. The compatibility with the Diaper Genie diaper pail is seamless, and the refill bags are easy to install.With four packs, I've had an ample supply that lasts a long time, reducing the need for frequent replacements. These refill bags effectively seal in odors, ensuring a fresh and clean nursery environment. It's a relief to know that I can dispose of diapers without any unpleasant smells lingering around.Overall, I highly recommend ChoiceRefill Compatible with Diaper Genie Pails to fellow parents. They are a cost-effective and odor-controlling solution for diaper disposal, making diaper changes a smoother experience.",
