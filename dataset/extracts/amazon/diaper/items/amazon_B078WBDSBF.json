        "description": "Potty-train like a hero with PJ Masks Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants. Featuring your favorite heroes Catboy, Owlette and Gekko, these super soft and comfy training pants fit just like real cotton undies with a 360 stretchy waistband that is gentle on your child\u2019s skin and easy to pull up and down. Plus, they\u2019re dermatologically tested, hypoallergenic, and free of parabens and latex.* That\u2019s just one of the many reasons Pampers is the #1 pediatrician recommended brand. When it comes to potty accidents, your toddler will be covered with up to 100% leakproof protection. To protect where leaks happen most, Easy Ups are made with Dual Leak-Guard Barriers around the leg cuffs while Extra Absorb Channels quickly absorb accidents and lock them away from your toddler's skin. And when it's time to take them off, Easy-Tear Sides make removal and disposal a cinch. Potty-training is a journey and can take your toddler 90 days on average to catch on. So, Pampers Easy Ups makes it easy with each box containing a one-month supply of training pants. Available in sizes 2T\u20133T (16\u201334 lb), 3T\u20134T (30\u201340 lb), 4T\u20135T (37+ lb) and 5T\u2013 6T (41+ lb).",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m officially in love with these pull-ups for my heavy-wetting 3 year old. We\u2019ve tried A LOT of diapers, slip-ons, and pull-ups. He\u2019s autistic and not exactly ready to fully potty train, but knows how to use his potty. We\u2019ve mainly been working on pulling these off and on so he can get the hang of it before wearing his boxer briefs full time. These aren\u2019t the softest material ever, but similar to other Pampers diapers. I think 360s might be a little softer. Compared to a 360, Easy Ups are a little shorter in height and not as thick\u2026 which makes them feel more like underwear. They\u2019re not as short as some training pants that claim to fit like underwear (like Pull-ups brand or Honest Company training pants\u2026 those show a lot of plumber booty!).He drinks like a fish, and luckily these hold a ton of liquid! The only time he leaked was when these were too small. I have to size up in order to prevent that. He\u2019s about 36.6 lbs and wears mostly 3T pants, some 4T PJs. The 4T-5T size fits perfectly.I forgot to change him into his night pull-up & booster pad the other night, but it was fine!! No leaks.He prefers these over every other diaper and pull-up he has\u2026 and that\u2019s saying a lot for a sensory kiddo!UPDATE: I\u2019m sad to say we had to switch to a Velcro pull-up for my son\u2019s developmental preschool. They prefer velcro so they don\u2019t have to remove his shoes. We found a GREAT alternative that doesn\u2019t itch like normal Pull-Ups\u2026 Huggies Pull-Ups New Leaf. Super soft and they have even more absorbency than these!Hope this helps! \u263a\ufe0f",
