I got the Amazon ones and while the smell doesn\u2019t come through the bag, the tension is wrong on the dispenser, a ton of bag is wasted because every time you shove a diaper in the genie more bag pulls out. I have never had that problem with these, they work perfectly and I am sure they are cheaper when you consider all of the bag you are not wasting. Also don\u2019t believe the lies that you can use normal garbage bags in them. 1. It is a pain to put in, 2. It does NOT hold the smell in, 3. You can\u2019t get the bag out once it\u2019s full because the bag fills to the shape of the container and you can\u2019t pull it through the opening at the top.",
