These diapers are so much soft the are cotton filled and not full of plastics and gel like the regular big name brands. I was using Costco diapers but I wanted a better cleaner more natural diaper. These do not have the line that shows when it's wet quite frankly I don't care or need it you can tell when it's wet the cotton will swell and it's obvious. They hold big blow outs better than those name brands, my daughter 6 months old now is sleeping 6 plus hrs because they hold so well at night and keep her dry. They also havnt not given her rashes I am sure uts because they are cotton. I LOVE these diapers and affordable to my for the fact that they are so much safer than those big brands. Try then you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I have four children and have used every brand of diapers under the sun- Pampers, Huggies, Luvs, Walmart brand, Kroger brand, CVS brand, Aldi brand, Hello Bello- to name a few. Of all these brands, this brand Pura is the most absorbent I have ever used. I used them for the first time with this purchase and they did not leak one time overnight, as nearly every other brand has. I only purchased them because I needed diapers delivered next day and these did so it was totally by chance I used them but I will almost solely rely on them because of how well they worked for overnight use on my children. (I have three under 3, two in diapers full time, one in diapers at night only). These truly were a game changer for night time, held up all night with no leaks. They are soft, comfortable and honestly well worth the money and I definitely am one to try and get the best deal on anything as a parent. Beyond pleased, highly recommend, new favorite diapers for my kids.",

                "reviewText": "I have used clean diapers for my 2 year old from the start but a lot of the brands have changed their ingredients and I searched and searched for a better option. I tried a ton of different brands and these are hands down the best. We had a ton of problems with leaks with other diapers but my son hasn't leaked once since we started these diapers. I was hesitant because I saw a few reviews stated that they don't have any absorbency and there were issues with leaking but we haven't had the same experience, these are the best! We started out with just using them overnight and they would be so full in the morning when my son would wake but the diapers hold up so well! They absorb everything and he isn't wet at all. After failing at trying to find a clean/non toxic diaper or even pull up that we loved we decided to use these during the daytime as well and we haven't looks back. They are the softest diapers we have tried as well. My son hasn't gotten any rashes with them either. Hands down the best we have tried. We are crossing our fingers the Pura training pants will be available in the US when we start potty training. Highly recommend these diapers!",

                "reviewText": "When my little girl was born we started to use Pampers swaddle. It worked well but it was smelling little chemical. Then I saw this brand. I thought it will be better because it says most of chemical free, cotton, no diaper rash... I used Pampers and Pura both to finish Pampers. I didn't see nothing different. After finished Pampers just I used Pura. And after 1-2 day I saw diaper rash on my little girls skin. I am using cream to heal them but nothing worked her skin has redness because of this diaper. It smells chemical still. Also I subscribed it. When the next delivery time came price increased almost 15$ suddenly. I canceled my subscription and also I won't use Pura anymore. It didn't work for me and was a bad experience. I don't suggest.",

Also they last through the night - no leaks :) they check all the boxes! I wish I had found them sooner! We did size up from the chart to be totally leak free.

They are so soft I joke and say that we are cloth diapering..but seriously it's like wrapping your baby's bum in a cloud! They do run a bit small so I would recommend buying a small pack and making sure the size is right. The diaper is a bit wider than a normal diaper so don't be a knucklehead make sure you apply and fasten it correctly. They are extremely absorbent so if leaks are happening, hate to say it but, user error. These diapers are honestly perfect. Not to be confused with honest brand diapers.
