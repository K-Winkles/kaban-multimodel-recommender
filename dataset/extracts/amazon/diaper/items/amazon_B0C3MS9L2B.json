The scrunch back of these held it in and the plain white style is so cute. They were good on her sensitive skin, and I really loved the wipes and the simple ingredients. The newborn size was perfect but I feel like the size 1s were really close in size to the newborn and she grew out of them so fast I had to give them away",

They run a tad bigger than the others. Seem comfy for baby. There\u2019s only been one \u201cpee out\u201d overnight, compared to multiple with other brands. I like the pure white look for my baby. My toddler prefers images, but no big deal. They give a military discount through their website, which is great! Love that quality. The only thing is if a wet-only diaper gets really full by the morning, the smell is a *little* funkier than with the other diapers, but not a real issue. She gets a new diaper, and that one goes in the pail.",

                "reviewText": "I love these diapers for my baby girl. They are incredibly soft and very absorbent. They mold to her body well and have never given her a diaper rash. I\u2019ve found that these diapers typically run a little larger than other brands, for example a size 2 in Dyper might be a size 3 in Honest. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I will start out saying these are a little pricey, but I knew our baby would need hypoallergenic disposables when she\u2019s not in cloth. No dyes; phlaytes, chlorine or other terrible chemicals. The inner is wood pulp, sustainably sourced I believe and so absorbent and bamboo outer is super soft. These are hands down the best disposable brand we\u2019ve encountered. Subscription service is handy and you get a slight discount I believe sometimes freebies for signing up. Adjustable dates and can return sizes that don\u2019t fit or unused packs. Overall these are the only ones I\u2019ve been completely satisfied. I love these, definitely worth a try. Sizes do run large ( 9lbs could have definitely used the size 1s instead of size 2; now 12-13lbs fitting right getting a little snug in size 2) I would size down 100% if you\u2019re on the fence. Compostable service if you\u2019re down to pay for the shipping. This company purchase carbon offsets which helps reduce the carbon footprint of lovely single use items such as disposable diapers (which there are plenty of in the world). Love the eco friendly, sensitive skin friendly vibes. I have to advocate for cloth diapers from an eco standpoint and would encourage any caregiver who feels up to the task to do the same, but for those times when I need it I use disposable for the sake of my sanity or drs visits, I use these.Tested against:Nest - great but could absorb as much as we needed so leaking happened on a few occasions towards her growing out of size 2 and $$$Bambo Love - leak problems, not a bamboo diaper apparently. Narrow fit; not wide enough for our babe",

                "reviewText": "I personally don\u2019t find these diapers to be very soft and they\u2019re rather bulky. They also have a tendency to wear down if worn without clothes. My daughter would crawl in her diapers and there would be bits of the diaper coming off from friction. The diapers are incredibly absorbent though. I would use them for overnight but during the day; I\u2019d pass on these diapers if you have a baby under 1. I think these are perfect diapers for toddlers though. My daughter never had blowouts with these diapers and no diaper rash. It really isn\u2019t worth their price- I\u2019d go with Honest Diapers instead but because they are bamboo and biodegradable; it makes the value a little more because you know you\u2019re helping the environment. I also live in Scottsdale where the DYPER is headquartered at so I like the idea of helping a local business\u2026 that being said I don\u2019t know if I will ever buy from them again",
