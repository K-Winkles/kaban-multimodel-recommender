                "reviewText": "TLDR: Super clean ingredients for baby. Free of the worst common diaper chemicals. Very environmentally friendly diaper and company. Absorbent, soft, and no blowouts yet! Cost is kinda high but you get what you pay for.I LOVE LOVE LOVE these diapers! We have never had a blowout with them yet (though we came close once) and they're super soft and absorbent. They can hold a LOT (though of course we try to change baby before it reaches that point). They're super soft and have never left scratches or friction burns.The company is super transparent and conscious about being good environmental stewards. It's great that the diapers themselves are at least 90% biodegradable (highest on the market). While the diapers themselves are not compostable, the packaging is compostable at home and made with paper and cornstarch but still effective for basic diaper protection. I love that the print (though minimal as is) is food-safe inks. I appreciate that they're carbon neutral, plant a tree each order, partner to remove existing waste, and have educational information on their website in easy to understanding language (which is SUPER nice when you're new to chemical free, lower petroleum, and eco-conscious baby products), and work to reduce plastic waste already produced.Most of all, I LOVE that everything touching my baby is completely natural products (non-petroleum and not synthetic)! The only polypropylene in the diaper is on the velcro band (which is as minimal as could be expected while remaining effective). All this while remaining effective. See company site for details.I have done extensive diaper researching for when we use disposables. We mostly cloth diaper, but we use disposables whenever we travel and the longest time straight has been about a month. Obviously the cost for these diapers is higher than most others, but it's a bit lower when you buy in bulk. That said, for us, it is absolutely worth it to know our baby isn't exposed to harmful chemicals and petroleum based products in the most sensitive areas. I think this is the only diaper I've seen that doesn't use petro-products for the legging cuffs (this uses cotton), even among other biodegradable brands. I can only compare to Bamboo Diapers (didn't like-leaked all the time) and Pampers, and these hold up to the latter on effectiveness while being cleaner ingredients and company by far!",

Until the size large were out of stock for months. I had no choice but to find something similar and I did when I came across Eco Boom. Then for a reason I cannot recall I was on the hunt again. These diapers were on sale and oh how I wish I had been able to purchase more because they are the best diaper I have ever put my hands on. The feel absolutely divine, almost too good to be something a little human poops on. I have had no issues with leaking and they hold pee just as well as the other bamboo diapers I have mentioned here. They are out of my price point but if I they ever go on sale again I will be back. If you can afford them, I highly recommend these diapers.",

Haven\u2019t had a blowout so far and I\u2019ve been through the entire package 10 out of 10 would recommend and definitely will be buying again. I also love the fact that there\u2019s no harsh chemicals or anything crazy that would affect my baby skin and long-term effects on the road as well.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted a \u201cnon toxic\u201d diaper but didn\u2019t want to fully commit to the cloth diaper route because I\u2019m a first time mom and truly just didn\u2019t know how realistic that aspiration was. These came highly recommended due to how natural and transparent the company is. I\u2019ve now tried over 100 of these diapers and while we have had blowouts (I\u2019ve never tried a diaper where blowouts weren\u2019t a thing), he\u2019s never leaked through these\u2014- not once! And he will sleep in this all night. Eventually he of course will want to get out of it, no baby likes a wet diaper, but I always had to worry about a leak with other diapers past a certain point at night. So that\u2019s really nice! A high-performing and natural diaper!!! I read here that someone said they start to disintegrate\u2026 I haven\u2019t had that problem. They aren\u2019t the softest diaper ever, but they don\u2019t irritate him at all. I also had an issue one time with a \u201cnatural\u201d diaper that would eventually start to get wet around the crotch area, as if the urine would seep through, but I haven\u2019t had that issue with these.",

                "reviewText": "These diapers are terrible. They fall off so easily, they leak, they can\u2019t make it overnight because they start to disintegrate, and they\u2019re green washed. They use \u201cEco\u201d to trick you into thinking they\u2019re good when in reality, they use ECF inner pulp which means it\u2019s elemental chlorine free, but bleached with chlorine dioxide instead which can still result in dioxins and furans. I got duped, writing this review hoping you don\u2019t fall for it. Buy Kudos, Andy Pandy, or Believe instead.",

                "reviewText": "These are great diapers. I love that they're biodegradable. They have a slightly bigger profile than other diapers because they don't have fake beads to absorb waste...it just relies on several layers. But they still hold a lot of pee! Just don't let your toddler hang out with the same diaper too long. Because they're all natural the fibers will rub off a little (think of what happens when you scrub something with a cotton ball). But my toddler is comfy and dry, and I feel a lot less guilty knowing that after 3 months in a landfill, only the elastic in the wasteband and the little fasteners will remain.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these diapers. I am so bummed that I have to look for a new brand to go with because we could hardly afford them when they were $69.99 the last time I bought them. I just looked to buy more and they are listed at $89.99 now. Very disappointing. We have been officially priced out. I refuse to put my baby in chemical diapers like honest brand or pampers pure so I\u2019m going to invest in cloth diapers. These were the best of both worlds before the price increase. It was a lot of money but doable. Now they are impossible to afford.",
