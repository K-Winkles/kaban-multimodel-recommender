Most size 2 diapers were huge in him but Hello Bello is my top pick because they are thin and fit his body type well while still being very soft and absorbent and didn\u2019t leak with the right size. The patterns are super cute and I ended up ordering in bulk from their website & got a 30% off coupon. I\u2019m wondering if negative reviewers need to size up? The only issues I had with leaking with this brand is when we needed to size up.",

He has more of stubby boxy wide build lot of upper thigh fat and large stomach. Not the best fit as opposed to most of the Huggies or pampers pure but they arent bad either. Never experienced any blow outs with these while in bouncer or car seats and have used overnight multiple times and no pee or poop leakage (my son unfortunately likes to pooop in his sleep)The only downsides are is the material isn\u2019t a bit stiff and ll they\u2019re on the smaller side imo. However if your baby has more of longer sliming body these would be lovely.I do recommend and if I\u2019m in a pinch would buy these",

                "reviewText": "This is a great daytime diaper. It\u2019s cute and thin, so it does not look bulky under clothes. I tried it at night for my 6 month old, who usually sleeps through the night, and she was very fussy all night. Come to notice she was visibly wet under the diaper when I changed her. Despite its advertising, this is definitely not a nighttime diaper for infants.",

                "reviewText": "Hello bello actually worked for my baby. The diaper is kind thin like the Mama Bear diapers, and absorbs pretty well. We haven't had issues with leaking, no blow outs so far, and we're about half way through the pack. The diaper has not caused any rashes or irritation on the skin. We haven't tried them overnight, but my baby has a tendency to hold it in until she wakes up in the morning, and we usually change her diaper first thing. Over-all it's a pretty good diaper if you're on a budget.",
