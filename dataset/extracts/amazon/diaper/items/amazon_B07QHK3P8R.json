There was a period of time they were all sold out for weeks especially night time diapers. However once they were back in stock the quality of the diaper changed. It's not as soft. It still does the job though but it's not as soft, the diaper feels stiff and I'm worried its not as comfortable for my baby. Currently looking for a new diaper.",

I usually use parents choice but was going on a week long trip and found these for cheaper and could have them shipped instead of packing with me. They're bigger than parents choice which was lucky for me because I had no clue how many I would need for a week and ended up bringing a ton home, so luckily we'll use them. They held more than parents choice and the absorbency was more spread out so she wasn't super soggy and saggy by morning and her poo stayed in the diaper, not up her back. She's very sensitive to huggies, parent choice and pampers but we barely used any cream for the week so that was an upside!",

                "reviewText": "I've fostered infants for years and have used every diaper out there. I began using Honest Diapers about 2 years ago and really liked them, but they were a little \"stiff\". I began seeing Hello Bello online and finally decided to try a box. They are wonderful. Pay attention to the weights in relation to the sizes. They do not follow the typical sizes. They are soft, and they have a much better selection of designs than Honest. I find the company very organized and responsive. I ordered mine directly from the Company so I am not a verified purchaser on Amazon. They are less expensive directly from Hello Bello.",
