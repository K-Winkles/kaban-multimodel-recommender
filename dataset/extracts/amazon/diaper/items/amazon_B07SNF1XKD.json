                "reviewText": "Update 2/6/2019These diapers leak if your baby has a blow out. They leak out of the leg holes it soaks through the fabric and goes everywhere. I put a new diaper on my 2 week old breastfed newborn and in 15 minutes it was leaking out all over her. Only for blow outs it seems I don't have an issue with urine leaking out. Disappointing still bringing my review down to 3 stars.The diapers are soft but they are not meant for newborns. My daughter is 2 weeks old and 9lbs and they are pretty big on her. We will have to see how they hold up or if they will leak. They seem to have good contact all around there are no gaps but I was sad they weren't just a little smaller. No idea how anyone with a 7lbs baby could fit these on their child. Sizing definitely needs to be updated.",
