The material is thin and soft, but held up well overnight for my 4 month old. I haven\u2019t seen any rash or irritation on my little one.However, one thing to consider when choosing diapers for young infants is the potential for blowouts. There isn\u2019t a flap on the back of these to protect from poo explosions (the name brand we were previously using has them and they have saved us) and we were about a centimeter away from a full outfit change this morning.Additionally, the cost of these diapers are a bit too pricey for us to continue using them at the moment, sadly. And the cost per diaper seems to increase as you go up a size for less diapers, which I found odd. However, these are well made and if I had the extra funds I would have loved to purchase more!",

They aren\u2019t the best fitting, as they are too flimsy and resulted in a few bad blowouts and leaks that other diapers would have prevented. They aren\u2019t the easiest to put on, nor the best fit. The price point just isn\u2019t up to par with the quality of the diapers, and I wanted to love them as they are cute but not functional which is most important for my baby\u2019s needs. The sizing is a bit off, and as much as they may be cute and cute packaging, I\u2019d rather stick with other brands that are similar to this but reassure the needs and best fit for baby. Can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend these, but the fact that they are hypoallergenic is a plus but there are better ones out there that also are as well.",

We still use a specific overnight diaper because our toddler is a heavy wetter when he sleeps, so we've been using these during daytime.They do alright 90% of the time, but twice he had diarrhea and it leaked out of the sides. It wasn't even blow-out level; liquidy, but a small amount so I would expect the diaper to contain it. They are super soft and comfortable for him, so we'll finish the pack but maybe use our overnights if he's got an upset stomach.",
