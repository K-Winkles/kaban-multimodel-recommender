Son is tall and slim, and his idea of fun is apparently practicing action movie stunts, so these do a great job of staying put and providing coverage. Never had issues with absorbency. The fragrance is a bit off-putting to me, but the materials don't irritate our kid's skin. The Cruisers stay in place far better than the Baby-Dry (sesame street print), which we found tend to come undone throughout the day. And speaking of print, the designs are super cute and I like how they vary by box. My son loves when we get a box with the \"big banana\" design.",
