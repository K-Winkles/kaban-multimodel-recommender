Ho acquistato 2 confezioni e sono ancora alla prima... dall'anno scorso circa. Questo perch\u00e9, se non \u00e8 stato sporcato, lo strizzo, lo faccio asciugare e lo riutilizzo. La forma a mutandina consente dei farlo indossare e di toglierlo con facilit\u00e0. Ottimo alleato estivo delle mamme!",

We did notice a few frugal parents drying them after swims the sun was hot enough I guess to do that.Good product we fortunately did not experience the ultimate test.Also very good price and fast delivery from Amazon.",
