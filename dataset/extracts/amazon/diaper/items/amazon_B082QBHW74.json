These are fantastic, \"CLEAN\" diapers, and they've worked great for our baby. We have had no issues with rashes or skin reactions, and they seem comfortable enough on our baby. We have used every size, and plan to continue using this diaper.Our only issue (that's not really an issue) is that at SOME point, your baby will likely not be able to wear these at night. Our baby turned into a tummy sleeper around 5 months, and all their urine would pool at the front of the diaper (b/c of sleeping on tummy), and their pee would leak out the front. The front of the diaper is smaller than the back, which is why this happens. We had to purchase a nighttime diaper, and the issue was solved. These diapers are perfect for during the day though. I recommend them to all my mom friends.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a first time mom with sensitive skin so when I was getting ready for baby I spent a lot of time trying to find the best diapers for him. I decided to try several different diapers in the beginning, find the one that works best and stick with it. Pampers Pure won that experiment and it has been the only diaper we've used for daytime since (we are up to size 4 during the day now). A lot of the reviews I read at the time scared me - bad rashes, diapers ripping open and beads spilling out, huge blowouts and leaks. While there is no way to know what will give your baby a rash until you try it because every baby is different, I can at least say that since I've stuck to Pampers Pure I've had zero of any kind of incidents like that. So if your agonizing over diapers choice right now like I was, I highly recommend giving these a try.Details:- These claim to have less chemicals than other diapers. I didn't do a deep dive into all the chemicals used in diapers (even these have chemicals) because I knew it would freak me out, but I at least feel good about it being one of the better disposable diapers available in that respect.- That line that turns from yellow to blue to indicate wetness extends from the front to the back and is IMMENSELY helpful.- The muted pastel colors and cute (sometimes pretty random) patterns are enjoyable!- I really like the little ruffles and straps on these compared to others. They don't feel scratchy or rough.- They hold a lot of...well you know!- They don't have a gross chemical smell like some of the other diapers I tried.- SIGN UP FOR THE REWARDS FROM THE START! There is an easy to use app and the codes are on the plastic wrapping (see picture). I ignored them for so long and I missed out on so many points. I am sad about it.- The boxes they come in are really sturdy and have little carry handles. We reuse them for all sorts of things.",
