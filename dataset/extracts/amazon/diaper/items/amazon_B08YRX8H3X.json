I used Honest for a while but do not like how they've reformulated them to only be partially chlorine free - not TCF wood pulp anymore! Plus they're rough and don't hold as much urine as most other brands. I spent a fortune on the Healthy Baby ones and they were good and soft like Dyper but again with the slidding off her bottom - and too expensive. But these diapers are a win! They are soft, but not overly so. They are absorbent. They do not cause rashes or irritation. They are made in Europe with TCF wood pulp. I am a fan and have 100% made the switch over to these. (I also like these more than Natty and Seventh Generation which I used with my other child. )",

No leaking and I prefer them over others now!I wanted to love these because my sister swore by them for both her babies but they have leaked urine from the START for my son. I\u2019m so disappointed. I cannot figure out where exactly they are leaking from. Sometimes it seems like the back, sometimes the side? I\u2019ve tried to adjust the way they are put on different each time and still no change. I thought it was a sizing issue, maybe too big? I gave them time for my son to grow into them but now he is on the heavier side and could transition to size 2 and they still leak\u2026 Total bummer!",

However, after 6 weeks of using them, I'm going to have to find something else. These diapers leak frequently--we went through 4 clothing changes last night. I can smell the pee before the yellow line ever changes to blue which is fine but my husband has no sense of smell so he can't tell. As a first time mom I thought it was because I didn't know how to put on a diaper but I didn't have this issue with Pampers, Huggies or even generic Kirkland. I just can't justify the price of the diapers for how much they leak.",

I've been buying these in different sizes since my first child was born and I have been using them with my second child too. Every time I've had to buy backup diapers because these didn't ship fast enough I'm reminded why I keep buying these.Other brands are either not biodegradable at all or as fast as these or have a terrible smell after a pee or they leave a bunch of fluff on the skin from the diaper or the material causes a rash or a combination of that. I've used Honest Co diapers, Seventh Generation diapers and other brands and would not recommend any of them.I hope this company keeps making diapers and doesn't get pushed out of the market by lesser quality brands that have more money put into marketing and/or have famous people endorsing the diapers.These diapers don't have a terrible smell after being peed in and can hold in poop and pee well. I am very happy I spent a lot of time researching diapers before using them and that this brand has what I was looking for and met my expectations. I've used sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.",

Today he shot some pee at grandma while being changed and when she tried to wipe it up with a diaper she said they didn\u2019t even absorb the pee!
