                "reviewText": "I love the hello bello brand and I love these diapers. They are very absorbent, my baby doesn't wake up overnight due to her diaper whether it's pee or poo. I love the designs too they are super cute! My 2 complaints are that there is no pee indicator on them. So the half hour or so between the time the diaper goes on and when she goes down for bed I have no real way of knowing if there's pee in there or not. Sometimes I really have to feel (the outside of her diaper) to see if it feels a little heavier than normal or I've even opened the diaper to see if there's pee because there is literally no way of knowing based on the outside. The second irritating factor is that there are only 24 diapers in a pack. Like just make 1 package with 30 diapers! Aside from that the value for your money is amazing! Other brands are so over priced!",

It\u2019s been so hard to find them at Walmart lately because they\u2019re always sold out. These are the ONLY night diapers my son doesn\u2019t leak through at night. He wears a size 6 & is 26 months old, 30 lbs. sometimes I even put a booster pad in them (like Sposie pads) & they protect him from leaks even more.Absolutely love these, and I\u2019ll definitely re-order from this seller in the future. Took about a week to get here though. Even though this picture had French writing on the package, these came in a regular Hello Bello box with English writing.Hope this helps! \ud83c\udf19",

However, my kid is an excessive pee\u2019er so the nighttime absorption was something we had to look into. 3-4 Diaper changes a night on a 8 month old was getting old. These Hello Bello diapers are super duper soft and clean ingredients which was something I was looking for since they would be on his bottom for 10+ hours potentially. Diapers lasted from 7 pm- 5 am with one feeding in between. They were MAXED out by 5 am and leaked but I feel like any diaper would by that point. I recommend these!!!",

The diapers themselves are very thin, they are thicker up front which is good, but they are still super thin and not very absorbent. I put my baby in one of these diapers during the day and it was almost to the point of leaking after about an hour. I usually buy Pampers Swaddlers Overnight diapers, and they work super well. These overnight diapers aren\u2019t even as absorbent as my daytime choice (pampers swaddlers). These diapers run a little small too. I\u2019ll use the rest of this pack for daytime use but definitely not at night and I wouldn\u2019t recommend them for such.",
