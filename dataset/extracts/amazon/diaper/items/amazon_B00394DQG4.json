So needless to say, she wears little swimmers and they work great. I put them on her hind legs like putting them on a baby and add a shoestring to cinch the side of diaper up over the top of her rump to keep them in place. They work great and hold a lot of moisture. Cheaper than buying doggie diapers. Thanks again Amazon!!",

These don't swell up huge like other brands we've tried. The hold in pee (and poo) great!These always make for a great time on the water, just wish they weren't so expensive.",
