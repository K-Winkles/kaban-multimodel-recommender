                "reviewText": "I have a large 22 month old son. Size 7 diapers are hard to find nowadays. We usually use Mama Bear or Earth & Eden brand but they were out of stock. Given the price of these Comfees diapers, we hoped these would be on par with Mama Bear and Earth & Eden. They have such a cute pattern and I really wanted to like these diapers, but we were immediately disappointed upon opening the box. The size they call 7 for 41+ pounds is actually comparable to a SIZE 5 of either of the previously mentioned brands, and the quality is thin and generic, very similar to Parent\u2019s Choice. The waistband managed to fit my son, but there was no wiggle room in the diaper at all and he got an extremely bad rash around his thighs from where the leg holes are so small. We ordered the box of four packs (80 total) and couldn\u2019t even finish one of the four packs without having to go order more diapers elsewhere. Very disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "These diapers are great when they stay on. The tabs don't seem to stick very well and often come loose. Maybe my son isn't quite big enough for them, but it doesn't seem to matter how high up on his waist I have them, they work their way down and he winds up leaking. I've found putting a pair of underwear on over them seems to help keep them in place. I wish the diaper companies would make diapers that actually worked on older kids who aren't yet potty trained overnight.",
