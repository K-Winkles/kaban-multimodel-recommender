                "reviewText": "These are great. We needed training pants in a smaller size than typical brands offer since our daughter is potty training but still very long and lanky, and these definitely fit the bill. For reference, she is just over 26 lbs and 35.5\" and the size 4 is working very well. They're snug enough not to leak but she definitely has some room to grow too.I was trying to decide between trying these first or trying one of the Korean/Asian brands (milk friends, natural blossom), and honestly the deciding factor was that I could get a smaller pack of these first instead of having to buy a 96 count box and risk them not working for us. These have worked out great, though - they're super soft and we haven't had any leaks or other issues. The tape tab is nice for closing them up when needed. We will stick with what works!",

This new design is lacking in so many ways and Is making me regret not stocking up before. They are still super soft which is great but they do rip too easy, and I also find that they aren\u2019t as absorbent and dry as before. I have even had a few leaks at night. Other times i find when I change a night diaper that\u2019s super full my baby feels really damp. He has started getting rashes for the first time since using this brand.

While we loved the perks that come with ordering from their direct website, finding their store here on Amazon was a life saver when life got chaotic. Which every parent knows happens. The company has pretty quick delivery time, (3 days), and through Amazon I think got the diaper training pants in 2 days. The training pants for toddlers are just as great of quality as the infant diapers. The price and value is unmatched, so I highly recommend.",

It's almost pointless to have a diaper if it's going to be so flimsy and move frequently. I would no longer recommend this product. It's a shame because i was looking forward to sticking to them until potty training.",
