                "reviewText": "These are Fantastic Diapers! You can see by the photo of the diaper with the logo that these look like classy diapers and they really are classy diapers! They are made very well. They are extraordinarily absorbent but keep moisture away from baby.The diaper really is black as seen in these photos. My phone camera would not see the black color and instead made the black appear gray. So, I simply upped the contrast when I moved the photos to my iPad so that you can see their true black color.The velcro works well. I didn\u2019t even realize that it was velcro at first because it is so soft to the touch! As you can see by the photos, the entire bamd where the logo is, is one super soft velcro strip. This makes these diapers incredibly adjustable. You can see in the one photo where I almost completely covered the entire logo while attaching the velcro. And it is easy to unattach, and reattach the velcro as needed.I put these diapers up to my nose and I could barely smell anything. Charcoal is a great ingredient for these kinds of things.I did some measurements here on a couple of photos so that you can get a better idea if these diapers will fit your baby or a friends\u2019 or family\u2019s baby. We all know that diapers are a Great Baby Shower Present!I highly recommend this product! I hope that these photos and information have helped you on your search!",

                "reviewText": "We tried these for our 1.5 year old. They work just as well as the name brand diapers and the look is fun and different. It's more expensive than other more popular brands though because of the materials used. The fit is true to size and they aren't overly bulky and they look pretty cool! Underwear looking actually.It's a plant based material diaper, but it feels just as comfortable and holds overnight just as well as any premium diaper brand. I would recommend these if you're into plant based materials.I am giving it a 4 (4.5 if I can) star because of tiny little details. These do not detract from the diaper's performance but are things I consider/prefer as a parent. 1. The black packaging has perforation on top but it opens to the diaper's waistband side. I prefer pulling diapers on their folded side so I know I am grabbing only 1 out of the bag. If you are like me, open the bag from the bottom. 2. No size markers - I have 2 kids, 1 wearing size 3 and 1 wearing size 4. I've had it where the kids pooled diapers on the floor \"accidentally\" and having size labels on the diaper makes it easier for me to separate them out. Without a size marker, make sure to keep both diapers' location distinct and avoid pooling accidents (where diapers get mixed on floor). 3. No usage marker - most diapers have that yellow line that turns green to help you visualize pee use. These do not have those so you need to do a feel test or just change more often.If you do not care for the issues I raised above and can afford these, add a star.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using these for a couple weeks now as overnight diapers for my 22 month old daughter. I cloth diaper pretty exclusively during the day with disposables at night and babysitters. I\u2019m very sensitive to the awful chemical smells that she\u2019ll usually wake up with from most other disposables. These don\u2019t have any of that stink, even after 12+ hours! She\u2019s not a terribly heavy wetter but depending on the night can saturate a diaper and we\u2019ve had no issues with leaks. The overall diaper fit is really great and while she doesn\u2019t usually poop at night, the leg seals are excellent!They run true to size when compared to other brands. She\u2019s 32+ lbs and the 6s fit her great, except I do feel like the tabs are a little short compared to other brands. I can fasten the diaper fine but if you had a super round baby you may be totally at the limits of the fasteners.Occasionally I do notice a little black along where the edge of the diaper lies, though the majority of the inner is white. The black is kind of a cool look compared to the usual white printed diapers!Not a cheap disposable by any means but it\u2019s comparable to other \u201cclean\u201d brands when you figure out cost per diaper.",

                "reviewText": "Like other reviews, I agree that these charcoal diapers raise the quality standards several notches. Just the black diaper, alone, sets this in a fashion category of its own.But, there's more to this diaper than a fashion statement. They are well-made with ample stretch-elastic for form-fitting coverage. Along with the odor-fighting charcoal, the diapers are designed with an elastic leak guard. The ingredients list charcoal, corn starch and other plant-based material and are free of latex, alcohol, PVC, perfumes or phthalates.But that's not the reason why these diapers come in at twice the price of big-box stores. I researched the company and was extremely impressed with their global website. While these diapers are made in China, they are distributed by an American Company and certified through several global organizations. First, the diapers are Oeko-Tex certified -- tested for 350 toxic chemicals. Also, these diapers are \"Dermatest\" certified -- a global \"seal of approval\" which ensures excellent skin tolerance and safety for the user. For me, those are important certifications that are much appreciated. There's a lot of quality tucked within this diaper. The company's transparency is also appreciated. Again, they are expensive -- almost double the cost of other big-box store diapers. But, compared to other \"plant'based\" socially-responsible companies, they are comparably close in price.",
