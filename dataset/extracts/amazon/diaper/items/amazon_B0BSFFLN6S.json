That's why we use very soft non-woven fabric to contact the baby's skin and make the baby feel comfortable. Why are these diapers thinner? For Breathability. Polymer is added instead of some wood pulp to enhance absorption and make the diaper thinner. Which also brings more benefits for baby's movement and skin breathing. Can baby wear it day or night? Yes, Daddy's choice diapers effectively absorb fluids and restore dryness as quickly as possible, which help lock wetness away for up to 12 hours. What size do diapers go up to? we offer size 2\uff0c size3\uff0c size4\uff0c size5. Are diapers ingredients safe ? Yes\uff0cthere is no additives/ paraben/chlorine/ fragrance/ bleach in production process.",

They seem to be very gentle on my baby girl's sensitive bottom as well.They can still leak out the sides if your little one has a blowout, but that's not very different from any other cheaper diaper.

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Average diaper, loses integrity quickly",
                "reviewText": "When it comes to diapers, I've tried many. I've even tried the same brands, in different countries (and yes! They are different.) I have a 2.5 yo and a 15mo at the moment. I really would give these diapers 2.5 stars if I could, 3 stars might be a bit generous. I wouldn't buy these diapers again unless in a pinch or all the other good cheaper ones suddenly went up in price (which, hey, with prices and inflation currently could happen, aha).The Pros:-very soft, their best feature really.-solid white design, except for orange logo on front of waistband. While I actually really like diaper prints, white diapers to me feel a touch classier, feel a bit retro, and are best under thin baby blothes.-the price isn't bad (at the time of buying, .30 per size 5 diaper)The Cons:-If left on too long, these diapers really lose their integrity. Even if not full, they can come apart and all those little beads that absorb your children's liquids end up all over their bum. Or, if you pick your baby up, they might tear.-These also leak. I have to make sure to change diapers right before nap to not run the risk of the kiddos waking up wet. Which also leads to...-Not good for nighttime. Kids often wake up wet.-These diapers have the \"tighter\" style of waist band. The tab \"arms\" are not very long nor is the back overly stretchy, which makes it feel like closing these diapers takes more effort.-these diapers get the saggy crotch look after just an hour or two, even if minimally peed in.Overall, these diapers are ok for daytime, as long as you stay vigilant in changing diapers. However, I think there are diapers out there that work much better for a similar price (which saves you money because you don't have to change them as often!), or that work similarly to these, but are much cheaper.",
