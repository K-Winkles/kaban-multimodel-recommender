                "reviewText": "Product: Huggies, Little Movers Baby DiapersI have been using Huggies Little Movers Baby Diapers for my little one, and I have to say, they are fantastic. Here's why I highly recommend them:First and foremost, the fit of these diapers is exceptional. They have a contoured shape and stretchy sides that ensure a snug and comfortable fit for my baby. The diapers stay in place even during active play, which is a great feature for little ones who are always on the move. I haven't experienced any leaks or blowouts while using these diapers, which gives me peace of mind.The absorbency of the Huggies Little Movers diapers is impressive. They are designed to quickly absorb wetness and lock it away, keeping my baby's skin dry and preventing any discomfort. Even after several hours of wear, the diapers remain dry on the inside, which is essential for my baby's comfort and overall health.I also appreciate the quality of the materials used in these diapers. They feel soft and gentle against my baby's sensitive skin, reducing the risk of irritation or rashes. The diapers are also hypoallergenic and free from any harmful chemicals, which is a priority for me as a parent.The Huggies Little Movers diapers have a convenient wetness indicator, which changes color when it's time for a diaper change. This feature is incredibly helpful, especially for new parents who may be unsure when to change their baby's diaper. It eliminates the guesswork and ensures that I can provide the best care for my little one.In terms of availability and pricing, Huggies Little Movers diapers are widely available in most stores and online retailers. They are competitively priced, offering excellent value for the quality and performance they provide.Overall, I highly recommend Huggies Little Movers Baby Diapers to parents looking for a reliable and high-quality diaper option. They offer a great fit, excellent absorbency, and are gentle on a baby's delicate skin. With these diapers, I feel confident that my baby is comfortable and protected throughout the day.",

                "reviewText": "Finally able to get my hands on Huggies Little Movers Size 7. Previously used Pampers Baby Dry and Pampers Cruisers for my 9 year old daughter that has autism.She isn't non-verbal but Potty Training has been like war, the past 2 times we tried. So I've continued with a combination of Pampers Cruisers Size 7 and Pampers Baby Dry Size 7, until now. The Huggies size 7 don't have air channels like the Pampers do, but I've found the huggies to be bigger/taller, better fitting, far more absorbant, smell less than the pampers (when dry and when wet), be more comfortable than the pampers (based on my 9yo daughter no longer having meltdowns over diaper changes or when she goes to the toilet in her diaper.She is able to wee/urinate in her diaper 4 to 5 times, before her Huggies will be full, and needs a change. No issues with going poo in her Huggies either, no blow-outs, no leaks, no tab breaks.Though one time, while I was changing her, she successfully managed to get one of her Huggies Little Movers Size 7 on her mommy's bottom, a testament to how big Size 7 Huggies diapers are I guess....The thicker and longer wetness indicator is great and she doesn't leak overnight, with a fresh or dry diaper on before she falls asleep. She usually goes through 1 diaper a night but it can sometimes be 2 diapers a night. During the day, it's sometimes 1 but usually 2 diapers per day.The Huggies size 7 also accommodates our daughters diaper alarm/humidity monitor, no problems (on the outside of her diaper, in between her legs, where girls begin urinating)",
