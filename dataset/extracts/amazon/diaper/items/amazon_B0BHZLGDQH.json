It was a path down a very long road that would lead her to found Irene Organics some years later. \"Before starting Irene Organics Skincare I was a professional nanny for over 10 years and then later became a Certified Pediatric Sleep Consultant so I had a lot of experience working with parents and babies. I also had a passion for making my own natural, homemade skincare products and realized that the children I cared for responded well to my natural DIY products in comparison to larger store brand products\" - Irene 2020 saw Irene expecting her first child, and with this detailed knowledge of the industry behind her, she wanted to create a product that would be entirely safe for her, and for other moms to use. \"That's when I created my Pregnancy & Postpartum Mama line, to help mothers like me keep their skin feeling and looking good in a natural way without any harm to them or their little ones.

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough about the quality of the Irene Organics products. I absolutely love and appreciate the simple and clean ingredients. I'm so sick of other so-called \"natural\" brands that will include chemicals such as Polysorbate 60 among others and still push their products as natural and market them as being organic. I've come to realize that \"made with\" certified organic ingredients means nothing but a marketing ploy. The Irene Organics products are so simple and high quality and I love them. I have their belly oil, belly balm, baby eczema cream, and now this baby diaper rash relief balm.This diaper rash balm is so gentle and practically unscented, and it has a very nice texture that is substantial but not pasty like most conventional diaper creams.If you're looking for the truly organic and simple/clean products for you and your baby, these products are it. While the baby products are Vine purchased items, my belly oil and balms were not and I purchased those before I even became a Vine member.These items are so worth the price and because they are NOT diluted with filler ingredients and preservatives, they last a lot longer and are more effective. I've had my belly oil and balm since the beginning of my pregnancy and I'm almost 32 weeks now. I still have a good bit in my bottle and jar. I'm all for paying a little more up front to get a high quality item that will last me a lot longer.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great addition to my rash arsenal. I keep quite an assortment due to 2 in diapers and a kiddo with eczema.This balm is really nice. It spreads easily, is not overly scented with lavender as I have experienced with other stuff for kids that has lavender.When it arrived we were ina diaper rash battle with my 3.5 month old. Raw, red and really hard to heal diaper rash that was headed to the dr next for a prescription. Now, please don't misunderstand, I am definitely not claiming this is good in place of a prescription when that is needed. I had tried all my tried and true methods (5 kids worth of collected diaper rash battle knowledge) and nothing was really working. We slathered this balm on each diaper change and continued our airing out routine and it healed up quickly. It was noticeably different within 3 days. It was wonderful.Product comes in nice jar and is definitely something great for a baby registry/shower gift.We will be buying more and also trying their excema balm too.",
