                "reviewText": "We normally use Huggies Little Movers with our 3.5 year old (nothing against them, they're also great diapers) but recently decided to give Swaddlers a try, and will not be going back. This is a top-of-the-line diaper and excels in all ways.We use a size 7 though could *probably* get away with a size 6, and use about 4-5 diapers a day on average (not including his overnight diaper) depending on how much he's had to drink and how often he poops -usually once a day, but could be as many as 3 times, especially if he doesn't go one day.The first thing you notice about these diapers is how soft they are. I mean, they just feel like they would be comfortable on a child, and since they're in them practically 24/7, that's important. The diaper is mostly white, and the overall designs are more muted than a lot of other diapers, with \"Shilo and Friends\" -an elephant and duck - on the front and back. I personally wouldn't mind something bolder, I don't think my child cares or even notices. There is a wetness indicator that goes down the length of the diaper, front and back. Nice to have I suppose for a caregiver who maybe doesn't change a lot of diapers, but at this age and stage, it's easy to know and tell. Like all Pampers diapers, they are scented. I happen to love the gentle powder-like scent, but it's a turn-off to some who describe it as too strong, and of course, if your child is sensitive to that, you may want to avoid Pampers diapers.Inside, the top sheet liner keeps his skin dry, even when he wets heavily -which is usually - and does a good job of keeping poop from sticking to his bottom. The \"blowout barrier\" in the back also helps contain any messes. In terms of absorbency, I'm pretty amazed at how much they can hold. Being a little older, he tends to stay drier for longer periods and then pee a larger amount at one time, but the diaper almost always holds it in, and leaks are rare.The one thing I wish that Pampers did do was have wider tapes, like Huggies, at least on the larger sizes, where kids are more active. It hasn't been a problem, so I don't really have a reason for saying that, other than that it seems like it would help with fit, but it certainly won't keep me from buying or using them in the future.",

The combination of no diaper rash, impressive absorbency, and the added blowout barrier make them a reliable choice for us and other parents looking for a high-quality diaper. While the price may be slightly higher than some alternatives, the peace of mind and overall performance justify the investment. I highly recommend these diapers to parents who prioritize their baby's comfort, skin health, and protection against leaks.",

Once she started to eat solids, we started to notice that when she pooped the smell would stick on her pants! We were appalled by Huggies and then switched back to pampers. The material seems to be thicker on pampers and just cheaper than Huggies which is surprising. Anyways, we are back to being Pampers customers and love these diapers! Pampers family for life!",

I think pampers is overpriced typically, but considering the size issue I will pay for it. Not many brands make size 8's. My son has always been a tall, big boy and finding diapers that fit him was a struggle. These are perfect as we work on potty training. Especially good for parents that have kids with autism that are slower to potty train. 10/10! Plus, you get that awesome \"baby powder\" scent with these.",
