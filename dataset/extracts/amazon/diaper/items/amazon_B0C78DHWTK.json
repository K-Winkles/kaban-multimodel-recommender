Babies' skin is extremely sensitive, up to 5x thinner than adults & much more absorbent. They'll spend almost all day every day in a diaper, so we understand the importance of being transparent about our ingredients & the quality of our products. A lot goes into a good diaper! We've seen other diaper brands pour liquid in a diaper and show that the liquid doesn't leak out, but what about the inside where it touches your baby? You want a diaper that doesn't leak AND keeps your baby dry! We've also seen other brands perform tests where it's clear they don't put the same amount of pressure on their diaper to make it look better! We tested a Terra plant-based diaper against two other popular diaper brands to see which one absorbs the most liquid, AND which one stays the most dry. We used a 5 lb. weight so there's no way to fudge the results. Honestly, the video speaks for itself\u2014scroll to the top and click through all the images to see the video!",

                "reviewText": "Over the past few years we have a used a variety of diapers. We have used and tried diapers from Pampers, Huggies, Luvs, Hello Bello, The Honest Company and All Good. At the moment we are using Pampers Cruisers 360 and Pampers Swaddlers Overnights; sometimes we use Pampers Pull-Ups.From the moment, I opened the package, it was clear these were premium diapers. They are thick and soft. One of children (2 years old) said they felt comfy. Overall, I'd say these diapers are great!The diapers are sized differently from what I'm used to. I typically buy size 4 but based on Terra sizing we needed the size 5. They looked a little big to me - just something to be mindful of. Even though these diapers are thicker, they are still easy to tear on the sides. I found the absorbency to mostly be comparable to the Pampers. We did have a few (loose) poop leaks that went through the diaper but not onto clothes. We also had one pee leak although the diaper didn't seem that full and had only been worn for ~3 hours but I feel that was just a weird thing.",

Not sure you can see the wet pants but just to show. I'm sure if I got the 4 he might be ok. I'll know for next time. But all in all they are REALLY soft is definitely not irritating. High quality ingredients, unfortunately really expensive for the bigger box so can only afford the small count.Update: got the smaller size and he still leaks so this diaper Is most definitely not leak proof. Only good thing is that it's soft and doesn't have the harsh chemical.",
