Maybe it's because our baby is only 4 months old right now, but both brands of diapers seem to do the job. I've tried store brand diapers before and they have been terrible! Don't absorb anything at all! So, I just buy whatever I have a coupon for or whatever Amazon has on hand. I don't go by the weight charts either: I use them until the baby starts leaking or it seems too snug around the hips/waist. We're not picky. Maybe things will change when he starts crawling/walking, but for now I love and use both brands.",

The couple of times that I used Pampers we had blow outs and she got rashes (discovered later that she was having an allergic reaction, I believe due to the scent). Not a problem with the Huggies. Even when we were in the car all day there were no leaks or blow outs (we changed her every time that we stopped, about every two hours but didn't stop every time she went or we would never have made it). In order to prevent the blow outs you do have to pull them snug when putting them on since they are stretchy (not too tight though, the little flap on the inside back really helps to catch stuff).",

This is the best. I used pampers on my son for the first 3 months and being a first time parents, we had no idea what we went through was not necessary( pupu explosion \"constantly\"; I am talking about almost everyday and sometimes few times a day. You can't imagine how much laundry I got to do) Finally on a road trip, we forgot to pack some diapers for him. I decided to give litttle snugglers a try and my husband and I were amazed. Since then, we are hooked on this. After all, I learn my lesson in my son's first 3 months. Every baby is different; what people tell you the best isn't necessary the best for your child( diaper, pacifier, wipes, formula..etc). You just have to do your howmework and run some testing on your own and find the best match. Good luck!",
