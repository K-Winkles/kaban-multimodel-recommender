                "reviewText": "I need to find a way to keep my fur baby dry now that he is getting up there in years . I found dog diapers on amazon and they looked just like reg baby diapers but worn like a skirt instead of how you put it on a baby . I figured for the price I\u2019d be better off buying these in sz 4 and they worked so well !! They keep my lil dude dry and he can walk around without any issues. It\u2019s so much better than using puppy pads for him to lay on . These work great on my 12 lb dog . I think a sz 5 would work too . He\u2019s built like a little tank . These have the line on them that let me know when he is wet . They smell really good too ! I used these for my kids when they were babies . Still great quality for a great price . I\u2019m super happy with how well they absorb pee . My little old man dog was stinky and needed a bath daily when I was using puppy pads under him to keep him dry but it was not working very well . These keep him dry and he\u2019s not stinky like he\u2019s making Jenkum . Now I can use just the diaper and a fabric Welping pad to keep him comfortable, clean and dry . It\u2019s his golden years right now and quality of life is the most important factor right now . I think it\u2019s cute that my dog is wearing his little diaper wrap that has a bunch of dogs printed on it (paw patrol ) . In my experience these work great on both fur babies and real babies !",
