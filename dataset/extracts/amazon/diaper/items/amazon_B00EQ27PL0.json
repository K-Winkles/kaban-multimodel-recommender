                "reviewText": "My son is 13 mos old, and we have been using Naty diapers since birth. I was on prolonged bedrest and had a LOT of time to do diaper research (and by research I mean I read a ton of reviews and ordered a dozen different kinds in newborn size to test our preferences). We tried the mainstream brands (Pampers, Huggies, etc.), as well as other \"green\" or \"healthy\" options (Honest, Bambo, 7th Gen, etc.). Cloth was not an option for us, as our daycare provider would not permit them. Of the disposables we tried, Naty was our hands-down winner with Bambo coming in second. We have never had an issue with leaks, but users should be aware that these diapers require a bit of quick fluffing because they are more stiff than traditional brands. My son doesn't mind the stiffness, and in fairness, he doesn't know any differently because he hasn't used other brands. If you don't fluff and make sure the fit is good, the diapers could leak, but we have had no issues, even after 10-12 hours overnight. As for the quality control issues others have mentioned, yes, we've had some defective diapers as well. I would estimate maybe a couple dozen diapers have had faulty tabs, which might sound like a lot, but when you consider that we've used somewhere between 3,000-4,000 diapers since birth, the defective ones represent less than 1% of what we've purchased. I certainly don't consider that to be a considerable deterrent, especially given the other perks in terms of performance and environmental friendliness, not to mention health and well being. My child has never had diaper rash, even when sick and having frequent/loose BMs. I maintain that lack of rash is due to these amazing diapers (as well as waterwipes - shout out to those too for being free of perfumes, etc.) Naty diapers have been amazing, and we plan to continue using them until we no longer have need for diapers.",

                "reviewText": "These are natural and very absorbent, however they have some major flaws! They are very crunchy/abrasive. I would hate to have that rubbing on my skin, let alone my sensitive baby's bum. The velcro latches are also prone to tearing as you pull them out to secure, and the diaper as a whole doesn't receive the velcro so you have to hold together even the poopiest diaper until you can get it in the garbage, which is especially challenging when changing in the car or on the go. I won't be buying them again.Edit: Within a few days of posting this as 2 stars, I woke up to find gel from my 20 month old's full morning wet diaper bursting through the front where she had grabbed it to communicate her need for a change. (Time to potty train!?! That aside...) This is to say, the papery exterior may achieve high ratings for biodegradability for good reason: it begins to degrade overnight! This is a serious problem if the diaper gets any amount of abrasion once wet, such as happens with nearly any toddler if just wearing a diaper. At some point (thinking summertime or between clothing changes as the case may be.) It didn't take long for that gel to migrate far with her little feet and excited discovery of said gel. Eeeeeew. Oh and try vacuuming it out of the carpet or picking it up by hand. So yucky. I cannot discourage you enough. I would only buy these again if there were no other brands available!",

                "reviewText": "It is the second review I have ever written for the products I purchased from Amazon. As a new mom with 4 month old baby, time is the most valuable resources for me. However, I'm eager to write this review and share with others my experiences in searching for the best diapers for my baby girl, who has sensitive skin and mild eczema.We have tried almost all good-selling brands on the market, pampers swaddler sensitive, Huggies pure and nature, the earth's best, and Nature Baby care. Pampers sensitive is VERY soft, however, it has a strong perfume smell, and we had blow-outs almost every week. The worst of all, my baby had diaper rashes, on and off. We are not sure if that's because of the diaper or the pampers sensitive wipes. But we do not want to continue either product and use our DD for trial. Well, speaking of dirty laundry, we had nightmares with the earth's best. Comparing the same size among all these brands, EB is the smallest one and the least absorbent. It also set the records for giving me 3 blow-outs within 8 hours. I think it is due to the bottom design which cannot fit quite well with the baby. Due to its bad air circulation, they cannot make the bottom as thick as the front which contributes to the constant leakage.Huggies? well, they do not give the baby rashes as pampers sensitive, however, they seem very poorly made. They left a huge space around the edge of bottom without any absorbent materials. Yes, just a thin layer of so-called \"Organic\" cotton paper, which means, blow-out could be very likely to happen (although we haven't had any, as we are using one size up for DD). Just when I am about to give up and turn to some premium and hard-to-buy Japanese brands, I found Nature Baby Care! The best diaper ever!Its design is so thoughtful and it doesn't have any of the shortcomings I mentioned above:It's very absorbent! Very! I can leave the diaper on my baby for more than 12 hours without change, as we do not want to disturb her long sleep at night. Any it only gave me small amount of leakage, once, throughout the entire 2 month of usage.It is soft, compared to EB. Perhaps not as soft as pampers sensitive, but that's the trade-off. To me, it's understandable as they are not using the same chemical gels used by pampers for absorbing the liquid. But my baby's butt feels dryer after using NB than EB.It fits snugly but not too tight on my baby and the design on the diaper is cute. I love those green little cloves print on the diapers!It's earth-friendly which makes us feeling good when tossing tons of diapers.In terms of cost, tt's slightly more expensive than pampers sensitive. But with Amazon sub & save along with Amazon Mom program, it ends up with the difference of just probably $0.01-$0.02 per diaper.Considering the above reasons, I strongly recommend Nature Babycare Diapers to any mom who would like to give their baby the best diaper care. You really don't know which one works the best until you try it out for at least a week. Give NB a try, and you might fall in love with this diaper as I do.",

Non contengono schifezze, il mio bimbo non ha mai avuto irritazioni. Io li ho trovati convenienti. Certo forse sono un po' rigidi, ma ci si abitua.Consiglio solo di verificare bene la taglia, io prendevo quelli pi\u00f9 grandi, ma ogni bimbo \u00e8 a s\u00e8.",
