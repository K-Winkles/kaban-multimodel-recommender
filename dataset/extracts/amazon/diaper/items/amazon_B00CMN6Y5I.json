Took him to the beach for the first time and he didn't get in the water, only had on the diaper for about 2-2\u00bd hours and he peed through the diaper. Maybe if I try a size bigger that won't happen? But it barely held any pee at all. Idk if its supposed to or not since its a swim diaper. But when I took it off and wrapped it, it was so small like it didn't hold any pee. Might try a larger size if I try them again?",
