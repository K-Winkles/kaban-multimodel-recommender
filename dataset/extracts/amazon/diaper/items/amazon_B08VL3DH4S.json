I still get occasional leaks (about once or twice a week, maybe?), but this is much better than the constant leaks from the other diapers. If it doesn't leak, it can hold for a good 7 hours or so. By leak, I mean that my 4 month old will wake up with a large circle of pee on his onesie. I feel this happens because somehow the pee came up the wrong way, not that the diaper was too full, because I've had these sorts of leaks after 3 or 4 hours of sleep some nights without a full diaper, when I know we've done 7 hours without leaks but with a full diaper. Summary: I would recommend this. This is the night diaper that I am using. Huggies was good but left my baby's bum too dry and itchy.",

                "reviewText": "IMAGES (from left to right): Reg Swaddlers, Overnights, PureUPDATE 2/28/20: since writing the review our baby is now 9mo and has had 2 minor leaks and I found that it was because the diaper put on crooked or not tight enough (trying to diaper and dress a squirmy 9mo isn\u2019t easy!). But I still think these work really well.We've tried all three lineups of the Pampers brand for overnight protection and would rate them as follows:1. Overnights (marginally better then the reg Swaddlers)2. Swaddlers3. PureOur baby would sleep 12-12.5hrs a night without waking up since 8weeks, but around 5mo he started to sleep on his tummy, and that was when the leakage problem became more regular. We tried sizing up on diapers. Still little help. We added a Sposie pad to his bigger diaper. It helped most nights, still had leakage. We'd also point his peepee down. Sometimes he'd sleep on his side and we'd find leakage by the tabs too, which doesn't have coverage. Because we really like the Pampers Swaddlers fit for him during the day, we thought we tried the Overnights and Pure. We tried all three with the Sposie pad to compare. He doesn't poop at night, so I can't attest to overnight pooping.Thoughts on the OVERNIGHTS: Yes, I agree with other reviewers that they are almost identical to the reg Swaddlers. HOWEVER, it is just when you open the package bc they have been compressed and flattened. I had set aside all three aside to compare and inadvertently discovered that after some time, the Overnights puffed up a little bit and decompressed. They felt thicker and more padded, in an airy way. It was noticeably different from the Swaddlers by now. You can't tell the difference in the picture but just by touch and feel, they feel like they have more material to absorb than before when they were removed from packaging.Thoughts on the PURE: We've used them before for daytime, but didn't like how they fit. They run bigger than the Swaddlers. He'd have regular blowouts bc there wouldn't be a good enough seal despite having a thicker padding. I thought this would be a clear winner bc of how thick these diapers are compared to the reg ones and would better for absorbing pee, but they simply don't fit well at all and he'd still leak around his inner thighs.Ultimately, I found that having a pad + sizing up (if your baby is within close range of the next size, otherwise daytime size is ok) + PLACEMENT of diaper are key. Making sure the diaper and pad were high enough and that the pad not peeping out the diaper. The tabs needed to be flushed/flat against one another, without puckering for optimal protection.The Overnight line worked best for us, then the reg Swaddlers not far behind. The Pure isn't worth trying again.",
