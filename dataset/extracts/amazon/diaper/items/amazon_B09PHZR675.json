I have tried various of other diapers from all price ranges, but I always go back to these. The only other Huggies diaper that compares is the overnight ones. Both are equally as good! So soft, no rashes, and no blowouts if you opened them as you should.Not too thin or thick. My daughter has used these since she was born, and she\u2019s 13months now.

I had heard from the Grand Pa to be that \"newborn\" size diapers are very hard to find in stores. I always loved Huggies when my son was born. They were absorbent and fit very well. Moms know how important those features are! I am sure that today they are an even better product. My gift was very appreciated.",

                "reviewText": "I feel like the quality of these diapers has gone downhill in the last year. They tear easily, the material inside is poorly distributed for absorbency (as other reviewers have noted), and worst of all, we have thrown out approximately 10% of these diapers because the gel balls that absorb liquid are falling out. If you shake a diaper, they just spill out or sometimes our baby would end up with hundreds of these all around his groin area and inside the belly button. One time, the belly button even got infected. We are not going to buy any more of these again. For the price, no longer worth it. They need to do something about the manufacturing and quality control process.",

The first time we tried them was overnight and she leaked for the first time ever. Fluke? No. They can\u2019t hold even one toddler pee. And we change after every pee so we can say that they literally fall off and/or the sides rip apart every time, after only one pee. Never mind anything else! Honestly considering just tossing the rest of the box.",
