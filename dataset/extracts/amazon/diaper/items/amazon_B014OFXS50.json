                "reviewText": "Great diapers. Has a great contoured fit for our baby, who is very happy in them. Comfortable, super soft to touch, absorbs lots of liquids, has a nice little flap in the back to catch poop that's trying to make its way up the back, accurate little blue-line indicator. Unscented, so that's good.Re: WireCutter & BabyGearLab -- I hate the online reviews that knock these diapers because they didn't absorb a gallon of some random blue liquid as quickly as another diaper did. If I need a diaper that absorbs weird blue liquids quickly when timed by stopwatch, then I'll take whatever those \"reviews\" recommend. However, if I need a diaper that fits my baby, absorbs his waste, leaves a clean bottom behind, and is comfortable on him, I'd have to say that I'm very satisfied with the Huggies Little Snugglers!!!Many parents debate between Huggies Little Snugglers and Pampers Swaddlers. I feel like it probably has to do with your baby's shape -- some babies will do better with one than the other. Having tried both the Huggies and the Pampers Swaddlers through both size-N and size-1, I feel like my particular baby does much better with the Huggies -- he has less blowouts (very few, at least until the size-N got too small for him and we were trying to use them all up =), there is less (if any) poop stuck to skin, and the Huggies diaper is easier to secure on him and stays on better. [Also, I very much dislike the \"net\" that's inside the Pampers Swaddlers, because it gets stuck to the baby and ends up leaving dried poop behind in a net-shaped pattern. Who wants that?]",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars First time mom choice Pampers vs. Huggies",
                "reviewText": "As a first time mom, I was overwhelmed with the amount of diaper choices out there and had no idea where to start. I asked a bunch of experienced moms and everyone recommended Pampers swadlers. I put those on my registry and had some stocked in my house and in our hospital bag ready for our babies arrival.At the hospital, I noticed they had these diapers instead. I used them reluctantly, thinking as soon as we got home I would be glad to use my papers instead. The hospital gave us a small bag of these and we went our merry way.I quickly learned the difference between the two brands. Though both are comparable in softness, Huggies are a lot more padded. Both brands have the wetness indicator. Pampers is higher in the back but Huggies has an amazing pocket to prevent what I later learned as being a blowout. Not sure I was a believer yet, I ordered two boxes, one of Pampers and one of Huggies. As my baby started growing and sleeping longer through the night, I quickly learned that Huggies held up better, were able to keep her dry longer, didn't slouch as bad when full, and had a higher capacity for overnight protection. Pampers leaked and she started having blowouts every single day despite being well under the max weight guideline (i.e dialers were not too small).This has become my new favorite brand and I highly recommend it if you are a first time mom and on the fence!P.S. They make great padsicle pockets too as recommended by my hospital nurses. Who knew?",

I told my husband that they felt more thin and crunchy feeling. Well come to find out, I started reading reviews and many had the same complaint. Huggies snugglers, however, seem like they have up their game and have became alot more reliable as far as leaking and super soft and flexible feeling, which you know, has to feel better to new baby's bottom!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE these diapers! As a first time mom, I researched EVERYTHING throughout my pregnancy and found that Huggies Little Snugglers and Pampers both had the top ratings as far as diapers are concerned. So I stocked up on both!Let me tell you, DO NOT waste your time and money on Pampers!!! The Velcro barely holds, the material feels dirt cheap, they're made too small (better suited for premies), the overpowering fake talc smell gives you a headache (so you know it's going to irritate the little one), and every diaper leaked; you better pray they don't poop AND pee in the same diaper (my clothes ended up drenched in pee when I was fresh out of the shower). And I noticed, if I have to use the Pampers on her as backups, she is always fussing (she is normally so quiet, you could forget she's here).With Huggies, the only diapers that leak are the ones that battle massive poops. And even then it's so little that I only noticed it if I run a finger along the seem of her onsie. The material is soft and feels super absorbant. There's no awful scent to them and the Velcro is so strong, it tends to catch on the new diaper when I'm changing her (watch those tabs). I ended up having to get 2 of the box of 89 in the Newborn size, as well as the box of 129 (or something like that) in the same size. Now that she's about to be 2 months, it's time to upsize to the size 1.I absolutely love this brand. I also use their sensitive wipes. I will never ever ever go for any other brand again.",

I used other brands of diapers including Pampers, Kirkland, Honest but the Huggies Little Snuggler is the best out of all brands. It doesn't give any diaper rashes like other diapers. I love the fact this diaper has a pee indicator. It has the best velcro for tightening the diaper so pee and poo won't leak. It also has the size chart in the front so that you will know if the diaper is getting too small for your baby as well. The only bad part to buy it on Amazon is that the price keeps changing and they are often out of stock online.",
