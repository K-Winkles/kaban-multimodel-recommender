When I ran out I went to these and actually liked them way more! They are far more absorbent than Pampers, they\u2019re not big and bulky, I like that both the front and back of the diapers have the tabs (Pampers has the small jet out in the front that I have trouble with.) My baby has a lot of blowouts and these have always contained them!!! These are now my go to diaper!",
