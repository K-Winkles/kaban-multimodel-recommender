I use them for daytime as they are better than the gentle touch version for holding together.My main complaint is the bigger sizes 5 and up are lower quality. They have weird hard lining and lumps . It gave my kid a rash. When first noticed, tried to put barrier ointment and then cream but then realized the irritaion was from the diaper having rough lining and lumps.I would say buyer beware with purchase as this is non returnable. And not recommend in larger size. My kid is on the smaller size too.Maybe buy in a pinch but there are still better deals and quality out there.",

                "reviewText": "We usually use generic brand diapers during the day and either pampers or huggies overnights at night for my 7 month old. She woke up the first night using these with a big wet spot in the front. She wore the diaper from 9pm-6am and drank 6oz of milk prior, and it leaked and was massively puffed out. These just do not hold up in comparison to other brand name overnights, which never leak. I thought I could save a few bucks trying them, but for true overnight use, they do not hold up at all. They may be a bit more absorbent than the regular mama bear diapers but still not for overnight use when comparing to top brands.",
