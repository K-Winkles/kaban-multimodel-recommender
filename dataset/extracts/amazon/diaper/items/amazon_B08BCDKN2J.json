The Snug High Waist wraps around your baby's stomach without slipping, which means no leaks during the night. Your baby will be comfortable until morning no matter the sleeping position. Perfect Fit Gathers stay perfectly secure around your baby's legs even when they toss and turn during the night, stopping urine from leaking out. The soft and ventilated material allow sweat and moisture to air out for maximum comfort during the night. Boys can feel like big boys in blue, and girls can feel like big girls in pink with our special colors. Your kids will love the designs and may even want to put them on by themselves. The Wrapping Tape makes disposal easy. Oyasumiman has plenty of absorbency so that it doesn't get wet with pajamas and pajamas, and it has a safe design that uses super-adhesive gathers (R) for turning over. Both moms and dads and children can start the day with a smile. Night diaper pants are not forcibly taken, but are taken naturally by the development of the child's body. Oyasumiman is designed with cool vehicles and cute princesses, so it does not hurt your child's self-esteem and covers the anxiety of leakage.",
