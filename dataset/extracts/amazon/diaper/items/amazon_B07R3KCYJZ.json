They are extremely soft, super absorbent, and don't cause any type of diaper rash for our little one. We rarely have any leaks, they last all night and our little one has an 8-ounce bottle in the middle of the night. Her diaper is full in the morning but she isn't wet. Other diapers would cause a little bit of diaper rash on her skin., these don't. They fit really well around the legs and tummy. We also have these on subscribe and save. We save money by buying these on Amazon, and they are delivered right to our front door. So much easier and I have not run out of diapers yet. Once you try these diapers, you won't want to try anything else. I LOVE these diapers!!!",

                "reviewText": "I was using Dyper bamboo diapers for my son because my conscience couldn\u2019t take the truth about how disposable diapers take 500 years to degrade. Those were ok and simply ran too big for my infant son. We will try them again when he gets bigger but needed something ABSORBENT and that prevented poop blowouts NOW. Tried Pampers, Happy Camper, Abby and Finn, Hello Bello... all were ok but didn\u2019t help with his blowouts or they were too big. The hospital had used Huggies Snugglers and they fit really well but I still had a guilty conscience about the waste lol. Found the Special Delivery on a google search and saw they were eco-friendly - I was souped!These diapers are amazing:1) super SOFT and cuuuuuute designs2) the poop catcher REALLY WORKS and is literally a life saver!!!!!! No other diaper has this little pocket of heaven I don\u2019t think.Literally this little pocket has prevented sooooooo many blowouts!3) INCREDIBLY absorbent!!! Works wonders as an overnight diaper and my son wears them during the day for hours as well. I only immediately change him after he poops.4) Stays dry - my son\u2019s skin does not sit in wetness while wearing it for hours. This diaper does a great job wicking away the moisture and keeping him free from wetness and rashesJust buy these - honestly. You won\u2019t regret it!",

                "reviewText": "These diapers are my absolute favorite. They are softer than any diaper I have felt (and I used to work at a daycare so I've felt a wide variety). They are very absorbent, and the fit is slightly larger so they last longer when you're LO is between sizes. My go-to was always Huggies Little Snugglers because they're also very soft and absorbent, but these are my #1 favorite. I also prefer Huggies brand in general because they are the only diaper brand I have tried that does not cause a diaper rash in BOTH my kids (even Pampers brand, the supposed \"#1 recommended\" brand, will cause a diaper rash on my babies). My oldest (now 6) couldn't wear any other brand of diaper or after 1/2 a day his butt would be red and raw. My now 3 month old is the same -- any other diaper will tear up her hind end but Huggies never does. 100% recommend these diapers!",

                "reviewText": "Let me start first by saying I Regularly use honest diapers. This is a good runner up if you can\u2019t afford the honest brand . I wanted to try these out to see if they were good and I must admitting they exceeded my expectations. In my opinion they are even better than the pampers natural line . My son has super sensitive skin and something in the pampers natural diapers broke him out still. I was waiting for my honest order to arrive so I tried these and as I stated pleasantly surprised . They also worked well on his sensitive skin . The prints are cute and adorable As well . They are also softer and less starchy feeling compared to honest. The softness was something that definitely stood out for me . I\u2019ve never used Huggies diapers because of the whole fiberglass situation but I\u2019m glad I gave them a try when I saw them come out with this line come out . I wish they had better prints but that just something small when putting it up against leak protection , absorption, and is it sensitive skin friendly.",

                "reviewText": "I only use huggies on my baby, so when I heard about these I had to try them out. Not only are they so soft but the absorbency is amazing! My daughter sleeps through the night, so i put them on her before bed (10pm) and didnt change it until we woke up the next day (10am) so I could see if the really work. The pamper was full, she peed a good amount but the inside was still dry! It was like magic. I will most definitely be using huggies special delivery exclusively now. So worth it! Although i wont be keeping my baby in a pamper for 12 hours. The cocoa butter and shea wipes are great with it too. Recommend those as well!",

It\u2019s comparable to the pampers pure line, but I feel that these are softer and my baby does better with huggies. They\u2019re stretchy, no leaks so far, soft, and can withstand crawling and walking without any messes. Honest, 7th Generation and Pampers Pure all leaked with my crawler but not these! I wish they had the extra front Velcro tabs though. Other than that, they\u2019re perfect! Hopefully amazon adds them to the subscribe and save soon! Do your baby a favor and get these!",

But they are super absorbent, no leak through (especially at night !!! A++) but they are gentle on my son bottom !!! I'm really happy with my purchase and will continue to buy them !!!",
