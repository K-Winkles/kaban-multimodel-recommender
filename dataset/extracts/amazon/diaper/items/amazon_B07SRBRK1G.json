My stash of Fisher Price diapers which by the way I HATE! They leaked almost every night but this review is not for them...so...back to my Pampers! The fit is nice the design is cute and best of all they have not leaked! I'm happy so far and will be back in about a week or so for an update! If you're interested in my review the fisher price diapers check out my profile and reviews!Update! One week into my package of Pampers baby dry and wow...all I can say is wow! No leaks at all! I've used brands like Huggies Supreme, Huggies Over nights, Diapers.com, Fisher Price <---Sucks! Out of all the brands I've used these are the best! I've had no leaks at all! These hold it all in even better than the Huggies Overnights which were made for well...Over nights! I have a new favorite brand and I'm so happy I tried these! I would recommend these diapers to parents who are looking for excellent leak protection!Update #2 This is my last and final update...Almost three weeks into the box of diapers and I'm still happy as ever! My husband even took notice! He recently said...\"we haven't had any leaks have we?\" I proudly said \"Nope, not one!\" I know I said this before but these are way better than even the Huggies Overnights! I love these and will be sticking with Pampers from here on out!Unfortunately I have to give another update: Although I have had no leaks at all, toward the end of the box my son started to develop this nasty rash. I recently bought a box of Pampers Swaddlers, so we will see how that goes. So far I'm not thrilled with Pampers. :( It's great that there have been no leaks, but my son has a nasty rash! What is that about?!?",

We generally use Swaddlers or Cruisers at our house but we have on occasion used the Pampers Dry Baby. They seem to work just as well as any of the other versions of pampers that we have used. This diaper is absolutely worth every penny! It kept my babies dry and comfortable and saved me time, money, and energy from not having to change and wash crib sheets every morning. This is a must have for babies that are sleeping long stretches through the night! These are AMAZING! I love the elastic tabs, they move and adjust with the baby unlike other brands that don't have elastic tabs which cause an uncomfortable fit/adjustment. I will never buy another brand. These diapers can absorb liquid like nothing I've ever seen and are just all around great quality!We have no complaints with Pampers products and we would recommend them to any one!",

                "reviewText": "As we all know, diapers and babies are very individual. What works for one, doesn't work for another. I started out using Pampers swaddlers, and loved them. I tried Huggies Naturals and they leaked horribly. My daughter isn't a huge pee-er and those diapers would leak out the top in the front constantly. Luvs gave her a horrible rash on her tummy and back from the first time I used one. So I went back to the Pampers. I decided to try the baby dry since I hate to change her diaper in the night and wake her up. So far so good. Haven't had any leaks, no diaper rash, and seems to keep her skin pretty dry even after 12 plus hours over night. The diapers are thin, but that doesn't effect their function. They hold ALOT of liquid. I actually like the thinness. Makes her pants less bulky and easier to snap a onsie on. I'm a Pampers girl from now on. So far the best diapers I've tried. They may cost a bit more, but with diapers, I'm finding out you get what you pay for. There's nothing I don't like about these.",

This is the only diaper that even comes close to absorbing it all without leaking. I had some leftover target brand from my last baby that I put her in during the day, just to use them up, but she immediately got a rash, and has a blowout EVERY time she poops. These didn't leak even after wearing it all night then pooping in the morning. I might just have to give away the whole box of target brand. Some days she poops 4x a day, which means 4 dirty outfits per day. The cost of these with a subscription is actually cheaper than the generic brand. Premium diapers at a generic price! I've been telling everyone. This is cheaper than cloth diapering. I can't pay for water and soap, never mind my time for as cheap as these are, about .12-.15 per diaper depending on the size and even better if you find an amazon coupon.Update: picture is 11 hours overnight in the same diaper. It absorbed everything and she and her outfit are dry and rash free. Yay, for no more midnight diaper changes!",

Very impressed, and the grandparents can't believe how far diapers have come! They complained about having all sorts of accidents back when they had us, and now diaper \"technology\" has come so far that we can buy inexpensive diapers by the hundreds and not have to worry about daily or nightly leaks!Also I should mention that our baby didn't have any bad reactions to the diapers. We use baby lotion a few times a week and baby power usually after every diaper change.",
