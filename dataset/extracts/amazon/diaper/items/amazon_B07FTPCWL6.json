        "description": "With 0 percent oil-based plastic on skin, Eco by Naty diapers have the softest touch on your baby's skin. Plant-based fibers ensure that the diaper breathes and provides a comfortable fit so that even the most delicate skin does not get any diaper rash. The high plant-based content is unique as it is the only diaper in the market to receive 'OK biobased' certification from TUV Austria. The diapers core consist primarily of premium wood pulp that is highly absorbent keeping your baby's skin dry and protected against leakages and blowouts. This makes our diapers ideal to be used both daytime and nighttime. As a parent, you do not want your baby to be in contact with any chemicals or irritant materials that are harmful to your baby's skin, which is why Eco by Naty's diapers are Hypoallergenic and Dermatologically tested. Our diapers are free from fragrances/perfumes, chlorine, bleaching, latex, lotions and are certified by OEKO-TEX Standard 100 to be free from over 100 harmful substances, ensuring our diapers are also suitable for babies with the most sensitive skin. At Eco by Naty we believe how we produce our diapers is just as important as the materials we use. This is why we source our wood pulp from FSC certified forests. The FSC certification ensures that the forest is managed in a sustainable eco-friendly manner and at the same time taking into account local, societal, indigenous and workers interests. We have been awarded the Vegan label as our diapers are free from animal testing nor contain any animal derived ingredients. The packaging is certified 3 stars (of 4) for its renewability by TUV Austria. The Eco by Naty diaper range is available from Newborn / Preemie to size 1,2,3,4,5 and 6. Each diaper size has adorable Scandinavian inspired design prints, and of course are free from heavy metals.",

They are well made and I love that they are eco and skin friendly. My son (now 3 months) has very sensitive skin. These did not irritate him at all. Unfortunately, these leaked with every single use, within 2 pees our son was soaked. We think these just did not fit our son well, he is short and chunky. I really think if they had fit our son better we would have stuck with them. I gave the ones we were not going to use to a friend and they have loved them and had no issues with leaks, their baby is more long and thin than ours. Great product, and I cannot say enough good things about their customer service. I reached out to them to ask for a refund since the diapers had not worked, they sent me a new package of a new size to try, which unfortunately still did not work for us. But, It was less than a week between my first email to customer service and receiving the new package of diapers. That goes a long way. I would recommend trying these diapers, just know the fit may not work depending on your baby's size! :)",

                "reviewText": "This was my favorite brand when my son was born in 2018. I used Eco by Naty exclusively up until he turned 4. Then I got what seemed to be a new version of their pull-ups and got disappointed by the fit (too much material between the legs). When my daughter was born in January I got her Naty newborn diapers and the fit was way off, super wide and also loose in the back. I decided to give it another try 6 months later and got Naty diapers in size 3 (after trying and not liking Coterie) but the fit of size 3 was still disappointing. I do want to give them credit for their absorbancy, even though they are on the thinner side now; and I like that the surface stays relatively dry.",

Firstly I want to note that if making earth friendly decisions is important to you, there are MUCH better options than this brand. They are made with better plastics maybe than normal plastic diapers but there is no recycling, no composting, and no biodegrading planned with these. They are hardly a step up from the regular disposable plastic diapers. To top this off, I purchased these diapers additionally because out of the \u201cgreen\u201d options, these ones listed the smallest size as fitting 4-11lb babies. These diapers BEGAN fitting at 11lbs, and are strangely shaped so have never fit perfectly. So now that the baby is big enough to fit the diapers, she is big enough that the absorbency is inadequate for her. She is leaking through EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. These diapers have failed on every level. Eco friendly? Not really. Fit? Absolutely not. Absorbs? Nope.Please save yourself the time and frustration and buy a different brand.",

                "reviewText": "Don't bother using these until your baby is in at least a size 3. The newborn / very young infant sizes are trash. They are oddly shaped and don't contour to baby's body well at all, causing leaks and blowouts every. single. time.I didn't start using them right after birth with my twins ten years ago so I only had experience with the bigger sizes until my newest baby came. I was gifted a couple of packs of sizes one and two and size one was pure trash. Dumbest diaper ever. So poorly designed that it's actually unbelievable that they sell them. Size two was a slightly better fit, but still leaked and caused blowouts. And yes, my baby was well within the reccomended weight for the sizes. I accidentally ordered an entire box of size ones, but thankfully Amazon refunded me. Now I'm stuck with the worst diapers on the planet (that belong in the trash) because there is no way I would do that to a new mom so I can't in good conscience even give them to anyone.I grew frustrated with them, especially considering the price, and switched to cloth diapers. I am enjoying cloth diapering so much and as much as I loved Naty ten years ago, there is no going back from cloth.For those of you considering cloth diapers, KaWaii Baby pocket diapers are the best. Hands-down. Their great prices can't be beat and I find them to be even better quality than my more expensive ($20+ a piece) diapers. Nora's Nursery has beautiful colors and prints, but the quality is not nearly as good as KaWaii Baby and the elastic is way too tight. I have four of them and I hate them. I say that because Nora's is one of the best-selling cloth diaper brands on Amazon. Save yourself lots of time (and some money) and go directly to the KaWaii Baby Diaper site because they offer free shipping, but not on Amazon for some reason.Happy diapering!",

No rash from the adhesive strips cutting into groin area. HelloBello is another good premie diaper, but the material is not as soft as Eco. Love love this diaper!!",
