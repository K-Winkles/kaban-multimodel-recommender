                "reviewText": "I have a 30 lb 10 month old baby boy who squirms all over the place when I change his diaper. I can never get the tabs to close evenly or secure enough because he won\u2019t lie still for a second. The only way I can change him is if he\u2019s standing up which makes pulling the tabs across the diaper next to impossible without them being too loose or too tight. My son also has huge thighs and eczema on his legs so the tightness of a traditional diaper really irritates him. I seen these diapers and decided to try them and I\u2019m so glad I did. They stretch and move with my son as he crawls, stands and sits. They are easy to get off and on, I just pull them off like I would a pair of underwear. If he poops, I rip them open at the seams on both sides and change him how I would a regular diaper. There\u2019s a tab on the back of the diaper that when you pull it up it has a sticky side which keeps the diaper closed and contained for easy throw away. No issue with leaks what so ever. My son sleeps 11-12 hours through the night with the same 360 diaper and he wakes up dry every morning. During the day some times I\u2019ll see he has a little baby wedgie from playing and still no leaks. These are just all around awesome. Someone questioned the difference between these diapers and pull ups and the difference is a pull up won\u2019t absorb like this diaper in my opinion. When you compare a pull up to this diaper, a pull-up is thinner while this is the same thickness as a standard diaper.",

And I was getting so annoyed with the regular diapers because I could never put the sticky straps on correctly because she wouldn't still still! Well, these have saved me time and my nerves lol They go on like underwear. Sure, she still squirms but it's much easier to pull these up than putting the regular pampers on! She is about 17 lbs and wears a size 3. These daipers are super soft, super snug. They don't dig into the skin. They are pretty and very easy to put on and take off. Have not had any issues with #2. Some people have but not us knock on wood. It's the same thing as in any other diaper. I am so happy with these! I have ordered many boxes and not one diaper has been damaged - knock on wood.",

I bought a pack of regular pull-ups trying to solve that and they\u2019re NOT the same as these. These pull-up diapers come up further in the front and back, which is nice for little ones who aren\u2019t yet potty training (think poop that goes up the back). They\u2019re soft, stretchy, absorbent and have that slight Pampers scent to them. Have used them for a while now and will continue! This Amazon price is way better than what Walmart sells them for!",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered these diapers, I did not fully read the description. I thought these would be regular diapers. When they arrived, I was pleasantly surprised because we wanted to try pull ups and were under the impression no one makes pull ups in a size 3. As far as I can tell, P&G (Pampers) are the only pull ups that go down to size 3. As pull ups, they carry the advantages and disadvantages associated with pull ups.Pros:1) If you find putting on a pair of shorts on your child is easy, you will have no problems putting these on.2) You don't have to deal with velcro tabs. With regular style diapers, the velcro tabs stick to wipes, the new diaper you are trying to put on, and many other items that may be lying nearby. Although you can fold them back into place to prevent this, it's one more step required for changing.Cons:1) If you like to keep your child's pants on while you change a diaper, you cannot.2) It's quite likely the lack of tabs may make the diapers less ideal for certain body shapes.Experience:1) Fit/leakage: In our case these diapers fit beautifully. The baby seemed to walk better in them. Out of 74 diapers only two had minor leaks, but most of the time they held up well. Yes, they can go through an entire night if they are the correct fit. Note: We have not found a single diaper that hasn't leaked at least once. I would say these have been among the best.2) Sensitivity: Just as with with fit, each baby is different as far as skin sensitivity. We had no problems with rash despite the baby having sensitive skin.3) Ease of use: For us, the pull up design worked out perfectly.4) Some individuals complained the diapers tear apart too easily and will rip as you are trying to put them on. We never experienced that.Why 4 stars? When I reordered, I ordered Cruisers, not Cruisers 360. Personally, I feel Pampers should have given these diapers a completely different name or call them \"Pull Up Cruisers\" to make it more obvious what they are. As for the regular Cruisers, we have to use them until the 360s come in and I will leave a review once we've had some experience with them. Also, I haven't been able to find these diapers in a package count less than 74. It would be nice smaller packages were available to test them out first. (If you find they leak, maybe your baby/toddler just needs a different size.)",

                "reviewText": "One of our twins goes a LOT at night. I mean, A LOT! It's weird how much she goes at night. And, as a result, we couldn't find diapers that would not leak all over her, the jammies, the sheets, etc. It was a lot of yucky smells and laundry. Enter 360 diapers! Now, these babies aren't cheap, but we just use them at night. And, we started with the next size up initially, so it really helped. Since day one, these babies have keep my baby clean and dry at night. She's my sleeper and wants a full 11 hours every night, so it's a long time to ask a diaper to keep her dry. These are amazing.Cons: my less-wet twin has wet poops at night. Those seem to leak out of any diaper, these included. I still don't know how to keep that inside. But, it's a MUCH smaller/contained leak than she was having in regular diapers, for SURE!",
