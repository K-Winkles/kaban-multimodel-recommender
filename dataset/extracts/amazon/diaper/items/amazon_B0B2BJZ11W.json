I\u2019ve also tried Honest Co for years. The hello bello diapers are way softer than honest company and don\u2019t feel like recycled cardboard. They also don\u2019t leave behind \u201cfuzz\u201d and keep baby dry. I was very impressed and have made the switch!",

Other brands have him rashes, these have not! While they are slightly more expensive than pampers or Huggies, I feel they are well worth the extra money. Highly recommend!",

My 1 yr old needed a diaper change every 2 hrs because of leaks, and to top it off, he developed a rash so bad that it had blood oozing from it. Not sure what was in the diapers that caused it - switched right back to huggies. Wouldn't bother recommending at all .",
