                "reviewText": "EDIT- I have to eat my words from earlier. We\u2019ve been solely using these diapers for his whole life (6 months) and they are amazing and wonderful and I can\u2019t sing their praises enough. Not to mention- the company is incredible with customer service! The trick here is your baby will size out of these like a thief in the night- don\u2019t know how to else to describe it. It seems to fit fine but it just doesn\u2019t- you have to size up pretty early, earlier than the weight stated per size in my experience. As long as you do this they work like a dream!I was so excited to use these for my new baby. I try to be as eco-conscious as possible and avoid a lot of the toxic ingredients found in just about every single thing they sell is in America. This brand has made a step in the right direction as far as safety of ingredients and the capability of these diapers to break down naturally! I thought for sure I\u2019d use these the whole time for my baby. HOWEVER\u2026These diapers leak everywhere. Any time I put one on my baby he ends up covered in a mess. They do run bigger so I waited a couple weeks for him to even be able to wear the newborn size but even now they do not hold anything in. I\u2019m so sad, I really wanted to love these. The idea is wonderful, as is the softness and I love that they don\u2019t use ink and are plain white- but the functionality is just not there and I can\u2019t possibly use them.",

                "reviewText": "These diapers are the worst diapers I have ever used. They literally just leak pee right through them. It is as if my baby is just wearing underwear. I changed her diaper this morning and after literally one minute of her wearing the diaper there was pee on my bed. This is the 3rd time this has happened. I thought it was due to my not putting them on correct but this time I know for a fact I put it on correct. And literally not even a minute later it leaked though the bottom. Save your money and try a different brand.",

So i got these and the minute I felt the amazing softness and thickness of these I was blown away, then the real test was that she hasn\u2019t had one single rash at all and these are seriously the most luxurious diapers ever and they\u2019re the most gentle and earth friendly toss diapers you can buy, so buy them you\u2019ll love \u2018em!!",

Recently found out they began using bleach on their diapers. It\u2019s a sad day when even a \u201cclean\u201d company begins using harmful ingredients for our little ones. Will no longer be ordering and switching Coterie Diapers due to actually being clean ingredients.",
