She came home with a mild rash which was totally normal and expected and the pediatrician advised against regular baby wipes, suggesting I use washcloths in the meantime until her skin healed. I brought these into her next appointment and these received the pediatrician's approval. Her rash is clearing up as her skin isn't nearly as irritated when I use these dampened with water versus a regular wipe, they're larger, and they're softer. Just did a subscribe and save for these wipes as I use fewer of these wipes per nappy change and they're a better quality product than regular baby wipes. Wish I could buy them in cases of 1000 or more.",

                "reviewText": "For years I have been searching for the ideal disposable washcloth. I have tried all of the well-known brands, and a number of others, but none of them met my expectations. For a while I gave up searching, but then last week decided to look again because I really want to be able to throw a washcloth away instead of having to wash and dry it; and, most of all, because I consider that a single-use washcloth surpasses all others in terms of health considerations. I looked at a number of brands on amazon, and finally decided to try Medline Babysoft Sensitive. As soon as I touched the first washcloth to my face, I knew that I had found the product I had long been seeking. It is soft, yet strong, and works equally well moist or dry. I have just ordered more and intend to use them daily from now on.",

I'm expecting a baby in a little more than a month, so I wanted to try these out on myself before using them later and not liking them. They are super thick and fairly big, so much so that I cut them in half and that does the trick for me. I simply wet them with water and wipe solution and so far so good.I have also used them to clean up messes, and they are much better than paper towels as they can be rinsed and reused. Pretty handy overall, I already have a larger amount of the way!",

                "reviewText": "A family member discharged from the hospital recently needed dry wipes for sensitive areas when going to the bathroom. Medline is the brand used by the hospital and these wipes that I ordered are close to the product hospital staff used. But I believe they used the Medline \"ultra\" soft dry wipes. Regardless, these wipes do their job in helping clean sensitive areas without any irritation or debris left behind. You can use the wipes with a foam cleanser, like the one typically used by hospitals for cleaning different parts of the body as well. Keep in mind that the wipes are intended for single use, just as hospitals use them. I think I read a review where someone is rinsing them out, drying them and reusing (perhaps using only for wiping or cleaning skin.) I'm certain that reusing this product to cleanse with would not be sanitary. What is important about these wipes is that they will not fall apart during use, it is a durable material unlike strictly paper products that tear and can disintegrate. The smooth texture will ensure there won't be discomfort using them.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased to remove makeup. I was very impressed. I\u2019ve tried various other products like disposable cotton rounds, terrycloth rounds, but felt both were too small. My skin is super sensitive and I\u2019ve ruin many facial cloths over the years. The Medline baby wipes are perfect. They are so large in fact, I cut them in half. I can use them for eye remover on one side and facial remover on the other side. You can actually see the cloth come cleaner under water to wash your face again. This doesn\u2019t happen with a washcloth. As a full-time caregiver I also see other uses as a regular washcloth; a cloth to take in our purse when you might need a little refresher on the go and of course, as intended the perfect baby wipe for the tender bottom.",

My daughter cut each one into 4, which made them the size of baby wipes. At changing time we would dip in water, and use to wipe the irritated area. We will definitely keep a supply of these in the house.",

After ordering and trying 3 other brands, we went with these. They are very soft and larger in size so I can fold it in half and get the thickness I want. They hold up well when wet and are even the softest of all of them dry. Great wipe. Exactly what I was looking for so we went back and ordered the box of 500!",
