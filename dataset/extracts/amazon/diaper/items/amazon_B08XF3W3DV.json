This is my 3rd kid & I\u2019ve never had to change the bedding or put down a soaker cloth wherever the baby was laid. After 5 months of leaks I finally found these diaper extenders. Genius! They are soft, absorbant and best of all, they work! I have used them now for a week and they launder & dry well, retaining the shape and integrity of the item. Great customer service too! (One had a flaw and I messaged the seller. She replaced it immediately with no questions asked.) I\u2019m so glad some mama thought of this and took time to create it. It has changed my life! No more scared blow out moments. Just sweet diaper changes where I can tickle my baby. Not to mention, I\u2019m not spending time washing out all of her clothes while my other two kids are wreaking havoc. Seriously, worth the money.",

I tried flattening them back out w a heavy book post washing. They were also a bit overpriced given there were only 4 or 5 to a pack and we go thru 10 + diapers in a 24 hour period.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I really liked these. I used 3 of the 4 in the first day and appreciated that his clothes and the blankets were spared. However, instead of washing other items, I still had to wash these, so it didn't really save any/much laundry. Also, there were quite a few times that poop got on the extender but just barely, so I had to wash it but if it hadn't have been there, no poop would have come out the diaper anyway. So it created extra work when there wouldn't have been a problem in the first place.My major issue, though, is I couldn't figure out how to wash these without them sticking and rippng up other laundry. I tried a zippered laundry bag but it stuck and ripped at the fabric. I tried sticking it to a towel but it came free when wet. Just having it in a load of laundry meant it got lost and stuck to our clothes, which then seemed like they could get damaged by the velcro. I found these helpful for a bit but ultimately more of a hassle for me than not.",
