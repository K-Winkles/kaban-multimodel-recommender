                "media_text": "How many diapers will I change a day? In the first couple of months, you may find yourself changing diapers up to 10 times in 24 hours. Diapers should be changed whenever they are wet or soiled. Your baby will often (but not always) let you know. With a super-absorbent diaper like Pampers diapers, you can tell if it's wet by feeling for lumps in the absorbent material. Here are some common times for changing diapers: Right before or right after every feedingAfter every bowel movementBefore bedtimeWhen your baby wakes upWhen you go out with your baby Is there anything special I need to know about changing a diaper? Pampers diapers are designed to adjust to your baby's shape for a snug, comfortable fit. While changing diapers, there's no need to fold the waistband in or out or to adjust the leg cuffs. Keep baby products, such as powder, away from the fasteners so they maintain their stickiness. Place tabs parallel to the waistband and centered on the character strip. Use the characters as guides to ensure that the fasteners are evenly spaced. What size diaper is right for my baby? Just like you, babies like to wear things that fit just right. Choose a size that does not sag or gap, even as your baby crawls and plays. This will help prevent leaks. What\u2019s the best method to weigh my baby? The easiest way to weigh your baby is to first hop on the scale yourself. See how much you weigh, then see how much you weigh when you hold your baby. If you subtract your weight, you'll know how much your baby weighs.",

I tried honest, target brand, Huggies little movers , Huggies Little snugglers, Amazon brand, and none of them satisfied me. I finally gave Pampers cruisers a go, I was skeptical because I\u2019m not a fan of baby dry, but I love these. The fit is great on my daughter, it doesn\u2019t sag like other diapers. I can visibly tell the difference.I read other reviews that these were fake bla bla and not the same. I contacted Pampers to make sure that the ones on amazon are , in fact, aunthentic, and they are ! I received 4 different designs, of which , I had already seen because I had previously bought a 2 pack at my local Duane Reade. Also, Pampers mentioned they are in the process of working on the art work of the box so this is why the box has the older artwork. So people please, just do your research before assuming they\u2019re fake and making other buyers second guess! Go ahead and subscribe and actually save!",

                "reviewText": "I switched to cruisers from swaddlers when my daughter was just over a year. We use Pampers, and my baby has had a diaper rash exactly twice. I have two older children who I used store brand and Luvs with, and they got rashes all the time. They also had a tendency to squish out the sides.Pampers vs. other brands. Pampers may leak up the back on a rare occasion, but they NEVER leak out the sides. We have never had an issue with diaper rash with Pampers, but have with store brands. These fit very well on my daughter. I have only once pulled the tab off on accident while fastening, but the store brand diapers regularly pop those pesky little tabs off, rendering the diaper useless. Cruisers vs Swaddlers. Definitely a difference in outer cover softness on the cruisers. These feel more \"plasticy\" on the outside, but not the inside. Still soft. Cruisers are narrower between the legs which is important when baby starts walking. No more green line to tell you when to change, but the diaper looks full from the outside on cruisers. I think that is the channeling system that Pampers boasts about that gets moisture away from the skin.",

                "reviewText": "Why did I wait so long to switch from Swaddlers to Cruisers?? I was a 100% Pampers Swaddlers faithful. I had read other reviews of the horrific rashes and whatnot that can happen with the overnight diapers or baby dry...and that totally scared me from switching to anything but swaddlers. However one day we were completely out of diapers and only had access to some cruisers. I skeptically used them on my baby worrying the whole time. But they ended up working so much better than the swaddlers! Sure, these don't have the indicator line, but by this point we're all pee/poo experts. If it's squishy it's pee; if it's stinky it's a poo. I don't need a line to tell me that. The cruisers allow for more movement, and are less bunchy overall. It's basically just like the swaddlers but made for babies who crawl/walk/run. Also, the designs are so cute. I know, that isn't a functional aspect of the diaper, but it's just so much cuter than the plain ol' white ones. I've completely switched over to the cruisers. They even hold up better overnight. Not a single leak.",

                "reviewText": "Love these!I spent a lot of time researching and looking at forums, and even the Pampers website itself, because they honestly create a lot of confusion about what diaper is best for overnight, and has the most absorbency.When looking at the package for Pampers \"Baby Dry\", you assume that these must be the longest lasting - right? They show off the big clock indicating 12 hour protection/etc... Well -- that's not the case!From all the research I've done and read postings by official Pampers reps, both the Cruisers and the Swaddlers contain their \"Premium Absorbency\" -- (better than any of their other diapers). Soo... What's this tell you??? It was already known, due to their stretchy nature that the cruisers and swaddlers are best during the day, but it just so happens that they are the best for SLEEPING and long-overnight protection as well.So you can now purchase either these cruisers or the swaddlers and rest comforted knowing that they are the best for your little one, regardless of the time of day!If you want an example... I do serve as one. The reason I spent so much time researching this topic was because for a long time, I thought I was using \"the best\" - by using the \"Baby Dry\" diapers for my daughter overnight... Well -- it was a common occurrence for her to wake up soaked in the morning! It was depressing, because I thought we were using the best...Well anyway - after changing nothing else, we switched to the cruisers for all day and night, and maybe only had about 1 instance/example of a wet baby (or crib) in the last 2 months. I am a believer! Plus they smell good and fit well to boot!",

                "reviewText": "I felt compelled to write a review, because like many others, I was concerned I would be receiving \"counterfeit or low quality diapers\". I purchased two boxes (Qty 66 each) of Pampers Cruisers from the Big Red Dot store to compare before I received my Subscribe and Save order. When I opened the first box, I saw that it was the typical Sesame Street characters. I received the Subscribe and Save order the next day and was a little dismayed to see the patterns were NOT Seasame Street - it was the cameras, monkey, geometric shape design. HOWEVER. I opened the second box I had purchased from the Big Red Dot store and the designs were the same as the Subscribe and Save - cameras, monkey, geometric shapes etc. My Subscribe and Save were in brand new sealed boxes, and comparing the two designs I really didn't see, smell, or feel a difference. We only used Swaddlers up to this point and after 3 major leaks in 3 days, I switched to Cruisers. Pampers just changed designs. I can't say for the customers who received opened boxes or diapers in brown boxes, but the ones I received from Amazon were legit. So far, no leaks, no rashes, and these diapers definitely have the channels and hold a very good amount of pee. No issues with my order!",
