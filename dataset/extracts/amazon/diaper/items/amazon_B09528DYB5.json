                "reviewText": "Really good quality, very soft for baby skin. No rush or anything like that. I hate that fact we don\u2019t have a choice here in the US stores and in general there is only one brand (Pull Up) and there is big difference between this one and pull up. Really recommend this pants to everyone especially if your baby skin is sensitive or has allergies.",

Well child wears a 4 diaper and these are to long they go almost to chest and she is not short. They are also not wide enough on bottom. Even if a had sized down her whole bottom would be exposed. The only good thing about these are they really do work for sensitive skin. Where other brands tend to break her out these didn\u2019t.",
