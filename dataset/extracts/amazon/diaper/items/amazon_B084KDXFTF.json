I say this because he was definitely super tired and I knew he was not able to wake up to use the bathroom. Not only did these leak, they were like he had nothing on at all. Of course he was in my bed so I woke up soaking wet. The sheets, all the was through the mattress pad and onto the mattress. I have never seen such a failure of a product like this. Needless to say, we didn't try them a second night. They might be ok during the day if you are actively potty training.",
