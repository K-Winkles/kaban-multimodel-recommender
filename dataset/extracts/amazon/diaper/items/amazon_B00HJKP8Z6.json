                "reviewText": "Slide on diapers are a godsend. Whoever thought of taking the convenience of Pull Ups and making them into full fledged diapers was a genius. These are great for active, on the move toddlers who don't want to lay down for a diaper change. They slide on quickly and easily, and have easy tear sides for changing time. Due to the sides not being very adjustable, your kid does need to fit them right since adjusting is difficult and can hamper the ability of the diaper to hold together. They are wonderful for traveling, or when on the go, since the child doesn't even need to lay down to be changed. As is typical of Huggies, they run small compared to other brands (target up & up), so my son grew out of them quickly. A general complaint about all diapers is that many don't run to size 6. Not all toddlers are potty trained by the time they need a size 6. I don't know if these even come in 6s. If they do they are prohibitively expensive when target up & up has their own version of Pull Ups. We've since moved to those. But these are still great for people liking the Huggies brand and the convenience of a Pull up.",

                "reviewText": "I love these diapers. We are currently slowly potty training, but even if we weren't I would still love these diapers. Being able to just slip them on makes diaper changes to much easier with a toddler that is always on the go and doesn't like to stop long to get his diaper changed! It is also nice to have them for diaper changes if you are out and about...no more finding place to lay them down (my son HATES public changing tables). I love the tabs on the side for easy removal, and they can even be refastened if need be. These diapers seem comfortable unlike the regular \"Little Movers\" that would always leave marks on my son's legs. We have not had any problems with leaking/blowouts etc. Also-compared to Pull Ups...these are so much better!! They fit nicer, have better absorbency, and wrap up better. What I mean by \"wrap up better\" is that when I go to fold up a dirty diaper I like to use the side straps to wrap it closed. The Pull Up brands side tabs are facing the wrong way and you can't wrap up the diaper like you can with these diapers. Plus they have Mickey on them...win win.",

                "reviewText": "I'll keep it short because there are already lots of reviews on these.They worked for me. I've been through Luvs and Pampers (Pampers are good too, depending). These are way more convenient since they just pull up and they work very well during the daytime. Our kiddo is definitely a mover. He stays in one place only to eat and maybe when he's having a moment of \"chill\" a bit with mom or/and dad. But he's probably 95% walking around. Every other diaper that we've used after he started walking, which was when he was about 9 months, would ride out or experience leaks or very unnecessary blowouts because he just moves too much. We tried these and we haven't looked back. Not only do we have way, way less leakage in general but practically no blowouts. Very happy with these.My wife and I wanted to do cloth diapering for our son but decided it probably wasn't the greatest idea for 1st-time parents and I have to say for us it was the right decision. No amount of reading can prepare you for the amount of stuff these babies put out. I can easily imagine how much money we'd probably had lost because we'd have likely thrown out cloth inserts at the sheer grossness of some of these experiences. I would not want all of that in the washing machine, for sure.If you've used other diapers and had issues, I'd say give these a try.",

                "reviewText": "We've tried so many different diapers. Pampers, The Honest Company, Luvs, store brands, & of course, Huggies. I have to say, for the new babes, pampers swaddlers are amazing!!! I don't think I'd go any other route. BUT... If you have an active kiddo -- like I do -- then you gotta advance to the big leagues. My little guy was waking at 8 months, and hates diaper changes. We did the little movers for a while, and those worked perfect with his activity level. But when I saw that Huggies made slip-ons? I was in heaven!!! It made diaper changes a breeze! And it's good practice for big boy undies.Some points I'll address that were made in other reviews... The only way I'd compare these to pull-ups is the fact that they indeed pull-up. They are very absorbant! We haven't had a leak or blow out yet & we've been using them for about 8 months now. We use size 4 for my 2 year old, 25lb son. They fit perfectly. Not too big, not too small. My babe is lean, so if you have a sweet chunky hunk or princess, you may way to try a size up. I wouldn't recommend these for babes that aren't active & moving. For that, I'd recommend Little Movers or Snug & Dry (though S&D aren't my faves...).Lastly, subscribe & save!! And become an Amazon Mom member! You get them shipped Prime monthly & you save 20%. Totally worth it.",

We two year old daughter sleeps 9 full hours without a diaper change and we have only had maybe three leaks (which may even have been our fault for putting them on incorrectly).

I imagine if you have a child closer to the end of the weight range you might have to size up sooner than you would regular diapers. For us, it's great that they are snug and absorbent as other pull on styles are a bit loose on my daughter and we had some leaks as they also absorb less. These have the absorbency of a diaper and the ease of pull ups plus they are so soft and look pretty cute for a disposable diaper!",
