That o my made me happier. I am a first time mom and so far it is an adventure. I brought luvs diapers size 3 but they were too small and I brought size 4 and they were too big. So I went back to pampers and the quiz recommended that I buy parapets baby dry size 3. I was hoping it would be his correct size and it was. I was very happy. So his actual size is size three. He was a premature baby. I like pampers and even their wipes. Will get more this week coming up. They last a long time also. When they say baby dry yes definitely. Woke up one morning and he had peed a storm through the night, but no leakage at all.",
