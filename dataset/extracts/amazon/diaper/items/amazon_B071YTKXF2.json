They get pretty tight if closer to the higher size. Much better than the water absorbing swim diapers.",

We used a disposable swim diaper and put the Happy Nappy over top. No number 1 or number 2 leakage. I don't know if the Happy Nappy would be sufficient on their own as we did not try but they worked great with the disposable swim diaper underneath. These are easy to get on and fairly easy to get off. I expected them to be a little harder to get off once wet but they were not as bed as I thought. I would do the measurements for sizing as the seller suggests. The first order I went by age and it was too large. I quickly reordered the size down and it fit like a glove. I kept the larger pair because the grand baby will grow into the larger pair by the summer. I highly recommend these swim diapers.",

I will say that these seem to run very small, even taking into consideration the fact that they are supposed to fit snugly. The 3-6 month size is a perfect fit for my 3 month old, but definitely won\u2019t fir him through 6 months, maybe not even 5. My baby is smaller with a weight in the lower percentile rang for his age - I can definitely see the 3-6 month size being too small for larger babies in that age range. Definitely go by measurements for sizing on these.",
