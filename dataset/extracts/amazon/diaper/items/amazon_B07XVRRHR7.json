Hello bello cumple con esta funci\u00f3n, son pa\u00f1ales suaves, libres de fragancias, absorben muy bien, se acomodan perfecto a mis bebes y pueden desplazarse c\u00f3modamente. Hay otros m\u00e1s \"limpios\" de pl\u00e1sticos y esas cosas pero el precio es mas elevado.",

                "reviewText": "I thought these were going to be good diapers but honestly their cheaply made and a little over priced on quality. They are the same quality in my oppinion as no name diapers. I switch to Rascal and Friends couple dollars more and waaaaaaay better quality. As far as the hypo allergenic goes there was no issue but they don't absorb pee as well as other brands.",

However it does not hold up well over night, I usually change my little one half way through the night and after 5 hours this was soaked through. The material also was itchy on him. I wouldn\u2019t purchase this product again.",

When I would change my baby she was wet and the diaper looked like it had a puddle in it. Other then the cute print there is nothing great about these diapers. Would not recommend !",
