                "reviewText": "Highly, highly recommend these disposables. When I haven't had time to get thru my cloth diaper laundry, we will use these as backup. My daughter (size 4 in these) has never had a leak nor diaper rash, even when we use them overnight (12+ hours!). She is very sensitive to fragrances and non-hypolallergenic stuff but has zero issues with these. We switched from Dypers because they kept having issues staying closed, found these and never going back. Stop looking for eco-friendly diapers and just get these.",

                "reviewText": "I was drawn into trying these with a black Friday sale and the positive reviews but my experience has been totally different.Pros: They are very soft as advertised, and feel like soft cloth. Neither of my kids had any rashes while using them and they smtend to have sensitive skin. That's the only reason this is 2 instead of 1 star.Cons: I got these diapers in size 3 and 5 for my kids based on their weights and the sizes were totally off. The size 3 fit my 26lb 2 year old and the size 5 was enormous. I had to fold over the top 2-3 inches just to get the elastic under the legs not to sag and leak out the side. Then the fabric of the diaper would soak through in a few hours. I tried using them overnight as they advertised being good up to 12 hours and both my 3 month old and 2 year old leaked(soaked) through the seat of the diaper after 4-5 hours. They advertise moisture wicking which may make the diaper feel damp but this is soaking the children's clothes and their beds after a few hours. I have to change the kids every 2 hours in these diapers to not have wet clothes.",

Over it\u2019s made for baby to poo an pee in an it did the job just great will deff buy again.",

My son has leaked through two diapers every night since we bought these. When I get my daughter up in the morning, her bottoms are soaked after using these. Both kids can get through the night without leaking through their diapers using Honest Company, which is our usual go to. Another con is that they run a little big, unless the sizing of our 4s were wrong. They fit more like a 6. The size 3 fit more like a 4. Overall, due to the amount of diapers I have had to go through in a short amount of time, I will not buy these again!",
