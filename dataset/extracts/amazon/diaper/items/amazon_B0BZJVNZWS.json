                "reviewText": "We have had these for a week now and every night my son has leaked through this pretty bad. This morning he was completely soaked and the diaper was on snuggly. He is 2 and weighs 30 lbs, wearing size 6. These are cute in theory and love that they seem thinner and easier to wear, but the function is just not up to par with Pampers and other brands.",
