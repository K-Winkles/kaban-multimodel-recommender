Now the diaper is flimsy and thin and you think how the heck is this going to work but I\u2019ve honestly had no issues with it. These are better the Dyper brand diapers I got the same day. Luvs aren\u2019t my number one but they are pretty great for the price and being that they\u2019re you can pack a lot to take with you and not take up too much space. The smell I can do without I don\u2019t like scents but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s unscented luvs. I did the absorbency test now of course they don\u2019t hold nearly as much as my favorite which is Rascal and Friends but then again who the heck would leave a diaper on for hours? I know people don\u2019t like waking the kid up but if I hear my baby poop and I smell it I change them while they are asleep plus letting them sit in it makes them prone to have a leak because it can only take so much. That goes for any diaper don\u2019t let them sit in it for long periods of time and you can avoid an accidental leak with your favorite brands",
