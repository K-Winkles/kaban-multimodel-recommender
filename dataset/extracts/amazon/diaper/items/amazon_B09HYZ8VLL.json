Then one day I was at the store and just grabbed some Luvs. They were thinner than the other brands, so I was skeptical at first. But we used them and loved them. No issues, no leaks, great coverage of the poops. So for my second kid, we started with the Luvs. He wears these to bed and during the days. I don't think they leak overnight any more than some of the more expensive brands, even the ones specifically for overnight. Highly recommend not wasting your money on more expensive brands. These are great,",

But I ran straight here after what just happened.Imagine my horror when I realized a USED DIAPER ended up in the laundry? (It was just pee thankfully)I opened the lid and there on top was the diaper, bloated and angry. My heart SANK expecting to rewash that load all night trying to get the absorbent filler out of my clothes. But nothing. It didn\u2019t even break a little?!? When I tell you the washer was on HEAVY SOIL and it\u2019s a TOP LOAD WASHER!!! My friends\u2026 this is easily the most impressive diaper I\u2019ve come across. Further, it\u2019s so absorbent that I am now positive, based on the size and heft, neither of the twins will ever be able to pee through a diaper. I was already a subscribe customer, but I will tell this story when I start recommending them to others from now on.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Luvs off and on for the last four years and never had a glaring problem with them. Occasionally they've leaked but I have had the occasional leak from every brand I've tried so that's not a big deal. I recently updated our subscribe and save from size 4 to size 5 in Luvs. The box we got was the Paw Patrol design while previous boxes had been the earlier design and I don't know what they did, if it has to do with the sizing, designs, or what but the tabs on these are garbage. I've had several come off in my hand while trying to put a diaper on and on multiple occasions, one side has failed while my son was wearing it and the diaper came off. If they're cutting costs for my kids to be able to pee on Chase and Marshall then I really wish they would return to better quality and less recognizable designs. Unfortunately, I've got a box coming and we'll have to use those but I will be changing our subscription. Hopefully the quality improves soon because Luvs has always been a budget friendly and reliable option. I'm hoping I just ended up with a bad batch this first go around with the size 5 Paw Patrol diapers.One positive, no leaking as long as the diaper stays on.Update: looks like we had gotten a defective box! Which is a relief because I do like Luvs. I just wish I'd realized it sooner because the company has a 30 day policy about returning unsatisfactory diapers - according to the box. Will keep on keeping on with these.",

                "reviewText": "I have 4 kids. These are the best! We started with another brand. Then, you get to the point where your child tries to wrestle you everytime you change their diaper. If they rolled off the new diaper you are trying to get on mid diaper change, (of other brands) the diaper springs up and you lose. Back to square one. These are less springy so you can lay them flat and they stay like that so strapping them to a wiggle worm becomes much easier! Trust me! The easiest diaper to get on your kid. Also, we didn't have problems with leaks in these either. Luvs for life.",
