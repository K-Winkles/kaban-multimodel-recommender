We use the Huggies Special Delivery diapers for overnight. They are absorbant enough that they don't leak throughout the night. Sometimes when she wakes up she is so hungry that she wants to eat before I change her, and they still continue to hold up well. I love that most Huggies diapers have the pocket in the back of them, but for some reason they stop making them with a pocket at size 3 for the Special Delivery diapers. I wish the pocket was on every size. Other than that, I have no complaints/suggestions. I highly recommend Huggies, especially the Special Delivery diapers!",
