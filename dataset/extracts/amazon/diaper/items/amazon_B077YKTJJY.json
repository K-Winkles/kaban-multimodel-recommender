When it comes to the Happy Little Camper in our lives, natural is better, which is why we\u2019ve created baby products that are naturally safe and naturally better for your baby's skin and for the environment.\u200b This means that not only is your baby comfortable in Happy Little Camper, but also safe and free from harsh chemicals. Knowing the facts, consider making a better choice for your baby\u2019s bottom by making Happy Little Camper your go-to natural baby care brand. SUSTAINABLE DIAPERS - We source only the purest, sustainably sourced pulp and natural cotton which are all approved by Mother Nature. Feel good about using Happy Little Camper with plant-based ingredients! Why don't we include wetness indicator strips on our diapers? You know those little wetness indicator strips on your baby\u2019s diaper? Have you noticed that Happy Little Camper diapers don\u2019t have them? There\u2019s a good reason for that! While the wetness indicator offers the convenience of knowing when baby is wet, the strips are actually made out of harmful chemical dye. One of the Happy Little Camper promises are that our diapers contain NO dye, which is why there are no wetness indicators in our diapers. Moms and Dads, we\u2019re pretty confident that you know when your baby is wet without needing an indicator strip made of harsh dyes to tell you. Did you know that babies urinate up to20 times a day? This means that baby should be checked every 2 to 3 hours. Usually, wet diapers will tend to be heavy, you can either pad the diaper with a hand, squeeze it gently. When squeezing or padding the diaper, it\u2019ll be obvious that the diaper is wet from the moisture soaking the inner diaper layers. Opening up the diaper to double check is also advised and there\u2019s always the good ol\u2019 nose-to-diaper smell test! Happy Little Camper = No Dyes or Harmful Chemicals Happy Little Camper products do not contain harmful chemicals because our diapers +wipes are made with natural, hypoallergenic ingredients. We don\u2019t use indicator strips or any dye that can penetrate baby\u2019s skin and potentially cause harm to their fragile organs. Our products have been dermatologically tested, so you can trust that our diapers + wipes are skin-loving and safe for baby. What is diaper rash? Diaper rash grows in warm and moist places on your baby\u2019s bottom and appears in patches of inflamed red skin. A baby\u2019s skin is extra sensitive and can overreact to exposure to certain environmental factors and chemicals. Naturally, some babies have more sensitive skin than others and tolerate products differently. Common causes of nappy rash include; Diaper is not changed frequently enough, Skin sensitivity to harmful chemicals found in unnatural diapers and/or Change in diet/introduction to new foods Steps to limit the likelihood of nappy rash include; Changing your baby\u2019s diaper more frequently and/or Using natural products free from harsh chemicals. Happy Little Camper is super soft on your baby\u2019s sensitive skin there are no added fragrances, harmful dyes, and chlorine, latex, phthalates, parabens contained in our diapers. Our products are made of the purest, sustainably sourced pulp and natural cotton which are all approved by Mother Nature. What is Eczema and how is it caused? Eczema also known as atopic dermatitis is a very resilient skin condition that makes your skin red and itchy. One in five children develop Eczema with a large majority having an outbreak before the age of five. Eczema is long lasting (chronic) and gets worse the longer it is present making it harder to control. Your genetic background is a strong predictor of eczema. If both of your parents have it, there is an 80% chance that you may develop it as well. Eczema generally flares as a result of environmental factors including change in climate to either cold, dry conditions or hot, humid ones. This is because eczema affects the skins\u2019 ability to provide moisture and defend it from irritants, and allergens. In some cases, food allergies may play a role in causing Eczema, particularly in children. Our diapers are packed full of safe ingredients and nutrients to soothe and hydrate your baby\u2019s\u2019 sensitive skin. Most importantly, they are dermatologically tested and hypoallergenic meaning they are safe and soft on your baby\u2019s bottom!",

They had a chemical smell, my baby got a really bad rash, and five boxes of diapers I got from Coterie had stiff chunks of pulp inside the diaper.I did a bunch of research after that and wanted a diaper that was cleaner and actually non toxic; one that was not made with polyester. That's how I found Happy Little Camper.I was hesitant at first as I really wanted to go back to the old Coterie. But I tried it and I was so amazed! I wish we had switched earlier. My baby's rash cleared up, my bank account was happier, and I was amazed at how well the diapers absorbed.I did worry about blow outs or pee through because of how thin the diapers are, but we have been using them for 5 months now and haven't had any issues whatsoever. They hold so much liquid that when my baby sleeps 12hours, he still wakes up feeling dry.I highly recommend these diapers as a disposable option!",

They also do not fit very well. The \u201cVelcro\u201c does not stick very well to the front of the diaper. My daughter has had lots of leaks when she doesn\u2019t in other brands.

There are a handful of companies that make all of them & just put more expensive labels & price tags on the same models. Diapers are the same deal. I was buying crazy expensive ones called Attitude because they had a list of \"No\" 's I wanted to see & they are the only diapers I've found that don't leak by morning but they are over $1.10 a piece & we aren't in that income bracket to waste money like that so I kept hunting & tried these. They are exactly the same, same scratchy rough ruffles on the side, same amazing absorbing ability. Same back that goes practically up to their shoulders hahaha. I use these for night time but when I use up all the other lame terrible Honest company diapers I hate I will use these exclusively. Absolute best for the price I have found...yet.",

I have been trying a bunch of different diapers (especially more natural ones) I have found on Amazon since my daughter was born. She is 6 months now and so far these are one of my favorite brands of all I have tried and I will be going back to them when I finish up the Earth and Eden box I bought last (these are much better). These absorbed well, we never had a blow out or leak, they are super soft, and they are so adorable to boot!! What's more to love?? The owl design is adorable but I do think it looks a little more on the girly side but it really is meant for either gender. I used these in a size 2 so I'm not sure how well they would work with an older baby but for a younger breastfed baby they were PERFECT!! When I use them again as she grows I will update this review and I will also upload some photos.I rely heavily on reviews when deciding to make purchases on Amazon so I know how important they can be for shoppers. Therefore, if you found this review helpful at all, please mark it as helpful. Thanks and happy shopping!!",
