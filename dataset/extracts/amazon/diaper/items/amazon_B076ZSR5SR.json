When it comes to what I put on them, I'm very selective. Little Toes was recommended by a friend and Im really happy that I tried them. The print is gender neutral, the material is very soft and the absorbency is great. The tabs stay put with no issue on my wiggly little baby. I love that this brand has put so much effort into creating a functional diaper that is good for our babies sensitive skin! The bamboo fibers have so many benefits and are much better for our environment!",

                "reviewText": "I love the diapers so far, they seem to be the best natural diaper of all the ones we have tried. However I am only giving 3 stars because I would think if we are buying natural diapers we are people that care about the earth and our child's health but for some reason in the picture it looks like they come in a carring box but nope it is plastic. Why go to all the trouble if you are just going to wrap them in plastic, please rethink your packaging.",

                "reviewText": "Update:Once we finally got to ise them around the 10lb mark they were wonderful. Super absorbent, and did not give my son a red butt at all. He has been soooo sensitive to almost every brand of diaper we've tried. And yes we change him very often.I will have to update these once we actually get to use them. They are huge! No way are these going to fit my 6.5lb newborn. They say they will fit a newborn, but they are huge! I attached a photo of them next to a hello bello newborn sized diaper.",

                "reviewText": "I was becoming frustrated when my granddaughter was getting red, irritated skin from her diapers. Her parents and I tried many different brands, but even diapers that said they were hypoallergenic still caused redness. I went on Amazon and saw Little Toes and decided to give them a try. My granddaughter did not get red from these diapers and we are thrilled. Not only that, I am one of those people who drives a Prius, doesn\u2019t drink bottled water and who wants to in some small way contribute to caring about the Earth. When I saw that Little Toes were biodegradable, I was extra excited about them. I also like that these diapers feel softer than some of the other brands and so I am sure they are more comfortable for my granddaughter.",
