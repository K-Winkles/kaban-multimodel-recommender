My 8yo son is special needs (autism with IDD) he is a short and chunky little guy (100lbs) and it's hard to find a size that fits him. The goodnites brand in size xl were getting a tad small for him and are getting harder to find in my area. He is also extremely picky about the brands he will wear. If he doesn't like the look or feel he will not wear them. These are lightweight and fit perfectly. They do leak once in awhile but he is a heavy wetter and it mostly happens at night or in the am when he's held it for a long time. My older 10yo son (not special needs) has night wetting occasionally bc he is such a sound sleeper so he wears them once in awhile when he's had a lot of fluids before bed. They fit him perfectly as well and he is only 74lbs so the size is versatile. He also says they feel the most comfortable and closest to underwear compared to other brands. Another plus is that my order always comes early!",
