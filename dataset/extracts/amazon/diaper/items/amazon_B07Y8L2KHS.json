I tried these diapers a few times and found the opposite. There were many leaks both from the side and the back.The diapers are indeed very soft and pleasant to the touch. However, I think it depends on how wet the diaper becomes over the course of hours. My little boy has a very strong stream and can sometimes have very heavy wet diapers even after 2-3 hours. I found that Merries just didn't absorb that well compared to other brands.",
