                "reviewText": "I stopped using Parasol around 2019 when they changed the design to tacky, terrible prints. I just ordered a few weeks ago and can confirm the diapers you get from amazon are the new adorable design with big improvements including the pee indicator line and better waist elastic.I had been using Parasol since 2017 with my first and was really disappointed when they changed. Recently got an ad and saw they had reverted to super cute patterns and thought I'd give them a chance again. The new design is super soft, they hold well even overnight and have good fit for my second. During the interim I tried pampers and hello bello and I can tell the fit is greatly improved with parasol. The elastic area aroudn the waist actually stretches and the diapers don't sag like hello bello ones.Love the black and white new prints with the leaves and puppies. I like that they're unisex and minimal but I do wish there were more patterns to pick from.",
