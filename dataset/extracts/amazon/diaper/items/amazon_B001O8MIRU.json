Hope this helps but I will be purchasing this time and time again when it's pool time!",

Well the purpose of the swim diaper is not to stay dry (does an adult bathing suit stay dry!?). They are just thinner than regular diapers and less absorbent so they don't blow up and soak up half the pool. The other function is that they keep the brown and yellow stuff IN, which these diapers also do quite well. They're pull up style so they make a nice seal around the legs and waist. Sizewise our guy wears regular diapers size 3 and the small of these fits perfectly. He's about 18lbs w chubby legs. This isn't rocket science, folks.",

The size small did match the weight unlike the pampers brand of little swimmers, they held up for the whole day and helped not make accident leak out into the pool. The size will also fit her next summer. I didn't have to get another size even when she went up a diaper size. Definitely worth the price I only had to buy one pack for the whole summer and even shared a few with some friends! Still have some left over and we went swimming alot! I was also able to let them sit out and dry and reuse them! For times she was only in our pool for a few minutes \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

I was initially unaware of this and made the mistake of having my 2-year-old wear one to lunch before hitting the pool. It turns out, these diapers aren't designed for holding pee, so that was my oversight in not understanding their proper use.However, one positive aspect of swimming diapers like this is their durability. They don't disintegrate after prolonged exposure to water. My child found them comfortable, and there were no marks left behind after use, nor did she complain of any discomfort.",

                "reviewText": "I got these for my almost 6 month old grandson. He wears a size 3 regular diaper (he's a bit of a chunk) and this size is perfect. I had a hard time finding them in my Walmart/Target so it was just easier to purchase them from Amazon.I don't use them in a public pool as my daughter is wary of putting him in a public pool (I don't blame her). I have an Intex pool that I bought for him and I to play in so we don't have to worry about other babies not wearing swim diapers. I would be perfectly comfortable with him in someone else's pool wearing these (even without a vinyl diaper cover).I haven't tried any of the other brands of swim diapers but since these work so well I don't see the point.When first writing this review I was only going to give the product 4 stars because I thought I was going to receive Nemo diapers but instead I received pink Arial/Minnie Mouse design. I realized that isn't the product's fault so I didn't ding them on that. Amazon needs to fix the issue though since it is a Seller/Fulfilled by Amazon item.",
