Plus, a secure, comfy fit for less sag + more swag. What Makes A Clean Conscious Diaper? To make the core of the diaper, we harvest wood from sustainably managed pine + spruce trees in Scandinavia, which is then turned into fluff pulp at a Swedish mill using totally chlorine-free processing. We don't add latex, fragrance, or parabens. We use a 100% plant-based backsheet, and our new, more efficient design reduces the amount of material used in each diaper. Our diapers are cruelty-free and never tested on animals. Our diaper boxes are made from 100% PCR post recycled consumer cardboard (aka they\u2019re 100% recyclable) \u2013 that means no new trees cut down and no landfill, if recycled.",

I read lots of reviews as a new mom and tried lots of diapers. These are not only one of the few diapers that doesn\u2019t cause rashes on my baby\u2019s skin, but they also have never once leaked in the 5 months we\u2019ve been using them, there are never faulty diaper tabs like other brands, and they are very cute! The diaper rash he had in the NOCU immediately went away when we switched to these diapers. When I ran out of Honest and went back to pampers for a week, the rash came back but again went away right away with Honest diapers. Honest also has the best wipes fyi!!! Take my word from a mom who reads every review and tries everything so you don\u2019t have to!!",

Him and I get ALOT more sleep now that I don\u2019t have to wake up in the middle of the night to change him.Appearance- There are so many patterns that it\u2019s hard to pick which one I\u2019ll put on him (this is the only down side lol). All the doctors and nurses that have seen us change him during a visit are so stoked about the designs that they ask the brand and where they can get them - whether for their own baby, or to gift. Right now my favorite is the skulls. They are cute and cool.",

My son is basically a broken firehydrant when he sleeps and completely fills the diaper. But unlike other brands, they don't through the diaper and they don't leave that gel stuff all over.Highly highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "Maybe it's the way our baby is shaped but we had many leaks with Pampers Swaddlers once our little guy started really soaking diapers. We'd been given a couple packs of newborn Honest diapers as hand-me-downs so we gave it a shot and now it's all our baby wears. Sure we still have the occasional blowout (who doesn't?) but the only urine leaks have been due to human error (remember to make sure the penis is INSIDE the diaper). Honestly, the blowouts have only happened to my partner so maybe those were human error too, haha. These diapers are great. They're absorbent, they trap those liquidy breastmilk poops well, and they're super cute. I wish they cost a little less but if you stock up during sales they're not too bad.",
