Enter, Babyganics. I did not realize they have SAP gel, or what that was; I thought it was pure plant matter inside. The bamboo based diapers are supposed to be a much greener choice, but my girl is almost potty trained, so I am sticking with these til then. She is a reverse cycling cosleeping breastfeeding baby & drinks milk every 1-2 hours overnight; these diapers keep her dry, no leaking (maybe we should send some to the White House)! Best of all, no diaper rash for my sensitive girl.",

With two babies in diapers, working within a budget but wanting to be careful what I put on my babies sensitive skin I have found that the only diaper that works for us is Babyganics.We tried many other products to find the right fit, pampers, parents choice, huggies, honest company, and a few dye free organic options but we found all of these brands ( with the exception of Honest Company ) just didn\u2019t hold up over time and would feel damp on the outside of the diaper soon after a pee pee happened, which to me grossed me out as a mom... just thinking about my kids in a wet diaper and then that wet diaper making their clothes damp as well. For me diapers should retain and contain moisture and the only two diapers I found to do this incredibly well were honest company and Babyganics. In store the prices seem comparable however where honest falls out is the amount of diapers you get in a box as compared to Babyganics. So for the best price and best quality the best choice for you would be Babyganics. Very happy with their diapers and recommend to all!",
