These things over time can cause issues so why even start with them!The best thing for the environment are cloth diapers but for convenience these are great and the company is working toward making things better so I'd rather support a company like Seventh Generation than some of the others.The diapers have good fit and leak guard. They are designed also to keep baby's skin dry to cut down on rashes.Overall these are great diapers.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks",

The diapers are very soft and stretchy which is great for adjusting it to different size thighs and bellies. The arent restricting at all and overall seem comfortable, so they will definitely be one of our top go-to brands of diapers.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using these diapers for a few days and so far they have been great. My very active 14 month old is putting them to work while climbing, running, and rolling around; we haven't had an unfortunate mess yet. The diapers are super soft while still feeling like they will hold up. I like the stretch of the waistband and how secure the tabs are. Some diapers have tabs that get shifted out of place with a lot of scooting or flopping around, I haven't had that experience with these. There is no wetness indicator which I can of miss, but I will gladly give that up for the quality that these seem to be. I like that the lining that goes around the edge doesn't seem to irritate my kid's leg. We haven't had any blow outs or overnight leaks, so we are highly satisfied with these. My child sleeps through the entire night and if a diaper disaster compromised that I would be devastated.",

                "reviewText": "I persoanlly am a huge fan of seventh generation brand. I had never tried the diaper line before receiving this box of size 4 diapers for my son. He is about 2 years old and this diaper fit him perfectly. The pattern is super cute as well. He sometimes has some sensitivities to diapers and wipes. He did not have any reaction to these specific seventh generation diapers so if thats a concern for your, you have nothing to worry about with these ones. The quantity was also very generous which I truly appreciate, I prefer these boxes of diapers instead of smaller quantities. Opening and closing the tabs are also easy and not complicated.",

Nothing worse to me than deodorized stinky diaper changes. These diapers did not irritate my baby's skin. They have all the features of other premium diapers. Love the giant pack for longer times between ordering. Definitely recommended.",
