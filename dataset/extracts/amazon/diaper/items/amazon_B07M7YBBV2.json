                "reviewText": "We were in a quick need for diapers, since I am a mother of 7 and currently have no vehicle to get to the store to purchase the diapers we usually do. I decided to take the chance to purchase these. The price was right and I was able to get them quickly. In the end result I liked the diapers. They held up very well. My daughter that I purchased them for is a water fanatic, living on the river, she has access to go swimming whenever we go outside. Problem is she likes to go in right after getting a new diaper on. Typically when she goes in with the diapers I usually get for her they like to soak up all the water and expand making her more prone to getting rashes and such, and biggest problem is the waddling. With MADE OF Baby Diapers she is able to go in and out of the water with no problems. The diapers soak the water nicely to where they don't expand and make it a nuisance for her.These MADE OF Baby Diapers were a great purchase and hold up to their description. Sizing was perfect, they absorb nicely. When the description says they are unscented. They are 100% spot on. I do not like purchasing diapers that have fragrance. There were no designs on the diapers, just a simple white. They withheld overnight with no leaking or rashes.Ultimately we loved these diapers and will purchase again when needed for a 5 month old. Since purchasing these diapers my now 3 year old that we purchased them for is now potty trained. These diapers are great for those that have sensitive skin and don't mind plain white.",

                "reviewText": "So my 5 month old goes to the bathroom. A lot. I\u2019m sure yours does too. Well, in these five months, we\u2019ve gone through a truckload of diapers. We started with some free Huggies from the hospital. Then a pack of Honest diapers (ps they suck and leak big time, avoid) and then a big box of Pampers gifted by a friend.But being the environmentalist, grass-eating, annoying vegan that I am, I felt that our kid should be crapping into the least hazardous, least environmentally impactful diaper possible. Here\u2019s where MadeOf comes in.They are organic / cruelty free / plant based / EWG / NSF certified (look, these take effort to get, gotta give credit) and if you\u2019re super anal about sourcing they\u2019re also ISO9001, PEFC, and SA8000 certified. This means from the very base materials they aren\u2019t f\u2019ing over the planet or the people in it. You can\u2019t get much more tree-hugging than this, unless you did the cloth diaper route and that\u2019s just gross, no thanks.These fit GREAT, don\u2019t leak (my kid pisses like a prize pony and craps like a gorilla), and I know they\u2019re basically the cleanest thing I can wrap him in.If you\u2019re concerned about the environment or having your precious little boo boo only have the cleanest and most ethical diaper possible, you\u2019ve found it. A+ would soil again",

They\u2019re effective, but had an odor like rubbing alcohol? Not sure what it was; I have a sensitive nose, but my mother-in-law noticed it too.",

My son is very sensitive to conventional diapers and I have yet to find any natural pull-ups that don't irritate him or that actually do the job. The kid sleeps like a log and doesn't always wake to potty so I have been using these for overnight. Soft, snug, stretchy, no weird smells, no rashes. Seem to run slim/small, probably not perfect for thicker kiddos, they just fit around my little string bean of a boy (In pants he is still 2-3T in waist while 5 in length) Cuties in size 6 are big on him. His best fit pull-ups are Honest Co 3t-4t",

They\u2019re not as soft as other brands I\u2019ve used in the past and they are very simple in their appearance. I don\u2019t mind the simplicity in the design, but I do love diapers with cute designs. Even just a number on the diaper rather than the tab to identify the size. I\u2019ve also noticed wetness signal line does not go down the center of the diaper, it is a little to the left. Overall, I would say that these diapers aren\u2019t bad but could use some improvement. They seem to run a bit small compared to other brands. I\u2019ve included a side by side comparison of the Size 6 Made Of Diaper and a Size 6 Luvs Diaper.",

I am quite impressed with these! They have a very light, clean/fresh scent to them. They are SO absorbent! I put them on for the night on Friday night - we had a 6ish hour stretch before my little one woke up to be fed and changed. His diaper was pretty wet, but he was completely dry! I feel like they run a tad bit smaller compared to Pampers and Huggies size 4. They are just plain white and have a wetness indicator strip across the middle. Some fun designs on them would be nice! Overall, my experience with these diapers has been excellent. I would buy these again for sure.",
