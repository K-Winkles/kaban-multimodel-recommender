                "reviewText": "My son breaks out in rashes when we use the regular \u201cPull-Ups\u201d brand. We used Dyper briefs for a while and really loved them, but with inflation everywhere, they were kind of expensive. We only use them at night, and he\u2019s often dry, so I used to re-use the dry pull-ups for the next night to save money. I feel like Hello Bello really had the best of both worlds - it is much more affordable, easy to find, and almost as comfortable as Dyper.The one thing I don\u2019t like about it is how gender specific the colors & themes are (BTW, little boys love cats and girls like dogs sometimes! Plz don\u2019t make them all dogs for boys). It also frustrates me that it\u2019s harder to find boy colors in the smaller sizes. Like you have to be 3 or 4 to be potty training a boy? That\u2019s gender discrimination. If you expect it\u2019s going to be hard to potty train a boy, it most certainly will be - because it\u2019s what you expected & projected. Please either make the colors more gender neutral or consider making them less stereotyped!",

They are absorbent, leak the least (yes there are still some leaks) and well priced. There are other brands that cost twice the amount that don't hold as well as these. Granted, each kid is different but these have been the best option for us. Wish there were more print options but that's the only complaint. We'll continue to use these until not needed anymore.",
