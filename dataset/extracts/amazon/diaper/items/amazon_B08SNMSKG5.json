My children both were very comfortable wearing these to sleep. leaking incidents rarely happen and when they do its usually because the easy up has been on for over 12 hours (overnight.) The easy ups also come off easily by tearing the 2 side seems, which makes it so much easier to use.",

                "reviewText": "Just when my 4 year old started refusing nighttime diapers I found these! I liked everything about them including the design because my daughter is obsessed with the ponies. The ruching on the sides is more comfortable than the resealable Velcro and actually stays in tact better. If you need to take them off and on you have to do it over the feet tho so there's the sacrifice. But well worth it for us because she doesn't wear them all the time, because she's mostly potty trained. When we go for a long car ride or a long day out around the city or something I put her in one to be safe, especially because she doesn't like public bathrooms. So I was using these during the day and using Huggies overnight diapers for overnight. However I was looking for a pull-up style overnight because my daughter started refusing diapers altogether and demanding to wear these to bed because they're much more comfortable. I gave in and there were some times she couldn't get to the potty in time during the night and went in these. They didn't leak!!! As I searched for overnight pullups these popped up and I actually see that they are designed to be worn at night as well!! They are 12 hour safe. So it was nice I just put her in these at night too! She doesn't go through a ton but maybe 5 per week so the value is great. I got the boy version for my 3 year old which are the PJ Mask characters and he loves those as well and doesn't leak either. Overall thrilled to have these and will use with my baby on the way much younger now with him, probably start him on these at 1!!",

                "reviewText": "Oh, Pampers Easy Ups, where have you been all my parenting life? These training underwear for girls are like the superhero capes of potty training \u2013 making the journey from diapers to big kid undies a breeze, or should I say a gentle breeze of floral freshness.Let's talk about convenience. These Easy Ups are easier to put on than my socks, and that's saying something. It's like a tiny victory every time my little one decides it's potty time, and we don't have to wrestle with complicated diaper tabs. I swear, these training undies practically pull themselves up \u2013 maybe there's a hidden pair of helping hands inside. If only adult underwear were this cooperative!Now, let's address the elephant in the room \u2013 the adorable designs. Pampers, did you hire a team of toddler fashionistas to create these prints? My kid thinks she's wearing a wearable art gallery, and I have to admit, I'm a bit jealous. From princesses to animals having dance parties, these Easy Ups turn potty training into a fashion show. Move over, Paris Fashion Week \u2013 we've got Potty Fashion Week in my house!And can we talk about the absorbency? It's like these training undies have a PhD in handling little accidents. They've saved my couch from more mini floods than I can count, and I'm convinced they come with a built-in magic shield against leaks. Pampers, are you sure these aren't made by wizards?But let's not forget the star of the show \u2013 the \"You Did It!\" indicator. This is like the toddler version of a gold star. When my little one sees that magical disappearing design, it's like she just won the potty Olympics. I've never seen someone so proud of a wet diaper turning into a dry one \u2013 it's like witnessing a magical transformation, complete with a toddler victory dance.In conclusion, Pampers Easy Ups Training Underwear for Girls are not just undies; they're a parenting sidekick. They make potty training feel like a walk in the park, a park filled with laughter, adorable prints, and a touch of magic. If you're on the potty training journey, these Easy Ups are the golden ticket \u2013 or should I say the golden pull-up \u2013 to success. Diapers, meet your stylish and absorbent successor!",

He can even wear them overnight without a worry of leaking. They are easy to pull up and down and I imagine when he is ready they should make potty training a breeze because of this. Another great thing about these training diapers is that they have a few larger size options. My son is about 30 pounds and still fits in the 2t/3t size. He also fits in the 3t/4t without leaks as well, so I do not have to worry about the awkward transition between sizes when the time comes.",
