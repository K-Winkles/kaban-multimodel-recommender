                "reviewText": "My baby does great with these, she seems to have allergic reactions to all the other ones I buy even the \u201cnatural\u201d kinds, she will break out into a bad rash quickly because of her eczema. So these are very gentle for her skin. I also like that the big box isn\u2019t a character design instead they have cheeky little quotes \u201cthese rolls are homemade\u201d \u201cI woke up like this\u201d they\u2019re too cute. These are super affordable, I can get an entire box worth and the average to about 17 cents per diaper, she\u2019s exclusively breastfed and goes through many diapers a day so it really helps to have a lot of diapers on hand and make less trips to the store. A tip for all diapers, size up to avoid blowouts, if my baby has more than three blowouts in a week I size up, I like them to fit just over the belly button and high on the back....I\u2019m not sure why others take stars off because they\u2019d prefer their children to be sitting in a dirty diaper for 4+ hours on end, diapers should changed as often as a child needs to relieve themselves not when the diaper is at max capacity of urine and feces.",

I downgraded from huggies and pampers since they were a bit expensive but only use those for night time as they are very absorbent.
