                "reviewText": "These diapers completely exceeded my expectations.. we\u2019ve always used parasol brand diapers with our oldest since they were the only diapers we could find that my first son didn\u2019t blow out of as a baby. We literally tried every single big brand diaper (pampers, huggies, huggies special delivery, luvs, honest..etc) and parasol were the only brand he didn\u2019t blow out of. They just happened to be non toxic as well.All that to say, parasol doesn\u2019t make newborn size diapers so I went on the hunt for a non toxic newborn diaper option for our second baby and came across these! I didn\u2019t want to spend a fortune on coterie or super so I decided to hesitantly give them a go and could not be more pleased!!!They absorb so much without getting soggy and gross. My 3 week old hasn\u2019t leaked out once during his 7 hour stretches at night, they hold explosive poops so freaking well. The synched band on the back of the diaper really helps too. The material of the diapers is super soft and the designs are minimal, which I like!Overall, it\u2019s a super well made, high quality diaper for a great price and it does an exceptional job holding all the things in! If you\u2019re on the fence, go for it and give them a go!",

                "reviewText": "Due to price fluctuations on Amazon, we did a little research to get the most bang for our buck, when we came upon these. If you are familiar with Luvs or even Amazon's Mama Bear diapers, Earth's Eden are a little thinner which I like because it doesn't look bulky underneath pants. No scent which is great for sensitive skin/personal preferences. Baby is currently sick and has had multiple bowel issues. There have been a couple times I thought for certain I was about to handle a blow-out; though close, these diapers held up pretty darn well!My only complaint is urine is not absorbed throughout but rather bunches in on area. Not a deal breaker in my opinion.",

We tried to be ok with pampers pure because they \u201caffordable\u201c but after reading the ingredients & picking off the SAP plastic balls off my son I couldn\u2019t stomach it as a conscious mom. I tried the bamboo dypers as well and after a pee they just feel damp! I can\u2019t afford coterie or healthy baby ( especially rn as a newborn ) but wanted a clean option\u2026 I LOVE these, no rash, they keep my baby boy dry to the touch, I haven\u2019t had any blowouts! They are more affordable than the \u201c cheap \u201c ones like pampers or Huggies! They are ECF , I wish they were TCF but that\u2019s prolly why they are budget friendly. I gave myself a migraine and for 3 days read ever diaper review , googled ingredients and searched the EWG website and these are the only diapers that are cost friendly and skin friendly despite being only ECF \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc thank you Earth and Eden ! If your hesitant just try a box!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these when Honest diapers went up in cost on Amazon. They do a good job and keeping pee off baby's skin and are soft. No smell to them, which is good, and don't seem to irritate baby's skin. Have also had very few blowouts or leaks in these. The one thing I dislike about them is that they don't do a great job of distributing pee -- it all gets absorbed in one place. So, often when my daughter pees, even a little bit, we will have a big bulky spot at the front of the diaper where she peed and the middle and back portions of the diaper are dry. Having this bulky part makes it uncomfortable for baby, so I find myself changing her diaper more often in these than I do with the Honest diapers. If it weren't for that issue, these would be perfect.",

Only color/ design on diaper is the front tab.",

I like that it\u2019s white, so no print is getting in the way of yellow/blue line, we had zero blowouts, and my baby\u2019s skin is fine.Would recommend",

                "reviewText": "If I could rate it a zero I would. There is nothing like picking up your 10 month old who has just awakened to find them 100% soaking wet with poopy pee. We gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe we put it on a little too loosely. But after the 5th night of putting them on perfectly and waking up to a soaking wet baby, we know it is the diapers. Our 10 month old has had maybe 3 diaper rashes since birth. She has now had 3 just since starting these diapers. I was so hopeful that they would work well because we wanted a more natural diaper for a reasonable price. We were very disappointed. Will be going back to the honest brand. It is worth the extra cost to not have my baby soaking wet every morning.",
