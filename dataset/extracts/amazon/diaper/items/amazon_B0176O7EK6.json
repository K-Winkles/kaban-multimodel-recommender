Anyone who has experienced a diaper blowout knows how awful it is to deal with, especially if it happens in the car or a public place. Cleanup may be as simple as changing your precious little one's diaper and clothes, or as extensive as buying a new outfit and steam cleaning everything around the epicenter of the incident. Either way, it's unpleasant and something that should be avoided if at all possible. BabyBackups are the best solution for keeping your #1 priority's \"number two\" exactly where it should be. While other products trap the mess between the baby's skin and the product, BabyBackups eliminate messy cleanups and embarrassing situations by keeping liquid where it belongs, in the diaper. Whether at home or on the go, protect against diaper blowouts with BabyBackups.",

Our daughter has tried different brands of diapers, but none of them have completely contained the mess, especially when the little girl is taking a nap. We figured we would give these BabyBackups a try, and we couldn't be happier (especially Grandma, if you know what I mean). We haven't had an incident since we started using them.I also started buying these for clients whose children became parents. Talk about a great conversation starter when your proud grandpa or grandma becomes a grandparent - especially since grandma (always) knows best! Inexpensive way to \"entertain\" a client, too!",

I bought it for the occasional trip to the store, hoping that it would stop any \"messes\" from leaking out the top of our daughter's diaper while away from the house. There were a few occasions when I heard a noise that made me think I'd be throwing the stroller away, but to my surprise/delight everything was contained. These things work so well that we use them regularly to help save an outfit change or two during the day. The pad is super easy to use, stays in place, and does what it claimed it could do--stop blowouts up the back of the diaper. Until things change in the diaper department, we'll be using these pads on a daily basis!",

I bought them because my daughter has multiple poop blowouts a day and so I researched and bought several options to try to prevent soiling and ruining so much clothing. These pads only work for us if we use 2 or 3 at once (lined up side by side and sometimes a third above the first two, see photos).Also I noticed they only work with some diaper brands, that rise higher up the back (for us, they fail with every diaper brand we've tried except pampers pure). Even when we use 2 or 3 of these, they only stop the blowout 80% of the time.When she just pees, I can remove the pads and the adhesive will work again on another diaper or 2.Overall, less dirty/ruined laundry for me, but they should definitely be made longer and larger and with more in the box.",

The pad prevented a messy back poo-splosion during an airport layover-- worth the money for that alone. Adhesive strip easily affixes pad to back of diaper. We prepped diapers with pads ahead of time, so they were ready in diaper bag when needed. An un-soiled pad can be re-used by carefully peeling it off an otherwise dirty diaper. A little expensive for everyday use, but definitely worth having along on road trips.",

These actually work and have saved so many shirts and quite a bit of frustration! The only thing is that I wish a bit more came in the box, but you can reuse one of the backups (given it's clean) two or three times if you remove it without ripping too much diaper off with it. Now baby doesn't have quite as many blowouts at four and a half months, but they still do happen on occasion, which is where these things have been a lifesaver. I like to use these when we go on car rides, out in public, and when he is laying down for sleep overnight. I highly recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "Before we flew for the first time with our twin girls, the biggest advice wa to bring an extra change of clothes for the babies and ouselves. This was often followed by the horror of an on flight blowout that was less than appealing to other passengers. I saw these and was curious so I got them on a whim. First of all, my wife is skeptical of all things with grand promises and it took some convincing her to let me use them. On our short flight from Seattle to L.A., the unspeakable happened. One of our daughters made the \"super-pooh blowout face\" followed by the all familiar \"this will be a messy change\" smell. I went to change her and expected to change out her clothes too but it was not needed. The poop traveled up her back as usual but the extra cover kept it from \"over-flowing\". My wife didn't believe me till she had to change our other daughter and got the same results. We now use these not only on flights, but long car trips, hiking or fancy events where the girls are in a dress... like their baptism for instance. Now it may not help for the \"side blowouts\" that come out the leg, but for us that only happened when we improperly put on a diaper or when the girls were starting to grow out their diaper size. Seriously, these things work and you be so thankful when you see what disasters these things avoid.",
