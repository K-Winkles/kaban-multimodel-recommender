These diapers are very soft on her sensitive skin and don\u2019t rub or leave redness like other brands such as pampers pure or honest diapers do.

They have the gusset at the back that prevents most blowouts as well as larger ruffles around the legs that help do the same. We like how narrow they are in the crotch, as they bunch up less.The only issue I have after using these for a few months is that there is a very distinct, chemically smell to them. We actually ended up at the urgent care thinking our daughter had an UTI. All of the tests came back negative. It turns out my super-powered mommy nose was just picking up the smell of the diaper mixed with urine, as the smell goes away if we try a different brand on her.Now that I know it\u2019s just the smell of the diapers, we\u2019ll keep using these since they work great for the price.",

Sure, they are more expensive, but as the saying goes \"You get what you pay for\". Right now I am paying for these. Honestly, I have personally witnessed less waking up in the middle of the night, less crying due to soaking wet diapers, and most of all a happy baby, son, and daughter-in-law. The price is worth it.",

I have used Babyganics for over 6 years on on my three other children and am highly disappointed by these changes in the new diapers. They leak more often, are less absorbent, feel cheaper, and baby doesn\u2019t like. I\u2019ve been able to find a few packages of the original babyganic diapers, but will have to find natural alternatives in the future for my fourth baby. Very disappointed",

                "reviewText": "After trying a few different diaper brands, we began using Babyganics primarily due to the softness of the fabric and the durability we saw from the diapers. Couple this with the fact that they are made with plant based materials and have a wetness indicator unlike some other brands, and this is the winner.Terrific fit and full satisfaction from the product. If you value comfort for your baby and are interested in a more organic diaper alternative, Babyganics is the best option we have found out there.",

Then I opened the box and realized there\u2019s no wetness indicator, they\u2019re not very soft, the sizing runs small (she\u2019s 16 lbs) and they feel cheap. These feel the same as the up and up brand diapers at target which are a quarter of the price. Very disappointing. Not worth the money.",
