The first time I thought it was baby sweat but since I learned babies don\u2019t sweat (mine is 2 months), I realized it\u2019s pee that has been soaking his back or his bottom leg area. So far it\u2019s happened 3-4x, I realize now why the Hello Bellos were fully stocked at the store while the Huggies were not. Don\u2019t waste your money!",
