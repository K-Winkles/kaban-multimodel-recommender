                "reviewText": "These nighttime diapers are a game changer! We only use huggies diapers, and were sizing up for nighttime, but if the boys slept a little later in the morning, they would wake up soaked. We started using these night time diapers, and are still sizing up, and we never have leaks even with sleeping on their tummy. Make sure you are sizing up at least one size, sometimes even two sizes if they are on the cusp of needing daytimes upsized soon (ex. my boys are almost out of size 3s during the day and will be moving to 4s soon, and right now we are in size 5 at night). Even if they feel a little big, and the straps are overlapping, it is okay, just make sure the part around their legs are pulled snug!! Side note, its amazing these last all night because my one boy wakes up to feed throughout the night a few times, and my other two are fed with a feeding tube all night long. So these diapers are HEAVY in the morning!!",
