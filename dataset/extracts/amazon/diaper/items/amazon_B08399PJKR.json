It just won't last through the night.I'm conflicted because my daughter has sensitive skin so I can't switch her to pampers/huggies. And I JUST received a big pack of these diapers that's supposed to last me for the month! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude11! I feel like I just wasted my money!Original post:I love these diapers!! They are VERY durable!!! The band is so hardcore, in the 4 months we've been using them, I've only had 1 diaper band rip! (Vs the at least once a week with pampers and Huggies).My only regret is that I wasn't doing the subscribe and save until now! :(The diapers are wonderful and they are the ONLY thing I use for my daughter!I definitely recommend it!",

They do run a bit smaller but that was ok with me because my baby is petite. But even though they are very absorbent, they don't take away the wetness from my baby's skin like other brands do. They also sometimes tend to get loose as time goes by. It doesn't happen with every diaper in the packet though so I don't really know that it's on purpose. They never fell off or anything but that was always one of my fears. I went back to the brand I was using and my baby was back to being a bit more comfortable than she had been these past couple weeks that we\u2019ve been trying these diapers out. I am still very happy we got to try these out because they do have lots of potential. I wish they would have worked for us.",

                "reviewText": "These diapers have treated us well! They are comfy, work well, soft and cute. Aside from amazon mama bear, they are usually the cheapest, semi-environmentally-friendly diaper. We have used these for about a year and tried mama bear - we like these better despite the slightly higher cost. We had less issue with diaper rash and less issue with any leakage. These seem to be better fitted to our kiddo\u2019s shape. I also don\u2019t like the waist on the mama bears (although if you like huggies you might feel otherwise). I appreciate that seventh generation set the standard that amazon has to beat and, in my opinion, they haven\u2019t done it yet. So I will continue to fund seventh generation in hopes that they keep innovating!For further info: We\u2019ve gone thru 6 brands in total and some cloth diapers bc I bargain hunt. Bambo and babyganics but I like these better. New Bambos are outrageously expensive and I just can\u2019t justify it. Babyganics feel like they are made of cardboard and i had to crumple them before putting them on my baby to soften them up. Pampers were great for our newborn but pretty awful for the environment and didn\u2019t offer anything that seventh generation doesn\u2019t. And I didn\u2019t like the huggies at all since they\u2019d leak on our baby and leach chemicals in the landfill.",

We noticed some brands are made for chubby babies and others are more for skinny babies. The seventh generation diapers are so super stretchy, they fit on every baby! And they might seem thin, but they are just as absorbent as the thicker and more fluffy diapers! And I like that they are thinner than their competitors, because that way I get a lot more diapers stored in the drawer! That the absorbency is just like with others makes me think that the thicker and more fluffy diapers from competitors have material for no reason, which is a waste of resources.",
