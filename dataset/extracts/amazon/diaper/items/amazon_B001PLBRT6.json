We started with several brands of diapers and then settled in with Kirkland Signature diapers which we pick up at our local warehouse store. They are the bast diaper we've used and they're also the cheapest. That's a hard combination to beat! They fit well, there are few leakage problems and they will absorb a lot of liquid. What more could you ask? We're now up to size 5. He's beginning to show interest in the toilet and what goes on there. With a little luck, perhaps we won't need size 6.Gary Peterson",
