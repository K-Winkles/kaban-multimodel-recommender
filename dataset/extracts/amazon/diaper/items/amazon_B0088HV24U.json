But overall cloth is fantastic (I super recommend sunbaby's, the best fit and bang for your buck and they're so soft inside and also happy heiny's.)Also another thing I loved about these diapers is that she never got a rash with them. Why would you use any other disposables? These are affordable (at our local grocery store we get them on sale often for $9.99), don't cause rashes, are chlorine free, and don't leak. SOOO no need for any other kind!",

First of all, the newborn size are larger than Huggies or Pampers, I would say they are the same size as size 1 in other diapers. I couldn't even use them at first because they were too large and have no cut out for the umbilical cord. I did not like the plastic feel of the outside of the diaper and the inside felt rough to me but I wanted to give them a shot anyway. After using them for about a day my baby's but became more red than it had been before and continued to be through multiple diaper changes. After I switched back to using Huggies for a day the irritation cleared up. I will not be buying chlorine free diapers of any brand again, they are all just going to a landfill anyway. Instead I am going to research to find reliable cloth diapers to use.",
