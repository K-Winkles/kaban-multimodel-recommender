                "reviewText": "I have four kids. I\u2019ve been changing diapers for 11 years and deserve an award. My fourth child is our largest. He\u2019s been in a size 6 in traditional brands for a while and weighs 31 lbs. I love that these diapers are free from all the chemicals and things babies could be sensitive to. My second child had all the sensitivities and we had to make our wipes and cloth diaper her. I wish I had this option of Dyper for her back then! I ordered the size based on what Dyper recommends for weight which was a size smaller that we\u2019ve been buying. These size 5s are actually even slightly larger than the traditional brand size 6. In my pictures, you can see the most noticeable difference is they\u2019re a bit wider. We\u2019ve been using these diapers for a week now so we can really test them, and I have no complaints. The Velcro holds tightly and, even with a 12 hour over-the-night, pee soaked diaper, they stayed put. They haven\u2019t leaked at all and are really well made. The double inner elastic liner has kept all messes contained. I don\u2019t smell any odor in the morning when the diaper is pee soaked. All in all, great diaper, well made, and happy to be supporting the environment and my kiddo\u2019s healthy skin!",

                "reviewText": "I'm more impressed by these diapers than I expected to be. They really do feel more like fabric instead of plastic, they fit well, they hold a lot, and given the choice my kid reaches for these instead of our regular white ones. Plus when my kid is having a tantrum I can laugh to myself about my \"emo baby\" wearing black and complaining that parents just don't get it.Depending on how much water gets drunk before bedtime we sometimes have a problem with diaper leaks overnight but so far have not had that problem with these. I also love that they don't contain dyes or perfumes or anything since I'm allergic to some of those. There isn't any sort of wetness indicator stripe on these so you kinda have to just know about how long your kids goes between diaper changes so you know when a clean one is needed.While these are significantly more expensive than the daytime diapers I normally get they are similar in price to the overnight diapers I've been using but are a lot more environmentally friendly so it's a pretty good deal overall. I might just end up sticking with those for nighttime moving forward since my kid seems to like then so much. I would recommend them.",

The branding is on point and the diapers are elegant with just a solid black and the logo in slick silver. I can truly see fancy parents putting their kiddos in this diaper. It is without a doubt a luxury diaper !I like that you got a set of over a hundred diapers for less than a dollar each which is a slightly discount then normal for the Dyper diapers. I love the look of these diapers and the way they actually fit my chunky toddler. I was actually amazed that these fit my toddler because he's got such chunky thighs and it's hard to find diapers that fit him!If you have a baby that is chunky like mine than these ar probably the best diapers for them !",

They are also independently tested and certified Standard 100 compliant by OEKO TEX. Outer layer made with 100% Bamboo Viscose for improved comfort, superior wicking, and maximum fluid retention. Bamboo viscose is a natural fiber made from the cellulose of bamboo. It is a popular choice for clothing and bedding because it is soft, comfortable, and has excellent moisture-wicking properties. It is also hypoallergenic and antibacterial. There are 240 diapers in the box, sized to fit ( i like this versus a diaper that fits from say 8 -15 lbs), other sizes have different number of diapers. <sub $100 for 240 diapers makes them a competitive purchase, sizes range from 1-6.",

                "reviewText": "These charcoal enhanced diapers felt really soft and had no fragrance. They are made with high quality materials and you can tell when you feel it. There is no blue indicator line like other diapers that show when the diaper is full, but if you've been changing diapers for awhile you should be able to visually tell when a diaper is full. The diaper fits really well on my 2 year old and held up for 5-6 hours without any issues. His skin tends to be sensitive and there was no allergic reaction when wearing these diapers. There's an expiration date on the box, which I'm guessing it's because of the charcoal ingredient. The 128 diapers came in 4 medium sized boxes, 2 packages per box, 16 diapers per package.",

Plant materials are used for key parts of the diaper, making them more planet-friendly.The leg openings are elasticized to help retain the \"deposits\" your child makes, and are lined with a generous amount of soft white absorbent material. They come with built-in tabs (each corner) with velcro-like tape to allow plenty of adjustment room for a custom fit.With this jumbo box, we will have plenty of diapers on hand for when we keep our great grandson, and these will do the job well and with style. 5 stars.",

No issues (yet) with how they fit and stay. No issues or complaints from us so we\u2019d recommend these for sure. The black outer covering definitely makes these more fun.",
