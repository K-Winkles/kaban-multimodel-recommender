They hold liquid just fine, as I haven\u2019t had any more or less leaks with these than Huggies or Pampers (I\u2019ve used an equal amount of those 3 brands with my two kids in diapers for the past 2 years\u2014daughter is 21 months and son is 9 months). CONS: 1) No blow-out pocket in the back like other brands. 2) Waist band is not as soft and is a little more papery feeling. I definitely use these diapers in conjunction with pampers or Huggies, since when the kids are gonna be more active, or for overnights, I used the better brands. But otherwise, they\u2019re fine and help me save a lot of money having two kids in diapers at once (they\u2019re even wearing the same size these days!)",
