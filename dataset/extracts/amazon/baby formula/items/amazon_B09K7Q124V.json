These cups are a good size so you can really store quite a few snack in there but the whole thing is no bigger than a water bottle. I am an exclusive pumper but sometimes when traveling it\u2019s nice to have the option for formula. These cups don\u2019t link or have a problem with the threads getting crossed. The nozzle makes it so easy to dump the formula in your bottle without making a mess. The blue gradient color is also just really pretty. The plastic is very solid and has held up well to multiple washings already.",

With its clever design, I can effortlessly measure the perfect amount of formula powder, ensuring accuracy and consistency in each bottle preparation. The straightforward process of filling, measuring, and sealing minimizes the hassle of portioning the formula while on the move.Upon reaching feeding time, the dispenser proves its worth once again. With a simple twist of the cap, I can effortlessly dispense the pre-measured formula directly into the bottle. This not only saves precious time but also eliminates the risk of spillage or mess associated with traditional measuring methods. A quick shake, and the bottle is ready for feeding, allowing for seamless transitions wherever we may be. Cleaning is a breeze, thanks to its smooth surfaces and detachable compartments. This ensures hygienic usage and minimizes the need for extensive maintenance, a welcome relief for busy parents on the go.",
