Please refer to the Use By date on the bottom of each formula tub. Once the tub has been opened, formula can be used for one month. We do not recommend using the formula after 30 days of opening. Can I prepare a bottle and store in the refrigerator? Yes, you can prepare formula in advance. Make sure to store prepared formula in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours. Do not store any leftover formula that you have already fed to baby. What\u2019s the best water temperature for mixing? We suggest preparing our formula with warm water (approximately 100F, or 40C). This temperature, which is just above body temp, will help to dissolve the formula properly. If the water is too cool, it will not mix properly.",

                "reviewText": "I recently started using Happy Baby Organics Infant Formula for my baby, and it has been a fantastic choice. This milk-based powder with iron, Stage 1 formula, comes in a 21-ounce container (Pack of 1), although the packaging may vary.One of the things that immediately stood out to me about this formula is its commitment to organic ingredients. It's reassuring to know that I'm providing my baby with a product that prioritizes high-quality, non-GMO, and organic ingredients. The fact that it includes iron is also crucial for a baby's development.Preparing the formula is straightforward, and it dissolves easily in warm water without clumping. My baby took to it smoothly, and it seems gentle on their sensitive tummy, which is a big relief for any parent.The packaging may vary, but the container I received was easy to open and reseal, keeping the formula fresh between feedings. Plus, the clear measurement markings on the container make it simple to ensure I'm preparing the right amount.As a parent, I appreciate that Happy Baby Organics values sustainability and eco-friendly practices in their production. Knowing that the brand cares about the environment as much as it does about the quality of its formula is a big plus for me.Overall, Happy Baby Organics Infant Formula has been a wonderful choice for my baby's nutrition. Its commitment to organic ingredients, ease of preparation, and baby-friendly qualities make it a product I would confidently recommend to other parents.",

We were on a couple generic formulas before settling on this one and she digests this one better and has had less spit up. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it does get really frothy/bubbling when you mix it. I also wish it came in a bigger canister and not just the 21oz size.",

                "reviewText": "Not being able to breast feed, I set out to find the right formula for my baby and have been through several formulas from the top brands, probably too many, and none of them have completely worked for my baby. One formula would help her be regular and wouldn\u2019t cause any gas, but would aggravate her GERD, while abother would help her GERD, but cause painful gas. Both situations led to hours of crying and in need of constant soothing. I am the only one who stays up with her at night, so six weeks of little sleep and constant crying has been heartbreaking, beyond exhausting, and overwhelming. Desperate, I began researching formula ingredients and started to think that maybe corn ingredients were upsetting her belly and GERD. Also, I wanted to make sure she was getting safe, quality food, so I began looking into organic formulas and came across this one. I vowed to change her formula one last time, and if it didn\u2019t work, we would just have to settle until she outgrew her GERD and belly issues. The first time I gave her a bottle of this formula, she did not squirm or pull back in pain, like she did with other formulas, and for the first time, she actually loved the taste! She gulped it down no problem. I waited, anticipating some kind of bad reaction, but no abnormal gas or spit up ever came. Then, a miracle happened, she took a two and half hour nap for the first time in her life! She has never slept longer than half an hour! That night, she was able to fall asleep on her own, again, for the first time in her life! I\u2019m so happy to have found something that she can eat without any discomfort, and I\u2019m really happy over the impressive ingredients list. I feel confident feeding this formula to my baby.The formula, itself is fluffy before mixing, and has a good consistency after mixing. Not too thick, not too thin. Not foamy. The container is easy to open and has a slot for the scoop to go in, so you don\u2019t have to dig through the formula to retrieve it. The smell isn\u2019t bad. The color of the formula looks similar to that of breast milk. The only issue is that I either have to order this formula online or drive an hour to the nearest Target to purchase this formula. I wish more vendors sold it!This formula has completely changed my baby! Thank you SO much, Happy Family! We both can look forward to feedings now!",
