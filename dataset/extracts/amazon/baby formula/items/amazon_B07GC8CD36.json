As such, the label measurements use the metric system. 60 mL is equivalent to 2 fl oz of water, which is similar to the typical preparation instructions for making a bottle. 1 scoop per 2 fl oz of water. If I have questions about formula imported by Abbott, should I call the number on the container or use the email on the container? For more information, contact our Similac Feeding Expert team at 800-986-8800, Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 7 PM EST. Why do the directions call for boiling water for this product? It\u2019s always best to prepare according to label instructions. Some countries recommend boiling water for 2 or 5 minutes. Ask your baby\u2019s doctor if you need to use cooled, boiled water for mixing, and if you need to boil (sterilize) bottles, nipples, and rings before use. What does \u201cEyeQ Plus\u201d and \u201cAA\u201d mean on the label? EyeQ Plus may appear on some labels and references key nutrients for brain development, including DHA and AA (which means arachidonic acid, sometimes abbreviated as ARA). What does \u201cStage 1, 0-12 months\u201d mean on the label? \u201cStage 1, 0-12 months\u201d means the formula is appropriate for use from birth until 12 months of age.",

Guess what she never did that with this formula! She drinks it just fine, no spit up issues, no tummy issues. Now we have her so spoiled on this if we run out before more is in she gets extra hangry. I don't know why it's so different from the US but it's a win in my book.The lid is just an added bonus. It's a lot like our Sam's club formula lid scoop stay in the lid, lid snaps close. I get so many comments how nice my formula containers are.",

The scoop snaps into the top of the lid for storage so you don\u2019t have to dig it out of the formula. Only down side is the scoop lip is wider than the base of the scoop so it makes half scoops a little tricky. Still five stars though cause my son does so well on this formula.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Up until about 7 months old, my baby was exclusively breastfed but at that point I just could not keep up with her demand and had to supplement. We tried multiple formulas before this, all of which I've had to mix with pumped milk in order for her to drink. This is the 1st one that she actually enjoys drinking and will gladly drink full bottles. I like the clip for the scoop in the lid, however I with there was an easier way to level the product in the can. The video shows after a few weeks of use. Overall, we are very pleased!",
