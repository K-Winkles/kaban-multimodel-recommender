If their ingredient list starts with Corn Syrup Solids, our babies hate it and often spit it up. It's not that it's bad for them. Corn Syrup Solids are almost entirely glucose (i.e. NOT 1/2 fructose as is table suger (bad) or more than half fructose as in High Fructose Corn Syrup (very bad)) and glucose is good BUT this formula tastes awful and if your baby won't drink it or spits it up and makes awful faces, then what? The lesson is try it with your baby before you buy very much.",

It even sent on sale for under $200 before prime day!My only complaint is that it\u2019s not currently offered consistently. This has more to do with the manufacturer. But it was helpful to order these while we could!",

                "reviewText": "All the moms at my daycare use this formula when they were switching from breastfeeding to formula. My baby did wonderful transitioning, she hardly ever spits up, she\u2019s not as gassy, has regular bowel movements and didn\u2019t notice a difference in taste from breast milk to formula. It can be hard to purchase online as they sell out often but if you\u2019re transitioning this is the way to go, even though it says for premature babies I found that as just a plus of added nutrients for babies continual growth. My baby went from 25-30 percentile breast feeding for 6 months to 50% on formula . She\u2019s super healthy and has only gotten sick once and she\u2019s in day care on this formula still as we speak.",
