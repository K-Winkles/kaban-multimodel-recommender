                "reviewText": "My son absolutely loves these in fact it's the only flavor of the big puffs he will eat I even like them lol only issue is they go stale SO FAST. You can't leave them out in a bowl for longer than like 15 mins without them starting to get stale. Even in the can after opening they will get stale after a couple days BUT I found the perfect solution for the left over ones in the can put the can in the fridge! It keeps them fresh as a daisy. And this is also a great price",
