        "description": "PurAmino is a hypoallergenic, iron fortified, amino acid based baby and toddler formula used for infants and toddlers with severe cow's milk protein allergies, and other food allergies. It also is suitable for conditions such as protein maldigestion, malabsorption/chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis. It contains omega 3 DHA and ARA, important fatty acid nutrients that provide brain support and eye development for your baby. PurAmino can provide a sole source of nutrition for infants up to age 6 months and provide a major source of nutrition for toddlers through 24 months of age, when indicated. Normally, in feeding infants, gradual introduction of solid foods after 4\u20136 months of age is an important developmental as well as nutritional step. In cases of severe and multiple food allergies or intolerances, PurAmino is sometimes continued as a milk substitute in the diet of children. This and similar supplemental use of PurAmino in the diet beyond 24 months of age may make a significant contribution to maintenance of good nutrition. PurAmino is created by the maker of Nutramigen\u2014the #1 recommended brand* for managing infants who are allergic to cow\u2019s milk protein\u2021. \u2021By pediatricians who recommend a specific formula. *Enfamil is the #1 pediatrician recommended brand of Infant Formula - QuintilesIMS, using the ProVoice Survey fielded from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.",

                "reviewText": "Our now 3 month old is so sensitive to dairy that even Alimentum cases severe stomach upsets where she gets bloody diapers and just screams and cries all the time. Plus she hated the taste of that and the enfamil version of the same stuff. So the GI doctor told us to try an amino acid based formula and I decided to try Puramino.She has had some serious issues while breastfeeding too because she is sensitive to multiple proteins that I eat so she was also really underweight. The plan was to give her formula for a few weeks while I change my diet to avoid all of the allergens (dairy, soy, wheat, nuts, and eggs). We already knew dairy and soy would cause bloody diapers and upsets, but even after 5 weeks of avoiding those she still had an occasional diaper with blood in it, and she was still having a hard time sleeping and crying all the time. So the GI doctor recommended cutting all these things out of my diet and trying to breastfeed again, then figure out what else bothers her. So we got some Puramino formula to give her in the meantime.Seriously, this stuff is awesome! With every other formula we tried, she fought and cried and didn't like the taste so it was hard to get her to eat it. The first time she had Puramino, she drank it with no problems. And actually she drank so much of it that she gained a while pound in a week! That was a HUGE praise for us because she had been having such a hard time until then that for the first two months of her life we were in and out of doctor's offices and the ER, and nothing seemed to be helping her.For the first week she was not gassy, fussy, no reflux, spitting up, no bloody diapers, or anything. She smiled and played and slept; I mean she was just a totally different baby! After about a week she did start spitting up sometimes and she does sometimes get actual reflux, but she did (and does) while breastfeeding too.So I would recommend this stuff to anyone who has a baby with a sensitive tummy. It is definitely expensive, but it is worth it. And if it's a long-term solution, some insurance companies will help pay for it. This 4 pack on Amazon has been the cheapest way of buying it that we've found.We are back to breastfeeding now, but since she was eating so much more while I was giving her formula, I am still supplementing with Puramino when she is still hungry and we run out of breastmilk. I am SO thankful that this stuff even exists because we didn't know what else to do for our poor girl. But avoiding all of those allergens has also helped her tremendously. FINALLY, I have been able to nurse her without her tummy getting upset. And I have the Puramino to help with weight gain.",

                "reviewText": "***UPDATE:Our daughter is now 15.5 months (dec. 2019) she was started on this Dec. 7, 2018. At 9 Months we were able to start mixing PurAmino with enfamil and by 12 months she was completely on enfamil. We started whole milk at 12.5 months and even now At 15 months she is now drinking whole milk with absolutely no issues. This formula is a miracle. It really is. It helped solved so many issues. Our daughter no longer has to see a pediatric GI doctor. She has been discharged from the clinic! She outgrew her reflux, milk and protein intolerance. We were able to take her off all of her meds for her stomach issues at 6-7 months old. This stuff is expensive and we often had to go between ordering at pharmacies and ordering on Amazon because prices would rise and lower. I am so grateful that my daughter is able to consume dairy and has no allergies.Under the direction of a doctor, if you\u2019re recommended this, give it a go. Our daughter had issues with the taste and constipation at first so we tried other protein-formulas and ended back at this one. I would give this formula 10 stars \u2b50\ufe0f If I could.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014My daughter has sever reflux, milk allergy, a protein intolerance to where she can\u2019t digest proteins, and trouble gaining weight.Our pediatric GI doctor recommended we try this first and he gave us a can to sample, he also told us about neonate if we wanted to try that. At first my daughter didn\u2019t like PurAmino and would not eat much and had severe constipation.So we decided to try neocate, she projectile vomited EVERY time we gave it to her. So we tried neocate\u2019s advanced formula with probiotics. She was a pooping machine and wouldn\u2019t eat.After consulting with her GI, he asked us to try this again. So we did and voila! Baby slowly began eating more and her poops became more regular! She is gaining weight on this tremendously! So happy we tried it again!Baby is now happy after eating, no screaming or pain, and falls asleep easily. Her spit up has decreased.",

The formula itself definitely helps with my baby\u2019s issues and they are a lot less fussy throughout the day. The formula isn\u2019t very thick, mixes well, and is easy to measure out with the included scoop (1 scoop per oz of water).",

                "reviewText": "We discovered our newborn had cow milk protein allergy. She started developing rashes around her face and body. At first, we fed her Nutramigen and the equivalent similac hypoallergenic formula, and let me tell you\u2026 they are not pleasant to the senses. That wasn\u2019t why we stopped though, while the rashes went away, she had too many bowel movements to count. We then switched over to puramino, no bad taste and no bad smell. Bowel movements dwindled to normal numbers.",
