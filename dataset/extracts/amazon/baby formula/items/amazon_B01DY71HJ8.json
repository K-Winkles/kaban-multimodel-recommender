                "reviewText": "Sadly, we had to supplement breast feeding with formula and originally started with the doctor's supplied can of Enfamil. The baby hated it and would take maybe a half ounce at a time. After two days of that, I got the Baby's Only Organic Whey Protein formula and it has been a 180 degree experience. Our baby boy has been thriving on this formula. I supplement my breast milk with this formula and his poo has been very similar to that when on exclusive breast milk feedings. He guzzles this down and smacks his lips in pleasure when finished. I kid you not! I still feel guilty for having to use formula, but that guilt has been greatly diminished by knowing I'm feeding him the next best thing. Yes, breast milk is preferred, but when your body cannot keep up with your baby's demands, then you have to do what's right for your baby. His health and ability to thrive is all that matters in the end.I called the company and spoke with a rep to get information regarding if a product labeled for Toddlers is okay to feed a newborn infant and the woman I spoke with was very informative. I did my own independent research to find what is considered minimum guidelines for a product to qualify as an infant's formula and Baby's Only Organic not only meets those standards, it exceeds them. I ran all of this by our pediatrician and got the thumb's up from her for us to feed this formula to our baby and the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. He is gaining weight like a champ, has minimal spit ups, and seems to enjoy the milk.For those on the fence, try going to the website directly and ordering from there. They allow a free full-sized can as a one-time gift/promotion with your first purchase.Also, for reference, we considered the two highly rated formulas from abroad, but in the end, decided there were too many variables that were dicey and chancy going that route so opted to find something domestically manufactured to fit our needs. We could not recommend this formula more highly!",

                "reviewText": "My twins absolutely hate the formulas commercially bought and I am trying to avoid soy as much as possible. This formula smells fresh unlike the rotten smells regular formulas do, especially when reconstituted. Gross. They say toddler on the can but you can give this to newborns as well and mix in breastmilk too. They are 9 months old now and still love this formula, easy on their little tummies, have never had any constipation or had to use gripe water or probiotics either. Closest thing you can get to weston a price home made formula imho if you want to feed clean and no time to make it. Their website lets you sample some too just to try it out which is how I found it, as the european formulas were getting too expensive. Baby's Only has a ton of different formula options which I think is good so different babies get their different needs met. BTW, I wasn't paid or given samples at all to write this review, just wanted people to know how much of a lifesaver this formula has been for my babies. They are wearing 12-18 month clothes already only being 9 month \"preemies\", so the formula must be doing something right!! \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this formula. Other than it being organic, it's also a great alternative to the very best organic European formulas, like Hipp. While living in Europe, my son was drinking Hipp formula, and we were very happy with it. When we came back to the US, I started looking for a good formula to buy, comparing the ingredients with the Hipp formula, and didn't find anything good enough until I came across Baby's Only toddler formula. Then I started looking into the Babys Only different formulas, and decided to buy the one with whey protein. Again looking very close at the ingredient list, I like the Babys Only organic Whey Protein Dairy formula because: it has lactose (and not some other syrup), no maltodextrin, it contains whey protein (which European formulas have), coconut oil and no palm oil, no added DHA (I prefer to supplement with that separately), no added artificial vanilla flavor, and it has the natural form of vitamin E (d-alpha tocopherol acetate). Based on these characteristics, we decided to buy and try it, and were very pleased with it. My son likes it, no tummy issues, no allergic reactions, or eczema, and haven't had problems transitioning from the Hipp formula. It also has a very pleasant smell (even though there is no added vanilla flavor) and it tastes pretty good. So far, I am very pleased with it!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the gentle with whey protein formula, the can shown in the pictures indicates milk as the known allergen \u201ccontains milk.\u201d The cans I received say \u201ccontains milk and soy.\u201d Exactly the thing I was trying to avoid. Thank God I checked. Always check I guess :( I can\u2019t find anything else soy free that doesn\u2019t contain corn as the main ingredient. Why did they need to add soy? What was inefficient about the previous non-soy version that didn\u2019t kill my child?",

                "reviewText": "This Whey Protein formula is a great fit for mother's still breastfeeding but who need to supplement once they return to work. After reading many reviews and trying many different formulas this formula seemed to most closely match breast milk. Most other formula's were rejected by my baby. He would drink them but not fully and only to satisfy immediate hunger. Once I tried this formula he drank the entire bottle. I've sent him to daycare with different combinations depending on breast milk supply level (sometimes one bottle of breast milk and one bottle of formula or a bottle of half breast milk half formula) and he drinks all. It should be noted I started this when my baby was about 5-6 months old. After reading many reviews and analyzing the content information it appears completely suitable for a baby under 1 year of age (I was concerned at first due to the label \"Toddler Formula\".) I am very happy with the Baby's Only Organic Whey Protein formula. This is my second child and although I pump throughout the work day my supply and time to feed the supply are not where they were with my first. This formula allows me to continue breast feeding without loosing my mind trying to keep up supply while the baby is in daycare. Kudos to Baby's Only Why Protein!",
