                "reviewText": "We were given a son with a sensitive stomach: he was prone to spitting up, gas, hiccuping, and constipation. This was the case with breastmilk. He was also unhappy while drinking breastmilk--whether that was because he always seemed unsatisfied, even after eating, or due to other reasons, we'll never know. But after a tongue-tie surgery for him and a prescription drug for my wife (for her supply) and lots of heartache, we finally made the switch to 1/2 breastmilk and 1/2 Baby's Only lactose free. He seemed happier but still cranky and still full of reflux. Once my wife finally threw in the towel on breastfeeding, we went to 100% Similac Alimentum (read my review on that), and he was still cranky and full of reflux. After several weeks on that, we then switched back to Baby's Only--this time exclusively--and he was a changed baby. Even my mother-in-law (who thought we should breastfeed) remarked on day two that he was like a new baby. His gas and spitting up nearly went away completely. His mood improved dramatically. And we, as parents, felt happy for the first time in his young life. And this has remained true to this day, months later. I cannot recommend this product enough!An important note: the can says \"toddler formula,\" but pay close attention to the ingredients. There's a chart online at the Nature's One site that compares various popular infant formulas to Baby's Only toddler formula; through this chart, it becomes apparent that Baby's Only is nearly nutritionally identical to the popular infant formulas (with a few differences here and there in mineral content and protein). Indeed, the chart shows that Baby's Only formula meets all of the required amounts set by the Infant Formula Act & Amendments. The Baby's Only website also explains that the company uses the name \"toddler formula\" because the company believes that all babies should be breastfed exclusively until one year of age, but that the formula is indeed suitable for earlier use.In sum, although I don't know what will work for you and your family, this formula has done wonders for our son. He's almost like a new baby, we think because of the formula--it's the only change we can definitively point to during that time period and we were paying close attention to everything going on that could possibly have accounted for his mood.If you have any questions, feel free to post a comment--we went through such a struggle with his feeding for so many months that I would be happy to help out.",

                "reviewText": "Baby's Only Lactorelief has made a huge difference in our 10 week old! Our baby was breastfed with supplementation for his first 6 weeks. After being advised to stop breast feeding due to medical issues, we had no choice but to switch to 100% formula. Our little guy had constant gas pains, terrible reflux and colic which began when he was 2 weeks. We tried Enfamil Newborn and Gentlease which made him gag and cry for hours. We then switched to Similac Sensitive which he tolerated better, but still presented terrible reflux and was crying through the night. We then tried Simliac Soy, thinking he may have a dairy allergy; this gave him terrible gas, not to mention thick and pasty dirty diapers. He had choking spells during feedings with all of the above formulas, including breast milk. He was sleeping 4 hours max at night and having many bouts of crying spells due to gas pains and reflux. We switched to Baby's Only when he was 8 weeks old. After two days on this formula he began sleeping through the night and became a different baby. His colic stopped as he only cried when he had obvious needs. We went from giving him prescribed Prevacid (for his reflux) once a day to once or twice a week. He now sleeps 7 hours through the night and is such a happy baby. I am so thankful we found Baby's Only. My main concerns about this formula in the beginning were \"Toddler Formula\" and the \"DHA and ARA.\" I emailed the company and received a response within hours. They stated this formula is safe and intended for infants. It is advertised as toddler formula to promote breast feeding for the first year. They explained that the non essential fatty acids (DHA and ARA) are not added to this formula, but the essential fatty acids required for DHA and ARA are. A healthy infant or toddler has the capability of making the essential fatty acids into DHA and ARA. It is comforting knowing my baby is still getting the essential fatty acids without the worry of algal and fungal sources being added like they are in all other formulas. Another benefit to this formula is it does not contain Hexane (a type of gasoline) that is found in all other formulas. As a parent we want to ensure the health and safety of our children, and I believe this formula is the best choice for our child!",

I'm not sure how it worked out like that but I'm glad it did. My baby has had an extremely sensitive tummy since he was born and couldn't keep anything down including breast milk. He refused to nurse after a two months and I was forced to start formula. I first tried Similac because that is what my daughter drank, but he would projectile vomit it and scream in pain. It was the same with Enfamil and even the pricey, specialty formulas. We finally switched him to Gerber Soy which was the best until I found this! I was really freaked out about Soy formulas bad rep (even though his doctor said it was nonsense) so I did a LOT of research and decided to give Babys Only Lactorelief a try. I immediately noticed s difference. He has not spit up once in the two months he's been on it, his skin has cleared up, his sleep has improved dramatically, and best of all he has a bowl movement regularly every dat now!! He was terribly constipated on Soy. So yes I would recommend it to all babys and this is probably the best place to buy it. By the way if you have not tried it the manufacturer, Nature's One will send you a free FULL SIZE sample of each kind if you go to there website www.naturesone.com!!!!",
