We've used many different types of formula including gentle, hypoallergenic, goat, etc., and nothing seemed to sit well with her until we switched to cow's milk formula with A2 proteins.Now, we have been using another brand with similar ingredients that is also A2, however, she has had some tummy troubles with it. We're about 2/3 of the way done with this can of formula and so far, it seems to work a lot better for her. I love how it's very clean and lacks all of the extras that other formulas of its nature tend to add. It does seem a little bit foamier than other formulas, but I found adding it to very warm water helps it to dissolve better and dissipates the foam quicker. I also allow it to sit a few minutes before giving it to her, which allows the foam and bubbles to settle.Most importantly, my daughter seems to like the taste or at least doesn't mind it. It didn't seem to phase her at all that we changed anything so that's definitely a plus. We may end up switching to this full time.",

                "reviewText": "I tried this formula to supplement a breastfeeding baby. It\u2019s an excellent choice, my 4 month old baby accepted this milk with no problem. It does have an odd taste (yes I tried it before feeding it to my baby) and leaves my baby with stinky breath. No big deal. We didn\u2019t notice any gas or fussiness, he poop once a day or every two days as normal. My baby ended up finishing the can with no issues. Yes I do recommend this brand!",
