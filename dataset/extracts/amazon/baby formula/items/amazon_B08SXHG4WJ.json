                "reviewText": "My 10 month old was on Gerber Soothe Pro. Then another recall happened, due to a bacteria in the formula, in the midst of an already inconvenient formula shortage. Long story short I was left with one can of Sooth Pro and I had to make a decision to transition her. I decided to try whole milk. It gave her diarrhea and upset stomach so it decided to try Gentlease toddler formula! This was the easiest and best transition!! I was so happy!! She was a little hesitant at first but after a bottle or two she took it with no problem. She has had no stomach issues and no fussiness. I 100% recommend! My little doesn\u2019t drink 6oz bottles so I just use 2 scoops of formula to 3oz of water to prevent wasting the formula.",
