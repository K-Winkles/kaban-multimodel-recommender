As such, the label measurements use the metric system. 60 mL is equivalent to 2 fl oz of water, which is similar to the typical preparation instructions for making a bottle. 1 scoop per 2 fl oz of water. If I have questions about formula imported by Abbott, should I call the number on the container or use the email on the container? For more information, contact our Similac Feeding Expert team at 800-986-8800, Monday through Friday 8:30 AM to 7 PM EST. Why do the directions call for boiling water for this product? It\u2019s always best to prepare according to label instructions. Some countries recommend boiling water for 2 or 5 minutes. Ask your baby\u2019s doctor if you need to use cooled, boiled water for mixing, and if you need to boil (sterilize) bottles, nipples, and rings before use.",

                "reviewText": "When our son was around 1 month old we discovered he is a colicky baby. After trying a number of different baby formula, this was the only one that didn't give him any gas or tummy issues. About 24 hours later, he was no longer fussy and has been happy and healthy ever since!Some of the reviews I have seen for this formula made us hesitant to purchase however I am glad we did. I understand after feeding, his breath does stink a little when we burb him but we don't feel that is too important. We believe how it affects his stomach and overall health is what truly matters.We have been feeding this to him for almost 3 months now and he is gaining weight at a good pace and still seems to really like this formula. Anytime we give him a bottle he sucks it down in no time!I would absolutely recommend this formula to any parents out there trying to help relieve their babies stomach pain, fussiness, and gassiness!!!",
