                "reviewText": "All 4 of my kids have a hard time digesting the proteins in other formulas. This one is great because the proteins are already partially broken down and makes it easy for their underdeveloped tummies to process it. A lot of other formulas also can constipate your babies. But similac doesn\u2019t because it doesn\u2019t contain any palm oil! My only complaint is that my youngest absolutely didn\u2019t like the taste of it and we had to switch to another formula as he got older. But, it worked great for his tummy as a newborn.",
