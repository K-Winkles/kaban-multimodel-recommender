No amount of humidity, hydration or slathering of products works for me\u2026 until now. Usually I have to do a course of lanolin to heal my lips, which is fine, but sticky and messy. But after a couple swipes of this stuff, I was good to go! Having lips problems like I do, I have an entire drawer of products I\u2019ve tried, but I keep going back to this stuff. It feels light and not sticky, yet there\u2019s a slight barrier to dry air (I\u2019m in Wisconsin and winters can be brutal!) I was a little concerned that the unscented would be a bit unpleasant (read: beefy) but it\u2019s not! I find myself reapplying just because I enjoy using it, which is keeping my lips soft and supple. Love!!!",
