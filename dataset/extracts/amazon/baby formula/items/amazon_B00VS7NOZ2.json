He is teething so he loves gnawing on them. If they get wet (from his mouth or a cup) then they do get sticky and will stick to clothing, high chair, etc. It cleans up easily, so not a big problem. I love that they are packaged in little packets of two, which makes them great for throwing in the diaper bag or in the car.",
