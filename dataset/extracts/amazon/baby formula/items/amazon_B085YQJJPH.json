Also one of my newborn babies was having issues passing a bowel movement while consuming the Soy formula I had them on prior to switching to Similac isomil Soy. Once I switched over there were no issues for my newborn to pass a stool or stomach discomfort. I am so happy I made the switch.",

I really recommend this formula for gaseous baby or colicky but just know it might put your child constipated. But I think with a little prune juice it\u2019ll help her/him a lot.",
