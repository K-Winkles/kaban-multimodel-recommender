                "reviewText": "AnD Butt Cream is my go-to savior for my daughter's skin! It works wonders \u2013 tackling serious rash burns and preventing any redness. It's like magic; if I spot even a hint of redness, a little application, and it's gone by the next diaper change. This cream is a game-changer, reliable, and the only one I trust for my baby's delicate skin. Highly recommended for all parents!",
