I was disappointed when I saw how many baby food products were purely just fruits and sugar and lacking any nutritional content of substance. I chose to feed my baby meats and vegetables due to the valuable nutrition content of IRON and FIBER baby needs.We started \"solids\" when baby was around 5 months old. I started with some well-known name brands before deciding to make the investment and switched to Serenity Kids instead. Serenity Kids specializes in super high-quality kids food. All their ingredients are ethically sourced, the vegetables are 100% organic, and they\u2019re full of healthy fats. Their focus is on nutrient density, regenerative agriculture and all their packaging is eco-friendly.I would easily and highly recommend these to anyone with a little one.",

                "reviewText": "Our daughter buys these for her toddler (1-1/2 years old). I do a lot of long distance driving and thought that these would be a convenient way to have a snack or even a small meal. I have just spent six days behind the wheel on a road trip and they worked out great! A good mixture of protein (beef, turkey, chicken) and veggies, especially the combinations. They are easy and safe to use while driving, have good flavor, are more filling than I thought they would be, and are certainly healthier than the snacks that are usually available on the road.",

                "reviewText": "I love the quality ingredients: healthy fats, bone broth, grass fed beef, and paleo starches. When I have to feed something pre-made I don't feel bad if it's from Serenity. Pricey but worth it.I only wish they made more flavors and had a wider variety of green veggies in the pouches beyond just spinach, kale, or peas. Most have either squash or pumpkin or sweet potato as the starchy component which all have a lot of beta carotene and if eaten enough can give your baby's skin an orange cast (trust me we had a nurse comment on it when she saw my baby). What about mixing it up with parsnips, turnips, rutabaga, potatoes, purple sweet potatoes, cassava, daikon, etc?",

I mentioned it in my IG stories and the company themselves sent me tips and tricks on how to serve these meats.The problem was, my baby had never had baby meat before, just fruits and veggies. Please understand that the thickness is a little thicker, but still creamy enough for even new eaters. We tried different recipes and ideas and now my son love them and gets his proteins.I am SUPER impressed with this company and their willingness to help and offer advice and ideas. Their products are HIGH quality and made of only the best ingredients which makes this mama very happy!",

She liked the flavor and it is definitely a big upgrade from normal meat baby food!!! I\u2019m also a huge fan of turmeric, but you have to definitely supervise your toddler with these, as they are a little oily and turmeric stains. Squeezing the packet to mix the contents before opening helps!!!! It\u2019s a little higher in price compared to most baby food, but it also has very high quality ingredients.",
