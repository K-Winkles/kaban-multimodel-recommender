                "reviewText": "I had been keeping my eye on this product for awhile going back and forth on whether or not I wanted to buy it and if I should just use a regular old lunch box or not. I ended up misreading the amount of vacation hours I had left for my leave and had to go back a lot sooner than I had planned, three days short of 5 weeks, and bought this right before my first day. I haven\u2019t actually used it yet as I got called into work early so it arrived while I was at work and I used an ice chest but I just got home and opened it up and set everything up to make sure it\u2019s going to fit everything great. Holds my four 6 ounce bottles AND my pump parts with the divider down! It did take some rearranging but it fits! Where I work we don\u2019t have a fridge or a pumping room so I have to make due as much as I can and this is going to help soooo much. I stuck it in the freezer for just a few minutes before realizing I should make sure everything fits really quickly and it was already cold! I almost didn\u2019t buy it because other reviews said only the top and bottom are insulated and not the sides but the whole entire thing is an ice pack, yes even the sides. It is on the heavy side because of it being all gel packs but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m carrying it around 24/7, I\u2019m just taking it into work and back home. I will definitely be buying other products from them in the future.Edit: I ended up using it the entire year I breastfed and it stayed COLD for 8+ hours in my room temp locker! Fantastic buy, I recommend them to everyone I know that is having a baby and plans on breastfeeding.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Took this bag on a 10hr trip requiring TSA checks and layovers. Going through TSA was easy. The agent just asked me if the bag was completely frozen and that was it. It didn\u2019t stay completely frozen for 10hrs for this trip but stayed cold and kept my milk cold.On my way back home, my trip with the bag out of the freezer was about 9hrs long. I brought back frozen breast milk and placed the bags sideways in a gallon zip lock bag for any possible spills. It fit my 40oz of milk very well. The middle flap folded down one way and didn\u2019t effect the way the frozen milk sat in the bag. The bag did stay frozen/cold for the most part. It didn\u2019t keep all of my breastmilk frozen but it didn\u2019t completely thaw it either. The unfrozen ones were slushy and the bags of milk that I pumped later stayed cold. Going through TSA with frozen breastmilk in the bag was easy. I just had to place the whole bag in a separate bin and it went through the XR machine with no questions or stops.Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a great bag!Pros:\u2022flap in the middle of the bag folds either way\u2022entire insulation (inside the bag) is an ice pack\u2022easy to carry because of the handle\u2022remained frozen for the most part (for 10hrs~)\u2022kept milk frozen/cold (for 10hrs~)\u2022every day use\u2022strong zipper\u2022fits fairly decent amount of milk (for me, 40oz~ /10 bags of frozen milk laying side ways with 2 bags of fresh milk)\u2022washable\u2022easy to freeze (literally throw the entire bag into the freezer)Cons:\u2022heavier due to the entire insulation being an ice pack\u2022doesn\u2019t keep milk frozen for 12hr dayI included photos of how the bag looks like when it gets delivered. The video shows the inside and how the entire bag is insulated. Also included photos of how the bag looks like with frozen bags of breastmilk inside and how the bag looks after I zip it up with the milk inside.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought this cooler in May 2018 when preparing to travel to Yellowstone with my then 9-month-old. I was exclusively pumping and heard this product was amazing. It lived up to all my expectations during that trip. Fast forward several years. That first baby is now 5 and an older sister to my 8-month-old. I continue to use this bag everyday at work to carry my milk home. But what prompted me to write this review is this: Yesterday we went to Animal Kingdom. I was able to fit 3 8-oz Dr. Brown\u2019s bottles (with travel caps only, not nipples and stems - those were in a separate bag) into the bag. I packed the cooler at 8am and unpacked it about 9:30pm. The bags of fresh milk that I had added throughout the day were perfectly cold. Granted, we had pleasantly cool weather (about 75 and overcast), but still - it stayed cold all day. We are headed home today and it is crammed full with 3 bottles and 4 bags of milk, but it capacity is outstanding. I already tell everyone I know who pumps that they need this cooler, but now I love it even more! If you are pumping and working or traveling, you need this pump! (Also - on that original trip we flew to Yellowstone, and I didn\u2019t need to fight with TSA about ice packs. Amazing!)",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for pumping on a bachelorette trip. I have a spectra pump and this fit my pump parts and two bottles with some spare room for a few bags of milk. I wanted to be able to pump while we were out and about without having to clean my pump parts each time. I typically refrigerate my pump parts between use at work and wash them at the end of the day which saves a lot of time. This helped to mimic that while on the go away from a refrigerator for hours at a time. I ended up pumping and dumping on the trip, because I didn\u2019t want to have to worry about lugging a bunch of milk back. If you plan to save your milk, you will want a bigger cooler. Worked great for what I needed it for and kept my pump parts and milk cold for over 6 hours.",
