The formulas usually distributed in the US have too much iron for a baby who will be strictly formula-fed (at each feed) and do appear as they should really only be supplemental. The lower iron content was very much appreciated.The product was exceptional. Baby took it without a fuss after switching from a previous brand. No issues at all. Planning on purchasing Aptamil Care Stage 2, once it\u2019s in stock again.If feeding formula only (no longer receiving breast milk), this one is a great option. Perfect breast milk substitute.",
