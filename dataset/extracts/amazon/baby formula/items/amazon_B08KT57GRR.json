My kid has to take miralax every day to make sure he doesn't get backed up. This seems to be a little easier on his belly, but it's thicker than his normal pediaure. I started pouring into a cut and giving him half mixed with regular milk and stirring in the miralax (and doing the same for night without the miralax added).I like the lower sugar and high calories for my skinny picky eater with tummy issues.However....the price is INSANE. We could never afford to keep our kid on this.

                "reviewText": "My 4 yr old son does not having a feeding tube but due to his autism he has a very limited diet (6-8 foods he will eat and none are high calorie or nutrient dense). Along with vitamins he also drinks classic pediasure for a caloric and vitamin boost. He did NOT like the flavor of this. However, I found that if I mixed it with milk or water he would drink it. I asked his nutritionist about this product and she said if he will drink it than it\u2019s a great way to get added calories/nutrition in him. It\u2019s also much lower in sugar than the tradition version. I can see this being very beneficial for fd children. I do not see this product useful for most children as it\u2019s specifically designed for very specific dietary needs. If your child has special needs then this might be a good option (if dr approved) for their dietary and weight maintenance needs.",

                "reviewText": "The PediaSure Peptide 1.5 cal is a high-calorie drink with the smooth and good tastes, and my son likes the flavor. In addition to providing daily vitamins, this bottle of beverage has 356 calories and a protein content of 10.7g, which is higher than normal whole milk. It is also rich in vitamins that are not available in whole milk, similar to DHA and lutein, which grow the brain and protects the eyes. But the drink sugar content is lower than whole milk only 2 g each bottle. It also provides probiotics and fiber to promote digestion. Due to the vitamins contained in this drink, I will halve my son's daily multivitamin intake. But I still give him daily VD intake to improve his calcium absorption.",
