                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Well received",
                "reviewText": "Of all the brands of soy formula I have tried, Similac brand is the easiest to use. In comparison to Enfimil and Earth's Best this product dissolved the best. I typically use prewarmed water that isn't boiling. The powder easily dissolved with minimal shaking.Enfimil and Earth's Best you need to vigorously shake and even then you may still get clumps unless you are using water that is right around the point of boiling in temperature. We should use this temperature to sterilize the powder but it should not be required to prevent clumping.The price of this formula is reasonable and actually cheaper than Enfamil. My state has a contract with Enfamil for WIC which increases the price of their products for this size can by ten dollars. I would purchase Similac powder soy formula in store but it's so hard to find. We do carry the contracted cans but they are pricey at 8-9 dollars for a can that has enough servings for a single day.I haven't noticed any adverse reactions to this formula. It's a quality product, dissolves well and is well received. Overall, I would recommend this brand of soy formula.Update March 24, 2023This soy formula, however well received it is, isn't the best. I don't know what does to make this product but it always produces a more frequent green bowel movement. Earth's best and Enfamil do not have this effect. I even got ahold of Gerber Soy which has an overall better ingredient list also.I'm still nursing and my daughter has started solids. Going back to the other mentioned brands her bowels is less frequent and more mustard colored. This tells me that Similac is full of inferior ingredients. Like ok, formula isn't breastmilk but I have to say this is the worst soy ingredient wise. It's a good product in a pinch but definitely not my first choice for a soy formula. I personally wouldn't recommend it either if other options is more available.",
