Can I prepare a bottle and store in the refrigerator? Yes, you can prepare formula in advance. Make sure to store prepared formula in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours. Do not store any leftover formula that you have already fed to baby. What\u2019s the best water temperature for mixing? We suggest preparing our formula with warm water (approximately 100F, or 40C). This temperature, which is just above body temp, will help to dissolve the formula properly. If the water is too cool, it will not mix properly.",

Plus I switched my baby to this formula since enfamil enfacare was tearing my baby\u2019s stomach up and making her constipated. Haven\u2019t had to worry about that since (at least not every single feeding like with enfacare.) no complaints.",

Baby slept for a full 6 hours the first night and was a happy baby when he woke up. So we have been giving a bottle to sleep every night. But warning baby will not get satisfied off breast milk anymore. So we are switching completely. My son is happier on it",

The formula we were on at first caused my son to be extremely gassy and have excessive spit up/acid reflux. I then switched to another brand which caused my sons entire body to break out and he was still extremely gassy.FINALLY, my mom suggested we try this brand. It cleared his skin right up. He loves the flavor and has way less gas and discomfort. He no longer has acid reflux and is a happy baby.Happy with this formula and would suggest for all new moms :)",
