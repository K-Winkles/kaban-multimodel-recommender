It smells and taste terrible, but all the hypoallergenic formulas do. This is the only one of the hypoallergenic ones that doesn't give him painful reflux so I am grateful for that. Packaging is great and I love the 1 ounces scoops.",

I was using Nutramigen for the longest time so thought I would give this a try. I\u2019m comparison, it dissolves much quicker and doesn\u2019t smell as bad as the Nutramigen. Measurements are different so you have to convert ml to ounces for those in US but it\u2019s fairly easy to do that with google. I just noticed that the liquid seemed to sit on his stomach so that when I moved him after he ate I could hear it moving around in his stomach- not sure why that was. He didn\u2019t make any fuss when I changed the formula on him which was great. Overall it worked well and could be a good option especially with the shortage in the US.",

The container has a lot of good advice and instructions and warnings.The formula mixes into water well without any grainy texture.",

Bad taste isn't that surprising with hypoallergenic ingredients... I've definitely tasted worse.The scoop is small enough to work with any bottle, but doesn't have the normal hole/slit on the bottom I'm used to, so I guess it won't scoop as consistently as other brands. It's the European standard mix ratio of 1 scoop per 30mL (or 1 oz ish).I ordered this December 2022, and the tin is marked best by June 2024, so 18 months expiration from order.
