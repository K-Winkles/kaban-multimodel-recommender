We had her on Nutramigen for several months and then tried to make the switch back to gentle ease due to the smell and cost of Nutramigen and the fact that she didn\u2019t like the taste. We immediately had the same constipation issues and I tried Reguline as a last ditch effort and within a day my baby had softer poop! I wished that my pediatrician would have recommended it when we were first struggling with her as a newborn! It can be harder to find and doesn\u2019t have the nice refill boxes to save on plastic, but I\u2019ve been so happy that we have a non-stinky formula that our baby likes and tolerates so well.",

His pediatrician recommended that we try this as a last resort and WOW. I noticed a difference almost immediately.

                "reviewText": "This formula is amazing. We had our 3 month old on similac pro advance and Kirkland pro care brands. She was so fussy and gassy and would go 2-3 days without pooping. She would strain, grunt, arch her back, turn red and just couldn\u2019t poop. She even struggled to pass gas. When she did poop it was the consistency of clay, not good. We have been on this formula for a week, after the first day we have seen regular poops. Sometimes twice a day. She also seems MUCH happier not having to strain all the time to poop and pass gas.I would highly recommend this formula to any parents with babies having similar issues. I was hesitant at first since sometimes these things are just marketing ploys, not here. This is amazing formula and has made me a believer.",

                "reviewText": "Our 6 month old has had tummy trouble from the beginning. She\u2019s been on several formulas and we\u2019d finally stuck with Similac Pro-Sensitive as it had the least side effects on her.... until about 4 months. She began getting constipated and having bowel obstructions. The poor thing could not poop by herself. We had to help her. She was in so much pain and nothing we did really made much of a difference. We tried Mommy\u2019s Bliss Constipation Relief, prunes, Apple juice, tummy massages, bicycle legs, probiotics, warms baths... you name it.It wasn\u2019t until we decided to invest in this formula that our sweet baby had relief. She started making regular bowel movements within ONE day. She has been on it for about two weeks now and we\u2019ve seen a dramatic improvement in her mood and eating habits. So grateful for this formula. It\u2019s amazing!",

                "reviewText": "If your baby is constipated and you have ruled other things out like not enough fiber in diet.. you have to switch formulas. You can mix formulas to slowly get the baby used to the new one.. We had to start with 1 and three fourth of the old formula and 1/4 of reguline.. slowly increasing the amount of reguline and decreasing the old formula with each feed until she would take just reguline. This solved her issue with constipation.",

                "reviewText": "Our 6 month old has been having a lot of trouble having regular BMs over the last month or so, so much so that we had resorted to enimas every 4th day or so just to relieve the pressure that was building up in his system. We were using gentle ease formula as our son was a little gassy and spits up on a regular basis. We have tried everything else (with drs permission of course), Karo syrup, pear juice, and even miralax each day with no relief.We were commonly seeing what we referred to as a plug, a piece of poop stuck in his rectum, that he just couldn't get out. He would push and push and cry in pain, well I am happy to say that after 2 weeks of this new formula he is having a dirty diaper at least every other day and it is very soft and easy to pass.We saw no gassy side effects, stomach gurgled a bit but he didn't seem to mind it",
