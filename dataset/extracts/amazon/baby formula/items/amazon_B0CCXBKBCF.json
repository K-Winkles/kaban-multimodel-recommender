                "reviewText": "Our little one never drank formula and exclusively breastfed but we are in the process of weaning him and transitioning him to milk. I ordered this because I feel like it offers a lot more nutrition than cow's milk or nutmilk. He isn't guzzling it down like he would breastmilk but he definitely prefers this drink over any other milk we have attempted to give him! I like that its jam packed with nutrition because I can feel better amount him getting some nutrients versus an unknown amount with other milk products. It's convenient that it is a powder you mix because it is easy to take some on the go and be able to mix it up for him, especially when we are snacking or having a meal time where milk is not an option!",

                "reviewText": "I have a very tall, thin 13 month old. He drinks whole milk without any issues, but I worry about his calorie intake matching his body type. I give him 4-6oz of this formula a day for a little extra peace of mind. He like it, both mixed with his milk and on its own. It doesn't clump, and it doesn't have an odd smell like other formulas. Using that small amount makes this can last for quite a while. At its current price of $25.99 it is a bit expensive, but if it isn't your primary milk source then it can be affordable.",

This formula is expensive, and much less convenient than just pouring some milk. Once your little one starts eating a lot of solids, the importance of formula somewhat wanes...",
