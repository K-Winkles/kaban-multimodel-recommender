                "reviewText": "My son was born 4 weeks early and spent 20 days in the NICU. After we got him home, he was fussy with breast milk and not sleeping well. We spoke to our pediatrician about this and he stated he may have an intolerance to dairy. He suggested my wife stop drinking dairy. This however was difficult for my wife to do and then wait to see if it even made a difference. He obtained some free samples of Alimentum and noticed a big difference right away with him (less fussy). The only problem was he was begin to have severe acid reflux to the point where he was choking and having difficulty breathing. This was very scary and painful to watch him go through. We made another trip to the pediatrician who then gave us a prescription for Zantac which only helps with the burning of the acid reflux. He then tried Nutramigen to see if there would be any type of change and get rid of the choking spells. He was still having difficulty breathing at times just out of the blue in the middle of sleeping with the formula we were using.While no doubt in my mind Alimentum and Nutrimegen are good formulas (just not for our situation. After we spoke to a neighbor about our issues, she bought us an 8 pack of the premixed bottles of the Enfamil A.R. as her son had a lot of the same problems She was under the impression we were already using it as we told her we were using a \"special formula\". After literally the first bottle we were impressed and my son hardly spit up at all. We finished the 8 pack and have been using the powder since(going on 6 weeks).My son still continues to have spit up (sometimes a decent about and sometimes none at all after a bottle) but has not had the extreme acid reflux he did prior to us using this formula. We are no longer afraid of when he goes to sleep he will wake up choking and not being able to breathe. If you are having any of the same symptoms as we were dealing with I highly recommend this product. We are going through about a box a week now.",

Wasn\u2019t gaining weight, puking all the time. On 2 different meds. He was put on hypoallergenic formula, which was so expensive and also did not help. I trusted my mom gut to start this formula, and it changed everything. He spits up way less and has gained a ton of weight. Also luckily during the shortage, this formula has barely been affected. Always remember to trust your mom instincts!",

                "reviewText": "I tend to not write reviews unless I either love or hate a product. In this case I am reviewing a product that has saved my sanity and my wardrobe. My lil guy just turned 3 months and since birth has had a major spit up problem. We're talking over 25x day and in large quantities. I wasn't even sure he was getting any milk at all. (I am unable to produce bm so formula is my only option) He also deals with acid reflux which has been extremely challenging. I have tried everything from different formulas to prescription meds like zantac and Prilosec. The dr said that by treating the acid reflux that the spit up should decrease. They were wrong. As a Mom you go with your instinct and not always what the drs say. After trying every formula on the market, colic calm, etc. I finally found a solution. My lil guy takes 3 oz so here is my breakdown: 3/4 gerber good start gentle and 3/4 enfamil ar. The combination keeps his bowels regular. So far in 24hrs we have had one major spit up. This is amazing considering that everytime we gave him a bottle we would be covered in spit up. I know it may not work for every baby but as a Mom you should at least try. It could save your sanity and wardrobe too. :)",
