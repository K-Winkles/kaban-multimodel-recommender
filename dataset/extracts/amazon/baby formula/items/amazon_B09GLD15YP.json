                "reviewText": "Our baby had no issues switching to this. With the formula shortage, there has been an issue finding any at all, let alone the kind our baby actually needs. It was amazing to find this available, as I had no idea the brand even existed. The storage container and placeholder for the scoop are wonderful and keep the formula very fresh. We are incredibly happy with this purchase, and, most importantly, our baby is, too.",

The formula arrived is an easy to open box, with a leveling corner and neat place to store the scoop.My baby loves it, no issues there. The only minus is that it seems to be a bit harder to mix than the Similac ones",
