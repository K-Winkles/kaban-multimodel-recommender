It was a path down a very long road that would lead her to found Irene Organics some years later. \"Before starting Irene Organics Skincare I was a professional nanny for over 10 years and then later became a Certified Pediatric Sleep Consultant so I had a lot of experience working with parents and babies. I also had a passion for making my own natural, homemade skincare products and realized that the children I cared for responded well to my natural DIY products in comparison to larger store brand products\" - Irene 2020 saw Irene expecting her first child, and with this detailed knowledge of the industry behind her, she wanted to create a product that would be entirely safe for her, and for other moms to use. \"That's when I created my Pregnancy & Postpartum Mama line, to help mothers like me keep their skin feeling and looking good in a natural way without any harm to them or their little ones.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this because my daughter gets eczema around her mouth every time she eats something with corn or gluten in it. I also have some rough patches on my foot and I\u2019m not quite sure if it's eczema but I wanted to try this balm out on it. The balm is quite greasy which my 10 year old wasn\u2019t fond of but it does work well! I have been putting it on my rough patches on my foot and the skin is much improved. My kids\u2019 hands have been very chapped and I have been putting this on them daily as well as on my own hands. They are so much better. Overall I really like this product and will purchase it again. This product is not going to cure eczema because you have to treat the root cause (typically some type of intolerance to food or body product) but it is really great at getting rid of it when you have a flare up.see pictures posted. This is a quality product and I give it a 5-star rating!I hope you found this review Helpful.",

My doctor recommend Aveeno Eczema relief for babies, and while it makes my skin soft right after I showed/wash my face, within a few hours my skin begins to flake again.I gave this product a shot and I\u2019m liking it so far! It does feel a little oily, BUT it\u2019s a whole heck of a lot lighter than coconut oil moisturizer (which is what I was using before getting this balm) and it doesn\u2019t sting my ears when I apply it.If you\u2019re using Aveeno or CeraVe eczema relief, this is a great step up! It does smell a bit like Aveeno, so it has some kind of neutral \u201cplain\u201d scent with a hint of oatmeal.",
