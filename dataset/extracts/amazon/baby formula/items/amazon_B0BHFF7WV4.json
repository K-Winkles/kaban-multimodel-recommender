        "description": "No one wants their baby to have a sore booty! Try our Orginal Protective Baby Ointment to provide nourishment to the most sensitive skin. An original Dr. Pavlovic recipe, further developed by my grandfather, this is a perfect formula for daily use from the day your baby arrives. While there may be similar alternatives on the market, this product is fragrance-free, steroid-free, and only contains five simple ingredients! Our version of \u201cpavloviceva\u201d barrier cream is simple and baby-centered! When your baby has a sore bum or really any part of their body, they aren\u2019t happy so neither are you! By wearing diapers 24/7, their little bottoms are constantly exposed to bacteria-breeding moisture and excrement. This means they need extra care, which we\u2019re ready to provide! Lanolin helps moisturize skin and can prevent dry skin from emerging. It helps keep skin irritations away White Petroleum Jelly USP moisturizes dry, rough, and scaly skin which can often be found under your baby\u2019s diaper. This can help keep it away as well as help soothe any ongoing issues your little one may be facing! We\u2019ve also included Vitamin E to provide extra moisture to soothe any irritated areas. It may also help reduce redness, so you can see the irritation fade, while the little cries start to subside Has your baby\u2019s rash gotten a little out of hand? Our Protective Baby Ointment with Zinc Oxide is a stronger version of our original formula to help heal your little one\u2019s sores. In order to help absorb moisture and reduce skin-on-skin friction, Talcum can help prevent rashes from sticking around. This can help keep the bad moisture from excrement away from the baby\u2019s skin allowing the rest of the diaper cream to do its work to heal any sores. To really help heal any sores, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide can help soothe and protect the skin from rashes without the use of steroids. It can help reduce redness and irritation quickly. How to Use: Apply the ointment on dry and clean skin at every change of diaper",
