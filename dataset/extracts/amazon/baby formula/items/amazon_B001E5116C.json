                "reviewText": "I was using the RTF bottles to go for supplementing breastfeeding on the go and for night feedings.After returning to work, this is more economical. My son drinks 5 ounces every 3.5-4 hours. I pour these so his caregiver is able to feed him when I'm at work. This usually comes to 2 feedings during the day. I try to feed him before I leave. Occasionally, I'll leave a 2 ounce bottle just in case he needs more than I breastfed him for the next four hour span.Similac Feeding Guidelines are on their website, but I've copy and pasted them below:Birth-1 week: 6-10 feedings per day (approx every 2.5 - 4h); 2-3 fl oz per feeding1 week-1 month: 7-8 feedings per day (approx every 3 - 3.5h); 2-4 fl oz per feeding1-3 months: 5-6 feedings per day (approx every 4 - 4.5h) ; 4-5 fl oz per feeding3-6 months: 4-5 feedings per day (approx every 4.5 - 6h); 6-7 fl oz per feeding6-9 months: 3-4 feedings per day (approx every 6 - 8h) ; 7-8 fl oz per feeding9-12 months: 3 feedings per day (approx every 8h); 7-8 fl-oz per feedingEvery baby is different. My son is currently 10 weeks old. He should be eating every 4 hours. He's usually screaming at me by 3.5h (not at all ready for 4.5 hour stretches). So I feed him every 3.5 hours (sometimes even every 3 hours). He's healthy and happy. He used to wake up multiple times during the night for more feedings. He now sleeps through the majority of the night. If he wakes up, I breastfeed him at night. If he's still upset, I supplement with about 2 ounces.In looking at their recommended feedings, I can't imagine my son eating every 8 hours, because I eat more frequently. At a minimum, I eat every four hours during the day. After dinner, I don't eat again until the morning. This is the only potential 8 hour stretch I'm seeing... but who knows! My doctor says we should start discussing the addition of foods to my sons diet on his next visit. He'll be 3 months by then.In regards to his poop... Diapers look the same as they did when I was breastfeeding. When speaking with Similac about \"shipping temperatures\" .. they mentioned that their carrier was aware of proper temperatures to ship their product, which could cause delays in shipping during extreme temperatures. I'm not sure if Amazon does this. But... I can say, Amazon has never let my baby go hungry. This is the fastest shipping item on Amazon. I have never had to go elsewhere to buy overpriced Similac.",

However, the last three months I\u2019ve noticed none of the bottles come with the QR code anymore. Since I ordered two cases each order every two weeks I was able to get 25.00-30.00 off. Because the QR codes are no longer available this deal is no longer beneficial and I will ship via Similac.\ud83d\ude14",
