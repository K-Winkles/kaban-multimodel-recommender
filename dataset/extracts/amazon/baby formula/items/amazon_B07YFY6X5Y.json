I tried many other, but this is the only one that has worked. I highly recommend it to any mom who is facing gassy problems with their baby.The only downside is that the poop smell is a bit worse after using this product. My baby's mouth also sometimes stinks, but this is a minor inconvenience compared to the relief from gas.The price on Amazon is competitive, and the product is delivered the next day, which is great. Overall, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.",
