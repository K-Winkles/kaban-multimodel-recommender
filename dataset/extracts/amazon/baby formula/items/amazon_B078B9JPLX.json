                "reviewText": "So happy to have an unscented, all-natural, organic balm that is safe for my baby's delicate skin! Originally purchased this to use as diaper balm. Works wonders! Thinly applied small amount to baby's diaper area any time the slightest red appeared and it helped restore the skin almost overnight! Has worked well with cloth diapers- seems to wash out fine- no staining or repelling noted! With the colder weather, I have now been using it on baby's face as well before going outside to help protect the skin from chapping! Again, I love that it is unscented and therefore isn't noxious to apply on nose and face. Tube is small but a tiny amount goes along way. Melts onto skin and spreads easily for thin application. Noticed some oil separation in the tube during the warmer weather months, but have continued to use product as is without any issues. Very happy with this product and have recommended it to friends!",

The only thing I wish was different is the oil separation in the tube. Sometimes no matter how much you squeeze the tube around to try and mix it before dispensing, it still doesn\u2019t remix and you get a squirt of oil before the balm comes out.",

                "reviewText": "[Photos made black and white to help see skin texture better.] We have been dealing with dermatitis on my baby's face since she started drooling more and eating solids at 4 months. The rash was on her chin, cheeks, nose, and on her lower eyelids. She would spread drool around her face with teething toys and her hands and rub her eyes a lot. We tried to keep her face and rash dry but any time it got wet or we were out in sunlight, it looked pretty bad / dry / inflamed. We worried it might be a food allergy. Have been using this ointment a couple times a day for almost a week and the rash is much improved... only a few individual bumps here and there but the rash is no longer red and bumpy and dry. I'm very happy with the result. We went with this product because I didn't want to use vaseline or aquaphor around her mouth (in case of ingestion) and opted for beeswax-based product instead. The smell is very mild. It is worth a try if you are dealing with a similar rash. Like other reviewers said, product seems to separate oil and the thicker balm. Still works. It is pricier from this seller than from walmart, etc.",
