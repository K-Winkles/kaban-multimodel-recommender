                "reviewText": "For years, I\u2019ve been on a never-ending quest to find the perfect skincare product to address my combination skin and its myriad of issues\u2014from dry patches to occasional breakouts. I\u2019ve spent a small fortune on creams, oils, and serums that promised the moon but seldom delivered. That all changed when I stumbled upon this Beef Tallow Whipped Facial Cream. I was initially skeptical, considering beef tallow is more commonly associated with cooking rather than skincare. However, after researching its benefits and reading multiple glowing reviews, I decided to give it a shot.Texture and Consistency:Upon opening the jar, the first thing that struck me was its luxurious texture. The whipped consistency is light and fluffy, making it easy to apply and quick to absorb into the skin. Unlike many plant-based oils and creams, this beef tallow cream doesn't leave an oily residue but instead forms a protective barrier that makes the skin feel incredibly soft and supple.Ingredients:The product prides itself on being made from 100% grass-fed beef tallow, sourced from sustainable farms. Besides beef tallow, it also contains a blend of essential oils like lavender and chamomile, which not only adds a pleasant, subtle aroma but also has anti-inflammatory properties. The ingredient list is refreshingly minimal, devoid of any harmful chemicals, artificial fragrances, or preservatives, making it ideal for sensitive skin types.Efficacy:After just one week of daily application, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and tone of my skin. The dry patches on my cheeks were nearly gone, and my T-zone was far less oily than before. I also had fewer breakouts, and the ones that did appear seemed to heal more quickly.",

I can't wait to see how my skin feels/looks in the morning. I have extremely dry skin, so I'm hoping this does the trick!! If it works as I'm hoping, I will definitely be reordering!",

Very rarely do I find a product that doesn\u2019t have synthetic fragrances that actually smells good on my skin (lavender smells awful on me and I have a ton of allergies).A little goes a long way. It melts into the skin and moisturizes way better than anything else I\u2019ve ever used. My skin dislikes lotions and creams, but does okay with oils. This is the best thing I\u2019ve ever tried. I put it on my very dry hands and a little on my combination oily face and both skin has responded well. Really impressed. Overall skin has improved in the last week. Love knowing I\u2019m not putting any chemicals on my body too.I just ordered some soaps and a couple of their other products to try.",

This balm is moisturizing, smells amazing and it\u2019s filled with the ingredients that\u2019s you can even pronounce. I damaged my skin barrier trying DIY home skincare and this stuff helps build it back in no time. Obsessed with this company now. And it\u2019s a small business that is a neighboring state so that is a plus!",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with this stuff. I was a little hesitant because other tallow products I\u2019ve seen that were used on the face were super oily and didn\u2019t really absorb and I\u2019ve also read that the smell can be weird, not this product! I have combo skin, oily t zone but live in Colorado so super dry! I use this as my night cream because it does take a minute to absorb but it goes on so light, does not create excess oil, and there is no smell. This is now my new go to night time face cream. I\u2019ve also used this on my daughters ezcema and she loves it, other stuff was burning her skin and also leaving her clothes oily since it would never absorb. Also a huge fan this is a family owned small business, all those giant companies put way too much crap in skin care products that just lead to health issue down the road. If you are looking for a tallow product this is it!!!",
