My baby can of Neocate was finished and the formula we tried while waiting on the Alfamino gave her diarrhoea \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dCompare to others \u2014 it tastes better, that\u2019s for sure, and my 6+ months now drink more frequently. She was a NICU baby (30W 5Days) who had NEC (didn\u2019t get surgical\u2014thank God) She weighed 8lb upon getting discharged\u2026 had her on Neocate for a while but weight gain was quite slow. When Neocate went out of stock Alfamino was given to us as an alternative\u2026 BOOM \ud83e\udd2f amazing weight gain. Better than when she was on Neocate. So, I decided to stick with Alfamino.She truly grow on this formula.I notice some compare this formula with Puramino, which isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019d choose Puramino over Neocate, but never over Alfamino. Puramino, to my surprise, gives off a greasy-like feel. It\u2019s very hard to mix as well.In the end, it\u2019s what our child will take, but don\u2019t give \u201clow-ratings\u201d purely because your child didn\u2019t \u201clike it\u201d.Happy feeding to all \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
