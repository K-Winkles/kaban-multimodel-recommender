Doing by syringe has proven difficult for not only myself, but my husband and mother in law as well. Being able to mix his dose with a little bit of formula in this little bottle is a lifesaver. He takes it no problem now. And it fits in the zipper case from my Frida mobile medicine cabinet. Syringe and zipper case pictured for size reference. I will say that I wish the top was screw on and didn't just pop on and off and I also wish it had a lid. This would help in getting a dose ready beforehand to store in my mini fridge and having it ready when he needs it. But other than that, it's a wonderful product!",

Avant de trouver ce biberon, j'utilisais des t\u00e9tines de biberons que mon b\u00e9b\u00e9 rejetait (nous sommes en allaitement exclusif). En plus de \u00e7a, les t\u00e9tines conventionnelles coulent seules, ce qui compliquait la prise du m\u00e9dicament (d\u00e9bit trop rapide) et on renversait une grande partie du liquide \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9.
