I chose it because it was the only brand I could find that didn\u2019t have corn syrup as one of the main ingredients. We also didn\u2019t want something cow milk based because of a history of dairy allergy in the family. It of course is not meant to be a sole source of nutrition like infant formula but we\u2019ve loved it for supplementing. I guess the flavor is pretty good, my daughter likes it and she\u2019s rejected just about every other formula we tried. The price it pretty fair but sometimes in the past it has been hard to find available to ship quickly so we\u2019ve had to be careful to keep enough on hand. I just put it on subscribe and save so I always have enough plus I get a discount on price. We are still using it for my little one at 2 1/2 years old.",
