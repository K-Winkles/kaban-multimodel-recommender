She is in way less pain. The flavor is not so bad for her. She didn't bat an eye, yes, it is a tad sour because of the lemon, but definitely doable. I added 2.5 ml to a medicine doser bottle with a nipple and she took it right down (in between meals). She is about 6 weeks old and was born a preemie. But I waited until she was term and talked in detail with my pediatrician before considering. I love GOL brand for the adults in our household and was excited to see something so clean available for my baby girl's precious developing system.",

I give it to her 4x a day, three times right before she eats and once in a mini bottle with a little breast milk and her multivitamin. She gulps it down and doesn't notice. From what I read, \"they\" say it works best when not added to anything, but I don't really know. Hey as long as it keeps her tummy settled, it's a winner in my book!!! Definitely worth trying.UPDATE: After using this for 3 months, I can definitively say it still works. For my baby, I figured out 1mL to each ounce of milk directly in the bottle after it's warmed is the best. She doesn't mind the taste at all, it helps her burp without being too aggressive, and she's much happier. Her tummy issues have drastically reduced. Life saver!",

                "reviewText": "I've used other brands of gripe water in the past. With my first born, I used zarbees brand. But I can't find it in stock anywhere, now. So I chose this brand because the formula matches zarbees brand the closest. Unfortunately, I didn't read where it says it needs to be refrigerated and the 2nd time I used it, my daughter spit it all up. It's totally my fault. I should have done a better job reading the label. But I've never bought another brand of gripe water that needed to be refrigerated. Since making this mistake, I searched online and haven't found another brand of gripe water that needs to be refrigerated. It's a bit odd. I wasted an entire bottle and gave my baby something that had gone bad by sitting at room temperature. Again, that's my fault. But I wanted to make it clear to everyone else that buys this product... Don't forget to refrigerate it.I lowered the star rating because it's really inconvenient to have to refrigerate it. My kitchen is on the 1st floor. We spend most of our time on the 2nd floor. And my daughter really hates that it's so cold. So I found a different brand to use (with a different formula) at room temp until my baby gets less picky about the temperature of things. It would be a lot easier if I could administer this product at room temperature.",

With this one he literally gags \ud83e\udd23 i bought this one instead of the one we had since it has more organic ingredients. It is not sweet at all it is just kind of blah like the flavors are just there and don't really go together. My main complaint is the dosage is a lot larger than the others like seriously 5 times more so its difficult to give to him and he chokes a lot.",

                "reviewText": "I would not recommend this product. Save your money and don\u2019t try it.We use gripe water in our home almost every day. We have been trying several different brands to find the \u201cbest\u201d gripe water, evaluating this based on the ingredients, effectiveness, and stain-factor.The reason I rated this product so low is this is the ONLY gripe water my baby hates.It doesn\u2019t have agave, which is part of what I liked about the ingredients, as it isn\u2019t ideal to give my 4-month-old sugar, especially right before bed time which is often when she needs it. Because it doesn\u2019t have agave, it is not sweet, and I\u2019m assuming due to the lemon balm, it is bitter and sour. I tasted it myself and I could understand why she isn\u2019t a fan. She will hold it in her mouth, then turn to the side so it will all drizzle out and avoid swallowing.It\u2019s not inherently a bad product. I love this brand and I trust the quality of the ingredients. I also love that it is clear and doesn\u2019t stain. I just wish the company would find some way to incorporate a sweetness factor so it is slightly more palatable to a baby. I\u2019m disappointed to have to throw away the bottle.",
