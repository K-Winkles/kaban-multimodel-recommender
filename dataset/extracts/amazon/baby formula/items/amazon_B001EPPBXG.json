                "reviewText": "I was advised by my pediatrician to start feeding my baby cereal to get him accustomed to the taste and texture of food. Hubby and I excitedly went out and got for him \"G___\" rice cereal. My poor baby was making faces while eating his rice cereal but was a pretty good sport and still swallowed. I was fed Cerelac as a baby and I decided that my baby should try some too. He was smiling and laughing while I was feeding him Cerelac. He obviously enjoyed his dinner. :-) My only concern is that the 4 pack cans expire on 10/12 and I don't know if my baby will be able to eat everything by then, since he's also taking breast milk. I wish the cans will have a later expiration date. Next time, I will just stick to the single cans. Although pricier, I will be sure there won't be any waste.",

It was a tough job to feed her and we tried every type of cereal that's available locally.On a vacation trip last year, we bought this cereal and she loved it. After returning home, we tried to find it but could not find a store that carried it. As a last resort, I searched for it on Amazon and to a big relief Amazon had it. It's a little pricey on Amazon but at least my daughter eats it without any problem. We have been mixing it with milk instead of water and she seems to like that. Great product.",

One of the finest food texture for babies to eat/chew. I has good nutrition value as well. he only factor I disliked, is it's too expensive (34$ for 4, 8.5$ per 14.11 ounce can. I searched it in retail offline giant store but couldn't find any. It lasts only 1 month for us, so we need it each month, so I was expecting a price bracket around 25 max.",

Right now we control how much we can give to our kid and only offer him on special occasions and not daily as we would like. The product itself is very good although I prefer the Portuguese version - it requires a lot less powder to have the same amount of prepared cerelac",

Not only did she took to it as fish to water, this has made easy for us to mix fruit and veges in puree form and offer her as meals during the day time. This is one constant snack/breakfast/meal that she enjoyed from 6 to 14 months. Absolutely recommend it.",
