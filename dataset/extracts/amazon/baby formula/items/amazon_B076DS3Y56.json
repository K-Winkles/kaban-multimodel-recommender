                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying this formula is likely not the \"best tasting\" one out there. \"Best tasting\" when it comes to food is often the worst when it comes to nutrition. If you're concerned about taste/smell this formula is probably not for you. I personally am un-bothered by the smell and only read the nutritional label when making my choice. If you're concerned about the quality of ingredients, don't want an obese child, and want to give your kid the best nutritional formula the US has to offer.... This product is for you.Secondly, I highly recommend ordering the refill packs on Amazon. Get your initial plastic tub from the grocery store then refill it the $55 box from Amazon. It's cheaper and you don't have to worry about seals being broken.This stuff is expensive.... But it helped develop my thriving 10-month-old who is talking, laughing, smiling, communicating, and hitting all of her physical milestones with ease. She was born 5 weeks early and we worried about her mental development. She was tiny and behind other babies at first in her milestones. Since my wife breastfed and could never keep up, this was initially recommended by our pediatrician to help supplement and eventually transition from breast milk. The lactoferrin and MFGM are the special ingredients along with lactose being it's only sweetener instead of corn syrup. The MFGM makes a big difference in mental development while the lactoferrin helps develop a healthy gut (which attributes to the loads of parents saying this is the only thing their little ones can keep down). These are the only two ingredients that set it apart from traditional formulas... and they truly make a world of difference. This stuff is great. If it is just a little too expensive check out Enfamil NeuroPro... Which is basically the same thing just minus the Lactoferrin (it still contains the brain developing MFGM). Hopefully next time our next child decides to stay in the belly full-term, the breastfeeding starts off on the right foot and continues through one year. If not, I won't think twice before using Enfamil Enspire again. It's truly a no-brainer and we are so grateful to Enfamil for developing this incredible formula.",

I think the ingredients are the best amongst other lines of products for Enfamil. The package is better value than the tubes. Other places often do not have this product in stock due but I don\u2019t find a problem purchasing from Amazon. Also you can use the registry discount.",

                "reviewText": "Ive been meaning to write this review for a while now.After a very difficult, but not very long, pregnancy, my son was born premature at 30 weeks at 3lbs 7 oz. After feeling betrayed by my body with being able to incubate him to term, I was ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED to nurse him. For the first three months, managed to nurse exclusively, but once he made it out of NICU, and I went back to back, nursing became more and more difficult. I couldn't keep up, and my son wasn't growing. The suggestion from the pediatrician came that it was time to start supplementing. One bottle became two, became three, and my supply dwindled more and more. Unfortunately, he still was not growing. The problem was he was spitting up about 75% of everything he would drink. We were having to limit him to 3-4oz bottles, and he was holding down maybe half of that. We changed his outfit 4+ times a day, and never were more than a few feet away from a burp cloth. His doctors though it was reflux, and gave him medication to take 4x a day, but it didn't help. He simply was not gaining weight like he should have been. Yellow, Purple, Nutramagin, the preemie formula, nothing was \"sticking\".Then we wandered through Publix, and saw this on the shelf. My husband and I debated back and forth, because it was almost twice the price of the others, but ultimately we decided it was worth a shot right?Took him home, gave him a bottle, and waited. No spit up. Fluke right?Next bottle.......... No spit up.Next....... bigger bottle. No spit up.Literally instantaneously, he was holding his bottles down. Every once in a while, after a 5-6oz bottle, he'd burp and spit up some, but generally speaking, he wasn't PUKING like he had been. And he started gaining weight. My 7 month old who had still been wearing 0-3 month old clothes, had a major growth spurt, and jumped to the top end of 3-6 month old clothes. He was doing amazing!!!So we said, great maybe he's outgrown this! And we switched back to the yellow one. His first bottle, he threw up the entire thing. His second bottle, he threw up the entire thing. He never got a third bottle. I still have a practically full can of yellow Enfamil sitting on top of my microwave because I can't bring myself to give it to him.We've been using this formula for 7 weeks now. He's gained TWO POUNDS, and is up to 6-9 month old clothes. It is so expensive, and WIC doesn't cover it, so we struggle to keep up with the cost, but to see my son not crying, or puking for the first time in his life, is a miracle.His 10 month old check up was last week. For the first time in his life, he is on the charts. He is 1% for his age now.Thank you Enfamil.",
