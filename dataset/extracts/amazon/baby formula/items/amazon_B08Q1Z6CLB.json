                "reviewText": "When my son was born we had difficulty finding a good bottle for him not only due to colic and acid reflux but also bc he was breastfed for only about a month so there was some confusion over his preference. We tried Avent, dr browns, nuk ect.. and these were by far the best. I like how you don\u2019t have to buy separate nipples for flow, the flow is based on the size of the bottle which makes sense and for my hungry boy the flow was perfect. They are very easy to clean as well. My son just turned 2 so we have reduced bottle use but he still needs one at night and has chewed a few of the nipples but they have lasted very well overall.",

                "reviewText": "My baby was ready to switch to fast flow bottles and he was using the avent bottles before and I couldn\u2019t find the fast flow avent bottles anywhere!! I bought these after reading the reviews. I was a little nervous but wow! I\u2019m so glad I purchased. He loved them right away. He loves the nipple! That was my biggest worry. Some people wrote that it does leak but honestly it\u2019s very little. If you tilt the bottle down ward it does SLOWLY drip out of the nipple... but i mean, it\u2019s a bigger hole in the nipple so I would expect it to. I still give this bottle 5 stars!! Especially that my baby had no problem drinking from it after drinking so long from the avent bottles. Worth the buy! And the price is awesome \ud83d\ude04",
