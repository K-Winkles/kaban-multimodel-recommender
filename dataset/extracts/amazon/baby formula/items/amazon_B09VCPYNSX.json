Now, I know she's getting all the amino acids she needs and some extra calories to give her more energy. I really like the taste too. Makes more nutritious pancakes and cookies.",

                "reviewText": "**Update** My son had the entire can and gets excited when he sees it and calls it his \u201cmilk\u201d haha to clarify hes 3 yrs old and I can\u2019t be thankful enough that this exists. My husband is happy knowing he\u2019s at least getting supplemented as he doesn\u2019t eat much not even candy to make him take vitamins.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-This product gives me peace of mind that my son is getting the nutrients he needs alongside some protein. He has yet to try any meat and was seriously lacking in protein.He has serious food aversions that literally makes him scream, tremble, and gag, not to mention bad constipation and this formula helps aid in his digestion.He still eats only pur\u00e9ed foods w oatmeal or mashed potatoes with a couple snacks here and there. I have hope one day he will eat more but this formula is God send for us!The taste is actually quite good! I do add a tsp or less of sugar for his liking. It smells like chocolate milk to me but tastes closely to soy milk but it has no soy! Haha10/10 would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Spent $30 on something my kid won't touch....She's 14 months and in the process of weaning. We've been giving her Silk Next Milk or So Delicious Wondermilk, which she drinks just fine, but I wanted to give her some toddler formula once or twice a day because it's more nutritious and filling.I've tried introducing it to her once or twice a day every day for almost a week now. I've tried using water or milk or a combo of both. I've tried cutting the amount of formula mixed in by half. Nothing works. She'll take one sip and then nothing until I give her the regular milk or breast milk again.I like the ingredients and that's it's plant based and organic and all that, but if my toddler won't drink it, none of that really matters, does it? Unfortunately wasted my money here. Maybe the company could improve the taste to make it more acceptable to kids. I've tried tasting it too and it's not very good. Has a weird aftertaste",

                "reviewText": "This product is amazing. Smells good, looks good, tastes great. Our baby loves it and it seems much easier on them than regular amino acid formulas. Our baby loves drinking this stuff, whereas with other options they just tolerate and eat it. Also they digest it more quickly so they eat more meals per day with this compared to amino acid formula. Lastly no spit up or vomit so far. Mind blown. Thank you ELSE \u2764\ufe0f",
