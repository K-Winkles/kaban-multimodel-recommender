                "reviewText": "i've used desitin preventatively with every diaper change since my daughter was born, but i feel like it just disappeared between changes, and she still developed diaper rash a few times anyway. then i actually read the ingredients and realized it has talc in it, which has been shown to cause reproductive cancers in females, so i stopped using it immediately and bought this as a talc-free alternative. i like this so much better, and i wish i had used this from the beginning. you can really feel and see the barrier this cream leaves on the skin, even between diaper changes. it's exponentially more expensive which is a huge downside, but we're fortunate that we can afford it, and i will be using this from now on.",

We now keep it everywhere - diaper bag, daycare, nursery, change table. There is a size that comes with a pop top as opposed to the screw on lid which is much easier for diaper changes but still highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s currently 4:00am as I write this feeding my one month old. Now this is my third baby so I know they poop a lot, but this baby is a poop machine, plus for a cold from her sister (thanks daycare). My new baby is literally pooping ever diaper. So needless to say it\u2019s hard for any cream to work when you\u2019re constantly having to wipe her bottom. I read the reviews for this cream and decided to give it a chance, I recorded it yesterday and used right away, as of her last diaper change, the sores are looking so much better and just about gone, already!!! Idk what\u2019s different about this stuff, but it works! I was using my go to purple Destin and it wasn\u2019t seeming to help at all aside from maybe keeping it from getting worse. I used that with my other 2 kids and swore by it. This will be my go to from now on and I\u2019ll continue to spread the word. Worth every penny!!! P",

                "reviewText": "Listen! You want to read this comment.I have tried almost ALL diaper creams in the market, including the famous Arbonne. They either smell terrible, stain the baby's skin, don't fix the rash, or are too thick to spread...worse still, some of them are all these things combined. Anyway, in a desperate attempt to find ONE MORE THING TO TRY, I landed on this product. I was skeptical, but I opted to trust the reviews and try it. My baby was transitioning to solids, so she was having diaper rashes a lot, even though we changed her every hour.First, there is no smell (it's so faint that I don't even smell it!). 2nd, even with my finger, it slides on the skin like butter. 3rd, I used a wet wipe to wipe it off and noticed this cream didn't stain her skin. I wiped her clean with no residue left. Okay, now they got me! 4th, this changed my life as a mum and my baby's bum...her rash was gone, OVERNIGHT! No kidding! This company doesn't pay me anything to say this...but I didn't trust it the first time, too, until it happened repeatedly! The best part is that once the rashes are gone, her skin is healthy and doesn't leave scars.Fast forward, my daughter is two years old. I have NEVER looked back! I give this cream to all my mum friends, and now this is what parents get at their baby showers, lol. If you are still reading this review, add it to the cart already. I know...I know...just because it worked for me doesn't mean it will work for you; that's true! But what do you have to lose?P.S: If you are a parent like me who doesn't like cross-contamination...I bought those tiny disposable wooden ice cream scoops to use with every diaper change and discard. How much? I think it was 500 pieces for less than $10. You are welcome :)",
