We tried other pre-made hi calorie drinks recommended/prescribed by our GI and Pediatrician; however, they all made my son sick. This product seems to do the job and mixes well with his milk, yogurt, or any other pureed foods.For those struggling with kids and weight gain, don't lose hope. Our son went from below the 5th percentile to now into the 16th. This may not seem like much to some, but trust me it makes a huge difference to see that something is making a difference.",

                "reviewText": "Miraculous product. I get a couple hundred extra calories into my toddler with this. No doctors or any other medical professionals suggested this for my failure to thrive daughter. In the last month she gained more weight than the average child her age for basically the first time ever. I couldn't be more happy with itl",

If you can find the balance, you generally can get good results, even when adding it to water. We only get about 40-50 calories for 6 oz of water, compared to milk at 20 cal/oz, but it is better than nothing.",
