That\u2019s all good stuff but the best is that there\u2019s no corn syrup solids. Crazy that corn syrup is put on formula. The only draw back is that we\u2019ve transitioned to just formula so my baby is constipated at present. But it helps to put just a little bit more water in the bottle past your desired ounce level.EDIT: this is the second time, on separate containers, that I\u2019ve cut myself on the inside downward facing lip of the can. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just stupid or what \ud83d\ude05 but the first time it bled like a pig. The pic is of my second cut- the smaller one. So just be extra careful!",

                "reviewText": "I nursed my daughter for 8 months and then decided to switch to formula. We wanted to try this since I was worried how she would take the change and she took to the switch seamlessly. The ingredients seem to be a better option over some other formulas and it actually seems to have a better taste as well (my husband tasted it and said it was a little sweeter than others). I also love that it doesn\u2019t smell awful like others. We used Similac Advanced with our other daughter and it had that noticeable formula smell. It doesn\u2019t make my daughter gassy or upset her stomach so I think this would be great to try with babies that seem to have a more sensitive stomach (as long as a pediatrician approves!). The only negative I can think of is that it isn\u2019t as readily available at my local stores but Target seems to be stocking it lately. We\u2019re so happy with this that we decided we\u2019re going to try the toddler version when our daughter turns one in a couple of months.",

                "reviewText": "After conducting thorough research and comparing various options, our top priority was finding a formula that closely mimicked the benefits of breast milk while ensuring our baby remained comfortable without experiencing gas or bloating. We were pleased to discover this remarkable product, which not only fulfilled our expectations but also exceeded them in several aspects. The formula effortlessly blends with water, eliminating any concerns about clumps or lumps, and unlike its counterparts, it possesses a pleasant aroma that doesn't overpower. Moreover, our little one displayed remarkable contentment, as evident by their minimal fussiness. This formula has truly proven to be a standout choice for our baby's nutritional needs, and we highly recommend it to fellow parents seeking a professional-grade baby formula. When we cannot give bm this is great for supplement.",
