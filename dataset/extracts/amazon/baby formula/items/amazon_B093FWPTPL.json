                "reviewText": "Let me first say that if you can breast feed this is the best for you baby hands down. Some times life happens and you can't. The problem is most formulas are so bad for your baby I don't know how they can sell this as food for any person let alone for a baby. So finding a good formula that won't harm you baby is next to imposable. I have only found 2 and the other one used kelp powder in there formula which could contain heavy metals. In comes Growth Spurt. First they used methylated vitamins in there mix which is amazing because 44% of kids can't process Folic acid which can cause a whole host of problems. The other is B12. Most formulas used Cyanocobalamin. Let me stress this is B12 with Cyanid attached to the Cobalamin molecule. Not good. Growth Spurt does use the best ingredients in there formula hands down. The only ingredient I have a problem with is Sunflower Lecithin. The other amazing thing about this company is their response time to email questions. I saw a discrepancy between the ingredients on amazon and the ones on there website. I sent and email and with in an hour they not only got back to me but updated there website to reflect what is on the back of the can. Amazing! If your looking for a formula this is as close to breastmilk as your going to get.",

We are transitioning her off breast milk and I am thankful that Growth Spurt offers a healthy option for babies.I love that all of the ingredients are clean ingredients and that growth spurt uses full cream goats milk.I was also impressed growth spurt uses healthy oils like coconut oil. Most formulas are full of unhealthy oils.I\u2019m also thankful there is no sugar or high fructose corn syrup in this formula. That was a requirement that was very important to me.We love growth spurt formula and will continue to use the toddler formula until 24 months.Thank you for providing healthy options for my baby girl",
