                "reviewText": "I switched to this formula a few weeks ago post Similac cb formula recall. My daughter is one month old and started out on Similac pro advance formula supplemented to breast milk in the hospital/first week. I suspected that she was having a GI issue with milk/lactose but wanted to continue with the first formula and eventually try a sensitive formula for her belly before starting a true elimination diet. I stopped breastfeeding after the first week due to her response to the milk.Background info, my son (18 months) seemed to have similar issues as an infant but as a FTM I didn\u2019t question the pediatrician saying it was normal when formula feeding. Once he turned 1yo and started real Milk I realized my initial milk/lactose suspicion was in fact true. He\u2019s now on A2 milk and has to drink 2oz of prune juice with his water a day to be regular. He\u2019s scheduled with a Gastro to determine the cause of his constipation so I can do whatever possible to get in front of his issue versus all the juice.Back on track - I was actually getting ready to swap my daughter to the Similac sensitive when their recalls began. It seemed as if the Happy Baby formula was the most cost-effective and closest option at the time, not to mention available for purchase in stores. I understand that when we switch formula it may take some time for the baby to adjust - but she honestly never had a soft stool or comfortable belly while on this formula (after using 4 cans). I tried to stick it out but after noticing how frothy the formula gets when mixed and her beginning to have what seemed like reflux symptoms I immediately swapped to another brand. To be clear, I originally figured she was going to have the same mild issues as my son did and was waiting for her next appointment in a few weeks to discuss the proper formula brand options.Every baby is different but the Happy Baby Sensitive formula gave her extremely hard stool and constipation. Our pediatrician suggested adding pear or prune juice to her bottle (sigh) - which I refuse to do this young. Oh, and they added that as long as she was going to the bathroom once or twice a week that she would be fine (major red flag for me). Using a Fridababy windi or rectal thermometer shouldn\u2019t be your \u201cgo to\u201d remedy. Do your research as a parent, read reviews and take action on what may be best for your baby. I have since switched pediatricians - You are their only advocate. I do have to credit our Chiropractor and TheFormulaMom on Instagram for pointing me in the Kabrita formula direction because on DAY ONE of swapping she had normal bowel movements, no spit up, no wheezing/congestion and a nice soft belly. Not to mention her skin is back to a nice pale color and starting to clear up from Milia and infant acne that may also be a response to issues with A1 in milk.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This formula was the easiest transition from infant formula! Previous formula was a cow based and she didn\u2019t skip a beat when we introduced this one as she\u2019s not huge into the solids game yet. It dissolves super well and the seal on the can is super aggressive so I\u2019ve never had a busted can upon arrival and I\u2019ve had a pretty beat up can or two so that\u2019s definitely saying something. Impressed with ingredients and have great peace of mind with the quality 12/10 recommend",

Both of my daughters showed food sensitives from a very early age so I wanted a goat milk formula made with high quality ingredients and packed with essential vitamins and minerals to ensure I was providing them with the best. They never had any reactions to this and also thrived physically while enjoying this and seriously they loved it, both were actually sad when they outgrew this and no longer needed it due to age. Absolutely love this product, yes it is more expensive than some other formulas but that is because it is high quality and provides everything our infant/toddler needs.",

A friend recommended it to me and my husband when we were considering going the formula route but was also hesitant due what we\u2019ve heard about the leading brands of formula. After trying this formula for the first time we didn\u2019t notice any allergy reaction from it so we decided to keep getting it and since then, we\u2019ve had no issues with it so far and I\u2019ve been using it for 3-4 months now. My baby loves it and has had no stomach or gas problems. Spit ups don\u2019t stink either! I thank God for it!",
