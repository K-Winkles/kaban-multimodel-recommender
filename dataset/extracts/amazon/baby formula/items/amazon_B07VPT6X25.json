Catching Up on the Inside, Too Even after your baby has caught up on the outside, Similac NeoSure continues to deliver beneficial nutrients that support growth and development you can\u2019t see\u2014such as for internal organs, muscles, bones, and the brain.

Enriched Nutrition for a Preemie\u2019s First Year Similac NeoSure supports better rates of growth during a premature baby\u2019s first year compared to term infant formula.1 It has increased protein, vitamins, and minerals compared to term infant formula, and nucleotides for the developing immune system.
