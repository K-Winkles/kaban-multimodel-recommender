We were apprehensive about switching to formula from breast milk, but we have seen nothing but great results from this formula. Our baby girl has had no spit ups or upset stomachs from this formula. It has been a seamless transition and we couldn\u2019t be happier with Aussie Bubs",

                "reviewText": "My baby loves this formula. It seems easy to digest. It smells better (less fishy) than some American brands. My only complaint is the spoon, which is buried in the formula. Do they really expect people to dig it out from the formula? It\u2019s poor hygiene. I would recommend making a smaller spoon, adding a holder on the inside of the lid, and putting the spoon there, which is how Kendamil cans are designed. I like that design way better. Other than that, I highly recommend this formula.",
