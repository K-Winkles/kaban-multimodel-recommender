The lovely horn on the top of travel formula dispenser keeps it stable while adding it. It is easy to clean and dry.",
            "Multiple Compartments: A milk powder dispenser is a great way to store your formula. It has multiple compartments so you can keep the spoon separate from the formula. This keeps out of dirt and dust. The leveller design helps you scoop out each spoonful of formula precisely without wasting.",
            "WIDELY APPLICABLE: The formula container is used to store 230g of powdered milk. It can hold about 30 scoops (1 scoop = 5.0g). This dispenser is easy to use, just be ready to feed, add the powder into the feeding bottle of pre-boiled water, shake it and feed your baby. The container also works as a fruit storage container, snack cup for cookies and other similar items.",
            "EASY TRAVELER BOX: It is transparent, allows you to see the contents clearly. The box has a scale which makes it easy to determine how much milk powder is left inside. This milk powder dispenser is of the ideal size for portability. It fits in bags and hands and comes in handy while travelling and visiting friends, or relatives with babies. It even makes on-the-go feeding easier."

I use it for formula currently, and it hasn't leaked at all. it's a great size to fit a pretty good amount into without having to worry about running out, and also fits well in a diaper bag to carry around without taking up too much room for diapers and such. The spoon that comes eith it is half the size of the scoops provided with most formulas is the only downside, as you have to remember to use the right amount if formula.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little container!! It\u2019s perfect for an overnight stay or day trip somewhere. It holds 30 scoops of formula perfectly, for us that\u2019s 2 full days worth of bottles. The only thing that I was disappointed with is the scoop it comes with. It\u2019s cute! But it\u2019s not an accurate scoop for formula. The scoop from the formula bin fits laying sideways on the top so it\u2019s not a big deal! Other than that, this is great!",

The scoop that comes with it was way too small for the amount of formula needed to use so I switched it myself. No powder escapes due to it having a great seal when latched on properly.

My kiddos formula intake ranges and having a pre measured option just wasn\u2019t going to work. This dispenser is easy to fill and it would usually last a full day before needing to be refilled. The small measuring spoon is too small and I ended up reusing one of the spoons that comes with his formula. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with the whole conversions of small spoon to big spoon. I love love love that it doesn\u2019t take much space, at all! The product is durable, easy to use, secure (has never opened or spilled on me), and purchased for a great price.",

The scoop however, is smaller than the formula can scoop, so I just included the one from my can. To me, it\u2019s no big deal, but that would be the only flaw. You can still use the scoop that comes with it if you did not want to include your own. It\u2019s just one scoop to one ounce water. But again, it\u2019s super cute\u2026. Seals tightly\u2026. Very convenient for on the go\u2026. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!",
