I can separate each meal and easily offer it according to my baby's needs. It also has a dispenser for powdered milk so in each container I place the necessary amount that I will use for each bottle, especially when I leave my baby in the care of someone else and I want to make sure that the measurements are exact.Perfect for traveling! We recently traveled to an all-inclusive hotel, with buffets, and it was very easy to always have food on hand for my baby (fruits, proteins, cereals), because I organized his meals in these containers.It doesn't take up much space in the fridge.FR: J'organise facilement la nourriture de mon b\u00e9b\u00e9 dans ces contenants lorsque nous devons sortir et que son repas sera loin de la maison. Je peux s\u00e9parer chaque repas et le proposer facilement selon les besoins de mon b\u00e9b\u00e9. Il dispose \u00e9galement d'un distributeur de lait en poudre, donc dans chaque r\u00e9cipient je place la quantit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire que j'utiliserai pour chaque biberon, surtout lorsque je laisse mon b\u00e9b\u00e9 sous la garde de quelqu'un d'autre et que je veux m'assurer que les mesures sont exactes.Parfait pour voyager!
