                "reviewText": "We started using the RTF version of this in the hospital with my baby. She\u2019s done awesome on it and we\u2019ve just continued using it because of this. Mixes really well using a formula mixing pitcher. I\u2019ve made bottles by shaking as well and it mixes up pretty well with minimal clumping after it sits. Foams a bit but goes down quickly. No issues with constipation and stools actually look similar to a breastfed baby because of the prebiotics. We have to fortify to 24 cal for my cleftie and a can usually lasts us about a week at 3 months old (I make ~33 oz/day).",
