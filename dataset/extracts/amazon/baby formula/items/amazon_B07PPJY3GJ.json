We have had problems getting this formula from our DME so I ordered this in case we ran out and couldn\u2019t get our supply order. I received it on 1/25/23 and the case expires on 2/20/23. This works out ok for us because one case is a week of food for him and we can use it up before then. However, what I received is not the current packaging or what\u2019s shown in the photo on their seller page (The container on the left in the photo is current). It\u2019s the old packaging that was changed maybe a year ago. I checked it upon arrival and there\u2019s no foul smell or lumps indicating any spoilage (this stuff doesn\u2019t smell great anyway). I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s ok and use it. However, the Seller should understand that children with complex medical conditions are receiving this and be more forthcoming with what they are actually shipping and the expiration dates. Hopefully it was stored properly while in their hands.",
