That was a little disappointing because I like everything else about it. It lathers up nice and rinses easy. It doesn\u2019t leave your skin feeling like there\u2019s something on it like moisturizing soaps can. You don\u2019t have to use a lot of it to get enough lather. It\u2019s a really nice soap. If you prefer your soap to not leave any scent you\u2019re going to love it.My skin feels nice and soft too. Smooth. It\u2019s gentle and hydrating.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this body wash to try because of it having minimal ingredients. Unlike store bought body washes, this product is made with mostly natural ingredients and a small ingredients list. I\u2019ve been trying to make a change to more eco friendly and natural products. The rose scent smells amazing, and it lasts for a good bit too and doesn\u2019t disappear immediately. It\u2019s a natural rose scent and very light- not too overpowering. The wash lathers well and I feel like I get a good clean after using it. With natural oils in the ingredients, I do not feel like it dries out my skin after use. (like how a bar of soap would) the body wash comes in a pump bottle, it\u2019s a very good size and the pump works very well. Overall: I\u2019m very pleased with this product and will be buying more scents. It gets me just as clean as any other body wash but with an ingredients list that I can easily read and know what is going onto my skin.",

Plus it doesn\u2019t say anything rose, that\u2019s weird. I love the smell but it smells like artificial fragrance. The seller should be clear about the ingredients. I will see after I use it for 1 week so i can see if I get allergic reactions.",
