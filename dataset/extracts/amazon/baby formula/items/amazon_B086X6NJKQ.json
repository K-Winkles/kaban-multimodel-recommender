Like my Toddler review for this brand, I like this series better for the taste, values, and quality. Toddler series like a wash down version of this. Couple buck more I get this instead and stock up way in advance.Toddler series is ok and great bargain when 6 of these can is sell for 80$ or so when it is close to expiration. I have also notices but not recommended this milk still fresh and good even after date on can is expired as long as one properly stored. Bc i pick up these infant and toddler pure bliss clearance at walmart for 7$ a can and couldn\u2019t consume by expirations, and i opened after couple years after expired, it is still fresh and good to use. I wouldn\u2019t recommended those, but this is to said the milk quality. Other US made baby milk on the market can\u2019t even stand close to this standard even way far before expiration date and they mostly taste chemicals like raw crush vitamin milk mixed in dilute milk.",

                "reviewText": "I started with breastmilk, then I gave him Gerber good start soothe pro. I thought the soothe pro was easier on his tummy than my milk, but then I tried this and this is the winner of all 3 options. Obviously everyone\u2019s different but this seems to be very gentle.",

                "reviewText": "We've tried 5-6 formulas with our last baby and this is the one that was magic. She immediately stopped spitting up. I've referred this to so many friends because it is not one of the \"mainstream\" ones you see front and center and so helpful when you find the right formula for your little one. I had another baby and 4 years later I am so thankful this is still being sold with the same formula.Another difference is this doesn't stink like other formulas do. The others seem to have such a distance and artificial smell. This hardy has a smell at all. It doesn't clump and is super easy to mix. Not sure why this is not the most popular formula on the market. It seems to be the best kept secret!",
