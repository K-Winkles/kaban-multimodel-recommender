So that's very misleading and disappointing, but not a deal breaker. I haven't actually fed these ready to eat bottles yet, but I have fed this formula to my first son and thats why i bought these, to bring to the hospital with me when my second baby boy is born. I'm rating these because the box came in pristine shape and there are no broken, missing, or damaged bottles whatsoever and they are all within the expiration date. Satisfied with the contents other than the missing nipples.",
