Ripple Kids has a smooth, creamy texture, and contains 50% more calcium than cow\u2019s milk, as well as prebiotics to support happy tummies and easy digestion.",
            "DELICIOUS & NUTRITIOUS: Developed with pediatricians, this product delivers key nutrients including iron, protein, DHA, vitamin D & other essential vitamins to support brain development and healthy, growing bodies.",
            "ONLY THE GOOD STUFF: 100% dairy-free, nut-free, soy-free, gluten-free, lactose-free & non-GMO, so you can enjoy with your kids worry-free.",

        "description": "Can smart choices really be delicious? We say \u2018YES\u2019! When you choose dairy free, you shouldn\u2019t have to compromise on nutrition or taste. Now we\u2019ve made something especially for your little ones. Ripple Kids was developed with Pediatricians1 to deliver key nutrients specific for growing kids. In addition to the 8g of plant-based protein from peas, Ripple Kids has 50mg DHA, choline, and prebiotic fiber for growing bodies, along with many of the essential nutrients found in dairy milk - calcium, magnesium, riboflavin, and vitamins A, D, and B12. And most important, it delivers the same creamy and delicious taste kids love! Dairy Free. As it Should Be. We are Ripple. We make plant-based foods that are high in protein, low in sugar, and most importantly, loaded with nutrition and deliciousness. Why Peas? Simply put, pea protein is the best plant-based solution there is. Peas require less water, are more sustainable and have a smaller environmental footprint than dairy or other milk alternatives, reducing impact on the earth and soil. It\u2019s better for the world. Ripple has 8X the protein of almonds and 50% more calcium than dairy. Ripple is low calorie, high in potassium and omega-3s, meaning it\u2019s better for you. Lastly, our proprietary pea protein is patented and designed by scientists to be as delicious as scientifically possible. Say goodbye to the thin, chalky texture of soy, almond, oat, and cashew milk. It tastes better!",

                "reviewText": "I have been giving my kids this milk for a few months now and have noticed a significant improvement in their energy levels and overall health. The milk is easy for them to drink and they love the taste. It is also a convenient way to ensure that they are getting enough protein in their diet, as they can be picky eaters at times. I feel good knowing that I am giving them a nourishing and delicious drink that is helping them grow and stay healthy. I will definitely continue to purchase this product.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great substitution for whole milk in babies 12 months to 2 years. It has the most similar profile to whole milk and offers all the benefits necessary in that age range. It is costly, but it\u2019s really the only non-dairy substitute that offers the amount of vitamin D and calcium necessary for development. Our little one loves it!",
