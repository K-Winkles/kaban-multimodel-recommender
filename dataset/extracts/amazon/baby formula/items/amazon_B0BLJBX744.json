                "reviewText": "I ordered the EleCare Jr Nutrition Powder Amino Acid-Based Nutrition Powder Vanilla. Obviously, if you are ordering something like this, you are dealing with some severe concerns with foods where you need a certain diet. My son needed this type as a baby as everything else made him sick. I actually ordered it to supplement for an animal with a severe protein issue including hydrolyzed. It didn't work out, but it was a long shot. I personally have some major issues with food allergies and sensitivities, so I knew when I ordered it. If it didn't work for the animal since we're in the trial and error stage I would just be supplementing my diet. It's actually quite tasty but incredibly sugary. There are two fake sugars in here, and that is something I am not a fan of, especially if this is for babies or toddlers. I'm actually surprised they are in baby foods, but it looks like it's a regular practice. For those that can't nurse, that can be a problem. I couldn't produce enough and had to supplement with my son, but he reacted to everything. Now, I haven't looked at ratios in a long time, and this was incredibly confusing about how much you're supposed to give. It actually completely stressed me out as It's not clear at all. And when I finally did figure it out after over 10 minutes of reading, this does not last a long time because you need so many scoops. But if your child is thriving and this is just a little bit of a supplement, it can last you a little bit longer, especially because it's so sweet. For me, I will just use a scoop. I react to most vitamins and minerals, so I need to only take small amounts anyway. Anyway, as a parent to a very sick baby I'm sure I would get over the fake sugar thing because when things are that serious you just want your baby to thrive and you just give them anything that will not make them sick. I understand this is the junior version for older ones. Insurance didn't cover our speciality formula in the state I live in, but looks like many do with things like this so make sure you look into it.",

                "reviewText": "This amino acid based nutrition powder in vanilla is pretty tasty but I didn't realize it's sweetened with sucralose which I try to avoid. It's really easy on the stomach and didn't cause any digestive problems. It mixes very well and the powder must be used within 1 month after opening. You can make some ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Great nutrition powder for sensitive stomachs.",

                "reviewText": "I have a child with a rare genetic condition and he has not yet mastered the art of eating solid foods. I'm supplementing his diet with powdered toddler formulas and oatmeal in order to maintain his calorie intake. But for quite some time now I've had a difficult time finding the powdered formula we're used to using. I came across this alternative and was able to see pretty quickly that it was a comparable item, probably even better than what I'd been using actually. The cost is not small, but for as much as you get it's worth the price and actually pretty reasonably priced. I can't speak to the flavor myself but my son sure seems to enjoy it! Would recommend to others and buy again.",

                "reviewText": "So it's very tasty. Quite like any vanilla meal replacement shake. I got these for my toddler who is entering his picky stage and wanted to be sure he is getting as much nutrition as possible.With that said I have a few complaints about this product.I do find it frustrating when a product does not outright tell you how many scoops or prepared fl oz their product should yield. I handed it to my husband to ask if he could find the information that perhaps I was overlooking it for the 3 minutes I spent reading it over and over.He finally had an answer but it took a calculator and some powers of deduction to figure how many scoops one should expect from a can. The way the directions are phrased isn't helpful unless you're familiar with this brand already.But upon second inspection, there is a note that shows \"when mixed as directed, makes approximately 62fl oz.\"I mixed as directed for the 5 fl oz water and 4 scoops. Waaay too sweet. I wound up adding more water and it produced 9oz instead of the projected 6oz. But that means there's approximately 10 - 6oz (prepared) servings if following directions.So idk... still not pleased with how this method of information about product yield is given. So 4 stars because of that.If you have the time to figure it all out, that's great. But parenting is harder some days and I would personally appreciate knowing this information in a straightforward manner. Because at the cost per can and only getting approximately 10 servings....isn't a value to me.Is it tasty? Yes, it is.Do I feel good about the ingredients? Some.Was it packaged well? Yes, it was.Would I buy this again? No. To be honest, this is too expensive for my budget considering how often I would need to buy.",
