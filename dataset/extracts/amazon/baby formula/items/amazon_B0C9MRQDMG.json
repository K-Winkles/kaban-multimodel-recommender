It\u2019s helped so much and I can actually stand to wear a bra again!!! Also the oil for my belly is helping my stretch marks as my baby grows! The lavender is so relaxing and refreshing. I suggest putting it about an hour before bed. It\u2019s helped me sleep some too because of the lavender extract. Will definitely be getting more!!",

                "reviewText": "I have a baby who is almost three months old and I am breastfeeding. I got this lotion before the baby was born in case my nipples crack, but I haven't needed it yet because my nipples haven't had much for problems. Instead, I have used it for my hands that are extremely cracked from dryness to the point of bleeding from countless cuts. This lotion has not cured me 100%, but it has certainly helped me heal. It is a very good moisturizer. I really like the natural ingredients, the mild smell, and the slightly chunky texture that fades when rubbed. Although I can't say whether it works for my nipples, from my experience with my hands, I can imagine it would work for nipples as well.",

                "reviewText": "Felt so special receiving this. Had my third baby 4 months ago was nice to have something special for myself. Also mommas stay tuned for a very useful hack for your babies with the nipple butter! So oil is great smells wonderful feels good and I think it's helped with appearance of my stomach over course of a month. Relaxing and I also dabbed my under arms with it and it actually helps with smell! Now for the hack. Cradle cap an issue? Slather in this nipple butter and kiss it goodbye! My son had a random hidden patch of STUBBORN cradle cap I didnt even know it was cradle cap until further investigating it looked like his scalp was like heavily \"dented/textured\" I was concerned like what the heck but realized it was cradle cap I tried everything before to only get a couple flakes gone I tried the butter hey if it's for cracked sore nips why wouldn't it work and boy did it WORK. A LOT of it within 5 minutes started to lift 3 days of heavy application it's ALL gone and boy was it worse than I thought he had so many scales coming up I was consistently removing over the 3 days all through out and it helps heal cuts/scratches as well so thankful for this set was beautiful and helped me and my son thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

The smell is sweet and a bit strong but quite pleasant.It works nicely to soothe already irritated skin and keep it from getting worse.Even though the product's title informed me of the size of the container (2 oz), I'm still surprised by how small it is.The presentation of the product is lovely, and it would make an adorable gift, but it's a bit too much if you're getting it for personal use, so it would be nice if we could choose between a \"personal version\" and a \"giftable version\" of the item.Despite some criticism, the quality of the product is great and it works well.This is a review for [Lizush Organic Diaper Balm - 2 oz. Diaper Cream and Soothing Baby Lotion for Diaper Irritation - Baby Care Products to Moisturize and Relieve Dry, Itchy Skin] [Style: Diaper Balm].",
