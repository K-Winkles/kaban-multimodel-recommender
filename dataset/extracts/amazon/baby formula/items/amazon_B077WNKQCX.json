And its incredibly easy to mix.This is a 'European quality' formula available on amazon. its a no-brainer for us.I learned a lot about formula and we decided on Bub's in large part due to research on 'pickyeaterblog(.)com' which was extremely thorough and helpful.From what I understand goats milk proteins and fats are closer in structure to human milk than cows milk is, making it more bioavailable and gentler on baby's system. Bub's company farming practices and additives are all in line with the highest standards of European formula brands that are commonly imported.It has worked for us so far. Happy baby!",

We had cows milk based formula before and really this one made the difference.I'm not sure why there's some yellow droplets sometimes in the formula but it looks like crystallization or something like that. I've been getting it from target till they discontinued. Now Amazon is my only avenue.",

                "reviewText": "With my last baby we used the Holly goat milk formula and it is fantastic, however we have to order it from the Netherlands and have it delivered to the US. It takes a few days and it\u2019s expensive to buy single or in bulk. So we found this on Amazon, it\u2019s goat milk and supposed to be better than crappy American formula and it would be delivered the next day. When this baby was about 4 days old I had to switch to formula and had this delivered the next day. I\u2019ve been using it for 2 weeks and during that time my newborn has been extremely gassy, burping, vomiting, passing gas, hiccups. She\u2019s had a stuffy nose and a cough, even a little nosebleed. She screamed 24/7, always colicky and unhappy. I was thinking that maybe she\u2019s sick, I\u2019ve heard babies and colic are normal, though my other babies never had it. She drinks all the time but not gaining much. I was trying to think of everything, why my baby was so difficult. A tongue tie, something? I noticed her eyes looked red and puffy and her symptoms were only getting worse. My mom instinct finally told me to stop and switch formula. My friend had an extra can of crappy similac or something, so out of desperation I gave it a try. After finishing the bottle she wasn\u2019t screaming like before, she was actually calm and happy. The first time since my baby was born that she has sat calm and happy while awake and not screaming and fussing. When I burp her she simply burps, no more vomit. Her eyes look much better and it\u2019s like a whole new child. I cannot believe all these symptoms seems to have been from this formula, but they all disappeared once we stopped using this formula.",

After being discharged home, our first tin of baby formula was logically s26, and as baby grows, now we start to see problem at week 3. She is often unsettled a couple of hrs after the feed, and struggle to empty bowel. I researched a bit and found it seems to be a common complaint on s26. problem was solved after changing over to bubs. bubs is definitely more expensive and not regularly discounted (at coles and woolworths), but few extra coins save all of us trouble. life can be quite miserable when baby won't stop crying uncontrollably",
