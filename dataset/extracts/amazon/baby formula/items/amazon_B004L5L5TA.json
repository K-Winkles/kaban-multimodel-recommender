                "reviewText": "This is well received with no problems with digestion. My daughter has a milk protein intolerance so soy formula is a must. This formula can clump when shaking so water must be steaming hot to prevent or shaking vigorously is a necessity. Because I am combo feeding this can lasts me about 1.5-2 weeks. My daughter is 8m and also eating solids also.This price is slightly cheaper at 36 in comparison to 45 per NYC prices. The smaller cans retails at 22-25 dollars.Off brand is cheaper but so much harder to get.Overall this is a pretty good non cow milk based formula.Update 03/28/2023I noted that Prosobee doesn't include ingredient that increases iron absorption. Similac brand for sure includes that ingredient. Between the two brands, Prosobee don't cause stinky, hunter green colored bowel movements a hallmark of Soy Isomil. On Enfamil's product my daughter's bowels remain the coveted soft, mushy, mustard color. This is also in addition to my combo feeding with breast milk. Between the two brands, I will use Similac but only when Enfamil is out of stock everywhere. Overall, even with a slightly different mineral content between the major brands, Enfamil Prosobee is a lot better for parents choosing to use a soy based American formula.",
