                "reviewText": "Kate Farms is a trusted brand for me, and my family's needs. I have recommended it over and over. For tube feeding or for direct drinking, for sole nutrition or add on nutrition. There are formulas for a variety of needs. Taste is fairly neutral. Not a fun tasting drink, but not bad. There are so many good ingredients that I am surprised that they are able to make the flavor mild and kinda neutral. Again, not super tasty, not sweet. More like the taste that milk can take on at tail end of bowl of cereal. That level of neutral. Not great but not bad. But really it is all about the easy digestion, building tolerance, providing a nutrition packed drink. Science backed and thoughtfully formulated. Price tag to follow.I normally get vanilla, but the plain is surprisingly good. Kiddos that are drinking it directly may find it off putting, but who knows. Always a mystery what they will like or not, right? haha. Likely can be adjusted to their preference. I find they all taste best cold. Though tube feeding it is likely better at room temp.I dont know exactly what dictates price on these products. But it appears that some insurances can be applied, or something helpful. I wont rate on price, as we all have different needs, preferences, budgets etc. Can't compare this to Carnation, Ovaltine, or other low end options. If that is all you need then go for that. But if you need concentrated science backed full sole source nutrition, then this can/will accomplish that. Compare it to products of actual similar ilk. Nestle has a special option with similar vibe to this, and it is well over $200 for 24. This Kate Farms option is currently $99 for 12. There are also other Kate Farms Pediatric Standard options for half the price of this Peptide varoety. Just go with what you (and/or your kiddo) need.Go Kate Farms for trusted nutrition. Works in a pinch as a creamer too.",

                "reviewText": "Kate Farms came recommended to me from my oncology team, as a way to get much needed calories and nutrition on days when I have no appetite. I've tried a variety of Kate Farms products, and this is just as good as any other I've tried. Though the flavor is listed as plain, it's a mildly sweet, almost nutty flavor. Imagine soaking a few of honey nut cheerios in 8oz milk, then drinking the milk - that's the closest description I can think of.Like all Kate Farms drinks, when not using them with a feeding tube they're best served cold. As cold as you can get them without them forming ice crystals. It makes the flavor better. And with the plain, it's easy enough to add your own flavor shot to it, if you're not a fan.These are also excellent for picky eaters. My toddler refuses to eat anything except apples, crackers and carrots and will drink nothing but milk. This is milky enough that he doesn't shun it, and happily gets in much needed nutrition. It doesn't upset his stomach or cause any gastric distress.For USDA certified organic sole-source liquid nutrition, there is no other brand I'd turn to. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I have a kiddo who is growth hormone deficient and struggles with allergen free meal supplemental formulas but she really likes this one!She actually likes the unflavored plain flavor as it is but I\u2019ve also doctored it up with chocolate syrup and of course that is a huge hit as well lol. She can finish an entire bottle and is up double her normal net calories in the morning with this replacer! I feel confident and happy knowing she is getting everything she needs nutrition wise without any of her big food allergies at the same time. I love the ingredients included and love what is excluded!We really really like this drink for our needs. I will buy it again and will recommend it to others!",

                "reviewText": "After the pandemic, a few members of our family take these nutritional drinks. We usually get the pediatric peptide protein drink from our medical supply, and covered by Medicaid. However, recently there has been a shortage of everything at the medical supply. So, I'm glad to know that there is an alternative that I can order from Amazon.This KATE FARMS Organic Vegan Plant-Based Protein Drink, is of the best quality, and I like the ingredients with the exception of rosemary extract. It has so much of it that my daughter told me that it tasted bitter, and when I tried I had to agree. And knowing about herbs, I'm sure the issue is the only rosemary extract. Otherwise, this is a great choice for pediatric peptide protein drink.",

                "reviewText": "This nutrition formula can be used in a feeding tube as well as for someone who is on a liquid diet and needs proper amount of nutrition and vitamins. Definitely drink it cold the taste of it warm was not appealing. This is only a suggestion and not meant for a feeding tube but when I have my mother take it I add some pumpkin spice in it and it taste like a nice pumpkin shake. Once again do not add any pumpkin spice to this if you\u2019re using it in a feeding tube!!\u2026.. only if you\u2019re drinking it from the bottle.",
