                "reviewText": "My daughter had difficulty latching right away and ended up not gaining any weight the first month after she was born. I continued to breastfeed but had to supplement and found at 6 weeks that she had 4 ties in her mouth, which we got lasered with a pediatric dentist. I\u2019m continuing to triple feed (nurse, pump, bottle) in hopes of being able to breastfeed only but in the meantime I have a low supply and she needs more nutrition. Kendamil was recommended by my pediatrician, and I was really happy with it compared to any of the US formula options, because Europe has stricter regulations and therefore much better quality ingredients. My daughter did fine at first, for several weeks, and then she became noticeably fussy after every feeding and was inconsolable. I thought it was bad reflux. Then I started to wonder if she had an intolerance or allergy to the cow milk protein. Fortunately my diet is dairy free so the breastmilk I\u2019m able to feed her is pure. She had also begun to have way more stools that were oddly very bright green with lots of mucus, and she had a lot of gas. I tried Kendamil Goat and she had the same symptoms. My only option was hypoallergenic so of course I tried Nutramigen. (My pediatrician recommended and it seemed to be the most popular). To my disbelief and complete disgust, I noticed the main ingredient is corn syrup solids, and it makes up almost 50% of the formula; It also contains soy oil. Terrible ingredients. I needed something right away that I could grab off a shelf so my daughter was fed, and she absolutely refused to eat it. I read from other reviewers that it smells like animal food, and it really does smell awful. She had looks of disgust as I tried to feed it to her and wouldn\u2019t drink it. My husband ran to the store to find another option and bought Similac Allimentum. It also smelled nasty but it must have tasted slightly better. My daughter still made a face when I gave it to her but she drank it reluctantly. I did some research and found Pepticate. High quality ingredients compared to the rest, and the smell and taste is much better. With this one, my daughter didn\u2019t make a face whatsoever and drank it happily. ALL her symptoms that I listed above resolved upon starting this hypoallergenic formula and she\u2019s been a completely different baby- very happy and content & no crying after feeds anymore. Turns out she doesn\u2019t have the cow milk protein allergy but she is obviously intolerant to it for the time being as her digestive system is immature. The hydrolyzed option is much better tolerated by her gut. I don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t use this brand. It\u2019s by far superior to the other hypoallergenic options.",

                "reviewText": "Before even trying this on my 11 month old, I made sure to do a little research to be sure it would be ok to give him this and made sure I felt comfortable doing so and needless to say, I did.My son suffers from eczema which was originally thought to be due to CMA so I've had him on soy formula and while it helps, it doesn't completely alleviate it so I wanted to try a true hypoallergenic formula. I did slowly switch over and tried the whole can but decided to go back to his soy formula because it caused him severe diarrhea (which can be expected when switching formula) so I truly didn't give it to him long enough to see if it helped his eczema any further and since he's 11 months old and so close to being done with formula, I don't want him suffering with the diarrhea unnecessarily when we've already came this far with soy especially since his eczema is manageable with creams and prescription oil.The one thing I really liked about this formula is that you can make odd ounce sized bottles because it takes 1 scoop per ounce (the scoops are much smaller than what I'm used to with Enfamil). The soy formula I had/have him on gets clumpy and doesn't mix back in if you make a large batch and put it in the fridge, so I always eyed what I thought was closest to a half scoop to make him 9 oz bottles but this method of measurement does it 100% accurate to get the correct water to formula ratio (which is extremely important).The other thing I like is that you can go directly to the manufacturers' website and have a free sample shipped to you from right here in the US to try out before spending so much on a can to find out your baby doesn't tolerate it well (and the sample size can I got was the same size as this can).Overall my LO did tolerate this formula well (minus the diarrhea which again, can be completely normal). He didn't seem to have an upset stomach and his belly seemed as full as on his normal formula. It's definitely a good alternative if you're having a hard time finding your regular hypoallergenic formula. The price tag is a little steep however the scoops are probably 1/3 the size of the Nutramigen scoops so if you're comparing those 2, it might equal out. I attached photos for comparison between the Nutramigen and Pepticate scoops.",
