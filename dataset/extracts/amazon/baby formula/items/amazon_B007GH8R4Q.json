                "reviewText": "I\u2019m one of those moms who decided to go to formula after much effort of bf. My friend recommended this product and due to my guilt of not being able to bf, I purchased this formula without much thought. After I ran out of formula, I decided to try the free samples I received from Similac and Enfamil.With Similac, my son would show his distaste for this formula by making a sour face every time I tried to feed him. Also, his BM was very yellow and runny. Enfamil seemed to match him a little better but this formula made him very gassy throughout the day.I decided to switch back to Baby\u2019s Only and my son seemed to enjoy it immediately. My biggest concern, based on other\u2019s reviews as well as my own experience, is this formula can cause constipation. When my son was just a about a month old, he screamed in pain due to his BM. I was shocked to see how big it was compared to his size. After reading more reviews, I learned you shouldn\u2019t pack the formula when scooping. So instead, I loosely scooped it and made sure if I\u2019m making 4oz, I went a little above the 4oz line.I also like that this formula has non-GMO ingredients, no corn syrup and lipids naturally derived from egg yolk. Also, the milk is not derived from any dairy cows that are given artificial growth hormone, steroids or antibiotics. No fake stuff here!!! My son is currently 7 months old and he is still on Baby\u2019s Only. I\u2019m not sure if the formula contributed to the fact that he\u2019s currently in his 97th percentile for height and 70th percentile for weight. This formula is extremely expensive and will make a dent in your wallet but for the quality, it\u2019s well worth it.",

                "reviewText": "So I spent about 4 months researching formula so when the time came that we needed to supplement from formula in place of breast milk, our baby girl would have the best. I couldn't believe the amount of crap that was in similac and enfamil when I started reading the labels. I wanted organic, and the organic similac used cane sugar, which is just down right terrible for your baby's teeth. Also, the chemicals used to extract DHA in those brands disgust me. Baby's Only extracts DHA and ARA from egg protein, which is awesome. It also doesn't contain all the crap that is in the other brands. There are some chemicals that cannot be avoided when using formula, which there is nothing you can do about. However, you can avoid the other chemicals, and that is what Baby's Only does. We have been rotating breast milk and Baby's Only every other feeding, and our baby girl loves it. No problems with anything what so ever. The customer service is also great with the company. I'm so glad I found this product.So our baby transitioned from breast milk to formula only around month 4, and she is now almost 8 months old. This formula is still proving to be the best. Absolutely no issues with her feeding with this product. I cannot believe how fast she is growing. I swear, once she started using this formula, she started growing like a weed. The doctor says she is extremely healthy and is most certainly getting the best nutrition she can through this product. I am so extremely happy with this product it really is hard to put it into words. So many others have had so many issues with brands like similac and enfamil. I am really surprised this product isn't so much more expensive, since it is so much better.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I recieved this today and had to come and leave a review. I have the world's most stubborn baby. I have tried to wean her multiple times. My daughter wouldn't even take breastmilk from bottles or sippy cups for months. Finally, I got her to sort of drink from a straw sippy and a regular cup. She's 9 months. Well I desperately need to wean due to severe PPD, so I continue each day to coax her to drink from her cup. Well, she will not go near formula. I have tried similac and enfimil (the new brand closest to breastmilk) thinking they would be sweeter like breastmilk, but no. I've tried multiple organic brands, even adding less than an ounce to breastmilk but nope. She started refusing cups again. It's like she can smell it coming. I've even tried to see if she'd drink watered down whole milk, and she liked that over formula, but not enough to drink more than a few sips. Well, I stopped giving her formula completely to help her start accepting her sippy cup again. I bought this on a whim after reading reviews one evening and it was delivered in one day. I made a meager 2 oz. assuming she would push the cup away....BUT she sipped it, pulled away and then went BACK for another drink. She slowly drank the whole cup, but she drank it! This is a huge win for us. I did add more water like some suggested to try to avoid constipation. I hope this will be our new formula, and we can wean eventually for good. :)",
