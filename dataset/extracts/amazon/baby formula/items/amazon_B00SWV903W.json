                "reviewText": "This is great stuff. Even if the powder did not work for your child, the ready to feed could be the answer as the ingredients are different.This is the only product my infant is able to use. We spent hours researching after trying other hypoallergenic formulas after we were unable to breastfeed because of a severe allergic reaction even after I cut dairy out of my diet. We saw some improvement on neutramigen but only minor. We finally tried this stuff and within two days she was a happier baby. Within a few weeks her skin was cleared up and her tummy troubles were nonexistent. Her acid reflux improved because this formula is a little bit thicker/heavier than the powder. She still uses this at 6 months. We use about one 32 oz. container per 24-30 hours.Yes- it\u2019s expensive. Yes it\u2019s inconvenient to tote around a bottle in a cooler if we go anywhere, and to heat all her bottles as she refuses cold milk. But- it is absolutely worth every penny for our child to finally feel better and be comfortable and thriving. This certainly was not our ideal feeding plan, but we have had to adjust and to accept that in our case, breast milk definitely was not what was best for her, unfortunately. This was our last resort before trying prescription formula Elecare or something similar. I am definitely glad we gave this one a shot before going that route.Occasionally we get similac coupons in the mail. Otherwise I order 6 at a time from prime pantry and use my amazon rewards card for 5% cash back, making it cheaper than getting at a big box store when I don\u2019t have a coupon. So far everything I\u2019ve gotten from prime pantry has been recently manufactured, the expiration date has been 10-12 months from the date of purchase.",

It was a constant mess. Tried Enfamil simply plant soy formula and then it was the opposite after 5 days it made his poop like Playdo and he was in pain. So switched him to Similac Alimentum and all symptoms subsided. Price is cheaper than Nutramigen and more than Simply Plants. Only hassle is since it\u2019s ready to use it needs to be refrigerated after opening. And when traveling extra steps are needed to make sure it doesn\u2019t spoil.",

I thought being sensitive would give us less issues than the regular formula. Nope. Our daughter had projectile vomit, screaming poops (when she could go) and sleepless nights. I thought we were doomed until we discovered the alimentum formula. My daughter now poops regularly, sleeps normally and no longer has bouts of projectile vomit. This product is a life saver",

                "reviewText": "If you're a parent with a child that needs formula this product could be helpful to you *if* you've tried the more readily available and less expensive products like those labeled \"sensitive\" and those for gas but your son or daughter still is having problems. We went through all those options over a period of about a month (waiting a week or more to allow the child to adjust to the new formula), and none of them worked. Some, like the soy formula, actually made things worse for our daughter. So we decided to take out a second mortgage and try Alimentum.Thankfully, Alimentum works for her, and we are happy that we didn't have to try one of the other elemental formulas that is only available in powder form. Of course no one enjoys the price tag on these bottles, but the price is identical to the price of the local big box store in my area. The main reason we buy this through Amazaon and not a local retailer is convenience. Local retailers only stock 4-6 of these bottles on their shelves, and rather than hunt for an employee to search in back to bring up more every trip we just buy 19 of these from Amazon and pay the $5.99 shipping fee. It's also great that it comes to our door, so it's easier to unpack.",

                "reviewText": "After trying several formulas for my 4 month old twins, my pediatrician recommended similac alimentum. We initially started with the powder formula, but found it still made my little ones a little fussy. Although not as much, they\u2019re were still a bit fussy. After researching we decided to try the ready to feed, and the fussiness went away! From what I\u2019ve read the difference between the RTF and powder is corn. There is no Corn in the liquid and I think that\u2019s what attributed to my girls calming down. It is a bit pricey and with 2 to feed you wonder if there are alternatives ,but we only bave a few more months before we introduce solids so my husband and I will manage.",
