These are important indicators of baby\u2019s progress that you can see and measure. However, your preemie is catching up in ways you can\u2019t see and measure. Catching Up on the Inside, Too Even after your baby has caught up on the outside, Similac NeoSure continues to deliver beneficial nutrients that support growth and development you can\u2019t see\u2014such as for internal organs, muscles, bones, and the brain. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to continue to feed a nutrient-enriched formula like NeoSure until baby\u2019s first birthday. Enriched Nutrition for a Preemie\u2019s First Year Similac NeoSure supports better rates of growth during a premature baby\u2019s first year compared to term infant formula.1 It has increased protein, vitamins, and minerals compared to term infant formula, and nucleotides for the developing immune system.

We ordered four cases because of the shortage but one of the case so far the milk have gone bad in it I don\u2019t know if it is because of where you guys stored it. However I don\u2019t know what to do because the other three boxes I did not open yet and it looks like this is not eligible for a return so I guess I get to lose out on my money and I have to order another four cases but I don\u2019t know if that is going to have the same issue. I never had an issue with this brand before I went to the supermarket and just picked up six individual cases so now I\u2019m just losing money . How should I get my money back at this point because I like to order it again Plus I have no choice.",
