Sometimes he likes them plain and sometimes with a flavor mixed with them. These are great because they do not have harsh red sauce for babies bellies. And I tasted one they taste fine.",

I\u2019m a feeding therapist and this oatmeal is soft enough for a new eater to chew as they are still learning. The oatmeal I make for myself was still a little tough for them so this is a great starter food. The apple cinnamon is also dairy free which was great as my kids were all dairy intolerant for the first year of their life.",
