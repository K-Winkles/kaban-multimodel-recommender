This is a perfect formula for daily use from the day your baby arrives. This product is simple and baby-centered: fragrance-free, steroid-free, and only contains five simple ingredients! When your baby has a sore bum or really any part of their body, they aren\u2019t happy so neither are you! By wearing diapers 24/7, their little bottoms are constantly exposed to moisture and excrement. This means they need extra care, which we\u2019re ready to provide! Lanolin helps moisturize skin and can prevent dry skin from emerging. It helps keep skin irritations away White Petroleum Jelly USP moisturizes dry, rough skin which can often be found under your baby\u2019s diaper. We\u2019ve also included Vitamin E to provide extra moisture. You can see the irritation fade, while the little cries start to subside. How to Use: Apply the ointment on dry and clean skin at every change of diaper",
