I love that it PREPS the digestion system for dairy. This seemed to work well and the gassy and terrible poops balanced out. My infant was happier and definitely more comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not a first time Mom. I have several children. I thought all my experience meant something, I thought wrong. My newborn was born in January. Soon as he was delivered at 37 weeks, he seemed so uncomfortable. The nurses noticed too and suggested in the hospital to put him on Enfamil gentlelease. So we continued it at home till we seen the pediatrician a few days later for weight check. He was having over 15 poops a day. He was also not resting at all and all red face from gas and crying. We couldn\u2019t put him down. The pediatrician said it was a lactose allergy and to switch to Similac sensative as it had no lactose compared to the Enfamil gentlease. Well we did that for a month and my baby was still struggling.Would not sleep more then a half hour peacefully and it would be only in our arms. We were sleepless. I could not place him down at all in a swing or a bouncer before he wake up crying in pain. We were doing gas drops as well and he was still very unsettled. Waiting for his two month check up seemed so far away. So I went ahead and bought a case of this formula. Let me tell you that it was within 24 hours my baby complexion showed through. He wasn\u2019t a red pepper after all. Within 48 hours we got a huge smile and coos. That was amazing. Within 36 hours he slept in his bassinet for three hours stretches the first time since he was born and not in my arms. He woke up just for feeds and went back down with ease. His reflux improved. No more projectile vomiting through his nose and mouth. No more choking and coughing. No more congestion fromThe milk. I have a happy baby now. One that more comfortable. No more walking around like a zombie, sleepless and trying everything you can read and purchase to sooth a colic baby. This stuff is liquid gold. It was our saving grace. I get to enjoy him more at this tiny stage. I get to be full functional with more rest and less stress. Do not hesitate to get it. Does it have a weird smell? .Well, we joke the baby smells like a potato but I will take that over covered in vomit and changing outfits and more crying changing him. Does it taste bad. I tasted it, it sweet at first then leaves a bitter after taste. It\u2019s not that much different in taste then other Similacs.Does it work? It absolutely does! Is it worth the price? Yes it is compared to all the gas drops, gripe water, every bottle that swears to reduce gas and colic, bouncers, swings and carriers we purchased and who knows what else we would of gotten just to get some rest. It is so worth it. Happy baby makes for more bonding and more functional parents. A new baby will have you up at nights for feedings and changes but there a whole new ball game when it\u2019s just what you expect. Compared to crying, unsettled, screaming in pain red faced. You feel hopeless when you can\u2019t help your baby or take away their pain. Don\u2019t hesitate to try it. It\u2019s a saving grace.Update: I joined Similac rewards the coupons online have been pretty good and ordering as well directly from them you get 5 percent off when it\u2019s not available here on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "The first two weeks of my daughter\u2019s life, she was very colicky. We couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. She constantly wanted to eat, but would arch her back, squirm, and cry while nursing. Everyone said her constantly wanting to eat was normal, but I knew it wasn\u2019t. She was so gassy and would spit up so much. It seemed to me like she was in pain, and eating soothed her pain for a moment, but then it would get so much worse after a few sips. When she would finish a feed, she would cry and arch until the next time.She started having really strange looking poop - green or black in color and very wet. Our pediatrician said that she probably has a dairy allergy, which made so much sense. She gave us a sample of Alimentum, and that night she immediately became a different baby. She was full and content, no longer arching her back or constant gas. She ate her bottle and fell asleep immediately, like she was finally at peace enough to sleep well.At first, I was very against using formula during her first year. I desperately wanted to breastfeed, both for her nutrition and to bond with her. I had to let that go, which was very difficult for me. Giving her Alimentum was one of the best decisions we made in the beginning, and it didn\u2019t hinder my ability to bond with her whatsoever. If anything, it helped our bond because I wasn\u2019t as exhausted as the first few weeks. My partner is grateful as well, as she was able to give her a bottle and bond with her more than she was when I was breastfeeding. Not to mention that she was a happier baby as a result. We just want the best for her, and clearly the best was Alimentum.We have used this formula for the past twelve months, and she has been a happy, well-fed baby. She is in the 85 percentile for weight and height, when before she was losing weight. We were worried about the reviews saying that it tasted and smelled bad, which is true, but it didn't affect her at all. She loves her bottles and doesn't mind the taste whatsoever.We started with the powder version, but we found the liquid far more convenient. It is worth the extra cost, plus the powder version is harder to find. We use Subscribe and Save, and get 15% off. There is nowhere you can find it for a better price. Buying the formula on Amazon has saved us hundreds.I cannot say enough good things about this formula. It saved us in her colicky newborn stage, and it has helped her thrive into toddlerhood. Even though using formula wasn\u2019t what we had wanted, it wound up being far better than anything we could have imagined.",
