                "reviewText": "For babies with sensitive tummies, this is BETTER than Enfamil Gentlease. There are two things I love about it\u2014100% whey protein, and true lactose for the carb.Enfamil (and several other) formulas keep their proteins on the 60:40 ratio, and instead adjust the carb to make it \u201ceasier\u201d on baby tummies. For my LO, the corn syrup solids Enfamil swaps in did not do the trick. Similac\u2019s Total Comfort was better, but clumpy\u2014not to mention it uses straight table sugar for the carb. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable introducing sugar to my baby so young, and the clumps caused so much spitup.THIS however was the PERFECT formula. Smooth (even when shaken), easy on tummy, and more natural ingredients than manufactured sugars. Plus, as many doctors will tell you, unless baby has a cow milk allergy it\u2019s better to continue using a normal milk formula rather than soy/etc. So this ticks all the boxes, and I recommend it to ANYONE whose little is having tummy problems.",

Our boy liked Similac Advance the most out of what we tried, so we were repeat buyers of it.When Similac advance was sold out on Amazon, we found Gerber Goodstart GentlePro, and it was roughly the same price per oz, so we figured we\u2019d get it and then go back to similac when we were done.To our surprise, our son liked this formula more than the similac, and he would finish the bottle every time (he usually left a little in the bottle with similac). Not only does he like it more, but his BM\u2019s didn\u2019t smell as bad.We have now purchased this formula 3 times, and will continue sticking with this formul until our boy bo longer needs formula.Definitely recommend, especially for the price (which is expensive, because all formula is expensive now-a-days, but the price is competitive compared to similar brands). Definitely worth trying",

                "reviewText": "This formula is fantastic- We've tried many other formulas, but this one seems to be the best for our little one. It travels well- I had it in to-go containers and it didn't clump. When manually mixing it it does clump up a bit more, but if you use a formula mixing pitcher then it's fine. Be warned though- if you tap the little scoop on the side of the can to remove the air bubbles, that is considered \"packing\" the formula. When you do this you end up serving 20% more formula than is expected. I tested this by weighing average scoops to tapped scoops to remove the air bubbles. Weirdly enough, even with the large air bubbles at the bottom of the scoop, the amount tends to come out accurate-within a gram or two of the intended 8.7 grams per 2 ounces of water. When you tap the air bubbles out, it came out many grams more- amounting to about 20% more formula to water. This over amount isn't dangerous, but it did cause constipation in our little one and could contribute to dehydration over time. I switched to weighing the formula by a scale and her stools became more regular. You could also just use the scoop as intended and not tap the air bubbles out to get the same result. (Though its very tempting to tap the bubbles out!)",
