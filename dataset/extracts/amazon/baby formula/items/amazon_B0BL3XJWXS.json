Some friends recently had a baby girl who was having some digestive and poop issues with regular baby formula.This was the exact formulation that the pediatrician recommended to help the issue. After a couple weeks of using this formula instead of a more standard formula mix, the stomach and digestive issues went away and she could go back to using a more standard baby formula.I guess you never know in advance if your little one will need this formula and if they need it, how long they will need it. When they need it, they need it.It is quite expensive so unless you are sure this will be required for long term feeding you'll probably be better off to just buy a single can to start with and jump to this six pack if it seems like it will be a long term need.",

When we decided to supplement with formula we didn't want to risk messing up the good routine we had going so opted for a hypoallergenic formula just to be on the safe side. This was a great choice because it was a brand name we trusted and purchasing in bulk made it more cost efficient.",
