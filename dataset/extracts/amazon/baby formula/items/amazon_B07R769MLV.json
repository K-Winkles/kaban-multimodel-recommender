If you do not have any remaining of your usual formula and need to transition from another brand to Bellamy\u2019s Organic Infant Formula Step 1 and Bellamy\u2019s Organic Follow-on Formula Step 2 , you can commence straight away!

                "reviewText": "I have tried SO many formulas with my 4 month old son. I\u2019ve tried Enfamil, Similac, Gerbers, Baby\u2019s Only, Kendamil, everything under the sun. While he merely tolerated most of them, he actively -enjoys- Bellamy\u2019s. He polishes the bottle clean with no leftovers, but he doesn\u2019t get overly hungry like he does with some others.The formula itself smells fresh, which is almost unheard of for formula. It tastes much better than its competitors (including to moms if they feel like having a taste). Something notable about the powder is how fine grained it is, which makes it very easy to mix with very minimal effort, and makes a can last longer. It\u2019s not sticky, or smelly. I love that it\u2019s natural and doesn\u2019t include all those icky additives and oils that American brands stuff into their baby food.I have no complaints about this formula and I\u2019m so happy I found it after a long search. My baby reacts so well to it and loves it. Any parent is is on a quest to find the perfect formula, which takes forever and is so expensive and demoralizing, owes it to themselves to try Bellamy\u2019s",

                "reviewText": "After I got really sick and couldn't nurse anymore, I tried several store bought brands first organics, then non organics. My baby either didn't like it or got constipated after the first bottle. I found this one online hoping to reserve expensive brands for last, and it's great! She loves it and is not constipated. I just wish the Bellamy's organic 2nd would come back in stock, I've had to go back to the infant 1st because it's been out of stock. Although she likes it just fine, I suppose I can just use liquid multivitamin added in a long with her food.",
