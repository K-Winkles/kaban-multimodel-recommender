                "reviewText": "This is gonna be really long but hoping it'll help other parents.Our boy is 8 weeks today and it's been HELL to say the least. From day 1 he has been extremely colicky, uncomfortable, crying 24/7, not gaining appropriate weight, would be awake for 8 plus hours at a time. I knew something was wrong and had went to the doctors multiple times. I was told he had acid reflux and he was put on medication as well as told to change formulas. I switched his formula 6 times. The medicine seemed to help for about a week but even that wasn't doing much. 5 days ago I called the doctor and said I wanted a different doctor(I had already seen 2 at this point) and said something is wrong and I want to know what it is. This doctor immediately said he had a milk protein allergy. She said reflux was common in babies with this allergy, as well as his mucous like diarrhea 15x a day. She told us to try nutramigen. I was VERY hesitant to switch formulas again and also to spend the money.Well, after about 12 hours he was seeming to be less uncomfortable. After 24 hours he was sleeping way longer at night. After 48 hours we had a completely different baby. Finally at 8 weeks he is no longer in pain. He is smiling, happy, playing, NAPPING, sleeping 2-3 hours longer at night. Only cries now when he is hungry or needs to burp. I wish we would've been told this sooner and started this sooner that is my only regret.",

People who say \u201coh weird, our baby never cried and always went right to sleep after eating\u201d\u2026 I have one thing to say to you ma\u2019ams and sirs: YOU SIT ON A THRONE OF LIES. Just kiiiiddding! That sounds amazing, but wasn\u2019t the case for us. We tried about 7 different kinds of formula and she had the same reaction to all of them - obvious discomfort, gas, screaming, and vomiting after a meal. Although the ingredients in this one aren\u2019t the best (corn and soy products) we got to the point of just being grateful to find something she could keep down and happily handle.

                "reviewText": "My six week old had blood in his diaper and was grunting from discomfort all day and night. I was breastfeeding and subsequently cut out dairy and soy from my diet Ten days later, he was still grunting. The pediatrician recommended Alimentum, but it proved to be too thick for my baby who had a hard time swallowing it. The grunting and discomfort continued. We then tried Nutramigen (liquid), and within a few days, my baby stopped grunting altogether, started sleeping more and becoming happier. If your baby is experiencing grunting or digestive discomfort when they are trying to pass gas (or in our case, all the time), then this may be the formula for you. While many people said \u201che\u2019ll grow out of it,\u201d I knew that something was off and have seen a 180 degree difference. I\u2019m so grateful that he feels better!",
