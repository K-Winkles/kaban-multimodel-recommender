However, I tested it and it was still viable.My breastfed baby was having major blow outs, green acidic stool even after I cut out many known allergens. Within a week of using this, his stool had the right color, consistency and smell. Although it's pricey, it's worth every penny. My baby also has silent reflux. Since starting the probiotic, he doesn't cry as much during feeds and while sleeping.",

                "reviewText": "I swear by this product!!!!! My 5 week old was only pooping every 3-4 days and had extreme gas problems. Within 4 days, he was pooping every 2 days, and within 2 weeks, he started pooping every single day!! His gas problems have decreased by approximately 75%. I exclusively breastfeed and I don't keep a bland diet at all, so this is really phenomenal.I tried mixing 1/4 tsp with .5oz of breastmilk, but after a few days he wouldn't take it. So then I mixed 1/4 tsp with 1oz, but after a few days of that, he wouldn't swallow it either. Now, I express about 2.5ml of breastmilk into a tiny cup, mix 1/4 tsp into it, and give it to my baby with a syringe. Problem solved!At first I was sitting him upright to give it to him, but that gave him the ability to push it out with his tongue (which he definitely did because it tastes different than just my milk alone). So now I give it to him lying down, putting my hand under his neck to raise his chest slightly so that he can't push it out with his tongue as easily. I squirt tiny tiny bits from the syringe into the back of his mouth, wait for him to swallow, then do it again until it's gone. It's a small amount so it doesn't take long and is TOTALLY worth it! He's even turned it into a game where he sometimes opens up wide, sometimes narrow, and smiles and laughs because he knows I want him to take it!",

I don't know what I would've done with out it. A huge boost in their immune system and with digestion. When they get irregular in time, consistency, color, or just need extra support this has saved my and their lives. I've made keifer with it and its only amplified its use and did better for my kids than any formula I tried, homemade or not.",

                "reviewText": "Ok,My toddler came down with a case of thrush after being given anti-biotics by his pediatrician. He had a nasty ear infection, and this was required; no thought was given to ensuring there was no yeast over growth, which caused thrush and subsequently caused additional sinus issues.After an initial treatment for the thrush, again without any indication that a probiotic was a really good idea, another physician prescribed Ther-Biotic (over the counter) along with Nystatin (prescription only). [The Dr did order a stool sample and blood work to verify there was a residual issue, btw.] The Dr then indicated that he wanted the Ther-Biotic used for at least four months, and that the blend of bacteria in this specific probiotic formulation was better than most in his opinion.First, the stuff is not cheap. However, it does have a pretty high potency, and can be put in something like applesauce and given to your child on and empty stomach 30-45 minutes before a meal, or 3 hours after a meal, with an oral syringe or teaspoon. This is especially important if your child is going on anti-biotics, in which case its usually 3 hours after a meal at least two times daily and perhaps right before bed.Second, the stuff has to be keep in a stable temperature. Some of the vendors on Amazon do not ship this product with an ice pack during the warmer months of the year, and you KNOW that the shipper has plenty of places where it will be extremely hot, etc. It should be in a temperature that is above freezing, below 60 degrees, and consistent.Third, as gross as this may be, you know that this is working when your child has a RUNNY stool. At that point, you should back off the dose by about 25% and the stool should stop being extremely soft or runny.Lastly, the true advantage of this probiotic is it's potency, many stains, and fundamentally low dose compared to the many other options out there. (e.g. I found one in a local supermarket that had most of the same strains, but it turned out you needed almost a tablespoon of the stuff to equal one teaspoon of Ther-Biotic. Clearly can turn out not to be cost effective.)",
