I wish it was more calories cause it\u2019s pretty expensive and I get it allegedly healthier than the other stuff that over the counter but that would be nice to add at least another 150 calories. Keeping my fingers crossed that he can gain weigh while maintains his health cause breastfeeding has completely wore me out and my health is declining with all the dependency of nursing. Has anyone noticed their child gain weight with this product?",

                "reviewText": "Tropical Fruit was my absolute favorite but it hasn't been available for months (any info on this from the reseller would be appreciated). As for the others, Grape Raisin and Orange Pineapple are tied for second with Vanilla a distant 3rd. Anything but the unflavored will do the job. Using for EOE / food reintroduction so it has been a literal life saver.",
