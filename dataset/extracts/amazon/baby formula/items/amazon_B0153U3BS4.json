I prefer these disposable bags over the plastic multi compartment formula container we were using prior because it takes up less space, keeps servings separate (the plastic containers would always have formula spill from one compartment to another messing up the per-measured portions), keeps moisture out, and overall is much more easy and convenient to use. The design is fun to look at also.",

                "reviewText": "I love the convenience and ease of use with these bags. The bottom tears easily. I would note that you should leave a little air in the packet so you can shake the powder to the sealed end before you rip open the funnel side. That way you don't get powder all over the place. Once you have opened the funnel side, the powder pours out easily. I love how compact these are in comparison to the formula containers. I can easily carry 6 of these without taking up a lot of space in the diaper bag. Space is a commodity that I don't have a lot of with twins!",

                "reviewText": "Good design, high quality. The upper opening is of good size, so it's easy to pour in the formula powder from the spoons. The zipper is very strong and seals well. The bag can hold up to six spoons of formula powder (for 12 oz of milk), but I usually use three spoons, then the bags are nice and flat, easy to stack and space-saving in my diaper bag. I like the funnel-shaped, narrow outlet especially, because it reaches into the bottles, making it hard to spill. I like this feature especially because I use narrow necked bottles of Simba and Dr. Brown brands which are hard to fill with formula spoon and formula dispensers; also because I often make formula when the car is driving. The bags are made of safety certified material, solid, but easy to tear at the tear notches. I'm really satisfied with them. I recommend this product especially when you need formula bags during traveling.",

I prepared all the bags the day before and labeled them with their name, date, and ounces. It made it so easy to identified and carry even when I had twelve they barely took up any room. I will definitely buy more in the future.",

You can easily reuse them since the powder is dry if you just empty them into the bottle from the ziplock end instead of wrapping off the bottom, but the price is pretty great if you use them as disposable too. Not to mention they're dang cute!! I always get questions about them when we're out. Other mamas seem to love the idea and end up purchasing them after seeing us use them as well!",
