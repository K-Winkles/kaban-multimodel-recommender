She also could not tolerate the powder formula anymore and started to refuse it and had more frequent spitting up *probably from the reflux. We switched her to the pre made formula because we heard that sometimes it can make a difference. She tolerated it, and liked it, for quite some time before becoming intolerant of it and refusing it again. She is now on the similac sensitive pre made and has been doing well on that one so far. Nothing was wrong with this formula, it was just that our baby couldn't tolerate it after a while. I should also mention it is wildly expensive as most pre-made formulas are.",

My bottles arrived with 17 months of shelf life remaining which is great. The babies seem to like the premixed more than powdered so if they are feeling a bit under the weather this is a good boost of energy for them.",

                "reviewText": "We used the advanced pro version with my first daughter, and now for my second, we have tried the 360 total care. We supplement at times, and this has been so gentle for my daughter. No spit ups and her tummy is fine! I love the premixed bottles because they just make my life so much easier. Not that it's hard to mix formula but it's just one less step - here you just pour and warm up. My daughter only consumes about 24 oz a day so a bottle of these lasts us a day and a few feedings for the next day. Just be sure that you use this up within the required timeframe as listed on the container. If you are supplementing just a few bottles a week, then these may not work for you in this premade format. These specific containers are best for exclusive or maybe half formula fed, so that you don't waste it.",
