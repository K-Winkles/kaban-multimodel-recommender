        "description": "Enfagrow Premium toddler nutritional milk Drink is a nutritional toddler drink made with real milk and fortified with vitamins. Enfagrow is for growing children ages 1 year & up. The transition from baby formula or breast milk to cow's milk can lead to an 80% drop in brain nourishing Omega-3 DHA consumption. And 85% of brain growth happens in your baby's first three years. That's why it's important to provide brain support with Enfagrow Toddler nutritional milk Drink. It contains 26mg of Omega DHA per serving, 2x the amount in similar go & Grow milk flavor formula and with 16% less sugar Enfagrow has not been shown superior to Similac go & Grow in supporting brain development. Enfagrow Natural milk powder (26 mg DHA & 11 g sugar per serving) vs Similac go & Grow (12.7 mg DHA & 15 g sugar per serving). Enfamil is the #1 pediatrician recommended brand of infant Formula - QuintilesIMS, using the ProVoice Survey fielded from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. Not made with genetically modified ingredients, but trace amounts of genetically engineered materials may be present in the product from manufacturing environments and process sources.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I pick Enfagrow milk for toddlers over over milk brands because I think it is a great option for parents looking to provide important nutrients for their growing child. And It's great to see that my son loves it, as this can make meal times easier and more enjoyable. I like the size of the bottle. Saving a lot with these size.Overall, Enfagrow milk for toddlers is a nutritious and tasty option for parents looking to support their child's growth and development. It provides important nutrients that toddlers need, and it's great to see that it's working well for Jack. I highly recommended!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought enfagrow 2 times. I was so happy as it came with natural milk flavor instead of Vanilla. Therefore, if moms are looking for Vanilla flavor for your kids, I don't think the descriptions are correct. It would be great if they fix the descriptions and images. Anyway the flavor tastes good. My 20month old son is picky eater, so far Enfagrow is the best option.",
