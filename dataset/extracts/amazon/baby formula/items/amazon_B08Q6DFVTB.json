            "EASY TO DIGEST NUTRIENT RICH FORMULA: Our A2 Whole Milk Toddler Formula is crafted with ingredients we are proud of like organic whole milk, A2 protein, nutrient-rich fats, high-quality carbs, DHA, ARA, HMOs, nucleotides, and superior vitamin sources.",
            "FAMILY OWNED COMPANY: We're here for you and your little one! If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please reach out to us!",
            "GRASS FED ORGANIC A2 WHOLE MILK: We chose to include A2 beta-casein protein rather than A1 because many people find A2 easier to digest. One of the reasons may be because human milk is A2. In other words, A2 beta-casein protein is the most natural type of milk protein to the human body. A2 milk has the same taste as \u201ctraditional\u201d A1 cow\u2019s milk. This gives it an appeal over goat milk, sheep milk, and other alternative dairy products.",
            "NUTRIENT RICH FATS: Using human milk as a model, our formula contains eight different sources of healthy fats to create a well-rounded fatty-acid profile. We include organic whole milk, olive oil, coconut oil, sustainably sourced palm oil, cocoa butter, algal oil, sunflower lecithin, and egg lecithin. Other formulas use nonfat milk and add fat through cheaper, industrial seed oils like soy, canola, high-oleic sunflower, or palm olein.",
            "ORGANIC MILK LACTOSE: Nearly 40% of the calories from human milk are carbohydrates in the form of lactose and galactooligosaccharides. The carbs provide the energy a baby\u2019s body needs to grow super fast. Most other formulas get their carbs from highly refined, grain-based sugars like corn syrup, rice syrup, and/or maltodextrin. In our formula, we\u2019ve chosen lactose and galactooligosaccharides, which are both organic and derived from milk.",
            "KEY PREBIOTICS (HMO, GOS, FOS): HMOs are a group of unique prebiotics that are found in human milk. Our formula uses two specific kinds, 2\u2032-fucosyllactose (2\u2032-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) which encourage the growth of good bacteria in the digestive tract and plays a role in the development of the immune system. Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO), Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) & Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from inulin are essential nutrients found in human milk.",
            "BETTER VITAMIN SOURCES: Not all vitamins are created equal, and nowadays it\u2019s easy to create cheap, synthetic vitamin compounds in labs that look good on a nutrition label but aren\u2019t actually bioavailable to the body. We have gone to great lengths to carefully select our vitamin sources, using natural whole food sources wherever possible, such as the methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 and L-methylfolate rather than synthetic folic acid.",
            "DHA & ARA OMEGAS: DHA and ARA are omegas that are key for brain and eye development. We choose to use algal oil as the source of our DHA because studies show it may be more readily absorbed by the body, and our ARA comes from organic egg yolk, an ideal first food for children. Most other DHA is extracted with hexane (a neurotoxin), but ours is not! Our DHA is extracted through a process called heterotrophic fermentation with a single-cell marine microalgae.",
            "REGENERATIVE ECO DAIRY: We partner with Alexandre Family Farm to provide organic grass fed A2 whole milk for our formula. Alexandre Family Farm is a grass fed organic dairy farm in California that never uses added hormones or antibiotics, and they are the first American dairy farm to be certified regenerative by the Savory Institute. Being certified regenerative, they are improving soil microbial growth and sequestering carbon through their practice of strategic rotational grazing.",
            "CLEAN LABEL PROJECT PURITY AWARD WINNER: This certification verifies rigorous ingredient testing for over 200 contaminants, including chemicals of concern and industrial and environmental toxins and contaminants (like heavy metals, residues, and plasticizers)."

                "reviewText": "This formula smells like rotten fish and tastes terrible. I mixed up one bottle and started to give it to my baby. She did not drink very much. When I went to wash out the bottle and poured the formula in the sink it smelled really bad! I smelled the inside of the bottle and it was horrible. I\u2019ve washed the bottle multiple times and rinse it with vinegar and the smell is still there.I mixed up another 2 oz in a glass just to see if the problem was the bottle. The formula does not smell until you add it to water. Then it stinks like rotten fish. I tasted a little bit to see if it tasted bad too - and it tastes terrible!It is not a water problem. I use filtered water that I boil before making a bottle. No other formula I\u2019ve used smells like this.A waste of $47 dollars! Can\u2019t send the formula back through Amazon. Wish I wouldn\u2019t have tried this stuff.",

                "reviewText": "As a new mom, breastfeeding was really hard. My son went on a nursing strike around 4 months and I had to exclusively pump from there on out. Around 10 months, I was so exhausted from pumping and struggling with low supply. It took a long time for me to feel at easy with my decision to wean onto formula but choosing this formula made me feel much better knowing my son was going to have the highest quality formula out there. My son had zero issues with it and it was like he didn\u2019t even notice! It made me wish I had given myself a break sooner and switched earlier! 10/10 recommend. You can also find it in sprouts and Whole Foods which is helpful!",

                "reviewText": "I am generally very satisfied with this company and their products. Unfortunately, this particular one just wasn't a good fit for us. I purchased it for my 19 month old because it was the cleanest I could find on the market short of making it from scratch myself. Unfortunately, he absolutely refused to drink it every time I'd prepare it as directed. I attempted to use it in a kid friendly smoothie and even mixed it with the goat milk based \"formula\" that he is accustomed to. He drank it on 3 occasions but I noticed that afterwards, he would become constipated, bloated, gassy and cranky with a belly making all sorts of funky noises and causinghim pain and discomfort. I cut it out and he was back to normal. Reintroduced it, and the issues ensued again. While I would not discourage people from purchasing/trying this product, I would absolutely suggest you be careful as your child may begin to have digestive issues, especially if they are goat milk drinkers and only have cows milk in the form of cheese/yogurt/sour cream. Especially since, as I just discovered, I cannot even return it or get some form of credit. What a disappointing waste.I hope they consider producing a version of this product with goat milk.",
