Cans that are severely dented may be unsafe to use and yet this states the item can not be returned. The tops are still sealed, however it's hard to know if the inside has been compromised, especially on the can that is dented along the side seam.Giving 1 star for the packaging as this is a food product that may be unsafe and disappointing that it can't be returned. The product itself would get 5 stars as we are very happy with this formula and have had no previous issues",

                "reviewText": "Been looking for Holle on Amazon and so great to see this finally available. I always look for organic, non-GMO products when it comes to what I give my little ones so I was excited to try this. There are a lot of great things about Holle and how it\u2019s made:+It\u2019s Non-GMO and organic+Made from cow\u2019s milk+No corn syrup or corn syrup solids+Made in Austria (Holle is made in a few European countries)+Ingredients from sustainable agriculture so No chemicals used on the farms+The Holle Demeter farms follow strict EU rules and regulations+DHA and iron added+Expiration date is over a year out in 10/22 so stays fresh a long time+European baby products have more strict regulations than the US, so less fillers and questionable ingredientsMy little one really liked this formula and it sat well with their stomach. This formula is a little more than other brands, but it\u2019s worth it for the quality of product you get. I would recommend this product, especially if you are concerned about the quality of products used to make the formula.",
