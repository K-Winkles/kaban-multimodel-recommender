                "reviewText": "This really is a superb product. I chose the whey protein because it seems to closely match that of breastmilk. Of course, nothing truly compares to breastmilk but this is one of the best formulas. Prior to choosing Babys Only Whey Protein my 4 month old (he started at 3 months) son went through formula after formula. I'm struggling with a low supply so I have to supplement. He was having constipation, gassy, fussy and I felt bad for him. I went through everything...Similac, Gerber, Enfamil. Variations of different brands...gentle, organic, etc. Nothing helped. He's been on this about 3 weeks or so. No problems. His bowel movements are regular again, no more crying and it apparently tastes good because he doesn't push it out with his tongue like he did with some of the others. Also this doesn't have a smell...some of the others we tried did. The only issue is the price. You can find this on the Nature One website for $14.99 plus shipping which totals about $19 so I was comfortable purchasing it from Amazon since I have prime. The price was $19.08 with 2 day shipping so I was getting it faster. However, the price is raising...it's gone up to $21....no sir....no ma'am. I shall not pay inflation price. I was considering one of the other kinds of Babys Only like Dairy or the DHA since they are cheaper, although I really want to stick with Whey. That's when I discovered from one of the reviews that you can purchase at Whole Foods...I didn't know that. I called my local Whole Foods and sure enough they have it. Bonus: they have the Whey Protein and it's $12.99!!! I will no longer purchase from Amazon and their high price. If they dropped it to a reasonable price that's on point to how much the original manufacturer sells it for then I would buy from Amazon but until then...off to Whole Foods I go!!! So happy that the price is CHEAPER! This is a great product!",

I do everything I can to give my daughter all I have when it comes to breastfeeding. But because of a health condition, it breaks my heart to say I'm not able to exclusively bf. After hours and hours of research THIS is the BEST formula in USA to give your child. Less chemicals and unnecessary toxins compared to many other leading brands. Ill pay the extra penny to make sure my child gets the better option. The delivery came on time, the bag was a little tore, so I wish the padding was thicker, but can and everything came undented and I felt safe giving to her. THANK YOU BABYS ONLY FOR CREATING THIS FORMULA!!!",

In fact, some consider Baby's Only with whey protein the best available organic formula, even above the European formulas Holle and Hipp. HOWEVER, six different \"customer answers\" state that you get 6 cans for this price, which I must say seemed too good to be true. (I pay about $12 a can for another version of Baby's Only at Whole Foods.) But with 6 different customers saying that you get 6 cans for this price, I was led to believe I was getting a great deal. FALSE! YOU ONLY GET ONE CAN FOR $15!",

                "reviewText": "We switched to this formula with the whey protein when my daughter was having a difficult time digesting the Dairy with DHA & RHA formula. She was having terrible gas, hard stools and was rather cranky from the discomfort. Within 2 days of switching we noticed an immediate improvement; she was comfortable and her stools were soft and \"normal\" as they should look.We chose this brand when I was unable to breastfeed, and began giving it to our daughter early on. We tried other organic brands before trying this one as we thought it was only used for toddlers, but after further research found that nutritionally this was completely safe for our daughter. Unfortunately there are many brands of formulas out there that use questionable ingredients, but I take comfort in knowing we're doing what's best for our daughter by giving her the closest thing to breast milk that we can.",

                "reviewText": "We did so much research to find the right formula to supplement. It took us weeks to figure out that we wanted to go with Nature One and no one else. The whey protein has been AMAZING for our daughter. We started her on just the dairy version, but switched to this based off of other people's experiences and issues with constipation and gas. I will say that one poster broke it down for me in a review about how this formula needs to be measured out properly and that was a lifesaver. The amount in one scoop can vary depending on who serves it, and when the scoop is too full it can weigh out to be 10 grams and even 11. The serving amount should be 8.5 grams and that's it. If the ratio is off ... it'll most likely lead to constipation. We went and bought a kitchen scale to help with this. A lot more effort but the company is so worth it.",
