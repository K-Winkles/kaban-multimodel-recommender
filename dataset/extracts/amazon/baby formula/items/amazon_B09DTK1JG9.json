                "reviewText": "I've ordered a few cases of this since having a baby 2 months ago. I like the price and the size was convenient. However I recently opened a case only to find 1 of the bottles in a six pack completely sliced open at the neck of the bottle. The cardboard box showed no signs of a leak and the product seemed well packed. I actually cannot figure out how it shipped without leaking everywhere?? Almost as if the packaging held it together just tightly enough. Luckily it was only one bottle... only out about $3... Hopefully it doesn't keep happening.",

The only thing which I faced as a problem was that if you open a bottle you have to use it with in 1 hour . new born babies can't finish milk in one go and take time to finish .so you have to throw the milk left in a bottle but actually if you keep it in cooler .it stays good for an hour or two .so my 100% recommendation for this milk to all new moms .",
