                "reviewText": "I noticed water does not dispense the correct amount. I\u2019ll put 3 oz and it\u2019ll dispense 2 1/2. Ive tried turning it off and everytime I restart it it\u2019ll dispense something different, I\u2019ll put 3 oz again and it\u2019ll dispense 2. I\u2019ve put to dispense 9 oz and it will only dispense 8 or sometimes 71/2 or something 81/2 it\u2019s always something different. The only accurate oz that it will dispense is 4 oz which is weird. Also, I had to run about 3-4 full cycles of the water glass pitcher to get the smell out of plastic. I\u2019ll see if I can contact someone if there is something I can do to fix this.Update: it also doesn\u2019t always dispense the correct temperature. Everytime I make a bottle I have to make sure it\u2019s drinkable. I\u2019ll have it at 116 temp because higher than that it gets too hot and lower than that it\u2019s luke warm but then when I check water is at 118 or 120, not accurate. I will be returning it. Sucks because I love that it\u2019s so easy and fast to use. Really wish I didn\u2019t have to return.",

I don't like the idea of a plastic container keeping water warm all day- so I saw this and wanted to try. Its very well made and aesthetic",
