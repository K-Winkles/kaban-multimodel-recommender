However, sometimes it\u2019s tough to get kids to eat right, so ensuring they get the vitamins and minerals they need is a helpful reassurance. NIDO 1+ was developed to meet the needs of children 1 years of age and older, and as part of a mixed diet, it helps to provide the specific nutritional requirements that are important for toddlers as they transition from breast milk or infant formula to the family diet. Nestle NIDO Kinder 1+ is a powdered milk beverage with 13 vitamins and minerals to help support your child\u2019s healthy growth and development. NIDO 1+ also contains Prebio1, an exclusive blend of fiber. Fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system. Note: NIDO 1+ is not suitable for children under 1 year of age.",

All the brand name formulas produced horrible gas and she was miserable. Tried the most expensive one good for gas, it smelled so bad and she wouldn't drink much of it and made her skin even stink! Switched to the Aldi store grand and she was good as gold! Until they quit carrying formula. I decided American made formulas were just not good, sorry to say, so I bought this product and she was perfect on it and seemed to love it the most! Only issue now is it seems cheaper to buy it in the store now, but I highly recommended this product!",
