These have come close to their expiration date so I gave them to my daughter to use up. I recommended her using these when mixing with baby cereal in fear that the taste wouldn\u2019t be the same as the powder but my granddaughter didn\u2019t stick her nose up at it she couldn\u2019t tell the difference from the RTF or the powder. I will purchase another case of these to have for her bug out bag. Definitely recommend if you live in a hurricane zone, wildfires or tornados. And let\u2019s be honest we live in a day and age that it\u2019s not just natural disasters we should be preparing for!!! Man can be more destructive than nature!! Keeping a case of these on hand for emergencies is just being a smart move in my opinion!!",
