It clumps terribly, making it hard to pass through the bottle nipple, and it has an awful and unattractive yellow color to it. I tried to return or at least ask for a refund form Amazon (including an unopened canister) and was stonewalled by customer service. Also, the website they offer up for Mama Bear Amazon products is an Australian company that has nothing to do with Amazon's private label baby products. We will not be using any Mama Bear products from Amazon again. I would recommend another hypoallergenic formula if you're looking for a replacement for Nutramigen, like Similac Alimentum.",

The only difference I noted was Mam Bear needed a few additional shakes of the bottle to completely dissolve the formula. With the great difficulty in locating the Nutramigen , this Amazon product definitely provided much needed peace of mind.",

She\u2019s covered in eczema just as she was before we knew it was a milk allergy. Not sure what exactly is in this since it says it\u2019s for dairy allergies. Just a forewarning to other parents, this may cause a reaction.",
