Here are some of the key advantages of incorporating coconut milk into your diet: Rich in Medium-Chain Fatty Acids: Coconut milk is abundant in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), particularly lauric acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid. These MCTs are known for their ability to provide quick and sustained energy. Because of this rapid conversion and utilization, MCTs are often used by individuals following ketogenic diets.Supports Digestion: The healthy fats in coconut milk can aid in absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. Additionally, medium-chain fatty acids may have a positive impact on gut health by contributing to the balance of microbiome.Immune System Support: Lauric acid, a substantial component of coconut milk, contributes to the strengthening of the immune system by fortifying its defenses.",

                "reviewText": "Awesome product. Many people read the front label and mistakenly think there is only 65% coconut in this product. There is actually 99.5% coconut with 65% of that coming from virgin coconut oil. Only 0.5% is emulsifiers. This is absolutely the best percentages I've found in any powdered coconut milk - although there might be one I've missed. It has a rich, creamy taste - probably due to the high percentage of coconut oil. Because of the high oil content, I can get my daily coconut oil even if I'm not cooking anything requiring oil (or when traveling) just by adding this to other dishes or drinks. I even add it to the pot when cooking rice.As with all powdered coconut milk, it tends to lump when mixed in cold liquids (haven't tried hot). And this is unsweetened which some may dislike because they are used to other powdered coconut milk products which have a lot of added sweeteners and sugars.",

                "reviewText": "Normally I don't write a review unless I am rating an item at 5 stars, but in this case,I cannot give it 5 stars but will comment anyway.I was hoping this powder would mix with water to make a coconut milk similar to that which i get at the grocery store in a carton. Sadly no. It is just 65% coconut oil that has been somehow powderized. Using the recomended 2 heaping tablespoons in water gets nowhere even close to carton coconut milk in taste and texture.Also as others have noted here this product contains dairy derived contents; so if you are using it to avoid dairy this is not your best choice.One good thing about it is that it can be easily added to a protien powder to include some healthy lipid content.",
