Besides of that she was being sick very often specially with all the kids getting sick at school too. So, I decided to give it a try and noticed this supplement is amazing, it has a good flavor, and is not too sugary. She has been taking it for few weeks, I noticed her hair is more shiny and it isn't falling down too much when I'm combing it. I recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Customer reviewsThese are some wonderful gummy vitamins.First off...let's get one thing straight. When I see the word \"Gummy\" I usually assume a texture like a gummy bear. Gelatinous and very chewy. But these are not. This are more akin in texture to Sunkist fruit gem. It has a \"Jelly\" texture and not a \"Gummy\" texture. It is also coated with crunchy sugar...like a Sunkist fruit gem. I like this texture so much more. Not because I don't enjoy gummy bears. But because kids don't always take the time to carefully chew and I find the chewy gummy texture harder for them to break down. When the gummy vitamins sit on the shelf a while, they settle, stick together at the bottom of the bottle, and get really hard. I don't find the jelly texture to have any of these problems. It is also easier to split with a knife or chop into little pieces if you so wish.I can't verify all the claims like...awesome sustainable, non-GMO ingredients or anything. We will all have to take a leap of faith on that.I CAN testify that the flavor is pretty great. The fish oil (Omega-3) is almost completely masked. It hardly even registers. Most brands of kiddie or adult Omega-3 supplements I've tried tastes gross because the fish oil flavor is not sufficiently masked. This one is pretty darn good. I don't get much if any fish oil flavor coming through. The only better kiddie Omega-3 supplement I've tried is Nutrilite (Amway), which is hands-down the best but also hands-down the most expensive. Another factor that matters in getting children to eat their multies is covering up the \"multi-vitamin\" flavor. What's that? Take any adult multi-vitamin tablet and let it melt on your tongue. That unpleasant taste is multi-vitamin flavor. There is a slight hint of multi-vitamin flavor coming through the more you chew these jellies. But it is very very minimal and my kids will eat these happily. Not so much the other brands, which mommy has to eat herself unfortunately.Overall, I think these are great. And would recommend if you are looking for a well-rounded supplement for you child.Please Smarty Pants - Make a vitamin similar to the Sunkist Fruit Gem Grapefruit flavor (white). If kids don't like it, I know adults will!!!",
