We tried other plant based formulas but she either didn\u2019t take it likely, the main ingredient were corn or soy fillers (which we didn\u2019t like) we needed something that was pure, no added fillers, gluten free and dairy free. The only downside of this formula is that it is soo difficult to find in our area. No one carries the pea formula (target, Walmat, cvs, Walgreens, HEB, any other grocery store) has it. Besides wholefood, which has a limit to how much you can buy. The other option is ordering it online. Also that it dsnt come in any other sizes.",

My baby was unhappy until we went to see a gastroenterologist and he told us to try this formula and I can tell you from an unhappy 50-day-old baby, with a severe diaper rash to a 48-hour later a happy baby who even smiles because her stomach feels relief , I know it says toddler but investigate why (the company wants to promote breastfeeding as the main and most important thing for babies). It is difficult to dissolve in water but I prepare several shots in a nutribullet and make my life easier. I know that all babies are a world apart but I cannot thank this company more for creating this formula that brought happiness back to my baby and me.",

But all in all great substitute if ur dairy free or soy free..",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this for my baby that has a lactose issue we think.. but it didn't work for us. My baby was suffering with massive runny poops... so her provider recommended a dairy free formula and I didn't really want to go the soy route so I tried this first. It caused her to be super constipated even when we were mixing it in at 1/4 ratio (3/4 regular formula 1/4 this one). We tried this for about 2 weeks and that was enough for me. You do need to mix it in hot water for it to more easily mix in... if I did it with just warm water it took forever for the formula to actually dissolve.",
