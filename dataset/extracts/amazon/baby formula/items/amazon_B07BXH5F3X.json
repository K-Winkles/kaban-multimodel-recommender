Gentlease Neuropro was easy on the tummy and provided all the nutrients my baby needs with the neuropro to help with brain development. I could feel at ease myself that my baby was getting a good formula without being to harsh on her tummy- As all moms want the best for their baby, this formula is the best and is so convenient to order thru amazon when the stores are so unpredictable when it comes to what formulas are available (mostly out of stock when we needed)- Great formula delivered at my doorstep- Couldn't be happier!

Also I cannot seem to find this specific size for this formula anywhere else I live and I find it better to buy this bulk than to buy the jugs. My twins last at least 2 weeks with 4 of the 35 oz boxes, so this is definitely convenient for me.",
