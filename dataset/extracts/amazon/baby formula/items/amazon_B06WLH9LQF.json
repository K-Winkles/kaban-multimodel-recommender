Please refer to the Use By date on the bottom of each formula tub. Once the tub has been opened, formula can be used for one month. We do not recommend using the formula after 30 days of opening. Can I prepare a bottle and store in the refrigerator? Yes, you can prepare formula in advance. Make sure to store prepared formula in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours. Do not store any leftover formula that you have already fed to baby. What\u2019s the best water temperature for mixing? We suggest preparing our formula with warm water (approximately 100F, or 40C). This temperature, which is just above body temp, will help to dissolve the formula properly. If the water is too cool, it will not mix properly.",

My Son started buying it (Stage 1 & Stage 2) for My Grandson because it was a healthier, more nutritional formula with a lower sugar content than many other formulas. This formula is an Exceptional Quality formula, due to its More Natural Organic, Healthy Ingredients, which has My Grandson thriving! He is Very Healthy & growing at a steady pace, with his eyelashes & fingernails/toenails growing Very Fast....which is an indication that he is getting ALL the proper nutrients that he needs & requires for his body & mind to thrive on....and less of the sugars, which can be more unhealthy. Plus, My Grandson LOVES the taste of this formula (both warm & room temperature/cool) and drinks it down from his bottle Fast! I would HIGHLY Recommend this Formula for ALL babies! I would have to say that it is a VERY HIGH QUALITY & Nutritional Food that meets ALL the nutritional requirements for babies who are growing up So Fast! It is a bit pricey, but, worth the price when the health of your precious baby is involved!",

                "reviewText": "At first when I realized I was going to have problems breastfeeding for a second time, this time with a diagnosis of IGT, I started with HiPP formula. My son did great on it. It's a great product. But it's not legally sold in the US, so I had to go through 3rd party sites. That.... Made me feel a bit uneasy. But every time I tried something different for my son, he got wicked constipated. Every mommy hates, watching her tiny baby struggle to pass poops.Then I tried Pure Bliss by Similac. It's made with grass fed milk. That one he did well on as well. But it's $35 a can. About the same as HiPP.FINALLY, I tried this. More affordable and he took well to it, no digestive issues.This is the one we have stuck with for the last 5 months. I think this'll be our last order--we buy this 3 boxes at a time and it lasts about 6 weeks. By then he'll be very close to 1 years old and we can transition away from formula. Yay!!!",

                "reviewText": "My baby loves this formula. He has been exclusively breastfed but am starting to wean him a bit. I originally tried Enfamil but he absolutely hated it and refused to eat. I found this formula and really loved that it is non-GMO and organic. I especially loved that the first ingredient is lactose and not corn syrup solids like most formulas. My baby drinks with formula with no problem and it seems to be working well for him-no gas or fussiness. As far as the price I don't think it's that bad. Enfamil charges a few bucks more for 20 oz tub. Of course there are store brand formulas like Walmart for cheap but one would call into question the quality. For an organic and non-GMO formula the price is right.",

It does have bubbles like others say, but if you stir with a spoon, or swirl it fast in the bottle without shaking it, it only has a few bubbles.My son is 12 months old and has been breastfeeding since. We are using this to wean and he has had zero issues. We bought another brand prior to this and did not have this good of a result. I feel less guilty weaning when I have a good product to supplement.This is an honest review from an Amazon customer. Let me know if you found this helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Holle organic formula ever since having to supplement for my baby and the latest purchase i made was wholesale, from Germany, so it didn't get here before i almost ran out. That is how i ended up purchasing this formula and my baby loves it! It's so nice that American formulas are concentrated (1 scoop per 2oz) vs the bulky European ones (1 scoop per 1oz). Makes it a lot less measuring and counting when making a bottle. No problems with taste or her rejecting it or anything like that. No increase in gas or stomach issues or anything either. Overall, I'd use this again, and maybe from the getgo with next baby!",

                "reviewText": "I know what your thinking... this is a dairy formula and our baby has a dairy allergy so why would you give him this... I\u2019m not sure if the cows being grass fed has anything to do with it but this formula works for our baby without any discomfort, colic or constipation. It rivals Hipp Organic (which I am a big fan of) without the wait time for arrival and can be found locally without any problems. If your child has any allergies, please give the formula a try and see if it makes them better before using any of the toxic, foul smelling alimentum and other formulas doctors may recommend. I\u2019ll also add I love that it makes the baby poops yellow line breastmilk with no bad/foul smell \ud83d\ude0a",
