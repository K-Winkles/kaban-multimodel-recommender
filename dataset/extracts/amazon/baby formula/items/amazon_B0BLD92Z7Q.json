                "reviewText": "Should you find yourself needing to feed a wailing banshee at random hours of the night or day, this formula will be a life saver. When the kid rises from a brief period of \"sleeping like the dead\", this not only is a smooth way to placate them, but it greatly seemed to help relieve digestive issues and allow the rest of the household to gain hours of rest. Pre prepping bottles to keep in the fridge with this formula allowed us to retain some level of sanity.",
