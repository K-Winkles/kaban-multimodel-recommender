                "reviewText": "This formula is a life-saver! Our 2-month old had a little viral bug, which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy. With this formula, he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier!Ask your doctor for a sample! When we took our baby in for his tummy troubles, the doc gave us a full-sized can of this formula to take home and try! Considering it costs about $14 retail, this was great!Pros:Reduced spit-up and gasReduced fussinessEasy to mix upCons:Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digestYou can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website. Great product and great customer service!",
