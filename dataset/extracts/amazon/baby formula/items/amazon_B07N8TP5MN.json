We tried what felt like every formula for our daughter but had the same results- crying for what felt like hours and generally fussy. (I was only using the formula to supplement, so it was very evident that the formula was the issue when my daughter became fussy after a bottle.) This formula (formally Carnation) had been suggested to me by multiple people prior to giving birth who had colicky babies. We tried it and never looked back. With my second, I never even tried the other brands and just went directly to their Everyday Probiotic on the first shot- again only supplementing about a canister in one month.",

My pediatrician recommended this for as a substitute and I\u2019ll have to say I don\u2019t think we will be switching back. First for the same price you get twice the amount which I was not expecting. I like how it opens and seals shut. I find that this formula is not only gentle on my babies tummy but mixes really well! Hardly any bubbles when you mix and doesn\u2019t leave clumps (yes I add my water in first before I add the formula). With the Similac I had to wait a few minutes for all the bubbles to dissolve. So far my baby hasn\u2019t been upset by the transition which is good!",

Luckily i was refunded but still.... send the right size at least.",
