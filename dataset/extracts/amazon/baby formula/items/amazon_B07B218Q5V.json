I recently made the change and she luckily had no reaction and has slept through the night since we made the change. I just make sure she is throughly burped because I can feel and hear the gas build up from the bottle. So far I like it.",

                "reviewText": "In my new mom journey, one thing that gave me much stress was choosing a formula! For the first 6.5 months of my sons life, \u00ef breastfed\u2026but then \u00ef was noticing no matter what \u00ef did, \u00ef was no longer producing enough to satiate him\u2026and so \u00ef had to delve into the deeeeeppp research of formulas to supplement, and then eventually transition to\u2026In my research of the ingredients in literally ALL the brands and all the different products each brand produces\u2026I\u2019ve learned 1. The mainstream brands are pretty horrible (chemically speaking) and \u00cf truly cannot understand why people would choose them\u2026.sadly when I\u2019ve surveyed many moms who do..the sole answer was \u201cbecause it\u2019s what WIC will give for free.\u201d So to not have a brand like this under WIC as an option is pretty messed up.2. The ONLY other brands that can compare are Bobbie, and HIPP. Only reason \u00ef didn\u2019t put them as number one is because HIPP does use corn syrup and neither taste as good as this.Lastly: Not all Earth\u2019s Best products are created equal. I\u2019ve found the Gentle to be the all time winner. The original red can\u2019s formula compares to the mainstream brands for sure, just uses organic milk powder. The purple sensitive can is most likely going to cause constipation for babies due to the fats/oils it uses. (Especially for babies under 6 months)Again, HANDS DOWN, Earth\u2019s Best Gentle IS the #1 choice of all formulas. Don\u2019t believe me? Please, mom\u2019s and dad\u2019s, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!To: Earth\u2019s Best, \u00ef thank thee",

                "reviewText": "So initially we had a very rough start for our 3 month old, we started supplementing when we cam home from hospital with similac sensitive, it did not seem to agree with her at all and I am not a fan of generic run of the mill formulas sold on the market, I really wanted something organic but gentle...so we started giving her this. Now I'll be honest the transition was not great, she was still fussy and constipated...we even tried earths best sensitive and that was even worse! We came back to the gentle and we stuck with it, after 14 days her bowel movement became healthy again , and we saw less fussing and she became all around more comfortable. We also started giving her cultrelle probiotic drops, and it worked wonders! I'm so happy we gave this formula another chance cause it ended up really working well for our LO.",
