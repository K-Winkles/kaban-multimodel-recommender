                "reviewText": "I was researching formula and hated how all of the US based ones had palm oils and corn syrup solids. I ran across Aptamil and decided to keep it on hand as a back up feeding option. My baby is breastfed a majority of the time, but I wanted to keep a formula on hand in case there was a time I could breastfeed for whatever reason.Baby happily takes the bottle and keeps it down with no issues. We haven\u2019t had any problems with gas or bowel movements either. I will say it does smell a little bit, but most formulas do and it\u2019s not a deal breaker.I also love how the scoop snaps into the lid so I am not digging through the formula trying to find it. The built in leveler is nice too so you don\u2019t have a heaping scoop.",

More than once I have received the package and opened it to find an opened formula with the product spilled inside the box. Amazon is great every time and gives me a refund.",

Our baby suddenly didn\u2019t like it anymore while he used to like it when we were buying it from the pharmacy.I don\u2019t know what is wrong with this batch but it\u2019s clearly not the same quality.",
