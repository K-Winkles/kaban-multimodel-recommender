                "reviewText": "I\u2019m personally a big fan of this product, due to my daughter having sensitive skin. The scent is pleasant, her hair is super soft, and her skin feels clean. This is my first time ordering it from Amazon, however and I\u2019m incredibly disappointed. I\u2019m not upset with the product itself, but more so how it arrived and it appears I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had an issue. Despite there being a seal to prevent the product from leaking, it still leaked. There\u2019s clumps of dried soap around the pump (this was only ordered 2 days ago) and a significant amount is missing. When I washed the bottle off and push on the pump, soap was instantly coming out which gives me the impression that it has been used before. Usually when you purchase something new, you must push the pump a handful of times before product comes out. When you\u2019re paying almost $15 for a product, this is pretty disappointing and upsetting.",

My friend visited recently and their bottle did not have that pungent irritating scent. So with some trepidation I ordered this and was happy to find out they had returned to not being toxic to me, in fact this had less perfume than that my friend had. Now just need to remind everyone that saponification is a chemical reaction and that even an essential oil turns toxic under those conditions.",
