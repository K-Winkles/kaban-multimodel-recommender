There is no dropper included and it\u2019s incredibly difficult to even see any drops come out of the bottle and into her mouth. Would like to love this product, but just can\u2019t with the way the bottle and opening is designed.",

For the past two days of using this product I can definitely see a difference. He\u2019s way less fussy and has actually been able to pass gas without it causing him discomfort. Will be buying again.",
