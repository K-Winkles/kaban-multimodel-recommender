                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research before having my baby girl. She was being given a great formula from birth that was made in New Zealand. Everything was ok until a month in she developed a rash on her face and back. I thought it was a heat rash until the gas pains started. I started doing extensive research again and Earth's Best sensitive seemed like a great option. My baby has been using this formula now for a little over a month. Her rash is completely gone. She doesn't get gas as often if ever. She still has acid reflux which I forgot to mention, but I recently purchased some single grain organic cereal for her. I'm hoping that does the trick. Overall I am very pleased with this formula for my precious baby. I hope that I helped someone in their decision for choosing the right formula.",

                "reviewText": "When Similac had their ecoli breakout my baby consumed some of the cans. We were notified by Similac that they sent us the cans in the mail and we gave them to supplement nursing when I wasn't producing enough for him. We hadn't settled on a brand and I really wanted organic but Similac sent these cans and I didn't plan on doing formula so early. I didn't expect to have supply issues. But ultimately I was stressed and my body couldn't produce enough so I had to figure something out.One of my friends gave her son the original can but I was worried about my son's sensitivity because he was having many bowel issues after the Similac episode. His bowels still aren't normal. But this formula is so much better. He's growing great and he drinks this stuff down.I was looking into the German brands but was worried about supply issues with shipping from another country but I do think that's the best other than this stuff. This would be id guess the second best formula in the world. And that is good for me. I think we're all on the edge of our seats waiting to see if we can't get formula. But I noticed my stores have no formula. The only cans Ive seen in store is this brand in the red can and one other can of Similac nobody uses. But that worried me that all brands were gone except two and they were short on supply of those as well. The shelves have been bare for months. I've never seen anything like it. I'm an extreme couponer so I'm in store alot and Ive watched the supply issues with all products but formula shortage is scary because people will try to make their own formula and make their babies sick not meaning to. So please research what's best for your baby. This was our choice and I'm happy with my regular shipment every two weeks automatically two of these cans are at my doorstep. Love it! Thanks for a great product and reliability during crazy formula shortage. Since switching to Earth's best we haven't run out of formula at all. I feel confident that I will not get any notifications saying they are out of stock any time soon. Can't say that about the grocery store when the shelves of baby stuff is bare. I don't know if anyone else has this issue but we've been getting a lot of bad baby food from the grocery store and the shelves are empty days before but stocked up with bad product. This is ridiculous!",
