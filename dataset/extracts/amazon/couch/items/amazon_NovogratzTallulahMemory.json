I bought this particular sofa/futon partly due to the reviews the color (green) and it was also on sale. The box it arrived in threw me off because there was only one and it was big but not as big as I would have thought. The couch is hinged on the middle! Assembly was opening it, attaching the arm rests and legs. Super easy!The color was spot on with no surprises. The size was true. It looks great! The seat isn't deep but it's acceptable. The cushion is firm, but I find it comfortable. Putting the back down to make it into a bed is easy. I'm 5\"11 and can stretch out without worry. I have slept on it and I can't complain. Not perfect but more than I expected I have been using it for almost three months and it's holding up great. I recommend a lint rake/defuzzing tool to smooth the fabric and in my case to also remove cat hair. The dog drool cleans up easy with a damp cloth as well.I'm glad I chose it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this around 1 year back and I am very happy with my purchase. I have the mustard colour one and it looks very chic and modern. It looks better than the pictures for sure.Pros -1. Easy to assemble.2. Very. good looking. It honestly looks like a way more expensive couch.2. Fairly comfortable though on the firmer side. The memory foam does sink in a bit. I will say it is comfortable in the way it supports the body.3. Fairly deep seats making lounging comfortable. I am a 6' 2 guy and I find it great to lounge inCons -1. Its a 300 usd couch so its not the sink-in super comfortable type.2. In the sleeping position it is only usable on one side. Everyone who has slept on this couch did not bother opening it into the bed position. However even in the couch form it is great to sleep on.tldr; This is a great first couch and you will not regret it. Get a couple of pillows if you want to make it more comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I searched high and low for an affordable comfy futon and couldn\u2019t make a confident decision. Since we needed one, this one was highly rated and although not 100% sold that I was going to like it \u2014 we went for it \u2014 and glad we did! Although I believe I paid more for this than I should have, I\u2019m satisfied with it.It was pretty easy to put together. It comes in one large large large box, and removing it was pretty straightforward. Turning it over felt a bit uneasy but it was ok \u2014- just make sure at least 2 of you to put together! The velvet felt nice, first velvet furniture I\u2019ve had, and the light green color was a nice change for our small apartment. It is quite firm, but all of us have felt comfy takings a nap or a full night sleep in it so far. My son has even jumped up and down on it more than I would like, and it has held without sagging. So far so good. I give it 5 stars bc it met all my expectations. There are legs on the back of the seat when you lay the futon all the way back, and so far no tipping issues. Good luck if you decide to also get one!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this futon after researching most of the other options on amazon. The futon is great for the price. It definitely is not comfortable enough to sleep on without a mattress pad. The backrests that you lower to turn into a futon are at a lower level than the front cushions- so you would be sleeping at an angle.The futon is generally comfortable but very firm. The memory foam is not the squishy type that bends to your pressure like you would expect in a mattress.It was very easy to assemble. I assembled it in about 40ish minutes on my own (5'5\" female - not hard to flip around. Too heavy for me to carry the box it came in though).The color is true to the photos. The velvet has some damage that looks like someone scratched it too hard, but it is not super evident. There are many loose threads that I had to cut off.The delivery process for this item was the worst I have encountered on Amazon. They rescheduled my delivery 3 times, and I had to call Amazon four times to figure out when this package would arrive. They actively dodged my questions and did not supply me with any helpful or accurate information. When you select a delivery time you choose a 3-hour window, and when they rescheduled my delivery the window I chose was not respected. 2 of the times they rescheduled my delivery, the delivery window they chose was between 3 am and 6 am. My delivery finally arrived at 6:10 am. I paid the additional $20 to have it delivered up the 2 flights of stairs to my apartment, and the delivery driver \"rolled\" the box up the stairs- lifting it up and then dropping it onto the stairs. This was so loud (it's a ~150lb box) that I am sure it woke up all of my neighbors. Luckily it did not damage the futon. Terrible delivery experience, would not recommend it.",
