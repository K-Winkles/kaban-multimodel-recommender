                "reviewText": "Awesome little couch. It can fit one full size adult comfortably. I can sit on it together with my daughter too but the max weight limit is not too much so be careful. The size is much more like an oversized chair that is a bit low to the ground.The product comes exactly as shown with all the pieces needed to put it together. Very easy to put it together for the most part. It took about 15 minutes to attach the legs and one of the arm rests. Other armrest is already attached. Many people are saying the back is not sturdy and this is because of the way the pieces come to attach the back. You will need to do a lot of puzzle work to fit the back pieces together but once you do the back IS perfectly sturdy. Otherwise, if you don't want to spend time doing that it will sit comfortably against a wall as well.Couch is very well made and comfortable. Does not feel cheap at all. A little less cushion in the back rest than the seat but still comfortable. If you need a small seating in your house, this is a good choice!",

                "reviewText": "The couch is more like an oversized chair, it's quite firm and comfortable, it fits one adult nicely, however the putting the back of it together can be problematic, I just make sure the back is supported by my wall, to make it more stable, it is also surprisingly not that heavy, I was able to put it together by myself, overall it's a cheap, very small couch, but worth the buy",

The attachments appear odd and slide together easily, but leave some gaps. The couch itself is pretty small. We will see how it holds up to time.It's not the most comfortable couch, either. Good for watching a show, but not laying down or taking a nap.",

                "reviewText": "I just received my loveseat today. Putting it together was very simple and easy. I bought a cover the ZNSAYOTX Super Stretch Chair Slipcover Universal Sofa Chair Covers for Living Room Dogs Pet Furniture Protector Spandex Armchair Slipcovers with Anti Slip Foam Sticks (Coffee, Chair). The cover is not the color I was hoping for but will still works.After putting it together I sat for a few hours and watched TV. It's comfortable for the cost, ease, and size. I mainly bought this for my dogs, as the memory foam beds I bought they no longer enjoy as they sink and have a hard time getting out of them. There are getting elderly have a hard time getting around sometimes.The first 2 photos show the care of of the packaging, a strip of cardboard was added so if using a blade to open it wouldn't cut the material.The 3rd photo shows the size in our living room. The rest of the photos show it was approved by my babies Rave (pitty 57 pounds) and Tiny (beagle/cairn terrier mix 27 pounds). We'll see how it holds up.",

Cute for a toddlers play room or maybe child therapist waiting area.",
