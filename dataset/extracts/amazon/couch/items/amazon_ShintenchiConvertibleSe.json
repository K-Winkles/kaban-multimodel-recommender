                "reviewText": "Watched video provided on Amazon and read assembly instructions provided in box with sofa parts. Delivered cleverly all pieces packed in 2 boxes. Took pieces out of boxes to fit into my 4-door Nissan Altima trunk and back seat. Easy to carry piece-by-piece up stairs and easily fit through my apartment single-size door. Took 5 minutes (at most) to assemble, no tools needed except hex wrench that was provided for 2 screws, all other pieces fit into each other to connect. Left for 24 hours for cushions to fully \u201cinflate\u201d before sitting on it (suggested by a friend). Perfect for small 1-2 use and very firm but not hard seat cushions. Back cushions are thinner and softer and the backrest can be kinda felt, but for me it\u2019s not noticeable or unpleasant (as some reviews I read).Not a sofa for hard-use with children/pets. The cushion material cleans easily, but is not able to be removed for washing.For me it is wry comfortable and big enough (width and length) to lay down comfortably to watch tv or be a second bed for guests which is what I needed!!! The biggest plus for me was that I could get it up stairs piece-by-piece and through my door by myself without expensive $$$ movers. (I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and 58 years old.). Three months later and I couldn\u2019t be more happy with my purchase, the delivery and the product itself!",

                "reviewText": "If you just moved to a new place and have been sitting on the floor to watch tv because you can\u2019t afford a good couch, sure this is an option. Yeah it\u2019s one of the cheaper couches out there so I wasn\u2019t expecting much from the start, but for costing over $300 I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so uncomfortable and unpleasant. The armrests are hard and super uncomfortable. the pillows aren\u2019t very cushy so it\u2019s not nice for your back. The seats are small, you can sit, but forget trying to lay down unless you\u2019re the size of a kid. Overall very cheaply made just by looking at it, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if something breaks in the next few months. Assembly instructions were made by monkeys, no parts were labeled. You\u2019re supposed to just look at the pictures and try to figure out which piece is which. In my opinion, This couch should\u2019ve costed no more than $200. But they add a footstool to a very badly made couch and suddenly you\u2019re paying almost $400. Should\u2019ve saved a couple extra hundred $$ to get one that\u2019s worth the money, but for now it\u2019ll keep us from watching tv on the floor\u2026 2 stars because i\u2019m feeling nice todayUPDATE ONLY 2 MONTHS LATER:One of the armrests broke already after resting my elbow on it a little too hard I guess, couch is still very uncomfortable, the seat cushions don\u2019t fill the entire couch so there is a 2-3 inch gap in between the seat cushions and the edge of the couch which only allows everything to shift around even more. I keep getting scratched by the velcro due to the cushions not staying where they should. Velcro doesn\u2019t really do it\u2019s job of keeping cushions and pillows from moving around so I\u2019m constantly having to fix them. Extremely extremely unhappy with this purchase. I hate it more and more everyday",

                "reviewText": "This is our first couch. We have a small space, and it fits in there wonderfully. It was a decent price, but it is on the firm side, for sure. It has softened up a bit through using it, but it's really not great on the back. Unless you are sitting normally or with your legs out on the ottoman, there is really no comfortable way to sit or lie down without plenty of (added) pillow support. However, I still think it's a good starter couch. I put it together by myself in less than an hour and it's holding up well enough so far. Just make sure you have plenty of fun pillows for back support, and character, of course.",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019ve had the couch a few weeks and wanted to really give it time to see if it could be better. It\u2019s a really affordable couch, easy to install, the color is amazing and very accurate to the picture. It arrived in two boxes and the instructions were very clear to getting everything together. The sectional piece is a little shorter compared to others I viewed but not a deal breaker. However, the seat cushions are EXTREMELY firm ( if you like that great), not a comfortable seat at all really and not very inviting to guests, the back cushions are useless, they provide NO support whatsoever and you are sitting with your back against the edge of the back of the couch. Very uncomfortable all around. Great price, terrible quality. I\u2019m not sure if mine is a defect or something because many of the reviews said they loved the couch but I just can\u2019t see how this is okay. I tested a sectional at a furniture store that was about 3-400 more and that is honestly worth the price to get a comfortable and useable couch.",

Il est sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t ferme et les avants bras sont dur, on peut bien sentir le bois. L\u2019arri\u00e8re est laid mais cach\u00e9 contre un mur c\u2019est parfait. Les coussins sont emball\u00e9s sous vide. Ils sont donc tr\u00e8s froiss\u00e9 et prennent un moment \u00e0 reprendre leurs forme initiale. Je les ai repass\u00e9 au fers vapeur apr\u00e8s le 72h d\u2019attente recommand\u00e9 et ils sont devenus tr\u00e8s jolis. Le pouf par contre bouge beaucoup et ne tiens pas en place. J\u2019ai donc mis des autocollants en silicone sous les pattes pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019il se d\u00e9place. L\u00e0 couleur tire sur le gris bleut\u00e9 et le type de tissus amasse beaucoup de poils d\u2019animaux, heureusement c\u2019est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 enlever avec un rouleau collant. Il faut donc garder en perspective que ce divan n\u2019as pas cout\u00e9 tr\u00e8s cher et que pour le prix d\u00e9bours\u00e9, il ne faut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 un summum de qualit\u00e9. Mais je suis tr\u00e8s satisfaite il r\u00e9pond \u00e0 tout mes besoins et je le recommande chaudement \u00e0 tout ceux et celle qui cherchent un divan tout en ayant un budget restreint. Pour le prix les petits d\u00e9fauts qui y sont associ\u00e9s sont minimes. J\u2019aime beaucoup mon achat!",
