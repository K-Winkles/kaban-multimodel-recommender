                "reviewText": "I bought these slip covers for my sofa and loveseat. They look more like suede than leather but they are very nice. They have a great stretchy, super soft feel and stay smooth even after my grandsons sit on them. They're easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth. That's important to me because I have a cat that sheds and kids who like to snack while watching TV. They are made with VERY heavy material and came out of my washer and dryer as good as new. I washed them before putting them on my furniture. The cushion covers are so much better than you get with other slip covers because they encase the entire cushion and have a zipper on them. I would buy another set if they came in different colors. They are absolutely worth the money! If you're ok with the dark brown color you will love these slip covers!",

It fits nicely but I wish it was a tad tighter. The reason it has four stars is just because I feel the color is lighter than the picture and it\u2019s a very thin material. I believe the title says \u201cUltimate leather\u201d so I figured it would be a thicker material. So we shall see how it holds up. I just don\u2019t love the color and how it looks in our gym vs if it were a darker gray. I might return it. But I\u2019m still deciding if we like it. But it still gets 4 stars!",

                "reviewText": "Addressing those reviews who thought it looked either cheap or not like leather or similar critique...Have your expectations in line before you select this item. This is a STRETCH slipcover, which has its main advantage in that it fits the broadest variety of shapes and sizes and still keeps its clean lines. It is never going to look like real or bonded leather--it must be fabric to stretch! That said I really like he leather-look embossing to the fabric, and the texture is very smooth to the touch but has he variation of a leathery item. It's clearly fabric to the eye but looks differently textured enough to please the eye in contrast with other furniture. Just my personal opinion.Otherwise, this performs much the same as my other SureFit stretch covers. I would say it has a LITTLE less give than stretch velvet or others because it is that unique leathery fabric, but still had plenty of give to fit onto my oversized ottoman.",
