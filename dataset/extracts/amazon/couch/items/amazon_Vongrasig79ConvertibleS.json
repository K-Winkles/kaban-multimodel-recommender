                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Ingenious design",
                "reviewText": "It was time to replace my old sofa, and I wanted something neutral (the other one was red), not too expensive, and with an ottoman included. It also needed to have removable, washable seat cushions, as I have a tendency to drop things, which inevitably land on the sofa. And I have a dog; she's not permitted on the sofa, but when no one is looking . . .A friend was going to help me to assemble it, but I was impatient, and decided to see if I could get some of it done myself. Not the brightest idea I've ever had, but amazingly, I did it.The assembly design is brilliant, with one exception: Even though it looks like you can either put the smaller piece (e.g., the side section) into the two-seater section OR the two-seater section into the side, that's not the case, as an embarrassing number of tries proved. It makes no sense to put the larger, heavier part into the lighter, smaller one, but that's the only way it works. The same goes for the single seat.There's Velcro for the seat cushions (which are quite firm and comfy) as well as for the back cushions, which is a nice touch. And as weird as it sounds, using a zipper to attach the cushy armrests makes sense. (They have Velcro too, so they stay put under the seat cushions.)It's a full-size sofa, but with what I consider a small profile, so it's just right for smaller spaces. And the neutral color allows for all sorts of fun choices of throw pillows and other complementary decor.My one complaint is the shipping cost, which is considerable. But given the price of the sofa itself, it worked out to about the same amount as other sofas I looked at with free shipping.",

I also didn\u2019t like how you have to lift the armrest onto the supporting piece when putting it together. The left that out of the directions and I\u2019m not good at putting things together so I tried and did it. But overall I like the couch.",

                "reviewText": "I paid in full for shipping and handling, for the entire couch, but only ever received half of a couch. Very annoying.UPDATE: The second half of the couch did arrive, only a day later. The issue isn't with Viogarden, but with FedEx. Anyone who has dealt with FedEx in the past probably isn't surprised by that.The couch itself is very comfortable, albeit smaller than I had initially expected. It's certainly nowhere near the listed weight as well. The back is short, so you can't rest your head on the cushions without slouching significantly, but this isn't as bad as you would think. It's shockingly comfortable for what it is. However, I don't fully believe it is worth it's listed price point, and certainly not what it costs to ship it. It's listed currently as $289, but it cost me in total $407 to finally get it after shipping and handling. It may be better to shop locally, depending on your location.TL;DR: Good starter couch at a steep price. Only buy when on sale.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted so much to love this couch, but...I'm extremely disappointed in it. I wanted a small sectional, and it IS that. But it is VERY small. Too small, it looks like a piece of furniture for a child. I am 5'2, I have short legs, and the seat size feels very small to me. The back is very short, it hits about mid-ribs on me. I haven't even had it 24 hours yet, and it sounded like the back frame cracked when I leaned back. Couch is very flimsy feeling, does not feel sturdy at all. I don't think it's safe for more than one person to sit on (even before I heard the cracking sound), and when I go to sit down I feel like I need to do so very gently. This couch is not made to last, that's obvious. Also, the color is quite different from what I expected, and the legs are plastic.To be fair, it is comfortable to lie down on (but not so much to sit on). The cushions are firm and supportive but still soft, and the fabric is soft (but very thin). It was very easy to put together. It came in 2 boxes that I was able to manhandle down 1 flight of stairs by myself, and also put together myself.Also, the shipping cost added 25% to the price of the couch. All in all, after shipping and taxes this couch was about $435. Definitely NOT worth it! Save your money, go to a local furniture store (with free delivery!), and get yourself a decent couch. I will be returning....which I'm not sure how to do, since it will never go back in the boxes it came in. That's going to be a PITA to figure out, that alone would make me keep it, if I thought it was safe, and not a total piece of junk.I wouldn't recommend this couch to anyone, for any price. It's just junk.Edit to add- seller was extremely easy to work with, and refunded my money, including shipping. Also said I did no have to return the couch, since it would not go back in the original boxes and would be very difficult and expensive to ship. I appreciated that they were very easy to work with, no hassle.",
