                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Nice big couch, great bargain for the money. Seat cushions are comfortable, but the back cushions are a little flat. It does not come with an ottoman, but luckily we had one to fit perfectly within the middle cushions which makes the couch like a huge bed that a family of four could kick back and watch a movie in. It's very easy to assemble. Just screw in the legs on the three main sections. Then the section snap together. Then fasten the 3 backrests, one per section. You do have to take the the vacuum sealed cushions out of the box 48 to 72 hours before use. Cut the bag open and let them sit and absorb air for about 2 to 3 days, which is standard for any memory foam furniture. All In all, pretty comfortable and looks beautiful .",

This couch will be a Den couch when we move for the kids and I will eventually get one that I can stretch more out on.",

The upholstery is velvety soft, and the cushions are nicely padded. It appears to be easy to clean. It\u2019s a lot bigger than I was expecting, which makes laying horizontal a lot easier. The arm rests, aka \u201cside pillows\u201d, ARE removable. They are more pillow than anything. I was hoping so when purchasing, but couldn\u2019t really figure out beforehand from the pictures (maybe I should start reading item descriptions idk). Overall, great couch for the price.",

It took me about one hour and a half. This couch is far from comfortable, and is very very low to the ground. I am 5 foot 9 and my legs hang off quite a bit on the ends. The pillows do not stay attached to the back of the couch and the armrest has no structure so you\u2019re not able to really rest your arm. It is not something you would want in your main living room. I don\u2019t have the patience or a large enough car to box all of this up and lug it to a UPS store for a return\u2026 I can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019m getting ready to sell it.",

                "reviewText": "One of the 12 legs arrived broken inside of the box. The legs are made of plastic so don\u2019t expect them to hold up for very long. Reached out to CS and they won\u2019t send out a replacement part, and I was told by CS that my only option is to return the couch to Amazon in the three boxes it originally arrived in just to have another whole couch shipped out. Guess who won\u2019t be getting assistance on this matter since the couch is already assembled and in use?Don\u2019t let this be you. Think twice before you decide to go for this couch. The design is nice, the couch is spacious, all cushion covers are removable for washing, and the comfort level is medium firm. But the cons are that the back cushions constantly fall forward as they don\u2019t have anything to grip onto (an easy fix for this is adhesive Velcro straps but you\u2019ll have to make that additional, yet small investment), and you also run the risk of having some type of unseen damage to any part of the couch before unboxing. In this case, there were no punctures/holes/tears/damage to the boxes exterior. An additional investment will have to be made for a full new set of 12 legs as well, since I can\u2019t get an identical replacement for the original leg nor will anything that\u2019s available for purchase on Amazon be a match. And if you decide to go with the cream-colored couch and you have little ones running around or pets, definitely invest in a sofa cover. You won\u2019t find a cover set on Amazon that will match the exact shape of this couch (or anything even close to it), so you will have to order each individual cover part separately for this U shaped sectional. I ended up purchasing an XL chase cover for the base of the middle seating section (as it\u2019s the only cover that can accommodate its dimensions), 4 more XL chase covers for the two chaise bases and their respective seat cushions, 2 standard seat covers for the middle seats, and 4 back cushion covers. When you add up the total cost to each of these, it will cost more than double if not triple than most couch cover sets on Amazon! Unfortunately it\u2019s ANOTHER investment that needs to be made, but you won\u2019t have to constantly go back to spot treat the original fabric or washing the original cushion covers often, and with a couch cover you\u2019re protecting your overall investment.Your best bet is to either go with the gray color option (if it\u2019s in stock), or just throw in the additional $100-$300 and simply go with a pricier, but better off couch. With as much money as I\u2019ve ended up putting into this couch, I would\u2019ve been far better off going with a different sofa.Keep all of these factors in mind before you buy. I hope this helps someone that\u2019s considering purchasing this sectional. I hope you make the right investment for you, your needs, and your lifestyle.",

The other reviews are spot on about the back pillows. You'll want to at least get some velcro because they do allover all the time. I'm going to try like another reviewer mentioned and add more stuffing. BUT I still give it 5stars because it's great for the price! I do like it a lot and absolutely would buy it again.",
