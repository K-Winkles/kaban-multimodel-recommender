For this sofa that cost less than $200, I decided to give it a try. This is a great buy, I am happy I purchased it. It was easy to put together. I did it by myself,however,some parts would have been easier with help. It looks exactly as pictured and is super comfortable. It is very sturdy and won\u2019t shake after being put together. Even if three adults sit on it,there is enough space. Because the pillows are vacuum packed,it has a little bit wrinkled when you first open it. But when you leaning on it,it is extremely comfortable,so it doesn\u2019t bother me. The four corners of the sofa are a little bit higher than ordinary ones,which makes it easier for me to clean the dust under the sofa. And I like the color a lot,it\u2019s a bit like Nordic style. Love it.",

The material is extremely soft. The picture I took is fresh out the box so I expect the pillows to fluff a bit more and see some of the wrinkles to go away. It was as easy to put together as advertised with no tools. Took about 8 minutes including unboxing. It is comfy, not sink in comfy, but enough for me to read or watch a show comfortably. I could easily lay out on it although I\u2019m on the shorter side. It\u2019s beautiful though and feels sturdy. I recommend this for sure if you are on a budget!",

Once we rectified this error it took all of 5 minutes to fit it in. I held the handle straight from the ground up and husband lifted the seat and wedged it into the slots.The seating is comfortable, the look is plush and it definitely looks way more expensive than the actual cost of the product.Although I must add, that I have not bought it for heavy traffic area.

                "reviewText": "I ordered this couch thinking I would receive it in 2 days as advertised. Didn't receive it until a week later as FedEx doesn't follow delivery instructions. The second attempt of delivery was much better. If you live in an apartment building, beware of this possible issue. Outside of the delivery delays and frustration, it is a very beautiful couch and I was able to put it together by myself. I'm 5'4.5\", 125 lbs. I was not able to carry this package (it is 84 lbs) to my apartment and had to remove the base of the couch from the box to bring up first before returning for the other pieces using a cart. I didn't have a dolly. Again, just FYI.. The easiest way to put this couch together on your own, is to first put the legs into the arm pieces. Then place a left or right arm piece on the floor and slide the base downward into the slats. When you attach the second arm piece, you can push it into the base slats from the top. Once you flip it over and sit on it, the base will secure itself into the slats. Bouncing helps. The base should always go down, into the arm pieces. If you try to do it another way, the base WILL fall out of the slats. The back piece is slightly tricky; don't try to pick up the couch from the back piece. It will slide out. The cushions are fluffing out more each day and the material of the couch does not feel cheap. If you like a firm yet soft mattress, you will enjoy this couch. Very emerald/forest green. I love it.",
