The second shipment didn\u2019t notify that it was on its way but it delivered within the next 2 business days! They came in two big boxes through fedex.The couch itself is super easy to set up and instructions were clear. I personally think it\u2019s really comfy but I don\u2019t lay on the couch much so I can\u2019t speak for those that work from home or are on the couch a lot that would use it a lot. Its a little lower to the ground so keep that in mind! It\u2019s not a very tall couch. It\u2019s such a pretty white and looks so good in my apartment. The cushions have zippers so it can make cleaning easy! It is 100% worth the price in my opinion if you\u2019re wanting a more affordable option with an elevated look!",

                "reviewText": "This was my first big furniture purchase - I usually get second hand things. I am so so happy with my purchase.The delivery process was quick. It was shipped in 3 separate boxes - the first one through onTrac and the last two through Fedex, who required a signature for them. I got all of the boxes within 3 days of ordering. So quick and the two delivery men carried the last two 100lb boxes up to my second story apartment and into my apartment for me.As for the couch itself - unpacking and building it took me about two hours. I messed up a couple times and had to back track mostly just because I didn\u2019t look at the diagrams correctly, not really a fault of the instructions. The cushions puffed up very nicely pretty immediately. It is actually a very big couch too. Make sure you measure accurately before buying! The fabric is soft and the blue color is stunning.I am waiting on velcro to come per other reviewers suggestions so I can velcro the back cushions and the ottoman to the couch as they slip around a bit. I also wish you could order some of the pieces separately. I would love to order another ottoman for the other end. It is low to the ground as well like others have said but I really don\u2019t mind it much.I am overall so so happy with this couch. It feels lush without completely breaking the bank on one of those $3k cloud couches. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "So first off like most of the reviews say.. the sofa is incredibly low to the ground. I'm 5'2 and it feels like my knees are up to my chest. I plan on purchasing new legs for the sofa to remedy this. The back cushions are also very thin and do not stay in place. I bought extra strong white velcro to hold them in place and it works great.The sofa it's self is extremely roomy! This thing is absolutely massive! It's plenty of room for a family of 3 and a baby lol.Comfort- ok so it is soft like others have said but there is literally no support. It does bottom out a bit. We have left it to fluff for the recommended 3 days also. If you're prone to restless legs I would avoid it. My husband can not get comfortable on it unfortunately. Also note that once this thing is open it is not returnable. It says it on almost every air packed bag the cushions come it. So caution to that. To me it feels as if the cushions cave extremely low. It may look super fluffy in all these reviews including mine but once sat on the fluffy smashes down.The fabric is nice and soft. I got the teddy bear fleece. It is not scratchy so I like that. For the price this is a decent peice of furniture. You really can't get something this large and esthetically pleasing to the eyes for much less. I don't regret my purchase but I do wish it wasn't as saggy. This is our last \"in a box\" sofa we will buy though. Ps this was set up in October even though I have Christmas stuff up haha I'm excited this year!!",

Which really is unfortunate because I love Everything about this couch, I just would have gotten it in a different color had I known the black was not black.I\u2019m not being a stickler here either, there\u2019s just nothing I hate more than grey. I wanted a black couch. I have A black and white couch cover but it just makes it even more obvious that the cushions aren\u2019t actually black they\u2019re grey. Otherwise everything about this couch is wonderful. It\u2019s huge and comfortable. Good quality, didn\u2019t take long to put together\u2026 just wish it was the color I ordered/wanted",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this sofa off the viral Tik Tok video with decent hopes of a great sofa since the reviews were outstanding. The shipment arrived quickly and it was extremely easy to assemble. After two weeks, the sofa started to cave in. It\u2019s reminiscent of sitting on a water bed with how this sofa lacks sturdiness. The back sofa cushions are low and offer poor support as well. I have definitely noticed back pain from using this sofa. Never had that issue with my IKEA couch.Customer service has been nothing short of a nightmare to deal with. I\u2019ve been trying to get a resolution for two weeks. They respond just once a day, and it seems they struggle to comprehend my concerns or grasp my perspective. Their ability to interpret my feedback and find a solution, or even understand my point, is severely lacking in common sense. Their solution was to \u201ciron / steam it\u201d to deal with how it\u2019s caving in. The product is very cheap quality and already caving in due to being worn out in just two weeks - steaming it won\u2019t fix this. They instructed me to return the sofa in original packaging which is impossible to do even if I still had the boxes since the cushions were vacuum packed. I keep inquiring how I\u2019m supposed to return this so I can get a refund but their response is simply \u201cwith the shipping label\u201d. I would HAPPILY return this if it was at all possible, but unsure how to seeing I live in Manhattan. There is zero common sense or practicality with customer service and completely pointless stating a refund is available if there is no possible way to return this sofa. Complete waste of money and time. I would highly recommend to avoid this product and seller.",
