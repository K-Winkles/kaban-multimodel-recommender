                "reviewText": "So excited getting the two seater sofa for my home, just moved (new home, new everything). The color beige of the couch matches the brick-shaped walls of the room and the size is perfect because of the small space of my living room. I\u2019m very glad that my package arrived in a hard and thick box because it did not come with styrofoam, but it came tightly closed with plastic film inside the box. Luckily, I opened it carefully. The sofa is kind of heavy. So I really needed my partner help to assemble it because I\u2019m not physically strong. It was easy to put it together since all the pieces are organized by letters and numbers. Detailed instructions are included with drawings of all parts of the sofa and also show how to install each screw. Oh, the tools are included too, so I did not worry about using my own. The sofa is beautiful and can easily sit on it three or four people. What I like most is that when I sit down I feel comfort and stability (it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to fall apart). Everyone at home loves it!!!! The sofa arrived in the best season. I can\u2019t wait to start decorating for Christmas! Happy purchase!",

                "reviewText": "It's well designed for what it is, steady and solid. Complaints seem to be materials for the frame, but I don't plan on jumping up and down on it. I'm 235 lbs, 6ft tall and it's supports me well, no sagging or creaking noises. Perfect for watching TV. If you live with you butt, stuck on a couch all day not for you. If you just want sitting place for a guest or somewhere to sit with your other and watch TV for a few hours, this works great and at a low price. Beats out a futon, for comfort and price.",

                "reviewText": "Final update:Seller was very responsive about fixing the issues and asked what my preference was for solving it. Once that was decided they were very quick in sending me a new couch. Assembled the new one today and it works great, no issues. I love the color and the style and it fits great in my apartment. A little firm but in a good way for my dog and I. The back cushions could be fluffier but on the whole it gets the job done.1st update:Seller has been very positive and quick with their responses for resolution. I believe that we have a solution in place that should satisfy the issue. When the action steps are completed I will update again with a new star rating. The couch itself seems comfy and cozy and I will speak more about that when/if resolution has been met.Original review:Will update if manufacturer is responsive in fixing the issue of the broken part. Hoping they will send a replacement part (the main couch cushion) or a whole new couch. The issue: the zipper that connects the front and back of the couch that fills the gap and provides a space for the pillows to sit broke. Which makes the couch unusable because the back pillows have nowhere to sit. It also came with a small stain, which I\u2019m not that concerned about. Just want the couch to function.. If they fix the issue, I\u2019ll let you know. \u2014\u2014- update - problem fixed.",
