But I decided to purchase anyway because all of the other couches that were similar that I looked at, the reviews weren\u2019t that great. But I am so glad that I did make the decision to purchase it. The couch is very soft, the material is great and it does not feel cheap. The seats are actually DEEP and it was very easy to assemble. Also, the couch is a lot bigger than I expected it to be, I can sleep/lay on it comfortably.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this to put in the little \"book nook\" in the primary bedroom and for this purpose, it's fantastic. It is a good size - you can fit a regular size person on it and a lap cat - it's very easy to assemble, and it's comfortable. It's not a super high end looking chair - I definitely wouldn't put it in say, the living room or other places where it's highly visible. But for a bedroom, it's more than fine. It sits a nice height from the ground so even a shorter person will be comfortable in it.The fabric is what makes it look a little less classy than it could if that was not a \"fuzzy\" look but you can easily drape something over that if you're not a fan. I think it fine but it's probably not for everyone. I took off a star for that because I will say that it definitely looks better in photos than in person. But for a chair you are going to read in or just as an accent in a bedroom, this works and we are pleased enough with it to keep it. I think if it were priced a little lower, the expectations of the way it looks would be more in line. This is a $89.99 big box store chair if you know what I mean...not a $200 one, which is the price as of this writing.But as far as functionality and comfort, it's a good chair. If it fits your decor or this is your style, then go for it. I just wish the price point were lower - if it was, then I'd recommend it for an occasional chair for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this armchair. On the pro side, it is super-easy to assemble. I'm a petite woman of a certain age, and I was able to put it together myself in about 15 minutes -- probably less. (It took me longer to break down the cardboard and gather all the plastic bags for the recycling/trash bins.) On the con side, it is cheaply made and cheap looking. The legs are plastic. It fit together well considering the lackluster workmanship. The boucle fabric is velcroed on, but the seams were straight enough that the slipcovers fit OK. The fabric looks/feels cheap, but you can always toss on a throw to make the chair look a little nicer. I got it for a guest room, and it's definitely OK for that, especially since it's comfortable enough. If you need a cheap armchair for a guest room, teen bedroom, home office, or college apartment, this will serve well enough.",

                "reviewText": "In terms of comfort, this sofa truly delivers. The deep seat provides a cozy and inviting feel, making it perfect for relaxation and lounging. Assembly was generally smooth, with most pieces fitting together well. However, I did encounter a slight challenge with the back piece, which proved a bit difficult to push in. While it required a bit more effort than expected, it didn't significantly impact the overall assembly process. One notable issue I encountered was the absence of a Velcro attachment on the back. It appears that it may have been overlooked during the manufacturing process. To address this, I had to use my own Velcro to secure the back piece. While this was a minor inconvenience, it's something worth noting, and I hope it can be addressed in future productions.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't really sure what to expect from this chair but I wanted something comfy for me in my basement office remodel.The chair itself comes very compact but it's pretty well packaged. The instructions were simple and well done. The chair went together very easily with very limited need for tools. There's really only 4 screws that need to be loosened then tightened down. Everything else just slides together or velcros in place.The chair sits a bit low and I was honestly concerned about the size of it as I'm 6'3\" 215 pounds. Even with my size the chair fits really well and is surprisingly really comfortable!I wouldn't put this in my living room as I don't think it would hold up for years of heavy daily use. But for an office, bedroom or dorm room use I think this is really a perfect fit.I huge plus in my book is that the seat cover, back cover and pillow case all unzip and can be easily washed. The chair material is like a terry cloth style loop fabric but it's soft and feels nice.The cushions are a nice medium density you don't completely sink in but it's not uncomfortable at all. Everything together is nice and light weight as well so it's easy to move yet decently sturdy and should hold up well enough for a few years worth of moderate use.Overall I'd definitely recommend this chair, I really like it and will be perfect addition in my office.",
