The orange is a perfect pop of color and the velvet is super easy to clean. It's not the softest fluffiest couch out there but for the price it is extremely comfortable. When it's folded down the seam from seat to the back is a tad uncomfortable but will get less stiff with use. Overall a purchase well worth its price, and assembly and delivery was super simple!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small sofa bed, or futon for my new apartmentI bought a cheap one but it was awful, seating are is small, the back are also small and don't stay in placeThen I had this one on my list for weeks, until finally I got it, in the peach color as it had a discounted priceIt's beautiful and well made. Very comfortable and easy to put it togetherThe only shortcomings I see for now - I received it today - are the legs and the bracketsAll legs are made of hard plastic imitating wood. I wish they were metalAlso, the two middle legs are the ones with brackets to keep both halves together. It's a bad idea to use plastic for thatAt least the middle legs should be metal or have a metal bracket insertAny vertical move of the sofa halves will put all stress on those plastic brackets and they are not rigid enoughThe legs could be made of a harder, better and reinforced plasticMy solution for now was to use the metal brackets intended for the arms as elements to keep the halves togetherThe metal brackets luckily have the exact same measurements as of the middle legs brackets, so I use them together, under each middle leg, I screwed the metal brackets in a sandwich fashionTo be honest, I don't know why the arms have brackets, as the idea to easy remove the arms is one of the things that made me buy this unitThe sofa became way more stableAs final thought, if this unit was a single pice, it would be a perfect small sofa bedPlus, metal legs!",

And I don't regret. For this price it was hard to find something nice, not too big and not too small. I also needed a convertible option. This sofa looks nice, nice material, comfy enough. Still a bit small, it could be nicier if it was a bit bigger. But anyway, for the money - it's perfect. The delivery was fast and smooth. The set up was easy, a bit heavy, but I was able to set it up by myself without any additional help. Strongly recommended.",

When it arrived; we opened up the boxes (its comes in 2 boxes about 59lbs each and 38\u201dx36\u201dx9\u201d size boxes) took it out and put it together. My wife and I both sat down on it in the couch position and immediately gave each other the same look. It was super firm with very little back support and the seat area was very small. We then folded it flat and each tried to lay on it\u2026HORRENDOUS!! There\u2019s a spot right in the middle where it folds flat that is hard as a rock, making it completely unusable. I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and can\u2019t even lay on it without my knees bent. My 8yr old son tried to lay on it and immediately said it was not comfortable. I contacted the seller to return it and they asked multiple questions about it before sending a return label, but we have to pay shipping to return it. The seller probably has a FedEx account for shipping, but we have to pay to ship it back and the shipping is about the same price as this useless futon!! I will never in a million years recommend buying anything from Mopio!!UPDATE: after posting this review; the seller decided to refund the purchase and asked us to donate the futon.",

                "reviewText": "Like many of the previous buyers, I searched Amazon for a long while before I settled on this couch! I got it because of the color (and the price). I love how this blue will pop with the rest of my living room decor. I also love that I didn't break the bank to get something that looks good. It's also pretty comfortable.First, I loved how quickly I received the item. Both boxes for the couch came together and it took about 2 days for me to get them! They both arrived at my door, and they weren't too heavy to move. But it should be noted that I have a ground floor apartment unit--so no stairs for me! Second, it took me about 10 minutes to put this together. The assembly is very straightforward and there are not a million little pieces. The instructions were pretty clear, and the diagrams were very well written/drawn. Third, I think it's comfortable. It's defiantly on the firmer side. But I appreciate this because I don't want to sink into my couch. It's just great for sitting upright and working. I'm sure it would be fine as a bed for a night or two. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase! It will be a great addition to my new apartment.",
