The instructions come with it and are located in the zipper compartment underneath the couch.

                "reviewText": "I was sleeping on the floor before I got this, and sleeping on this was actually worse than sleeping on the floor. So why four stars? Well, as a place to sit, and for the price, it's pretty good. I've gotten used to sleeping on it now that it's been a few weeks, but I have to avoid laying on the crease where the cup holder section lies. It's narrow, so when you're using it to sit, you won't be able to lean your head against it because it isn't tall enough, but it's not uncomfortable besides that. Also, it is just about as cute as it looks in the pictures.",

The backside of the cup holder part is too big and required much physical strength to push it in between the two recliner sections. Screwing this portion in was another painful ordeal. Wondering if i received a defective product. Only reasons for not returning it back was the efforts put in to get it altogether The final product also looks pretty cheap.",

Of course I just got it and assemble it today so time will tell true feelings but first impressions are good. Assembly was easy however I recommend having a screw gun handy to speed up the process. It\u2019s very sturdy. Is it the most comfortable thing in the world? No, but I would definitely sleep on it and it\u2019s a little bigger than I expected which was a nice surprise. Only problem is this came without the middle cup holder piece and the arm rest pillows. I sent a message to the seller so we will see what happens when they get back to me!",
