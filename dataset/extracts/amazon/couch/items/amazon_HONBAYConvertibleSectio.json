                "reviewText": "Comes in two large boxes that were delivered on separate days (both had tracking). Putting it together was easy, except for one narrow wood plank that required a lot of force to take out of the smaller couch section. Fortunately the directions are clear and even mentions the wood planks being there for shipping, not for the couch itself. If we hadn't known that in advance the couch would likely still be in pieces. Kudos to the manufacturer for making clear, easy to follow directions!The long seat cushion is significantly firmer than the two smaller ones. The two smaller ones also didn't reach the same height as the long one. The height difference isn't super noticeable visually and only a problem if you're trying to sit across the firm cushion and soft cushion. However, you can move the cushions around to fit your preferred cushion firmness. (I suspect the softer seat cushions won't last as long as the firm one, but that's just my guess.)The dark gray cloth texture feels nice to the touch. We currently have no pets, so I can't comment on how cat claws or pet fur would interact with the material. For regular human types, it seems just fine!We had a used futon couch that we'd been using before this couch. That futon was pretty small for my husband (6 foot) and me (5'9\"). This couch is also little small for us, but it's bigger than the futon and we live in a small apartment so bigger furniture was not an option. You can see my husband sitting in one of the pictures to give you an idea of how high the back of the couch is and whether that's acceptable for you. While it would be nice to have a higher back for us taller people, it's not a deal breaker. The back pillows are nice and fluffy, very comfortable.The build quality is exactly what you expect at this price point. The entire structure is light for a couch and there's definitely some give in certain spots. This is not the type of couch that you can jump on and expect it to survive. The cloth cover used to \"blend\" the two couch portions (that were split for shipping) don't do a good job. The split between the long and short portion of the couch ends up looking a bit tacky from the back as a result.However, it being light due to budget constraints has it's perks. It's easy to take apart and carry. If you're the type who moves themselves, this couch will be easy to take down a flight of stairs or elevator. Perfect for those in collage or apartments they know they'll be moving out of soon.All said, it's comfortable to sit on and functions as you expect from a couch. If you don't have a lot of money, are able to lift light-medium weighted furniture, and want an L shaped couch, this should work very well.If I come across any serious problems in the future, I'll make sure to update my review. Otherwise, I recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this couch to replace a gifted but extremely large sectional that I appreciated but did not need. I Definitely wanted something smaller as I live alone and in a semi small duplex. I was drawn to this couch due to the fact that I could still have the \u201csectional\u201d option if I really wanted and also that I didn\u2019t have to decide which side it had to be on upfront and then work with it from here on out. I have a dog who sheds and was also concerned with cleaning rather often to remove dog hair since she\u2019s spoiled and allowed on couches.This couch was by far the best option as it can be cleaned easily, covers are even removable (Although I haven\u2019t had to remove and wash yet), the dog hair, when it\u2019s on there is not very noticeable, so it\u2019s not an eye sore (I am an ocd clean person) between cleaning/removal of the dog hair.The seat cushions are firm and comfortable and the backing cushions do seem super thin due to being vacuum sealed when they arrive but do expand after 12-24 hours or so. They could use a tad bit more cushion in the back ones but I also had an overstuffed couch before so I may be comparing it too much against that factor. While sitting on it, I\u2019ve never felt that they are too thin or uncomfortable in the slightest so I think it\u2019s just my own thing. The size itself absolutely perfect size for a small or even medium size living room and the fact that you can switch sides, shapes and even have a little ottoman and/or an extra seat for extra company is the best!I bought this a month before I moved with the intent to keep it boxed until the move itself but I was too excited and put it together anyways :) - Took me 10 mins to assemble, 10 mins to take apart and re box (the backing cushions are vacuum sealed and stored in the underside of the seat cushions when it arrives so although I re boxed the whole thing, two understandably did not fit perfectly back in the box which I was totally aware of prior to it all), and even less time to put together the second time!I was curious when ordering it on amazon how it would be and especially how it would be delivered. Not to mention how the mailman would get it up 3 flights of stairs!! However, I was impressed to discover that the boxes were heavy but not excessive and everything was surprisingly packaged into two largish sized boxes. I was even able to move them inside and around the house myself before I opened it up!To be noted:The color seems gray in the photos and description and from afar and even most of the time it looks perfectly gray to me, but I have also noticed that in direct sunlight it has a bluish tint to the gray. Also when you place different shades of gray on or next to it you notice the bluish tint as well. Definitely not a deal breaker for me and hopefully not for most but be aware \ud83d\ude0a. Also I\u2019m pretty tall for a girl, just under 5\u20199\u201d and laying straight on the longer area (as the sectional), my feet do hang off a bit. It\u2019s not how I usually sit on a couch anyways but I did test that out bc some reviews I initially read of ppl in the 6\u2019 range mentioned it. So it\u2019s shorter than a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d sectional would be but again, I don\u2019t typically sit that way and it doesn\u2019t bother me what so ever. Maybe if you\u2019re cuddling with a significant other or sleeping on it then it would be a problem with the feet, but you can always lay the other direction. I just figured it should be noted too.I definitely recommend this couch to others, especially for the price! I can\u2019t say enough good things about it; It\u2019s comfortable, affordable, easy to assemble, easy to clean, and the perfect size. Hope this review is helpful to others!",

No tools required for assembly and I only needed to look at the instructions once. The fabric in the back does not line up and leaves noticeable gaps between the panels. If this couch is not going to be against a wall I recommend covering the back with a console table. The back cushions are thin and the couch works and serves its purpose but it is not the most comfortable piece of furniture. Overall you are better off paying a little bit more from a couch you can demo at a furniture store and buy for the same price.",
