                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good Cheap Couch",
                "reviewText": "For the price, I think this is a really good couch. The bottom cushions are really comfortable, the back cushions are a little thin, but pretty cozy and you can easily add a pillow. The only 'unsturdy' thing we've noticed is the back support (the metal frame behind the back cushions) has a bit of play in it. So it will give a little and crack and creak if you sit down a little too hard. So, here's hoping that it doesn't become an issue later on.Putting the couch together was pretty simple, they even gave some extra screws which was thoughtful. There's a little space underneath to store stuff or be a play-place for cats, haha. I like that the arm rests are flat -- I can easily set my phone on them and it won't slide off.The ottoman has storage inside and it can velcro (underneath) to the couch so it won't slide away. The lid of the ottoman does not have a hinge.The back cushions also velco on, the bottom cushions do not.Also note: Our couch was delivered in one box. The cushions were vacuum sealed and we almost thought we were missing one because it only came it two bags, but one back had 2 of the cushion in it! So make sure you double check before thinking something is missing.Overall, it was a great experience buying our first couch online. It's not the best couch in the world, but we can't afford something super expensive right now and this is going to work absolutely great.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to put together! Mind boggling how it all fit in one box. There are parts inside the armrests so check there if your missing anything. I was not missing any pieces or parts to my couch. The back is definitely lower than I thought it would be. But all in all, for the price it's very decent. I did unzip all the cushions and remove the cushion covers so I could iron out the wrinkles. That helped the back cushions puff up and the seat memory foam cushions return to their original shape much faster. Very comfortable to sit on and sleep on but I wish the back was taller. Probably will upgrade to something better in the future but for now it will work for us.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, we had a bit of trouble finding some parts because they were hidden inside the armrests. We thought that there was a box missing so we had to contact customer service. Since they don't talk to customers directly we had to have Amazon customer serve as the intermediaries. However that was an oversight on our part and we found the parts as soon as we read the manual more thoroughly.As a whole the couch looks pretty good, it has the potential of being better. But it's lower than I expected it to be. The ottoman is not properly proportioned as seen in the picture. We had already tightened the frame since the manual instructs to assemble the ottoman frame first. This resulted in the the bottom not being able to fit. We had to loosen the frame in order for the top and bottom square to fit. The cushions are a lot thinner than pictured which makes it less comfortable than it could be and makes some gaps (also pictured). I had seen a couch at living spaces which was about the same price but I went with this one just because it had an included ottoman. I should have just gotten the one at living spaces, it was definitely higher quality than this couch set :|",

Will add a few pillows to the couch when moved to the basement. Decent size. Some of the legs for the couch were already stripped and would not screw in. My husband had to use a flat head to pry other parts open to slide the back of the couch into place. Ottoman was great!",
