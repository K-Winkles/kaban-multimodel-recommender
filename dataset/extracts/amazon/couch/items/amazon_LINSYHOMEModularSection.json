                "reviewText": "I have never felt more inclined to give a 5-star review for a product or company than this. There was an issue with shipping and half of our new couch got misdelivered. While the delivery company beat around the bush and had non-existent customer service, Linsy Home Direct's customer service responded the very same day, even though it was late at night and sent out replacement pieces the next day after I got back to them.The couch itself is also high quality especially for the price. The assembly is self-explanatory, there is a youtube video demonstrating the way to do it but you might not even need it, it's that easy. Everything you need comes in every box. It took two people about an hour and a half to assemble all the parts and dispose of the packaging. The storage space underneath each seat is invaluable in a <1000 sq. ft. home. The color looks very close to the pictures and the dimensions listed are very accurate.This couch replaced a hand-me-down couch that was originally much pricier than this one. Our old couch was plagued with shoddy construction, strange floor-space wasting angles, flattened cushions, and deep crevasses that led to the internal springs where small objects frequently became lost to time. And it was insanely difficult to haul in and out of homes when we moved it. I am extremely satisified that we now have more seating that takes up less floor space, doubles as storage, and matches our style better.Some considerations, although not at all dealbreakers or really even cons in my opinion: Every part comes in its own box, so there will be a lot of cardboard and plastic wrap to get rid of. cushions take a few days to fully fluff up. Feel very firm at first but light use will break them in more. Locking the pieces together can take a little bit more force than some people might feel comfortable with.",

All cushions arrived vacuumed sealed and fully inflated after three to four days. The sectional is not extremely firm but firm enough and comfortable. Overall I love the ability to make multiple configurations and would like to purchase the versatile unit they have once available in gray.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy such a crucial piece of furniture online especially after reading some reviews about issues with the low back. The back sofa pieces are very low and could have been made higher for sure. However I don\u2019t find them digging into my back. You can feel the back of the couch but I would not say it\u2019s uncomfortable. The couch was easy to assemble and is very easy to rearrange for a special occasion. It\u2019s comfortable to sit and lay on and looks nice. The storage is super convenient although I do wish the boards sitting on top of the storage just opened and attached somehow rather than coming all the way off. Haven\u2019t washed it yet but have had to wipe a few baby related spills off of it and it came clean very nice that way. The only two drawbacks I had1. The back really cannot be placed in front of the arm in the corners as shown in the pictures. When you see it in person that way the arm sticks out way past the back and therefore looks really cheap and dumb. We arranged ours with a chaise type lounge on one side using the extra back on the other side in order to put the arm facing out because of this. Not a huge deal but a tad misleading because it doesn\u2019t look that way in the photos. Hoping to be able to contact customer service for a couple additional backs sometime in the future to make both sides the same.2. None of the cushions attach in any way to the furniture. This is the reason I gave 4 stars. Because of this the cushions shift around a lot especially on the parts that are functioning as ottomans. I have to put them in order quite a bit so it doesn\u2019t look wonky. I really wish they had included something to attach them and am planning on adding something myself at least for the bottom ones",

                "reviewText": "1st pic in brighter light was after 1st assembling the sofa. 2nd pic in darker light is after about 5 hours later. Cushions all inflated very well. Cushions are firm but comfortable\u2026think memory foam firm. It conforms to you without you sinking in. The couch is heavy and sturdy. Super easy to assemble. I have been wanting a Modular sectional but didn\u2019t want to spend a fortune because I still have 2 young kids so the high end brands were out of the question for me right now. We opted for dark grey as well due to kids and cats lol. Packaging was great and couches arrived in great condition. Came in 7 individual boxes. 4 for the seats, 2 for the ottomans and one box was just the arm rests for the end chairs. Instructions came in the armrest box I believe but I was easily able to watch the assembly video on the product page. I wasn\u2019t sure which box the instructions were in so I just opened them up in the order they would be assembled. Overall very happy with my sofa. My only complaint is there are a few visible ending threads on the seat bases which I wish were cut( I hate that on products) but as long as they don\u2019t come undone I\u2019m fine. The price is amazing considering how insanely high lovesac is. Each piece is fully configurable to be used any way you like so no ugly brackets or different colored fabric on the sides. I was especially sold on the removable cover part! It appears that you can even remove the covers to each seat base as well because they are attached underneath by Velcro. Anyways this is a awesome sofa and I am so glad we ditched our standard sectional for this Modular sectional.",
