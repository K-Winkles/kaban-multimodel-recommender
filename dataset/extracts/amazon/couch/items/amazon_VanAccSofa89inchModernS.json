Instructions could have been a little clearer, but not too bad. I couldn't find the Allen wrench it came with so I just used one of my own. It looks good and is decently comfortable. It sits a little low but it also sits deep. Really can't complain, especially at this price.",

The fabric and color are great, no complaints there... The only real issue I have with this sofa is the backrest cushions are extremely thin even after they fully expand, but you get what you pay for and this sofa is a great option for a small space, or a kid's game room. All-in-all this was a great purchase and I recommend it to anyone looking for a non-expensive option for a small sofa.",
