                "reviewText": "This sofa is one of my favorite pieces in my apartment currently. It\u2019s the perfect size for my small apartment, and the storage is a plus; all pillows fit perfectly when made into a bed.I assembled this sofa all on my own (please note it\u2019s advised to have 2 people assembling). It took me a whole day but was not hard to do (also note there are no words with the instructions, making it a bit challenging). It comes in 2 boxes; mine arrived a day apart. When assembling, I thought I was missing parts but soon realized the \u2018missing\u2019 parts were in a box labeled \u2018missing parts\u2019 lol.As for the L-shape, I wanted it to go on the right side instead of the left, as it\u2019s supposed to be. I figured out a way to do so. On the side of the sofa where the arms are supposed to go, there are \u2018hooks\u2019 where you would normally place the arms. I decided to swap them in order to be able to change where the L-shape went.Regarding the comfortableness of the sofa, it\u2019s very soft with fluffy pillows. If you plan to use it as a bed for guests or personal use, I would recommend getting a mattress pad to add a bit more comfort, as the divide of the cushions is a bit uncomfortable. The pull-out part is very easy (note that the only thing holding this part are 2 screws from coming out).It looks beautiful, though, and I would recommend it!\u201d",

                "reviewText": "This couch is super cool! I love the storage and the way it pops out. I think it is more comfortable than a lot of conventional pull out sofa beds and it is much easier to operate. It isn't luxury feeling by any means, the pillows should probably be replaced and its a bit on the firm side. It is not at all uncomfortable though. Putting it together was very clear but it was a lot of steps. It is an awesome sofa especially for small spaces and it is a pretty decent price for a sofa bed.",

                "reviewText": "This couch arrived 3-5 days earlier than expected, which made me very happy! It\u2019s a cheap couch, the fabric isn\u2019t high end fabric, the wood base is very flimsy. But, for what you pay, it is worth it! Even though it\u2019s not the most luxurious couch, it\u2019s worth it for a small space and especially with kids! It looks very nice & the cushions are firm(which is good because the wood base would break if the cushions weren\u2019t firm enough). The couch is comfortable, but do not expect a cloud like feel to it. It\u2019s firm-comfortable.It took me about 4 hours to build, but I had kids wanting to play with the pieces so I was chasing them around the whole time. I\u2019m sure you can cut that time in half if you do it without an kids around.Overall, I give the couch a 4 star because it\u2019s perfect for what I needed and it came quickly& it\u2019s good for what you pay.",

                "reviewText": "For sleeping - It's more comfortable with a pillow topper on it, but don't use a queen topper, it's too big for it. I would suggest a full-size topper.It's small. My son is 11 years old, he's short, not sure his length, maybe 4'10\" or so, but his feet hang off of the bed. If he sleeps diagonally or curled up, he fits a little better.The cushions were easy to fluff up. The couch was easy to assemble. The wood slats seem a bit cheap, and I'd say, take it EASY on the couch, because one aggressive approach on that couch, and you will snap the slats for sure.I basically got it for our game room/guest room area, so this couch is out of sight. Hopefully my guest(s) will be okay with the size & topper I put on it for more comfort. We shall see.",

                "reviewText": "This came in two shipments. The seller was super fast to respond with the 2nd tracking number. The 2nd package arrived the next day. I love this couch. The pillows have been out for 3 days and they are getting more and more fluffy. At first the couch is not as comfy as expected but that\u2019s because it was vacuumed sealed. Once you give it some time it becomes comfy. I would suggest getting the back pillows open as soon as you receive the packages so they have more time to fluff up before the couch is put together. The pull out bed is super easy to pull out but I found once it\u2019s all put together it\u2019s best to pull it by the front panel first, then use the pull tab to lift it. We have had it pulled out the whole time because we love to lounge. It fits me and my 2 kids very comfortably and we could easily fit another person and possibly a 5th. I love that my kids and I can all lay down at the same time and not be touching if we don\u2019t want to. This is honestly my favorite purchase. My kids slept on it last night and they said it was comfy.As for putting this together, it took me an hour and a half by myself (29 yr old woman) and I was taking breaks to eat my dinner. If you have a drill attachment for this type of screw you could have it done in 30 minutes. It was incredibly easy to put together and the directions are very clear. I like how they zoomed in and showed exactly how to put it together. There was nothing confusing about the directions and nothing difficult to put together. Honestly I have no idea why some people struggled to put this together. The pictures were very clear. I took everything out and put them in piles of what I needed for what part of the couch I was building and unwrapped everything as I needed it because it\u2019s all very clearly labeled.",

We had to hire someone to assemble it but even then it was less money than most sofas like this. It's great for a smaller space, not big and bulky but is about 8 feet long so great for a tall person to sleep on.",
