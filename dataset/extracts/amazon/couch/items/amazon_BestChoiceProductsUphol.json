                "reviewText": "It's cozy, comfy, and perfect for a small space. The Ottoman being detached and movable means you can adjust to your liking/space needs. Only complaints are that the back feels a little flimsy and is only attached by two metal pieces, one on each side. I feel like I have to be careful every time I sit down or the back is going to bend and/or break. It never does though so I suppose that's a plus, but it'll be in the back of your mind every time you go to take a seat regardless. Overall this is a good product for the price, and works amazing in a small studio. Also, the arms are wide enough to set a phone down to charge on them, which is very nice as well. Didn't think about that when buying, but it's an added plus.",

I\u2019m 68 yrs young woman who put it together myself without any problems. The price was very reasonable and quality of fabric and cushions were great. Even better, it is one of the most comfortable sofas I have sat on. In fact, I purchased this for a friend\u2019s apartment and even spent a week sleeping on it. Fantastic! Very suitable for small rooms or apartments. Perfect size. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "After paging through some of the reviews that inspired me to buy that couch, I'd like to share my own experience.The couch is shipped into large boxes. These boxes are packed together by somebody with a rather amazing Tetris score. Assembly was comically easy as you're just screwing on the legs, throwing two bolts with hand turn nuts into the connecting all, and throw and cushions on. It's a breeze.My chief complaint however comes from the fact that the cushion material between the long two seat sectional piece and the two individual cushions is not only different, but it doesn't even share the same properties.The long two seat cushion is made of an incredibly firm foam, like, comically firm. If the entire couch and backs were made of this, it would be fine. But the problem I'm running into is that while this individual cushion is Stout as a Russian polar bear, the other cushions including the couch backs are made of a soft expanding foam. Both on their own are comfortable, the one you combine the two you're left with this weird amalgamation of issues,Specifically if you're laying longways on the couch, regardless of where you place that double seat, there's one part of the couch that is a solid 3 or 4 in above the other cushions when you're laying on them. If you were to lay on your back facing up on the couch, it's a great spine adjustment because the offset is enough that your back will absolutely pop and twist in ways it's not supposed to.I haven't found a good work around for it yet, but even having the long piece as the double chase ends up messing you up if you're sitting on the regular couch as it ends up as a weird super low armrest of sorts.For the money I guess you get what you pay for, I just really really wished that the cushions were at least all made of the same material whether it was the firm two seat cushion or the expanding foam of the single seats and the back of the couch.",

                "reviewText": "Got a defective part that was damaged and it couldn't be assembled properly so the backrest was wobbly and stick out further back. Asked company for assistance. The product gets shipped in two boxes \"Box A\" and \"Box B.\" Their solution was to send me one of the two boxes containing more parts than I needed and I would have to just throw away the extra parts I didn't need. Annoying but whatever. But then they never sent me the part and said sorry we'll just give you your money back. I'm somewhat thankful that I got refunded without having to return anything but now I'm stuck with a useless broken couch that would cost me $100 to get rid of. It's sitting here in my apartment and now it's giving off a horrible chemical fume that is making me cough. Even if I had none of the assembly issues this couch is a cheap piece of garbage that is uncomfortable to sit on, the couch cushions are uneven. It's way overpriced for what it is. If you want to return it the company would normally charge you like $70 and it would be impossible for you to get it back into the box because it's vacuum sealed. Luckily I didn't have to do that... But realistically I'm going to eventually have to pay someone to come pick up this couch from me for disposal or I'll have to drop it off at a junkyard that will charge me for drop off.",
