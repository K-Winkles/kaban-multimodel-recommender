So a project that should have taken maybe an HOUR max, took me almost 2. Also one of the arm rests was damaged so it looks like I\u2019ll need to invest in a cover as it is very visible and eye sore.",

I would highly recommend this sofa for a small apartment and for a temporary fix. The cushions are very comfortable.

                "reviewText": "This is definitely a get what you pay for scenario. My budget was around $300 and the reviews for this couch seemed better compared to others in my price range. I rated this 3 stars because I knew it wouldn\u2019t have everything an expressive couch has. The other reviewers didn\u2019t seem to touch on these things. The back is not solid. It is three bars put together with a cover and no real support. This coupled with the fact that the back cushions are extremely thin makes my back ache. One back cushion is already letting out filling, although being zipped shut. The bottom of the couch is not super supportive and the whole couch is very noisy, creaking when you sit. I am a female who weighs around 145lbs. Warning, do not put in the middle of the room, it\u2019s best against a wall. The couch moves no matter how softly you sit. The ottoman has decent size no complaints, but it doesn\u2019t connect to the couch well. Also, this company does not accept returns if the couch is not in its original packaging, so don\u2019t throw the shipping box and plastic covers away until you decide to keep it. It took me around 2 1/2 to assemble but I was also chasing a 11 month old and trying to focus on the couch in intervals and I put a few parts on backwards and had to restart. Put instructions in case someone loses theirs. Do not recommend, it\u2019s better to save a bit more and spend on a reputable brand",
