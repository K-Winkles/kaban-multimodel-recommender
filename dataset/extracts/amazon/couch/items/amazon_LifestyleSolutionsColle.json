                "reviewText": "The microfiber sofa required assembly, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality and comfort. Despite the initial hassle of putting it together, the result was worth it. The microfiber material used for this sofa is incredibly soft and feels pleasing to the touch. However, it is prone to attracting lint and pet hair easily. I appreciate that it is easy to clean, as spills and stains are bound to happen in a household with pets.The design of the sofa is sleek and modern, fitting in nicely with my existing decor. It offers ample seating space, perfect for entertaining guests or simply lounging around. The cushions are firm yet comfortable, providing adequate support for extended periods of sitting. I was impressed with the sturdiness of the frame once fully assembled. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, making the assembly process relatively straightforward. While it did take some time and effort to put together, the result was a solid and well-built sofa that I am confident will last for years to come.Overall, despite the initial assembly, this microfiber sofa has exceeded my expectations regarding quality, comfort, and style. I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a functional and attractive seating option for their home.",

                "reviewText": "One of the biggest concerns I have with buying furniture, outside of value for money, is whether it\u2019s easy to put together, if I need extra tools, and so on. Thankfully this couch did not disappoint. Assembly is very easy, and goes along with the directions. There are two pieces I could not put in on the ends, and you will absolutely want to make sure you have someone on hand to help attach the back piece to the seating portion. Otherwise as far as assembly goes, pretty smooth!The couch itself is nice for the price. It\u2019s not Egyptian cotton; you will feel the wood frame on the armrests for example, so a couch pillow is a great idea, but you\u2019ll be just fine sitting down. The size to me is a pretty perfect size as far as a three-person couch is considered. My personal height runs a bit on the short side so I\u2019m able to lay down comfortably when needed.The biggest thing to keep in mind is that this is not a sturdy couch. It\u2019ll have no problem bearing weight according to the weight limit, but the frame itself is not anything like steel. There is the possibility you can break one of the legs if you go to sit down and throw your weight against the couch too hard, as is the case that happened to me with two of the four legs broken but semi-functioning, so you\u2019ll want to exercise caution against strong physical actions like jumping onto it. Same thing with the cushioning, as the cushioning along the back of the seat may tear with enough force.If you\u2019re looking for a very affordable three-seat couch that\u2019s easy to put together, this will work just fine.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not gonna lie. I was worried that this couch would be difficult to put together. But honestly it was amazingly easy to assemble, but does require an extra hand or two to help with assembly. Also the box is ackward and bulky. Make sure you have someone to help you get it into your place. The fabric is velvety soft, simple yet stylish. I added 2 pillows & a throw blanket to give it a little more flare. Only negative I can say is the cushions are a bit firm. But honestly not bad at all! I want to buy the matching chair down the line. This was a great buy for me considering I took a chance & bought one of \"blemished\" or \"damaged\" sofa's for $197, when they are usually mid-upper $200's. Well worth, with no damage to the couch at all, just the box! What a bargain piece!!",

                "reviewText": "The tops of the back cushions ripped away from the back frame. Lasted about 8 months maybe. Cushions are non removable. Also small for adults, barely enough room for a single person to lay down. Too small for couch pillows, even the small ones are too big. Arms have no cushion. Fibers stay to come through it leaving it looking like it has hair on it. Back cushions also begin to sag and bunch up. Have to take it apart if you drop phone down the sides because it gets trapped inside the couch at the bottom and you hand doesn't fit in the gap. Would not recommend. Not even a year later already need to replace it .",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a great couch for the price, cushions are a little firm but I like it that way. It was fairly easy to assemble, did it by myself in about 20 minutes. The \u201cscheduled\u201d delivery, however, was an absolute nightmare. Not once did anyone reach out to me to schedule a delivery date but one was provided to me through the tracking information which happened to work with my schedule. Unfortunately, while I was out of town for a few days long before the \u201cscheduled\u201d delivery date, the company attempted to deliver my couch three days in a row after telling them I was not home to accept the delivery and that is not the day that it was supposed to be delivered. The owner of the delivery company even pressured me to try to get someone else to come sign for the couch for me, even though it was about four days before the supposedly scheduled delivery date. Also, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an issue with the clearly unprofessional delivery company or if it\u2019s an issue with the warehouse that it came from, but the couch arrived dirty and damaged in one corner. I would not recommend purchasing this, especially if you live in a rural area. The couch came in a box that was not difficult to bring inside on my own so I don\u2019t see any reason why this couldn\u2019t have been shipped through UPS or Amazon itself. While I am satisfied with the couch itself, because I purchased a couch cover to hide the damage, the entire process was such a headache that it was absolutely not worth it.",
