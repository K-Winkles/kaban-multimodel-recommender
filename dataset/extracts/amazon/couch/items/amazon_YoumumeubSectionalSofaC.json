                "reviewText": "I would actually give this couch 4.5 stars.Pros: Pretty easy assembly - we had 2 people and it took about 30 minutes to put together. The seat cushions are firm but still soft. It\u2019s the perfect size for apartments but I would say too small for a home.Cons: The back cushions are quite thin and they don\u2019t have the same firmness as the seats. You can definitely feel the metal backing when you lay back (this is where I dock 0.5 star). But a few additional cushions solved that problem.Tip: I found that when putting together the ottoman, it\u2019s actually easier to attach the legs to the baseboard first and then build the side boards around it. When I did what they instructed, the resulting box shape was very wonky and the baseboard wouldn\u2019t fit.Overall, a decent couch that gets the job done at an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "You get want you pay for! This couch kind of looks nice from a distant. The seating and back cushions are very thing. You sit on it at your own risk. Don't let anyone sit on it that is heavy sitters, like fall to a seating position. It's more like shophouse seating that nobody sits on, just looks nice. Pretty color and the ottoman is fine, in fact its cushion is probably the puffiest cushion.The seller and their customer service were wonderful.i would buy from the seller again. So couch 3.5 starts and customer service 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Seat cushions are surprisingly comfortable. Back cushions and ottoman cushion are a bit thin and haven\u2019t fully expanded which gives a less than fitted look with fabric. Not sure it will get better with time? But looks stylish when throw pillows are added. Seems like it will last a few years for two college girls but wouldn\u2019t expect it to work for heavy family use.",
