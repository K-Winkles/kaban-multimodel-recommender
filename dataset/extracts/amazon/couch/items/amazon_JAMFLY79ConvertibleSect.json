                "reviewText": "I have a pretty small living room and not a huge budget. I knew I was taking a risk ordering such a cheap couch and its fine. There's nothing great about it but nothing bad either. Assembly was really quick and easy, I did it myself in about 10 minutes. The back cushions are really thin and you can feel the back board but I stuffed them with some polyfill and that helped a lot. It's smaller than I expected as well, the seats aren't very deep so if you're tall that might be an issue. Overall, its a good couch for the price, but extremely mediocre in comparison to others.",

So, for tall or heavier people it might feel like sitting on a big floor pillow because the furniture is kind of short. I got the couch in grey! Absolutely compliments the set up I have and is easy to clean. Easy to readjust. Thank you!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Mundane \"Get What You Paid For\" Type Deal",
                "reviewText": "I wouldn't say there is anything outstanding or unique about this couch. It definitely is for small places on a tight budget, and you'll get what you paid for. Although the amount for this couch in total is a little less than a paycheck for me, it is below average for the couch market (at least from what I can see). So I guess \"You get what you paid for\" has to be entirely subjective in this circumstance. I do like the light khaki color of the couch that was exactly as it was described and expected, and it was by far the easiest thing I put together in my new place. However, the seats are pretty small, small enough that I find myself more comfortable sitting on the area rug I've placed beneath the couch, using it as a backrest. Not to say that I can't sit on them, but it doesn't feel as comfortable as most couches I've experienced in my life. The whole \"sectional\" thing tripped me up, and I didn't expect that an ottoman would be attached to the main couch to make up the \"sectional\" part advertised. That was my fault for not paying attention and not the seller. I wasn't disappointed in that part anyways since the ottoman never strays away from the main couch since it is velcroed together. Overall, if there is one thing I learned from buying furniture for the first time, just spend the money on the thing you actually want instead of settling for the low-end stuff. If you really don't care about what couch you get, sure, get this one. But if you don't want to just tolerate your couch and actually love it, I would look elsewhere.",

The legs are plastic and the pillows are all different sizes. My 5\u20198 husband looks like a giant on this tiny couch. All of the pillow packaging came in an air tight bags completely squished to fit in the box. Once opening the box and seeing the bad quality of the product and size, I attempted to start a return but then the seller told me it needed to be in the original packaging and I would have to pay $100 for the item to be shipped back to them. The box was incredibly small and unless you\u2019re gonna airtight the pillows and all again, it\u2019s not going to fit in the box again. Its extremely disappointing and I wish I had never thrown my money away like this especially in a time of moving! Invest in better quality couches if you can or go somewhere else. This is not it!",

                "reviewText": "After recently moving long distance I was in need of living room seating with room for myself & 2 boys, but the budget was tight. I scoped Craigslist & FB marketplace but not only were most of the offerings not to my taste (plus the potential concerns of cleanliness/odors), but I have no way of moving a large piece of furniture by myself, so I decided to bite the bullet and order something that could be delivered.I looked at several options for the L shape design I wanted, and was hoping for one with storage in the ottoman and/or sleeper option, but those options alone doubled/tripled the price point, so I passed on them. Of the remaining sofas this one had the highest rating for comfort with a large number of reviews, as well as being affordable. This was super important to me due to chronic pain issues. The manufacturer\u2019s description specifically noted a thicker cushion and spring base, which both suggested actual functional comfort.The sofa arrived in two large but manageable boxes very quickly. The parts assemble easily via v shaped brackets already mounted on the various components that slide into each other. There was only one piece of hardware: a metal plate with two bolts that bridges the two back pieces. The legs are black plastic cones that screw straight in; they seem rather lightweight but easily replaceable if so desired. Altogether it took may 15 minutes to unpack & assemble. One thing I was a little disappointed to see is that the springs in the base pieces were flat, s shape springs that lay horizontal, as opposed to vertical coil shape springs which is what I imagined. The cushions were all the vacuum sealed foam that is common now, and quickly inflated when packaging was opened. Another detail that is a little concerning is the upholstery fabric appears on the thin side, a sort of synthetic velour which I am thinking will not wear well (I am hoping it doesn\u2019t easily tear). One detail I was pleasantly surprised by was that the pillow covers not only unzip for cleaning, but they also came with a Velcro strip along the length of them to stabilize them. This has been one of the drawbacks I previously observed with sectional furniture is cushions/components that slide apart, so between the brackets and the Velcro, once the sofa is assembled it feels stable & secure.The important part- comfort. The cushions are pleasantly firm, but not hard. The back cushions are soft, and extend well over the back rest, which is good because the backrest (and armrests) have virtually no padding. You will definitely need a couple of throw pillows for lounging/comfortable TV watching. So far my sons & I have all sat comfortably together and are enjoying it. Overall I would safely give it a 4 star rating; my biggest concern is it\u2019s durability. I will come back in the future and adjust my score accordingly, but as of right now I am pleased with the purchase & value.",
