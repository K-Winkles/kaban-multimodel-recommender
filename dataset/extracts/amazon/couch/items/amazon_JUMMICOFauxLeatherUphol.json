                "reviewText": "This is a great futon for its price and it was very easy to assemble. The only issue I had with it was putting the cup holder in the middle as the screws it comes with aren't exactly long enough for it to nicely fit into the middle. It is a simple fix though as I just went to Lowes and got a longer screw for one of the sides and since I have done that, I have not had any issues. The (head rest/arm rest/back) rest does not stay in place and you can move them around wherever which I like because you can place it in a place for wherever it fits your needs best. It is not the most comfortable place to lay on but it works for having guests over for a night or two. I am overall happy with this product and I'd recommend this futon for whoever has a lot of guest over or even to someone who is just looking for a good size futon for their smaller apartment or room. Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for furniture for their apartment or home.",

                "reviewText": "This sofa futon sits like 6\u201d off the ground and the cushion is only like 3\u201d thick. It might work in a kids room but if any adult sits on it your knees are up around your head when sitting. The cushions always fall off the sofa while seated. Also, if you are or your guest is over 5\u20195\u201d, there legs will hang off the end. Also, not comfortable to lay down.This is so misleading.Also, if you get it and don\u2019t like it, you have to pay the shipping to return it and the thing weighs like 50 lbs, so it could cost $150 for postage. Also, the futon will never fit back in the original box.We put it together, realized it was way to small for a couch for us and attempted to return.This is a 3rd party and not an Amazon product so when we tried return it. They apologize d but said they don\u2019t pay returns if we don\u2019t like it. I told them it was too small and they said sorry and we would have to pay for all postage back which will be hundreds of dollars.If I had it to do again, I would go to a brick and mortar store and buy a futon being that these are soooo misleading.I am 100% not happy with this.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was so excited to put this together. 1 page instructions and came with everything I need. I got to the middle piece with the cup holder and... It doesn't fit. It doesn't reach the other slide piece to secure it. So it ends up being like a car. You know how usually the middle goes with one side of the seat when you fold it down? Yeah like that. Beautiful material and design otherwise. I'm just terrified if I put the cupholder up someone is gonna sit and lean back and break that middle piece off.It's shorter than the photo appeared. Very low to the ground but it's a fouton so guess I should have known. The pillows I thought would attach somehow for some reason but they are loose and take up more space on the sides than the photo makes it look. They are also pretty flat so not good for resting arms (which I should have known from the photos they are more for the laying down and using as an actual pillow maybe). Took a minute to find them they were inside the zippers underneath along with the middle piece. Overall it took about 30 minutes to put together and was VERY simple. I did it alone. Tipped the box upside down to get it out. Came folded. Just had to add legs and accessories which was awesome. It's pretty easy to move around. Not too heavy. Ugh I would be so happy if that middle piece just fit right.",
