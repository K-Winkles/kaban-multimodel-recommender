        "description": "Shahoo Convertible Folding Futon Sofa Bed Sleeper Couch Q1: What's it made of? A1:Unlike cotton sofas, this sofa is upholstered in faux leather, which is delicate and soft to the touch and easy to clean, but not as warm as cotton sofas, so it is recommended to use it with cotton cushions. Q2: What are its dimensions? A2:The longest side of this sofa is 65\", if you are taller than this, you will need to curl up when sleeping on it, which is a slight inconvenience, so we recommend that you use it with an ottoman. Q3: How much weight can it support? A3:It has been tested to have a load bearing capacity of around 500lbs and is perfectly capable of taking two people sitting on it. Q4: How can I use it? A4:Once installed, just use a little force to slowly straighten its backrest and lower the small table with cup holder in the centre, and he becomes a sofa for two people, on which you can sit and chat with your friends and enjoy your leisure time! Q5: Why can't I find the couch leg part or the cup holder part?? A5:You can look for them on the back of the sofa, some of the parts are in the back of the sofa.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s amazing, comfy, stylish for a game room or lounging space! It was easy to put together\u2026once I found the directions. They were inside the bottom of the couch in the zippered pockets along with the pillows and the cup holder cushion. It\u2019s all there but the first direction tells you to turn it upside down to put the legs on, but without the directions you wouldn\u2019t know that. Thats my only complaint. Hope that helps if anyone like me couldn't figure out where the directions and other cushions were. Other than that it sits and lays well, I would still use my own pillow if laying here, but it\u2019s not too bad just using the ones that come with it. It\u2019s big enough for guys to feel comfortable in the seats (seat leg room is nice) and the cup holder cushion blends well plus it\u2019s actually better quality for the entire item than I even thought. Highly recommend!\ud83d\udc4djust flip it over and unzip for instructions\ud83d\ude05",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- detailed instruction- cute blue screws- straightforward to assemble- comfortable cushionCons:- where do I start- the left front foot screws do not tighten up so the foot wouldn't stay in place.- back left foot screw holes do not align. Meaning i can tighten one, but the other doesn't fit cause the holes on the futon itself is closer than the holes in the foot- the left back rest is flimsy. Doesn't stand right up like the right back rest.- the middle cupholder screw holes doesn't align with the holes in the back rest. I was only able to put one screw.I had so much hope for this futon. I'm so disappointed that it doesn't work the way it's supposed to be. Amazon offered to refund 30% and I can keep this, but I don't think that's justifiable with how much damages there are. They offer to replace with a new futon. I was gonna take this but upon seeing the damage in the cupholder part, I'd rather go get a different one.",

The price was right and aesthetically it looks better than most futons since I really didn't want my office to look like a college dorm but still wanted the ability to use it as a spare bedroom if necessary. Setup wasn't terrible. It's really small though. I'm 6'1\", but even somebody who was 5'5\" feet would hang off the edge while sleeping on this. When it's flipped into a couch it also feels really small. It would be completely uncomfortable if didn't have a bench in front of it to kick my feet up on. It is what it is, you get what you pay for. I'm not totally displeased with it but given the option over again I probably would have kept shopping for something else if I'd of taken into account how small it really is.",

The futons arrived early and were fairly easy to assemble. The futons do look nice and seem well built the problem is they are extremely small.Although the seller does give measurements it is difficult to realize how tiny these are until you sit in them or see someone sitting in them. The futons would probable be fine if you had a play room for small children but they do not work for teen boys or adults.I would recommend that the seller include a photo of an average size person sitting on the futon in the description.",

It sits low and the back isn't high, so some people might not like that its not a normal size couch. Its great for a kids room or game room couch. because of its height I wouldn't recommend as a normal living room couch.Also when it arrived the put the instructions, pillows, and middle cup holders inside the couch. Just unzip and they should be in there.",
