The picture gives it the feel that you\u2019re going to get a comfy little couch with thick pillows and coushins but the reality is you\u2019re going to get a flat lumpy block for everything. The fabric is very scratchy over all extremely dissatisfied and will be returning",

I will say she didn't ask for no type of help, but then she is a farm girl. The cushions don't look to be to much and would not think it would be as comfortable as it is. I will lay down and fall asleep on it and I have a thing about napping on couch. Appearance is more a modern look with frame being metal it is solid. Fabric reminds me of a good pair of wore in dinem jeans that you always love to wear. When I get more money I'm getting another for my basement bar.",

                "reviewText": "It was fairly easy to assemble. But if you try to pick it up, it basically falls apart. It\u2019s not very comfortable. I would definitely not recommend buying this if you want comfort. It\u2019s good for a small apartment. It\u2019s probably good for a college kid. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you\u2019re somebody that likes to hang out on the couch and watch TV. When you try to push the cushions in the entire couch, feels like it\u2019s going to break in to two pieces. The back cushions do not seem to be as tall as they are in the picture. Because of my birthing situation, I missed the window to return it. If I could return it, I would. Now I have just stuck with it.",
