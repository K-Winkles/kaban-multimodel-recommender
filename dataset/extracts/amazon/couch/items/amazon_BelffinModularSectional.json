I was missing two of the brackets I needed, so I reached out to the vendor. They got back to me quickly and sent the two brackets I needed within a day! They kept in communication with me and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience.As for the couch, there is storage for days. It\u2019s very firm but we kind of like that and the color is stunning. The fabric is soft and easy to clean. We chose this couch so we could add to it once we get a bigger place, and none of us regret the decision. It\u2019s the same width as our old couch but adding the ottomans means all three of us can sit and the dogs can too.",

                "reviewText": "This went together in a snap. Very easy assembly. I weigh 330lbs and have slept on this for a few nights before my new bed arrived at my new apartment. I was VERY pleasantly surprised that there was so much support. At no time did I feel the frame or anything while I was side sleeping on it. As far as modular couches go this is very good quality. I would place this better than any modular they offer for 3 reasons. Cost, storage and durability. It's still to early to tell how well it will hold up but so far I have no doubt it will be fine. As a very large man I have a way of coaxing furniture to fail quickly if it's gonna fail. This is recommended highly. I'll likely buy a chair kit for this soon too.",

That being said, I did take off a star because there are a lot of thread strings hanging from the cushions. I'm not sure how they are going to hold up. I'm trying to find the best solution to see if I can get rid of them myself without compromising the seam quality. Other than that, the cushions pretty much came assembled and are very sturdy and firm (but comfortable,) and they have plenty of storage underneath; the fabric is easy to clean crumbs/cat hair (I have 4 cats.)",

I love that you can change the arrangement when it fancies you. Buy this, you will not be disappointed.",

I purchased the sleeper sofa 2, it came in six big boxes, it was very easy to assemble, the manufacturer gives you screw driver tool, not those annoying little L shaped things but an actual screw driver. The instructions are easy to follow and stress free. The couch is very comfortable and I love that each seat has a storage.",

The only thing is I wish the cushions were a little deeper but with the additional ottomans to make the sectional U shape or L shape this makes up for that :) it\u2019s also doggy approved! 10/10 recommend!",
