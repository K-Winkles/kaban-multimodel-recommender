                "reviewText": "I was very hesitant buy a couch online without trying it. But the stores had a long wait time for purchase. So we pulled the trigger, & we LOVE THIS COUCH!PROS-stability- sturdyFirmness- firm I like bc after a year I do expect it to become softer with people sitting on the couch. So it is keeping the longevity. After people sit on a couch is starts to wear down so I like that this came firm.Weight- typical couch weight not too heavy, wil need1-2 people to assemble.Performance -great comfortable, sturdy, supports well.Washable covers- loved that the covers come off. The only cover that doesn't come off is to the cup holder built in.Appearance- beautiful! The only thing I will tell you is that the color is like a dark gray blue. It is a gray color- but when the light hits it kinda looks dark blue, But it is a gray.Seller support -they have been outstanding with communication. I received my items different days and I was confused and thought they may have forgotten the other box but they didn't and responded with great manners and provided all info needed.Con- color is a little different then pictured but it is a different shade of gray.Should you buy this couch? - YES! If your on a budget (we were not) or not on a budget I think you will love this couch! For the price it was a good deal. I highly recommend purchasing the warranty.",

                "reviewText": "FYI, this comes in three massive boxes. I got this delivered after I had surgery and thought my teen could load the boxes in the car to get to our apartment, no way. Two grown men had to team carry them in. They\u2019re prob more than 50-75lbs.I love this couch though. Very sturdy, even for someone weighing +200lbs, and its huge! The open mechanism for the storage doesn\u2019t slam shut, it does one of those slow close type of things. Quite simple to put together. Great buy, def recommend.",
