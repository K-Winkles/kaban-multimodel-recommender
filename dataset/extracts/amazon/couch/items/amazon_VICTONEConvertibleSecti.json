I wanted to send it back right then but one box was very heavy and I'm 62yrs old, not in great shape and couldn't see myself managing to get it to the place for return. After assembling it, it's very very small and does not look like the picture at all. Cheap cheap cheap. Afraid to even sit on it. Plastic legs, cushions are not fluffy like the picture depicted. Very disappointed. If there was a way to vacuum seal the cushions and get it all in original box I would definitely be sending it back. To top it off I bought through Affirm so I'm paying inverter on it as well. Save your money. Buy a couch you can see and feel first.",

We were looking for a cheap couch for our first apartment and this was definitely a good choice. It wouldnt be very comfy to sleep on but for just lounging its pretty comfy. I don\u2019t recommend getting this if your over 5 feet tall as it is really small. But just make sure you read the measurements. There is a weird black stripe on the bottom front of the couch that wasn\u2019t pictured but ive just chosen to ignore it. I also want to note that if you clean up a stain pretty fast it doesnt stain. The first time we sat on it my boyfriend spilled buffalo sauce on it we just rubbed it with warm water and it came right out! Overall pretty good first couch.",

You can see in my pictures how they look after more then a week of recieving the couch. The seat cushions were vacuum packed so they did actually get bigger but the back cushions are still uncomfortably thin. I also failed to consider the seat depth and back height but that's my fault for not checking the measurements. I would also recommend getting some pillows for the armrest as they are not comfortable. Also I was able to assemble this myself without much issue.",

If you are looking for a couch for your kids playroom ages 2-10 or if you need a SMALL couch that's low to the ground this is for you! I don't recommend for an office or for anyone above 5 feet 3 inches, or only because it's small and low to the ground. I don't like the plastic legs either. The cushions and material are very good. I can tell you that the company is very pleasant to deal with and since this couch wasn't for me, I contacted them and let them know I needed to return it and they responded immediately and sent me the labels/instructions for return quickly. So I would give it 5 stars for a kids couch and for a kids room or playroom and/or small person couch but no stars for adults over 5 ft 3 inches. There you have it!",

I absolutely do not recommend purchasing it as an adult, even if you have a small apartment or small living room. The cushions are firm and uncomfortable. Our standard size coffee table is taller than the seating. The seat is also too narrow for an adult. I'm 5'4\" and my legs hang off the end of the chaise. 1/10 stars.",
