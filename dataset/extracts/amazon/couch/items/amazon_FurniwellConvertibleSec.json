                "reviewText": "Like many others, I wasn\u2019t expecting much for the price of this couch. We just needed something to sit/sleep on for my mother\u2019s place. I am very happy with this purchase!This couch was easy to put together and is comfortable. It is firm, but not hard like a rock. If you want more softness, a few throw pillows help. My 6\u2019 tall son sleeps on it with no complaints.I was worried that it was going to be too low, but it\u2019s fine for an average height person. If you need support to get up, this is not for you. The arms are basically cushions.I was also concerned about the material but it looks quite nice in person, and is easy to clean (already had to clean paint off of it with no trouble). I like that you can re-configure it, even though it only \u201clocks\u201d in the shown U shape. Who knows how long this will last, but for the price, it\u2019s fabulous. It seems sturdy enough, but if you\u2019ve got active kids, it might not hold up as long.Overall it\u2019s a great buy for the price! We used the coupon so it was $400 before tax. We\u2019ve already had an guest ask us for the link so they can buy it too.",

The zippers on the cushions have already broken, causing the filling to spill out. The size of the couch is smaller than advertised, leaving barely enough room for two people to sit comfortably. The cushions themselves are incredibly stiff and uncomfortable, providing no back support. Worst of all, the Velcro attachments used to combine the chaise pillows and couch sections are a different size, so they do not properly stay connected. I had high hopes for this couch, but it is poorly made and constructed. Within just a few days, the failing zippers, inadequate size, lack of comfort, and mismatching Velcro attachments have demonstrated this couch will not hold up to regular use. I cannot recommend this uncomfortable, poorly designed furniture.",

It's way bigger than I thought, my husband and I are able to comfortably watch a movie together.One thing is, reviews said cushions/pillows were flat. I fluffed my pillows and they were perfect, besides the left corner. I opened the zipper and found a hole in the \"netting\" and missing stuffing. just check your pillow(s) in case it seems flatter than usual. I used some extra stuffing from a spare pillow and it's looking good now.Overall, we love the couch. So far it has been pretty sturdy, comfy, and spacious for only 500 dollars!",

                "reviewText": "First off, I would like to say, to the people that said the assembly was awful, I put the couch together without the instructions. It was the easiest piece of furniture I\u2019ve EVER put together.Secondly, yes, it is cheap so you get what you pay for, BUT this is a really great couch for a single person or couples without kids OR if you\u2019re just on a budget. The last couch I purchased was almost 3k and this was so much cheaper.Third, the backs are a TINY bit flat but you can always get filling for it to your liking. There are springs in the cushions, they\u2019re not bad. Couch does need to rest to plump up. So I would give it at least 24 hours before sitting. Just like anything that\u2019s been vacuumed sealed.Just to be spicy, to the lady that that posted the couch seat all side ways. Imma tell everyone right now, it don\u2019t do that. It literally Velcros in place. LMAO get it, don\u2019t get it. But I\u2019m glad I did.",

I am a smaller woman, I had to call somebody to come and help me carry the boxes upstairs because they use FedEx and lazy shippers. I would send it back but that\u2019s a lot to tear down and move again so I\u2019ll just deal with it but I\u2019m not happy I do not recommend buying this couch to anybody save yourself The $400 and go to the furniture store and buy something useful.",

It feels like a rock .No support on back cushions they are completely flat. Tried reaching out to seller to remedy the issue no response whatsoever. Heard from other reviewers that it cost more to return than the actual price of the couch and you don't get refund so that option is out....would like for the company to reach out to me to correct this situation all these bad reviews its getting can't be good for business. For the record I did not see the bad reviews until AFTER the purchase. So buyer beware this couch is awful !!!",
