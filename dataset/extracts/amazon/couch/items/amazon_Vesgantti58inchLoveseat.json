The seat cushions are comfortable but could use a little extra padding as it gets a little stiff after sitting on the couch for a while - we added a blanket on the cushions and that helps a lot. The only real complaint I would have is that one of the arms pops up a lot like it's going to come off and needs to be pushed back into the base. If you're careful it shouldn't be a problem but I'm not sure how it will hold up long term. Overall really happy with this purchase and would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Genuinely happy with the product I received and I rarely write reviews. So when I am impressed by a product, I take the time to write back about it.I was really surprised at how good the quality was for such a cheap couch. You usually can't touch a good quality couch for under $300-400 unless you get it used. This couch is soft and easy to assemble. There is a gap underneath so it's easy to clean underneath. It's comfy. I put together the couch alone. It comes in about 4 main pieces (back panel, 2 side panels, bottom half of couch), 2 cushions, 2 small side arm pillows, and 4 legs (with screws). Each of the main pieces slide into place via metal grooves and are well hidden once the actual couch is assembled fully.It's pretty light weight for a couch. Put some furniture sliders on it and it moves around with ease on hardwood floors. I lay down on it and while it's not enough room to fully lay as it is a loveseat, it does have enough room to lay with legs curled up. It feels pretty sturdy although I've only had for half a month. We'll see if it holds up over time. It feels like it sits about as high as most normal couches. The color is so pretty as well!I would definitely buy it again if I ever moved or needed another couch. I do wish there was a 3 seater version as it could probably fit 3 people if you crammed together and removed the small side pillows but as it's not made for that, it doesn't really affect the review of the actual product. I would definitely get a 3 seater of this if they made it.",

                "reviewText": "Very pretty sort of bright indigo blue color, lovely short soft velvet texture, quite easy to put together just screw in legs and slot the arms and back on. Its the perfect size, literally, fits 2 people quite comfortably with a little bit of space in between still, or a person and cat even more comfortably haha. Came nicely packaged but easy to unwrap and find all (not too many) parts. Really love the quality for money here its a super winner!Is firm-ish, but in a lovely way, because it still feels like soft memory foam, you just dont sink down to the depths, we fall asleep on it all the time, the armrest are the perfect height for support but dont get in the way and it has a very generously deep seat, especially if you remove the back cushions, but we havent even had to do that and we still have so much seating room.I know im gushing but for the price this couch could cost like 200$ more i feel, especially if you found it in a store, and it just looks classy. (picture is of it just unwrapped so there are some wrinkles in velvet, but it expands a bit and those go away and it settles)Literally no sacrifices here people, buy it!",

The sofa is beautifully made, with a sleek and modern design that perfectly complements my living room d\u00e9cor. The velvet fabric is soft and luxurious, and the tufted back adds a touch of sophistication.The sofa is also very comfortable to sit on.The seat and cushions are filled with high-density sponge, which provides excellent support and pressure relief. I can easily spend hours sitting on this sofa without feeling any discomfort. Another great thing about this sofa is that it is very easy to assemble. All I had to do was screw on the legs, and it was ready to go in less than 10 minutes. Overall, I am extremely happy with the Sofa. It is a stylish, comfortable, and well-made piece of furniture that is perfect for any home. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new loveseat. Here are some of the pros and cons of the Loveseat Sofa: Pros: Stylish and modern design Soft and luxurious velvet fabric Comfortable to sit on Easy to assemble Cons:The velvet fabric can be difficult to keep clean Overall, I believe that the pros of the Sofa outweigh the cons. It is a great value for the price, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish loveseat.",

Also the back only goes up a third of the way up my back. Who designs a couch like that? If it's not against a wall this couch would be unusable in my opinion. Even so the right armrest moves. Very firm, which I knew going in, so I can't complain much about that. The armrests and the back rest are the weak links .( Kind of important.) Also the back cushions are still wrinkled after three days. I don't think I'm being overly picky on these points. It is an attractive, cute couch as everyone seems to agree. I guess this is what $300 buys you.",
