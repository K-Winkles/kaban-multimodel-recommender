It is pretty easy and straight forward to assemble but make sure you attach the back of the couch correctly. The seat cushions in my opinion are very comfortable. It looks great in any space and I love it! It does come apart in 3 pieces too which makes it easy for future moving and storage! Despite it being a white couch I haven\u2019t had any issues removing any minor stains. The only downsides are that the back cushions are more flat and the cushions do slide around. This can be easily fixed with some Velcro and additional stuffing or pillows. It arrives in 3 heavier packages and mine did arrive on separate days despite saying they were all delivered. However, the seller responded quickly and provided me with all 3 tracking numbers when I asked. Great purchase! Can\u2019t beat the price.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the layout of the couch and the color is beautiful! I plan on washing the covers to get the wrinkles out and the packing smell. The seat cushions are firm and similar to an Ikea couch. The back cushions are more like cheap pillows but for the price I can\u2019t complain about it too much. Overall a really decent couch for the price and was pretty easy to put together by myself!",

The bottom cushions are so thin you can feel the springs easily. The velcro on one armrest is already ripping off and its only been a month. The cushions shift all over the place which really impacts how comfortable it is. I would not buy this again. I feel like there are other budgey friendly options out there",
