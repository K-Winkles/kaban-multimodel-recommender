We have bought generic ink in the past and never had greta luck with photos lasting more than a year or two, especially if its on a wall and gets indirect sunlight.Very happy with our MX922 printer. For big print jobs we go to Costco, but one offs are done at home. I have compared prints from Costco and at home with this ink and the quality is on the same level. We do use a premium Ilford lustre paper. Regular black ink printouts look perfect.I gave this 4 stars because of the price. We go through a lot of ink cartridges but we do print a few pictures a week. I'd give it 5 stars if we could print at home for almost as cheap as Costco.",
