                "reviewText": "I agree with previous users. While i had no problem setting this printer up and printing. As soon as I cancelled my account when the free time period was up my printer would no longer print. I resigned up and it prints like a charm. I cancelled it again a month ago and bang same thing. I cannot print no matter what I do. Signed up again for the 0.99/ month plan and was instantly able to print again . I do not want to be held captive by this company. As soon as I can I will buy another printer. I am not going to pay even 0.99 a month just to keep a printer active and support something that is such a rip off!Update on this \u2014- after much research you can use this printer after you cancel your instant ink or paper membership. You do need to set up an account to set up printer. What they do not make clear is that the ink cartridges included in the box are special.(they say instant ink on them). Once your free 6 months is up you need to either sign up for one of their plans to continue using these cartridges. They communicate with HP as to when to send you more ink. If you cancel the plan the communication stops immediately and the ink cartridges will not print. Its not the printer its the cartridges. If you decide to not pay for an ink membership you must take out the original ink cartridges (throw them out) and replace with regular HP ink cartridges for your specific printer. This was not originally made clear when I bought this printer, but this last time when I cancelled the plan they asked me to confirm that I understood the instant ink cartridges would not work and I would not be able to print with out replacing the cartridges etc. I am no longer on their plan and I am printing fine with this printer.",

Yeah. Beware guys when your protection runs out.Pros: prints silently but slow and I don\u2019t mind. HP app was already I stalled so no issue there. Just had to add it all via the app. Quality and details are almost neck and neck with the HP6055e. Prints well on matte. Thick paper, vinyl sticker paper and I\u2019m in love.Cons: slow to print but normal pace I think since it\u2019s going across the page.",

                "reviewText": "So, let\u2019s start with the pros.1: it came the next day, so crazy fast shipping.2: The printing speed is insanely fast as well.3: The print quality is the best I\u2019ve seen on a home printer, and is even better than many office printers I\u2019ve used.4: I love scanning a picture and being able to see it on my computer screen to make sure everything is lined up right before I waste ink printing, only to find something looks off. It\u2019s also convenient for when I need to email a document, as opposed to printing.Now, the reasons I can\u2019t recommend it.1: it won\u2019t stay online, and support said something along the lines of it\u2019s because my router needs to be tuned down, or I\u2019m not close enough to it for the printer to stay online.I have no idea how to slow down the router, and considering I pay good money for fast, reliable internet, why would I?? Second, the printer is literally right next to the router. When it advertises that I can remote print, but it won\u2019t print when I\u2019m three inches away....I researched it, and this appears to be a fairly common problem for this printer. Unplugging it works to wake it up, but that\u2019s getting really annoying, really fast.2: It drinks ink. I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019ve had tons of printers over the years, and I understand an ink cartridge never lasts long, but I printed 15 colored pages, and it\u2019s already out of ink. And ten of them weren\u2019t even blue, which is the main color it was supposed to be. They came out pink because my brand new ink cartridge only had enough cyan for five pages. That\u2019s insane to me, as the image only filled half the page. I did sign up for the HP ink program, and I\u2019m seriously hoping I don\u2019t get burned on it because my printer won\u2019t stay online, which is one of the conditions to get the ink. I can\u2019t afford to buy full priced ink cartridges for this thing, so if they refuse to honor the subscription, I just wasted $160.Considering the price, I definitely don\u2019t think I got my money\u2019s worth. I\u2019m going to keep it, as shipping it back would be a nightmare, and I do love some of the features, but when this printer inevitably breaks down, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be getting another one.Edit one month laterIt doesn\u2019t print 90% of the time, and there\u2019s absolutely no reason given why it doesn\u2019t. What should take me seconds to print requires a minimum of three hours of hitting print over and over and over!! I\u2019ve never been so frustrated with a product in my life.If it\u2019s not filled to the top with paper, it considers it low, and even if there are 50 pages in the drawer and you only need to print one, sorry kid, quit being lazy and fill it up. Again.It constantly goes off line, and I have to unplug it and plug it in to get it back online.And forget about remote printing! 6 feet away from the physical printer is considered remote!! And that\u2019s apparently an issue, so I literally have to sit directly in front of the printer, and have my HP laptop touching it.PRINTING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS FLIPPING HARD!Do yourself a favor and purchase a printer that can actually print the first time. Wish I had. Gotta start saving money for one that actually works. Thanks HP!!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to use on a ChromeOS computer. The process was fairly simply, you need to use the HP app on your phone, I wish you could have used the computer browser instead which makes this process a bit more complicated. The setup process took about 10 minutes ( after the app was installed on the phone ). Tested printing single sided, double sided, color, b&w, scanning and all worked rather well. The screen on the printer is different and will take some getting used to. There is a b&w and a tri-color cartridge, I suppose since it uses a tri-color cartridge you will save money because you do not have to purchased three different color cartridges however it one of the three colors runs out then the entire cartridge will need to be replaced instead of replacing that one color. Also, if the cartridge expires then it will be cheaper to buy the single tri-color cartridge. Wireless printing was rather quick to get to the printer, the actually printing is rather slow however this is a low end printer and I knew the about the printing speeds. All in all if you need a basic wireless color printer ( auto duplex ), scanner and copier for ChomeOS this should be fine as along as you do not need to print a lot within a month and have patience for the printing speed, all in all for low end printing I would recommend this printer.",

                "reviewText": "When my hp 7640 developed a paper jam I couldn't find, I decided to replace it. After days of reading reviews, taking cost and shipping in mind, I decided on the 6455. When I unpacked I was impressed on it being smaller and lighter then the 7640. Hp have been my printer of choice for decades but if this current tech continues, I'll be finding a different brand name. Instead of a good menu this one had buttons lit in different colors and a light around the bottom. The color light around the bottom flashes in different colors specifying different function working properly. I spent hours trying to get it connected, the ink registered and at the end the printer would not print. Luckily after watching U-Tube Hp fix video's, I watched a fix paper jam of a different make of printer where it was suggested to shake the printer when it was upside down.",

                "reviewText": "I was 50/50 on purchasing this printer since the reviews were mixed. The print quality and ease of use is pretty good. The set up on the otherhand is this. 1. Online will tell you that the set up is best done with a mobile phone. Well, it was not for me (iPhone user). I guess it depends what type of phone you have. Took me several tries on my phone and gave up after 30mins to an hour or so. I was determined to have this printer set up so I tried the desktop option. Within 10-15mins, everything was set up, and done. By the way, if you happen to reach the point where you need a \"password\", it's a whole other process to get that. So I suggest to look on YouTube, and there is a gentleman who will walk you through it. In the end, I didn't need it after trying to set up the printer via desktop instead of mobile phone. I am pretty happy with the printer and quality so far. Not sure how long the ink will last, pending on each customers usage. And for those who said that the light stays on, yes it does - but there is a power button at the back of the printer that will shut down the light and power if it bothers you so much.",
