We have gone through 2 instant print cameras, and he loves them but the film gets expensive fast.My husband saw this and we decided to give it as a Christmas present. My son LOVES it. So far we have only used the non-adhesive paper but I am very impressed with the print quality. It isn't perfect by any means, but you can tell who the person in the picture is and it helps cut down on him wanting to go to the big box store to print as often.It does a good job of printing lists as well.It is easy to figure out. I did have to google to figure out which app I had to download for it, but not a big deal. He uses my phone mostly to print, but can also use his iPad. He figured out how to print and edit pictures (crop, lighten, etc.) on his own fairly quickly.Overall would recommend.",

As my photo shows, increasing contrast and adjusting brightness can really make a difference.I got it with 6 rolls of plain paper figuring I can order sticker / adhesive paper if I decide I want to make stickers with it, given the limited lifespan of things printed on a thermal printer I hesitate to use it for journaling - but it would be convenient for place labels in a travel journal.It works with the phomemo App, it comes up as M02L and connecting via Bluetooth was a snap.Overall, glad I picked this up, having fun with it and getting good use out of it.",

However after a few uses I find that I do not bother using this for either of those. I have looked for additional sticker paper to achieve this goal and been unsuccessful. I plan to research it more in hopes of resolving these issues. Set up with super easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "Got this as a present for a tween, with no real expectations. The logic was that being able to print selfies and other images that kids can share with their friends, on the fly, would be something neat. My kid loved it! The printer is very compact, which is great. When using it for the first time, finding out how to open it to install the paper roll is very tricky, as there are almost no markings or text on the case. The main problem is that the included instructions are poorly written and not comprehensive at all, so there is definitely a fair learning curve involved!The second problem is that the app needed to use the printer is not terribly polished, not to mention that the instructions don't mention how to obtain it... I believe the developers meant for users to read the printer's manual using the app, but I was unable to actually access the manual, after clicking many times on the corresponding menu in the app. The app works but it feels like it isn't quite finished yet.Thankfully, printing images from the phone or the web is straightforward and works. The first time printing, nothing showed up on the paper, so after a few tries, I realized that I inserted the paper with the printing side facing the wrong way. Once this was fixed, printing was fast and of fairly good quality.I like that the printer comes with lots of paper rolls, which allows beginner users to play with the various features and explore how to use the printer. Once I was comfortable with it, I gave a brief tutorial to my child and they were able to get going right away. Pairing the printer to a phone via Bluetooth was easy and fast, **but** it had to be done through the app itself, and location access is required (??)All in all, this is a decent product, much better on the hardware side than the software , but usable, after a while exploring and trialing. The app could be better and the included manual is of extremely limited value, so if you are not a patient/curious kind of person, you may want to look elsewhere. This product has a notable learning curve! IF a better app was available, it would be a great buy.",
