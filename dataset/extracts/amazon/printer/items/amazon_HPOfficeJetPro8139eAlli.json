The printer does a great job of printing and also copying and scanning. Installation and setup were relatively easy. We subscribe to the HP ink service which automatically monitors the printer status online and sends us new cartridges as needed. This is perfect for us since we never have to worry about ink drying out from disuse or running out under heavy use. We had an earlier model of this printer for a number of years that served us well until it started showing its age.",

Easy step by step installation with accurate instructions. You don't have to guess. Make sure that you read the operating system your printer support before you purchase. That can make a huge difference. The installation allowed me to use the replacement of the previous HP 3830 free plan with this one. I've faxed and printed so far. I will never by another brand of printers. I tried an Epson before I bought this one and quickly gave it away, and found this one.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased HP OfficeJet Pro 8139e in order to print remote. Have always owned Canon but thought I would give HP a try. WRONG. I was unable to set the printer up on my own. Went to HP website and went through troubleshooting unsuccessfully. Called support line and of course on hold for over hour. Finally got with technician. She was helpful but had me unplugging all connections. Even computer to router. After several attempts, she finally took over my computer remotely and turned off all of my antivirus. Another hour or so and she finally said it would print from computer, but HP Smart would not work remotely while antivirus was on...who doesn't run antivirus these days??? Anyway, we gave up and I can only print from computer. Problem now is the Wi-Fi not working from computer, I assume from disconnecting all the wires. OMG. So, after printing a couple of documents, I find that print quality is POOR. I am trying now to reconnect by old printer and return this junk. Will NOT replace with HP this time!",

                "reviewText": "This printer is a win from HP. I have been an Instant Ink subscriber for well over 7 years now (with the same medium-use HP printer!) Because of a lightning strike/power outtage I kept getting a bad printhead warning on the screen and decided it was time for an upgrade. Found this one with the free year (and $100 off!) up to 700 pages/mo and thought that had to be for new subscribers only but it's not! After 7+ years I get a free year of ink! I subscribe to their paper as well so I synced that up for the year and I'm good to go. Before Instant Ink half the time I couldn't afford Ink in my printer, or would only buy black. I killed one printer I bought once with off-label ink- I still remember the awful noises it made. Then I discovered HP and Instant Ink. Now I print freely - all I want and they send me supplies as needed. Anyways- the printer. It took less than 3 minutes to set up with the on-screen guide the walks you through. You need your WiFi name and password and maybe a couple other simple pieces of information. The app on your phone (recommended) makes it easy to print from your Drive, etc. It has its own email address so you can send docs while you're away from home and they'll be waiting for you when you arrive (you can change the beginning to something simple to remember.) I struggle to set up printers on computers, etc but this one literally did it for itself. I almost expect it to have my coffee waiting for me one morning it's so intuitive, lol. You won't be disappointed with this printer! Give the Instant Ink a try while you're at it- you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.",

                "reviewText": "Very good for the price point. The biggest plus is that it is not super tall and bulky like the other HP printers. More compact and doesn't take up a lot of space. Works 98 percent of the time for casual household printing needs. Finicky here and there but MUCH better than other HP printers. Colored screen is easier to read and can pivot. This is an honest review and I got nothing out of leaving this review.",
