                "reviewText": "I think of this primarily as a source of entertainment. I can't think of any urgent use case I have for it, but I can think of a million fun things to do with it. It isn't disappointing.It's a very simple device. Plug it in via USB C, charge it, use it, whether it's plugged in or not. It prints over bluetooth using the \"TinyPrint\" app. That app is surprisingly good: it will print stuff out of your photos, with convenient cropping, off the web, from a stockpile of line art. It even has an AI engine that you can describe something, and it will come up with an image and then print it. Not bad at all.The print quality is...fine. This is the same type of printing you get at cash registers, but it looks better than those do. It doesn't look like it came out of a laser printer or anything. Great for clip art, labels, etc. I printed some pictures, and they are certainly recognizable, but not impressive. I have printed a bunch of things on regular paper with it, and they are fun, but not that useful. The use case I have found that is more useful is printing labels with pictures and things on adhesive paper. I can think of a ton of things I'd like to put labels on. For example, I have a bunch of kids and they all want their picture and/or name on their stuff.This set comes with 6 rolls of regular paper and 5 of sticker paper. Use is way easy. Just open it, pop in the paper, hit print on your phone. There is no aligning, calibrating, buttons, or anything else to mess with. You couldn't find a simpler little printer. One thing I did notice is that you have to put the paper in curing away from the front--this heat-paper has a side that gets printed on and one that doesn't. Once you know this, there is nothing else to know with this printer.I have had a ton of fun with it so far. I don't have to print out receipts for a business or anything, so there isn't anything here I *need*, but I have had a lot of fun with it already, and will likely come up with some things I feel like I need printed.For me, this is just an outrageously fun toy. I'm sure someone actually needs it, but for most people, it's just a great little toy. Seems like this type of paper is easy to find as well. Yet another plus.",

Its battery is very durable and can be used for several days on a single charge. The compact shell design makes it convenient for me to carry it with me when I go out.This is a very cool little toy, perfect for decorating and writing diaries! Also upgraded my notes. I used it to print many cute stickers and classroom notes.The quality of the 10 rolls of stickers that come with the printer is particularly good, and the stickers and thermal paper have a great texture. Overall, this is a great portable printer. I plan to buy one for my friend as a gift as well!",
