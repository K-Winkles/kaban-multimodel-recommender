        "description": "Your busy office needs a printer that\u2019s fast, affordable, easy to use, and has great features. That\u2019s why we developed the EcoTank ET-3850 \u2013 an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you\u2019ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-3850 features an auto document feeder, fast printing with outstanding print quality, productive paper handling, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and a large color display \u2013 making it the perfect printer for your home office. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of May 2021. | 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of May 2021. | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel App download. Data usage fees may apply.",

                "reviewText": "This printer is a replacement for an HP all-in-one printer. It is about 1/3 the size of the HP printer and uses liquid ink instead of ink cartridges. Checking the price of a complete set of replacement bottles of ink indicates that the Epson bottles are 1/2 the cost of a set of HP ink cartridges. Overall, print quality (documents) printed on the Epson ET-3850 is comparable to the HP printer. In my opinion, photo quality is questionable, and if I was going to print photos regularly, I would buy another printer.There is no LCD on the printer to preview print jobs. Also, it will take a little time to \"learn\" how to use this printer. It works very well with Windows 10 & Microsoft Office. Network setup/wireless setup was easy and fast. You do not have to keep the printer on all the time for it to retain its network address. It is not particularly quiet, but what printer is? I am quite satisfied with this printer, especially since I will spend less on ink. It is definitely worth the money I paid for it.",

While the print quality is not as crisp as the HP (I may change paper choice), the Epson is a far better and a more reliable printer/scanner. It does not lose the wireless connection, has not jammed, and scanning is a breeze. So far highly dependable.",
