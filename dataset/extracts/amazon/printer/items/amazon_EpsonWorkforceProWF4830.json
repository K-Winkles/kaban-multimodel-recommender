                "reviewText": "Had to replace a very old (ten year?) Epson Workforce printer. Pulled my hair out juggling all the obscured specs of all the brands, Brother, HP, Canon.Read carefully: some of them will duplex print, but not duplex scan; some of them will duplex scan but not with a Mac; some of them will do all that but they are made to print 13 inch wide paper and if you just need a simple multifunction office unit for 8-1/2 X 11 inch paper you're getting a LARGE footprint and spending a lot of money you don't have to.I had to create a spreadsheet to parse it all.This one (WF-4830) does everything the other one did but faster and better. Wireless, copies, scans, prints, scans duplex, prints duplex, color and B&W.Doesn't benefit from large ink tanks so that's still criminally expensive, but for my home office it's fine.",

                "reviewText": "After many years our Wf-4630 kicked the bucket. Finding a less expensive replacement wasn't all that clear. I went with the WF-4820 because the WF-4830 wasn't immediately available and I needed a replacement ASAP.I'm happy it worked out this way. Knowing what I do now, the WF-4820 was the way to go.Setup and installation was a breeze. I encountered no problems. I connected the printer to my router using an ethernet cable. I prefer this to a wireless connection. There are 3 computers accessing the printer. One is running Windows 7, another Windows 10 and another Windows 11.I ruled out Canon and Brother printers because I didn't want to get involved with ink ordering schemes. I prefer the cartridges. I prefer choosing when and where to order.This is an ideal printer for home or home/office use. I wouldn't select this for a large office with many users.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars This company has terrible customer service and serious flaws in their printer design",
                "reviewText": "I have never posted a seriously negative review of a product in the past as I try to work with the manufacture to fix their product problems and keep the customer happy. However, after prolonged attempts at resolution with this products issue I have to post something to show my frustration. The company has horrible customer service and does not support its flawed product, so I need to warn other potential customers to avoid my expensive mistake and seek a different manufacturer to purchase your printer and your ink.I bought this printer in December of 2021. It initially worked fine. I left on a vacation in July and returned in August to a long list of items to complete with close deadlines. Many required me to use my printer. Unfortunately, when I turned on my computer, I chose to update the software for the computer and for the printer (automatic requests that I clicked yes on \u2013 bad mistake). Once the printer software was updated it rejected the ink in my printer (which has worked previously and was Espon brand). Given very tight deadlines I called all over town and found some new Epson ink 20 miles away. I bought it and returned. The printer rejected the new yellow ink. I called customer service asking for help rolling back my printer software so I could finish my job and was dismissed. Now with a few hours deadline, I had to go buy a NEW printer and new ink (clearly NOT Epson brand), return, install and print.The deadline met, I recontacted Epson and asked them to take my printer back or replace the software as it was useless. I could not even print with black only ink when it rejected the yellow cartridge. They simply ignored me but asked for receipts, etc. to prove I bought new Epson Ink. That required more of my time to scan (with my new printer mind you), fill out forms, and submit. Weeks later they sent me a single new yellow ink cartridge. By then I was traveling again. I returned a month later, the ink was in my mail. I installed it \u2013 It does not work so now 6 weeks after the original problem I still cannot use my printer. I suspect to get any help I will need to go through all the same paperwork and hassle and will have no resolution of the software issue, which is the real problem, not the ink.Bottom line \u2013 this is a deeply flawed device with very touchy software glitches. The company is so paranoid to protect their ink business that they had made their device(s) unusable. I now see they were sued and they settled that lawsuit a few years ago. What they have not done is fix the problem nor do they want to help customers who have problems.I strongly recommend you not buy this device and seek a different manufacturer (probably none of their devices after reading the lawsuit information and noting they have not agreed to resolve the problem).",
