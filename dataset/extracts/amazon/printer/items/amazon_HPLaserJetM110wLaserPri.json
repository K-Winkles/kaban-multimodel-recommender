While the instructions said the app needed to be downloaded on other devices, I was able to simply select the printer from my Chromebook's print window. I hardly ever print anything, and having a small laser printer that easily connects to devices makes life easier.",

Had HP Tech Support (knowledgeable, patient) on the phone with me 2 hours (yes, I was annoyed; but the guy was great). HP tried to tell me it was my 'instant ink account' - it was not (which I already knew). They shipped me a new ink cartridge thinking the cartridge was defective - it was not. Trying to get a new printer (while under warranty) is like pulling teeth. I'm literally on w/HP now (45 min.?) trying to get my new printer. Customer Support told me (last week) if the new ink didn't work I'd only have to call to get a replacement printer - NIGHTMARE! I've had Cannon, Brother - for years - never an issue. I am not happy w/Hewlett Packard. Sorry, I tried.",

BUT................NOT auto duplex- it is manual duplex \u2013 This might be a deal breaker for me because my printer is not next to my desk and I will have to walk over to flip the pages.Prints slower than expected, but not terrible. Printed 8 pages in 1min 22sec.Printer status not available when printing from computer. You have to use phone app to see this.I was printing copies from my computer and it stopped working (needed to cool down). I couldn\u2019t figure out why. Turns out the phone app will give you the printer status, but I was unable to check the status on my laptop. It\u2019s possible I did not download the software appropriately.This can\u2019t handle volume printing. I was printing approx. 120 pages and it stopped printing a few times to \u201ccool down\u201d. Printed approx. 50 pgs before \u201ccool down\u201d started. This happened about every 7-8 pages after the first 50 printed. Cool down time was approx. 4mins each time. I can usually space out my printing so this isn't that big of a deal for me, but if you need to do volume printing this may not be the printer for you unless you have the patience to wait through the cool down cycles.",

                "reviewText": "While the quality does not measure up to my old LaserJet 6P it is satisfactory for occasional use. It is tiny for a laser printer and the temptation is to believe that it is portable. I would have liked to be able to use it in the woods while building a cabin to print drawings, but it requires WIFI. Flawed assumption is what comes from urban living. The designers have not thought the process through to the end of the equation. In any event, setup was easy and straightforward from my desktop computer, but I have not yet succeeded in getting it to print from my laptop. That likely arises because years separate the time each of these were purchased and setup of accounts are not identical. So it works on one, but does not recognize the other and does not respond. Like all of the smart devices it requires 2.4 ghz WIFI so you will likely have to set your router to broadcast in both 2.4 and 5.0 ghz.Note: About three months later the info that the printer uses to sign in to WIFI became corrupted so a printer offline message appeared. In order to fix it you need to connect the printer to the computer with a USB 2.0 male A to male B printer cable. It is a good idea to have one on hand, as you will likely eventually need to use it and it is not included with the printer.",
