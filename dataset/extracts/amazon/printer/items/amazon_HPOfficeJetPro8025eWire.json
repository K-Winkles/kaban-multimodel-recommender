                "reviewText": "I Purchased my last printer back in 2017 it was a big Hp laser jet pro MF477 and it took up a ton of space-It was expensive but did last me until Friday (Dec 2023) until it finally quit working. I need a printer that same day- I quickly searched HP printers on Amazon- This one happened to be on sale and had 4.2 stars and over 10,000 reviews so I took a chance and I am so glad that I did because I\u2019ve only had this printer since Friday, but it only took me 10 minutes to set up, connect and works great. You do have to have the HP Smart app on your phone and I actually find the app to be extremely convenient. I can be anywhere Starbucks, visiting family, and I can scan any document or picture into my phone as if I was using the actual stationary printer to scan. It\u2019s amazing and only takes a few seconds, I love the ap. It does take a little bit longer to print- it\u2019s not quick in that regard but as long as you know that you can plan accordingly! It\u2019s also very compact but definitely an upgrade from your standard tiny printer you had in the early 2000s! So far, it\u2019s been great- Very good buy, I\u2019m pleased!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this for a home office and due to the fact that it allows for wireless printing. Shipping from amazon was very good and on time. The setup had a few hiccups when it came time to have my laptop hook up to the wireless printing....I blame user error but after a few attempts I was successful hooking up the printer. The HP app was pretty easy to download and hookup to the printer. My only complaint is HP trying to sell monthly service plan for printing supplies....In lieu of signing up, I purchased extra cartridges for future needs.The mobile app also was easy to use to print a PDF file from my emails. Also the indicator on status of ink remaining is very easy to interpret.Print quality is pretty good. I printed out a picture of my dog (Brittany, orange - sitting on a blue bed - on a scale of 1-10, 7.5 - not laser quality but good enough to hang it on my refrigerator.Overall good value for the money and being proactive in purchasing my own backup print cartridges I feel comfortable printing off this for the next few years.",

                "reviewText": "This is gonna be one of those \u201cif I could give it a MINUS 5 stars, I would\u201d kinda review. I\u2019ve been a professional computer systems reviewer for 20 years, and this is the single most frustrating, time-wasting, money-wasting device I have ever used.This is supposedly an all-in-one printer: It scans, copies, faxes, prints, autofeeds documents, works via Ethernet or dual-band (2.4 and 5 GHz) WiFi from a desktop computer, laptop, phone, web or any other device that will talk to a printer and can be connected.I noticed recently that the price has dropped from $230 to $150. That could be because newer models are available\u2026or it could simply be because HP is trying to unload a really rotten device.Pros of the HP OJ Pro 8020e seriesYou will save trees. The print experience with the HP OJ 8020e is so awful that I go out of my way to avoid printing anything. Literally.Cons (where do I begin\u2026?)Installation is confusing, largely because HP spends quite a bit of time inveigling you into installing its smart printing app that strays dangerously close to malware. Its primary function appears to be talking you into signing up for \u201cInstant Ink,\u201d HP\u2019s ink subscription service that sells you ink whether you want it or not, and then getting you to buy more. It monitors your activity and sends a lot of data back to the HP mothership, and\u2014like most of HP\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d functionality\u2014is a real pain to stop.Installing a wireless smart device should be a no-brainer. Unbox, plug in the printer and power up, select a WiFi network and enter your password, then hit the print button. Ten minutes, max.Not this printer\u2014it took FOUR HOURS of install-test-reinstall before it could print its first page. Even then, I would up sending the document to my Android phone and printing from there.The Ethernet connection was equally stubborn.I wound up resetting the printer six times until it could find the WiFi network. Along the way, I accidentally activated HP\u2019s ink subscription program, which has caused even more headaches.Even than, the only way I can guarantee a print or scan is to shut down the printer, shut down my computer, and then restart. That gives me ONE immediate session to print or scan as much as possible before it goes offline again.If it actually does work, the print/scan is high-quality, but after six months with this foul beast I\u2019ve never managed to get actual output in less than an hour.If you work from home (as many of us do these days), beware your company\u2019s VPN: The HP apps will be shut out, and the printer won\u2019t work. It also doesn\u2019t seem to like Microsoft Teams. Best to save your printing until day\u2019s end, then restart everything, do your print, and retire for the night.HP advertises its \u201csix months of free ink,\u201d but read the fine print before you sign up, and be very careful: Once the printer/your network thinks you\u2019ve agreed to accept that free prize, you\u2019ll be forced to use HP\u2019s ink cartridges\u2014at 2X the price\u2014forever.Some HP printers allow you to disable \u201ccartridge protection,\u201d which allows the printer to reject any non-HP ink cartridge and simply refuse to print. The 8020e, and all \u201ce-series\u201d printers, however, do not, a practice I thought had been made illegal in the US, but apparently not.So, in addition to a poorly functioning printer, you\u2019ll also be stuck spending $90 on a set of HP ink cartridges instead of $45.Now, I've nothing against HP ink, and I typically prefer to buy the printer manufacturer's own ink just to avoid hassles. But I don't want to be forced into it, and I also don't want to be forced to purchase more ink than I actually need, given how little I print these days.Supposedly you can rub an electrostatic rubber thingee across an ink cartridge\u2019s microchip to get it to work\u2026but that hasn\u2019t worked for me.At this point, I'm looking for a cheap, non-HP printer that does NOT lock you into a bogus ink program and doesn't require hours of frustration just to get the WiFi actually connecting. I wish to blazes I hadn't given my old Epson printer away.",

                "reviewText": "First let me share what I don't like so much:. The LED reading screen doesn't tilt enough to make it convenient to read and the SIZE of it should be LARGER making it truly easy to read. However, it is indeed functional. Fairly simple to figure out.. The paper at 8.5 x 11 is not held 'Securely in place' and thus some of my pages came out mis-aligned or incomplete overlapping onto a second page. (Important to gently hold the paper forward in the tray as you close the paper-tray.HOW what I LIKE or LOVE about this item:. It prints beautifully. It's not FAST, but it does beautiful work. It's VERY EASY to replace or add New Ink Cartidges-- SUPER EASY. (Just do so carefully to align as you do). It holds quite a bit of paper. First time ever using a Scanner--- worked wonderfully and easy to do between the computer & Printer. Creating Two-Sided copies was also quite easy to do. Just following the LED directions and no problem doing so. (I may make a Video to help people learn how to do this easily) :--))Overall-- a wonderful printer especially for the price! Worth every penny in my humble opinion or view.Ink-- as always IS EXPENSIVE these days. I think THAT is thee only downside or downfall to Printers across the board. *Cheers mates!* Happy Writing, Printing, Faxing, Scanning and Copying! GO HP!Kindly always, Sir Nicholas",

                "reviewText": "I bought the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025e All-in-One Wireless Color Printer for our home office to replace a laser printer from a different make which I hated! The HP is great and very easy to set up with the HP app and I am very happy with the print quality. One thing that I love about HP printers is that they work great with any computer system. In our house we use, Windows, Mac and Linux computers for various tasks, and there are no issues with the drivers or features on the printer. I did not opt for the \"ink Subscription\" as I don't like such supscriptions packages, but the ink cartridges are readily available all over the place. The scanner is practible and it is great to be able to scan a stack of paper with the auto-feed tray on the printer. All in all I am very pleased with this printer and can highly recommend it for any home/office application.",

                "reviewText": "Previously I got a HP7525 in my shared office. It was not the best in the world but it was okay and it did the job. The feed roller broke so I bought this 8025e to replace it.The first thing was that I got a \"refurbished\" 8025e from this seller but it didn't mention anywhere in the description. The inside door was clearly damaged so it was not new for sure. I was thinking of returning it but I figured that I should gave it a shot. I installed the software & the cartridges those came with the printer, then I tried to print couple pages. It was fine in the beginning but it kept complaining it could not communicate with the cartridges. When it complained, it didn't print. I need to reinsert the cartridge to get that going again. It was just super annoying. I cleaned the \"pins\" and re-insert the cartridge but it didn't really solve the problem.Anyway, I contacted Amazon to return the product and I got the shipping label. I had a biz-trip at that time and I missed the returning window. Then I had no choice but keeping it.We bought the new cartridge from Staples to replace the cartridges that came with the printer. That solved the communication issue. Note that the cartridges of this printer are quite expensive (120 CAD+) and they don't last very long. Well, for me, I don't really care as I can reimburse the expense. But I do think it is a rip off.Well, here comes another problem. When the cartridges ran low, the printer liked to remind you every minutes on your computer. It was annoying. Also, it also stopped printing for no reason. As I mentioned, the cartridges didn't last long especially those color cartridges. My partner and I printed black and white mostly so we don't really care the ink level of those color cartridges. However, when those color cartridges run low, it stopped printing even you only want to print black and white. It just took me 20 mins to fight with the printer to print a 2-page black and white document. So I decided to write this comment to let you guys know how bad this printer is. The PC saw the printer and the printer status was \"printing\". The HPSmart thing (the software that you need to install for this stupid printer) popped up complaining the color cartridge running low. I clicked ok to dismiss the messages but the printer still didn't print. Anyway, I restarted the printer but it didn't work. Finally I had to unplug the AC cord. I think it must reset \"something\" by killing the AC. Then it started printing again.I bet the firmware/software was written in a way to make sure it would give users a lot of hassles when ink runs low so they will go buy those expensive cartridges.",
