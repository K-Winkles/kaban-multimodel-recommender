                "reviewText": "One of the easiest printers to set up !FOLLOW all of the setup instructions and things will go as planned, it works at the end of setup process.The touch screen is great.Connecting to BOTH a wifi device and an phone/tablet are two separate processes, dont think they are one and the same.The Sleep function timer can be adjusted, set mine at 15 minutes, default was 1 minute.Yes, if the printer goes to sleep the user must wake it up. That is not an issue.Yes, when it sleeps and you want to airprint the user must re-establish its connection. Not an issue.The paper tray? Yes some say its a bit flimsy. It\u2019s plastic and Epson has made it as light as possible, so that means dont try abusing the paper tray.When re-inserting the tray THE BLUE RELEASE butoon tab is paramount in getting the tray to go back in correctly.That did take a bit of time to workout since the instructions were not clear on how to reinsert the full try again. Just DONT ram in back in thinking its stuck, its not stuck, it needs the BLUE RELEASE button pressed again.All in all, yes I would buy this same printer again.The negative reviews are a mystery to me, the printer works, like it was designed to work.",

                "reviewText": "Wow. What a horrific experience, and it's not even been a year. Where to even start other than to say AVOID THIS PRINTER AT ALL COSTS. Interestingly, it's dropped by about $50 from last year, but don't think you're getting a deal - if it works at all, it won't for long, and what does print either won't print correctly, or it will never stay connected to your PC. Multiple devices? LOL!The final straw was the firmware update - yep, will not recognize my ink cartridges (3rd photo). You can scroll through the reviews and see how many others this happened to. Seems like the only positive reviews were \"review of fReE product.\" Honestly, I'm kind of relieved because now I can get rid of this PIECE OF CRAP. Please save yourself the aggravation - there are so many other choices. Epson deserves to go down in flames for selling this junk and their pathetic customer service.I already left a review of this rattly piece of plastic, below. Yes, the negative reviews are REAL. It was already awful, literally from the first print. One thing after another, and then a week ago I noticed that all my front-back printouts were not lining up (first 2 photos). Assuming that for some random reason now the duplex wasn't flipping straight (which was literally the reason I got a new printer), I tried feeding front & back manually. Nope, that is ALSO crooked. You have got to be kidding me - I haven't even used this printer all that much because of the constant aggravation!Original comments:If you're only using plain 8.5x11 paper, don't mind paying outrageous prices for Epson-only ink, and love crooked printouts when nothing is broken, then you'll probably be OK. If you would like to use any different paper sizes at all, and heaven forbid you use any specialty paper, prepare to be infuriated, repeatedly. I WISH I had been able to test it more before the return window closed. But this new printer should be better than my 10 year old Canon, shouldn't it? It should. But nope!So today, we're not going to allow A5 paper and every time you try to use it, we'll bring it into the cartridge, stop it there, and then tell you it's jammed! Want to use Tomoe River? No way. First, we'll do the above, then we'll just tell you there's no paper in the cartridge, even though you've made sure it's loaded correctly. Want to duplex print? Prepare to be amazed at the illogic of it - no, we can't just flip a paper for you, we must load 8 programs on your computer first, and then never print correctly whether you choose flip-on-short-edge or flip-on-long-edge!There are so many other options out there, SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE OF THIS PIECE OF JUNK! My first - and LAST - Epson.",

                "reviewText": "This is my third Epson WorkForce printer, and overall, I am very satisfied with it from a functional perspective. I did have some frustration while installing the print/scan applications, as even on a fully updated Windows 10 device, the driver install would stop at around 20% and never complete. I was able to manually install the driver by unpacking the self-extracting installer, and running the Scan, Print, and Fax installers individually. Once completed, all functions work as expected. The addition of a driver CD seems superfluous given the number of machines that have gone diskless, and excluding it would save a little cost on the manufacturing side, as well as keeping more plastic our of our waste stream. Overall, a solid printer.",
