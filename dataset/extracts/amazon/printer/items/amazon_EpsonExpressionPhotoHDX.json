                "reviewText": "I initially bought this printer after being frustrated with the quality of prints at Walgreens and the cost of getting a couple of 4x6 prints shipped to me from Adorama. I really was just looking to print some 4x6 photos to send to a friend in South Korea as a thank you, but this printer has so much more to offer. My 4x6s were printed from iphone photos and they looked good and I sent them off.Afterwards I decided to see what my photos would look like printed out at 11x14 and they look great, and the I realized this printer can print up to 13x19. I was truly amazed by the quality, prints came out with bright and accurate colors, and stunning sharpens. On my days off now I spend time printing off some of my favorite photos and creating 13x19 portfolios with them.I've only used Epson ink with this printer and the results are great, I have steered toward A-Sub photo paper which has been ok for the most part, but it does have trouble reproducing accurate skin tones. For the highest color accuracy, you will want to stick with Epson photo paper.When I initially received the printer, it unfortunately died after printing off a few photos. After a quick troubleshooting process with Epson they decided to ship me a replacement. While it was a hassle dragging this thing around to get it shipped a replacement was sent out promptly and I've been very satisfied ever since.",

The Wi-Fi feature does work well. If you use Epson paper to print your photos with you can be assured of the longevity of your digital print as well as being a bit water resistant. If you use Epson ink with Epson paper, you will get a nice clean, bright print. If you choose to use other artistic paper or any off brand paper, you may not get the same results so you\u2019ll have to work at it other than that I have always used Epson printers and I do believe that they are one of the more superior printers on the market for printing digital photographs and for the amount of money paid for an oversized printer it\u2019s kind of hard to beat. Now if it had ink wells, instead of cartridges so you could refill it instead of replacing ink cartridges it would be perfect.",

Not a deal breaker.Cons: After the first few prints, i have never printed ANYTHING without error messages, usually incorrect. \"Needs paper\" when there is plenty, etc.Never get more than 2-3 prints without having to replace an ink cartridge, despite using XL for this very reason.Epson has blocked third-party cartridges, though Amazon continues to sell the useless items. This means the per page cost is very high, and the per page hassle factor is ridiculous.Output tray, which is supposed to retract automatically, fell off after a few days,and could not be re-attached, even with manual, youtube guides, and three different competent people attempting.Though I've gotten less than 100 prints, I am retiring this piece of junk.I'll try a tank-type printer. Also by Epson! So watch for another embarrassed review.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first dedicated photo printer. I was pretty nervous after reading the reviews, but I am so glad I didn't listen.I'm convinced a lot of the negative reviews are user error. I've printed a fair amount of photos already and I've never had an issue except one paper jam, and that was my fault.The print quality is amazing, although I find it seems the photos may print slightly darker than on any of my three displays.I've always had a very hateful relationship with printers, so when I set this up in 30 minutes I was absolutely shocked. Calibration is easy, I found and installed the drivers quickly, the paper loading is quick and seems to even be able to take that last sheet from the tray.Pros-Awesome print quality-Prints up to \"13-Easy to use-Rather quieter than expectedCons-Slightly heaver than I thought-Expensive ink-Decides to print photos with excessive banding then not do it again the second time after changing nothing, but only if the earth is at a right angle to Venus during an eclipse.Overall, I'm in love with this printer. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this printer a couple of months ago. I was specifically looking for a printer that would print on very thick cardstock. This printer does take my very thick 140 lb cardstock in the back feed, but after using it for about a month it started telling me there was no paper in the feed even though there is. Then it started to tell me there is a paper jam when there wasn't. The screen does have some tips to try if that keeps happening. One of the tips is to clean the roller, but they don't explain how to do that. I ended up having to find a you tube video from someone who explained how to do that. The fix they suggested did help, but I have a feeling I'm going to have to use that fix a lot.The other thing I wasn't expecting is how much ink I was going to have to buy. I also have an HP without the rear feed. I was thinking that I would be changing the ink cartridges with about the same amount of frequency, but in two months I have already changed all 6 colors at least twice some of them three times already at $21 a pop.If I had it to do over again I would probably be willing to spend more for a printer that has less problems with the feed and didn't need constant ink changing.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace two different Canon Pro100's that I have been using for 20 years. Reading other reviews this fit what my needs are today. Didn't want an all in one, didn't want to use it for anything but colour photos. Didn't need super fast printing and didn't really cars about 2 paper trays but it's part of it so fine.The good: It's print quality is every bit as good as the Pro 100 which I had been very happy with. It's much lighter and easy to move around. Main thing is the print quality and this prints great colour quality so that's all the counts for me.Not so good: The screen is not a touch pad, only works using up/down, side to side arrow keys on front of printer. Touch pad would be better. Paper tray is automatic, extends out once pointing is going to start. This may be neat but it's just something else that can malfunction down the road and if it won't extend you can't print anything. A manual tray would have been better. Installing to work with my Mac desktop was a nightmare. I've installed 3 Canon printers and 1 HP over the years and this was the worse. I use a Catalina operation system and the install went fine until I asked my desktop to recognize printer via my home wi-fi.Desktop wouldn't allow connection to be made after multiple tries so had to call Apple support. After over an hour on the phone and getting to senior tech he finally found a way to work around the blockage and connect to my wi-fi. This was an aggravation I didn't need and have never had before. Was it the printer's fault, I don't know but never happened before.Aside from these few negatives I'd rate the printer as supurb so far. Given the price it is an excellent buy as long as print quality continues and there are no service issues after more usage.",

I was looking at this epson and a much more expensive version when doing my research and decided to go with this model since it is able to print on a thicker paper. For thicker paper I use it to print onto watercolour paper before painting and it works wonderfully (9x13 paper size). I also make prints of my watercolours on presentation grade 8x10 and 11x14 paper and the colour matching it AMAZING. The prints come out beautifully and the detail is incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this printer. I've also made both matte and glossy stickers with this printer and again, it works so well. If you are looking for a great printer that isn't going to cost $1000+ I absolutely recommend this product.",
