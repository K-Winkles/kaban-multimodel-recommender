The reason is that the printer uses thermal paper printing technology and the photo may be exposed when the user takes a photo, resulting in blurred photos, if the photo is taken in normal light, the print will be clear enough. How does this mini printer work? First, switch on the mini printer and enable Bluetooth on your phone. Open the \"Walkprint\" app, choose the printer, and it's ready to use after connecting. Why print on thermal paper instead of ink? I think ink is much clearer. The product was selected for thermal printing because it can give users easy to use, can be carried around, and can save costs, do not have to buy special ink. How can I turn to if I have a problem? If you have any suggestions for the product, feel free to contact Darkant, we will do our best to help you solve the problem, to ensure that every customer can be 100% satisfied!",
