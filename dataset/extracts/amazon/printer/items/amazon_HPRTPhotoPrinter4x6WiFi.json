                "reviewText": "It's hard to believe that mostly no one seemed to notice that it wasn't all that clear how many pages of paper actually came with this picture printer... In one place it says that it comes with 10 pages of paper, and in another it says that it comes with 20 pages of paper... \ud83e\udd26 (person facepalming) And so, just to be clear again, this picture printer comes with 20 printable pages.However, I DON'T know how many pages the cartridge will last for yet. You see, when it's necessary to get another cartridge and more printable paper, it costs $25.99 (at the time of this review) to get 1 cartridge and 54 pages paper. So then, that makes me wonder. After I've used the 20 pages that initially came with this printer, will the cartridge be able to handle 34 more pages when I get them?? Or has it been made to just handle 20 pages? Well, I'd be willing to bet that it can only handle these 20 pages, lol. But hey, I could be wrong.Anyway, besides all of that, this printer seems to work very well. Even better than I expected. The only thing I don't necessarily like, is that the piece that plugs into the wall is really big an bulky. That's not that big of a deal though, as we should all be used to that type of thing by now.Now, if you are someone who is trying to decide between THIS picture printer and the one made by HP, I would actually suggest this one. I think the one by HP is like a dollar or two less than this one right now, but they don't even say ANYWHERE, whether theirs comes with a cartridge OR any printable pages! And what's more, most of the reviewers are totally oblivious to this lack of information and provide no help whatsoever... Well, luckily for whoever is reading this, after looking for a long time I finally found out that theirs DOES of course come with a cartridge and some pages of paper, but only TEN pages. AND, many people who had decided to get the HP picture printer, now find themselves with only one option when they need another cartridge and more paper. Which is, 108 pages of printable paper and 2 cartridges for $46.99. At least with this printer you can choose 1 cartridge and 54 pages for $25.99. Or you could just double it if you wanted more than that at once, and get 2 cartridges and 108 pages for $51.98. So yeah, I suppose refilling this printer costs just a little bit more, but not a whole lot. And I would still recommend this one over HP's picture printer.(Also, don't forget to keep in mind that the prices I have listed throughout my review may be different now, depending on when you are reading this. But that is what they were at the time of this review.)",
