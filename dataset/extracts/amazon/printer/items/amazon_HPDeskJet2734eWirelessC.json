Yall I'm on day three and I'm only 3.5 signatures in. does not do double side print so I have to do it manually and you can't do groups of pages at once cause it will cut off in a middle of a page. So I am literally printing 200 pages one page at a time. Also it does not like to maintain wifi connection. I am currently writing this while I wait for connection again. Also I'm on my 3rd ink cart. Just spring for the $80 HP if you are doing fanfic. At this point I never want to read Breath mints and Battle scars ever again let alone bind it lol.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Landmines....",
                "reviewText": "Landmines.......everywhere.Short take based on my short time using; printing only, haven't tried scan or fax yet...Print quality is excellent.B/W document photocopies also excellent.Setup: using the most current version of windows 10, when I used the windows settings to \"add printer\" it recognizes the printer but comes back with \"no drivers available\".You can either go do a manual search for drivers or will have to load the \"HP Smart\" app onto your computer to employ this printer, well, I did anyway.I'm not a tech genius, but I did used to do tech support for a Savings and Loan as well as a Credit Union software vendor that provides about 85% of the nations credit unions their operating system software.Parts of the HP smart setup were easy; parts were so unhelpful, so NOT intuitive that I wondered if I'd ever get the printer to print.First, it demands that you start the printer with the HP ink cartridges that come with the printer.Although I *bought* this printer, as a Vine reviewer, I had ordered some generic HP 67XL cartridges that came the day before this did.I wanted to just save the HP's and use the Vine ordered cartridges so that I could write a review for those.Rabbit trail, and you already know this: THIS PRINTER, LIKE ALL, IS ABOUT THE INK, NOT THE PRINTER.After installing the HP cartridges, HP - not that smart, wanted to align the print heads.Click the button in the app and....nothing for a very long time.Finally it printed one page, but the app stayed stuck on \"printer alignment not finished\" (not a direct quote).Here's why....after printing the alignment page, you also need to scan the page that shows the alignment to complete the alignment process.Wifi: one of the best/easiest things about this printer; found and connected well and stayed connected, and once it was finally in the mood, printed the documents very nicely.\"WORRY-FREE WIRELESS \u2013 Get better range and more reliable connections using dual-band Wi-Fi with self-reset\".Would *anyone* read in to that, that NO, you will not be able to connect this printer via a simple cable in order for it to work??? I seriously doubt it.I posted inaccurate information in this review, and this is the corrected update, with that info deleted....There is a cable usb port on the back of the printer.First though, the printer MUST be set up using only wifi.After being set up on wifi, you can connect a USB cable, *but* the printer *must* continue to be connected to wifi.Back to the ink: the product page said 9 months free with signup (consider declining) the app and the box mine came in offered 2 months.Landmine: To participate you will need to agree NOT to use generic cartridges.Landmine: Agreeing to have automatic printer/software updates could disable the printers ability to recognize and use your generic ink cartridges. You can select NOT to have automatic updates.Each time I installed and tested generic HP cartridges, immediately a separate HP window opened wanting to update the HP software. I can't help suspect that it would have installed an update right then and there to disable that set of generic cartridges, so be careful about agreeing to updates if you intend to use or have installed new generic cartridges.I'm sure the \"rationale\" from their marketing department would go something like...\"To assure the longevity of the printer lifespan and the quality of printing, we have updated the software to reject non compliant ink cartridges....blah, blah, blah\"It's about income stream, not their concern about how long a $40.00 printer lives.Really, as I said, it's like it's THEIR printer, not yours.But wait, there's more.When you say \"All in One\" and suggest that includes the ability to fax, would you suspect that, no, the machine itself really won't fax for you, instead the app will. Okay...No. Not Okay; it becomes a PAID function at that point and after a trial period, you will need to provide payment information and pay for the fax function.To me, these many little omissions of transparency border on inviting a class action lawsuit.The initial and current 3 star rating is not based on long term use.As new, this prints a nice page (using both theirs and the generic ink).4 stars for print quality and appearance of quality of printer.1 star for \"landmines\".As I haven't bought a printer for a while, I suspect this kind of behavior is industry standard now; but that doesn't make it right or okay.I'm averaging the overall to 3 based on my experience.I hope this review has been helpful and enables you to make an informed purchase decision.I rarely give an overall 5 star rating.",

Not too big of a deal, you can always change your print options to odd pages only, flip it over, and print even only. Just be careful that everything is in the right order and facing the right direction. Definitely would not recommend if you need to print a lot, but a few pages every now and then, it works great.",

Basically for 3 months i can print up to 700 pages/month. after which i would need to subscribe to a ink plan and payment is now per page not per cartridge. If i cancel the subscription the cartridge would deactivate and i'd need to buy a genuine HP cartridge from the store.However i wonder if it would have been better not to activate and just directly shop offbrand.",
