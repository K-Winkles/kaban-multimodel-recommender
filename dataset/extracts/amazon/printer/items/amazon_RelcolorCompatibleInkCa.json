                "reviewText": "I bought these cartridges based on the reviews and the price seemed too good to be true. About half of what the name brand costs. It was indeed too good to be true! After about a week, the printer malfunctioned and an error message occurred showing the printer cartridge was incorrectly installed. I pulled them out and tried to put them back in the error message continued. After troubleshooting I discovered that these aftermarket cartridges are ill fitting and eventually stop working. I was worried my whole printer was damaged, but after a hard reset and inserting name brand cartridges it began to work properly. I tried to begin a return but I was a day late and was not able to. What a hassle!",
