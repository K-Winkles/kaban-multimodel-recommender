I resisted trying anything other than manufacturer brands due to all the ominous warnings about print quality, possible damage to my printer, voiding and the warranty, etc.. But I gave this a shot and I'm soooo glad I did!!! Reasonably priced especially for the XL capacity cartridges and like I said - works beautifully! Excellent print quality! Very happy with these ink cartridges - will definitely be buying again!",
