                "reviewText": "Just a few buyer beware tips before you buy this (and probably any HP printer) printer. If you are just in need of the occasional label, document, or picture printing, you might want to skip this brand.First off even though Amazon (and possibly the seller)encourages you to buy the off brand (and much more affordable ink) don\u2019t. Only HP ink works. Also, the major selling point, for me anyway, that even if one cartridge runs out, you can still print. Nope. And lastly, unless you\u2019re using enough ink to warrant the monthly subscription fee for their service, which automatically sends out ink you definitely want to skip this printer.I bought it, along with the recommended off brand ink that was 3x more printing at a savings. Unfortunately a month after sample in runs out I pop in my off brand, but the ink wouldn\u2019t work the printer just kept saying not HP, buy more ink. Then wanted my cc information for the subscription ink. Long conversation with tech support. They turned off the subscription request and assured me that as long as I buy real HP ink no problem. Fast forward 13 months, I get low/no ink warning and it won\u2019t print a label even though the black shows nearly full and color shows at least half. After waiting a few days for yet more ink to arrive still won\u2019t print and keep getting call to renew subscription. After a good couple of weeks of me, my kid, a friend all running through set up rebooting whatever you can think of it won\u2019t accept the new HP ink I\u2019m guessing because the subscription hasn\u2019t been renewed.I\u2019m done. Over Christmas I\u2019ve ordered a new Canon printer, it might have issues who knows, but I\u2019ll take my chances. At least their ink is inexpensive, available everywhere not just Amazon (oh yeah I should add no where locally to buy the ink, Amazon or the subscription are the *only* options). I. Will. Never. Buy. Another. HP. Product. Again. We\u2019ve had their desktops, laptops, and printers for decades, but never again.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Monitoring by HP, Exploitative Subscription Ink and Obnoxiously Bright Light",
                "reviewText": "This is a review of HP\u2019s approach to this printer.First the light that stays on on the printer. The picture of this product is very deceptive; it does not show just how bright that blue-ish light really is and stays on 24/7/365. If you keep this printer in your room, that light will illuminate almost the entire room at night and the wavelength of the blue light is such that it keeps you from sleeping. Give me one good reason why there is an obnoxiously bright light on a printer that stays on 24/7. Why do I need a loud and bright reminder that the printer is \u201cready\u201d 24/7? Thats what plugging it in is supposed to do. There is NO way to turn off the extremely bright light. Its almost as though the printer makers want to control your life by being obnoxiously present and having an annoyingly loud way of reminding you day and night that such inconsequential thing as a printer is now this huge thing in your life. There is no way to turn off this light. Plenty of other ways to serve the purpose of the light without having that light on. Honestly, it feels like a Big Brother situation. They have this thing on their app where they remotely monitor your printer and they claim its for your \u201csecurity.\u201d Personal printer security? Security from what? So does that mean that HP is getting a copy of EVERY page you print sent to them? This is a reasonable suspicion given that they can remotely monitor how many pages you print, so it makes sense that they have access to the CONTENT of those pages too. Its feels extremely uncomfortable to me how corporate America continues to increasingly invade our personal lives, take away our rights and privacy, even more than governments do.The second issue is the printer ink subscription. The terms and nature of the subscription are manipulative. I actually read the fine print. The fine print conveniently leaves certain crucial information out such as when it says that you \u201cmay\u201d need to return the ink if you unsubscribe and they will remotely disable whatever ink you already have. They then promptly send you the first ink long before you existing ink is low so as to mentally tie you down during that \u201cfree\u201d subscription period. Now the ink subscription is NOT just an ink subscription; it is also a page subscription where you are basically charged if you print more pages than your subscription level. So now, you have HP invading your mind by making you always conscious of how many pages you print, taking away that mental freedom to print as many or as little as you like. Oh and they conveniently omit from the fine print how much EXACTLY you would be charged for each page overage; they merely say that you \u201cmay\u201d be charged overages for printing more pages than your subscription level. Is it $1/page? $5/page? $500/page? It doesn\u2019t say. How much per page? What limit? None of that is addressed int he fine print that comes with the printer. This is a TRAP that HP sets for their unsuspecting victims whereby the ink plan that is so overtly advertised as saving you up to 50% in ink costs could easily cost several times more than one would have paid without this exploitative ink subscription. One oversight or one month of heavier-than-usual printing is all it takes; consumers have many other things to worry about in their lives so may not always keep track of exactly how much they are printing and so if one stays with the plan long enough, they may inevitably trigger the overage charges which could wipe out all savings up to that point and then some. And of course there is a maximum page subscription level so there is always a chance of overage even at the highest level of subscription. I imagine, as is typical of Corporate America, that if one were to call HP when they suddenly see a huge charge on their credit card that they are not expecting, HP would simply use that opportunity to get them to subscribe to higher plans, thus essentially blackmailing them into spending more. This is theft, plain and simple; just that it is disguised as a \u201csubscription plan.\u201d Oh, what they get away with!Why be this deceptive? Why not show on the product picture the true image of what the printer ACTUALLY looks like when it is plugged in? Why effectively eliminate the light from the picture when in fact it is the most noticeable and most obnoxiously loud and present aspect of the printer by design? Why abuse Americans/customers with exploitative subscription plans? Why invade the sanctity of our privacy?Unfortunately as technology has become more sophisticated, this has been the trend throughout both with HP and other companies providing these technologies and services. These companies are competing with one another for a share of the consumer\u2019s privacy and attention and in that stampede of competition, the consumer is the victim and collateral damage that gets stumped down in the mud at every turn. I am saddened by the direction of such practices. And I am just tired of companies like HP abusing and taking advantage of people like this. Someone has to stand up and say something. This is NOT an inevitable trend; these companies need to be held accountable for their corrupt practices and have these trends reversed. Human life is supposed to get better with technological improvements; we should not have to pay for these advancements with our very own freedom.",

                "reviewText": "I am not a computer person. I am a retired senior who finds this sort of thing to be extremely frustrating. Although I try, I have to go somewhere else to have somebody else put it together for me. Life is just too short to live with that level of frustration.I was able to put together this printer together on my own, which is shocking! It was so easy. It came with a very easy to read booklet of instructions that tell you exactly what to do. This booklet also show you what the codes mean when it\u2019s having an issue. That way you don\u2019t have to guess, which in my mind is a really good thing. What I was most surprised about, was the way that it is put together. It\u2019s built unlike any other printer I\u2019ve ever seen, but it seems to work really well. Ie, the paper is fed from a drawer inside of the printer. You basically have to lift up the whole printer itself to get at the paper or envelope drawer. It\u2019s curious, but it works amazingly well! I also didn\u2019t realize that it hasn\u2019t extra bit of warranty which is a treat as well! Extra bonus! I have only had it for a few days and have not had an opportunity to try out it\u2019s other features but for me, given the cost, this HP printer is one of the best.",

                "reviewText": "I finally had to buy a new printer because my trusty old HP printer (over 11 years of use!) finally started having issues. After much research and wading through several bad reviews on every printer I looked at, I decided to go with this one and crossed my fingers that it would be a good experience.Everything started out fine, going through the process, but when it reached the step to connect to my wifi, it just would not, no matter what I tried, no matter what device I tried it on. I'm not new to technology and this type of thing should have been an easy process for me. Instead it was 6 hours of nothing working and complete frustration! Finally, I decided to just connect it with USB (USB cord doesn't come with the printer btw), grabbed the USB cord from my old printer and gave it a go. After another hour of downloading the driver from HP's website, and going through the lengthy installation, and it was connected via USB. Yay, time to print right? THINK AGAIN.When I put the ink cartridges in, I instantly got an error message stating that the color cartridge was not communicating with the printer and no matter what I did, it would not work. I read page after page of other similar issues (many of those to be found with this printer!!) and finally realized that my brand new cartridge or the cartridge compartment in the brand new printer was defective. Seriously!? So I ordered another ink cartridge from HP for $25 to see if it would work in the ink compartment.With time constraints on needing a working printer ASAP, I then decided to just send the defective printer back and have it replaced with the same model replacement. I was actually still hopeful I could make it work. Thankfully, I read the reviews on the actual ink cartridges for this printer and found out that they run out after 30 to 40 pages, though stating they will print 100 pages (still too low anyway). Since I can't connect to the subscription program through HP, and receive ink monthly, and would need to order my cartridges on an as needed basis, this was the straw that broke the camel's back.I ordered a completely different printer that hopefully will suit my printing needs better and will not arrive defective and unable to connect wirelessly!Would NEVER recommend this printer. Its too costly on ink and not user friendly at all. Don't bother, trust me. Horrible experience.",
