After that there was a slight problem because the USB cable wasn't provided with the printer, but I bought one and it worked immediately once connected up. Nothing fancy, it doesn't fax, scan, or connect using Wi-Fi, but it's inexpensive and physically compact.",

                "reviewText": "My Epson c88+ was finally rendered obsolete and so I was forced to look for a new printer. But everything I looked at was an all-in-one, which I don't need. I happened upon this Canon TS202 and thought I'd try it, in spite of the mixed reviews. That was a mistake. The first one I ordered worked fine until the return window lapsed, then I got the 10 blinking lights for no apparent reason. The printer had not been moved or touched other than to turn it on and to refill paper. The 10 lights was code for \"needs professional service\". REALLY?!?To throw good money after bad, I decided to purchase another one but also get the Asurion warranty. Well, now that printer is giving me those 10 lights. I submitted the claim with Asurion, but was informed that the printer is still under the manufacturer warranty and so I was to check with them about it. Yeah, right. I just hung up after being on hold for 21 minutes. I have pressing things I have to do, which included printing for a class I'm teaching tomorrow! I'm so livid. What happened to quality products?!? If you decide to purchase this printer, you are knowingly selecting a ticking time bomb. It's not \"if\" it will stop working, but \"when\".",

Just one thing: I have been using it for less than a week from the time it arrived; however, a message showed up on my desktop screen today that the \"Ink is running low.\" I spent an hour on the phone with a very pleasant woman convincing her that I shouldn't have to pay for a $16 ink (black only) replacement as the description of the printer says it comes with a \"Full Set of Ink Cartridges.\" She agreed with me. I paid for a new black cartridge for $16 and she emailed a certificate for another black ink for free! BTW. I don't print pics; I just wanted the printer for my articles. So far so good.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this essentially because it was the cheapest option and we really only needed it for a small amount of things, A few business cards, some resumes and similar mostly text only content, Of course it'd be hard to really screw those things up and the included ink while very little was good enough for about 100 pages or so before it waned about \"low ink\". Of course the color cart is a 3 in one, mening if any one color runs out you need to replace all 3, so wastefull, not to mention the age old practice of mixing in color even on black and white printouts just to ensure the user requires more ink sooner, but since a new ink cart alone is only $10 less than the actual printer I'd strongly advice against getting this for any sort of long term use. Laser printers WTF.Since the ink carts are defective by design, and only lasted me about 100 pages, I decided to return them for a replacement rather than just tossing them. Thanks to Amazons wonderful return policy i had a replacement wihtin a week at non cost, just had to ship them back the old defective ones... Hopefully the ones they send wont have the same issue, but worst case I'll just keep returning them when they run out and save up for a proper laser printer.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried everything with my old printer to get it to work, but nothing was succeeding. I finally had to give up and start looking for a new printer, but I was worried about cost. This model absolutely is what it\u2019s promised. It\u2019s a very basic, but very efficient model That prints very well. It\u2019s also nice that it only requires two ink cartridges as opposed to the four I have been using with my previous one. It\u2019s not anything mine blowing but if you just want a good working printer this is for you.",
