                "reviewText": "Exactly what you\u2019d expect from a classic, old-school, analog style label maker. Easy to start using, and comes with a front / back page of instructions and troubleshooting. I love the vintage look and how quickly and easily I can create labels. I\u2019ve included photos of how I used it so far - to label compartments in this container. I deducted a star for a minor issue (still totally worth buying!!) - there is a balance for how hard to squeeze. The first one I made (see photo for \u201cAAA batteries\u201d) came out kind of weak, as I didn\u2019t squeeze hard enough. Then I guess I overcompensated, and when you squeeze TOO hard, the spacing between letters comes out wonky; I\u2019m guessing it crimps the tape so severely that it loses some space between letters. So go into it knowing you might be performing some \u201cdo-overs\u201d if you\u2019re picky about how it looks! It comes with plenty of tape, so you will be able to label your heart out. Also - something nice about it is that when you cut it in the machine to end the label, it makes a nice spot to peel the backing.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this product, as I could always use a good embossing label maker. However, the Vixic Embossing Label Maker Machine left a great deal to be desired as it relates to print quality.The item was well packaged and included three rolls of embossing tape. The instructions accompanying the product were well written and clear. I had no problem loading the tape, selecting letters and cutting the label. I was pleased that the manufacturer included extra embossing tape and clear instructions. The product is super-easy to use right out of the box. However, that\u2019s where all of the positive points remain. Regrettably, the major area of importance for this product is the ability to deliver clear, crisp, labels. In that area, this product does not excel. I printed a number of labels and found that many letters were scrunched together such that it was difficult to make out the letter or the embossing was so uneven that some parts of a letter were not well done. Letters like G, B, M, S and others simply did not look crisp. I have included a picture of a sample label for you to decide for yourself.Years ago, I had a similar embossing label maker from a major brand and it was outstanding. This is a product I will not continue to use and I will be searching for another.I should explain the 2 star rating. While the quality of the label was truly poor in my opinion, the manufacturer did some things well as noted above and I wanted to at least acknowledge that effort.",
