This one definitely works as well as any of the similar priced ones I am running now as well.For my uses I have it plugged in via USB - so I can't say how the bluetooth functionality works. But setting it up and having Windows see it as a printing device was easy. With all of these printers it takes a bit of tweaking to get your shipping labels to print from your source exactly as you want them, but this one was no worse than any of the others.The printing quality and contrast has worked well for shipping labels. Like most others as well it wouldn't be great for content with a lot of shading and completely filled in dark areas, but it makes perfectly legible and intact shipping barcodes.I am very happy with it for those purposes!",

                "reviewText": "In my opinion, there are too many cables required to operate this small little thermal printer. Granted, I was setting this up for my desktop pc. Bluetooth was not an option. I read the user manual and I also watched the video on how to set up the printer. I had to do this twice because I neglected to turn the printer on the first time; and after installation, I tried to print a test label and the print job went to my HP laser printer instead. It would not stop printing! Every page just had one line at the top and I struggled to cancel the job even after doing so at least 6 times. I uninstalled the driver, connected the thermal printer, turned it on, then finished the installation. Lastly, I went into the printer's preferences and changed the settings as instructed in the video. On the first test print, it printed the entire label in ONE SECOND. Wow! I was impressed. However, I didn't care for the ink's lightness. I changed the density setting to very dark. That had no affect on the print job. It still did not print black but more of a charcoal gray. There was no difference between the two test prints. I removed one star because of this.Another thing I noticed is that the power button turns on the printer, but it does not turn it off. The only way I could turn it off was by unplugging the cables. Even with this thing completely turned off, unplugged and in the box it came in, the green light on the power supply stayed on for at least five minutes.Overall, I'm pleased with it and totally impressed by how fast it can spit out labels. This will definitely come in handy for my Esty store's Christmas campaign, though I may opt to get a color thermal printer as well.",

It is made from what feels like a durable plastic and is very sleek in its design. The size is perfect as it can be easily be taken with you on the go and can fit in most bags. There is no built in battery and will have to stay plugged in for power.This printer is easy to use and operate - insert the labels and connect via Bluetooth and the app (or direct from a computer via a USB connection). For such a small printer, I think this does a great job in terms of overall print quality. It also works with nearly any smart device that uses Bluetooth and I've had no issues to speak of.All things considered, I really like this portable printer and it does a great job for me. I don't always print, but this is a great way to print on the go if needed, or just at home. I mainly use it for printing shipping labels and it's been perfect for that.",

                "reviewText": "I started thinking that I received a defective product when setting up the Jiose thermal label printer. After several days of trying different things to load its driver on my desktop computer, I finally thought of trying the idea to set it up on my laptop instead. Following Jiose\u2019s excellent setup instructions once more, the printer was recognized by my laptop in short order. Printing a Windows test page from the laptop resulted in a flawless print on one of the Jiose\u2019s included 4\u201d X 6\u201d labels. One of the printer drivers on my desktop computer must have been preventing the Jiose printer driver from loading.I ordered the Jiose thermal label printer to serve as an inexpensive way of creating black and white wine bottle labels. As a winemaker, I\u2019ve always liked the look of black-and-white printed labels on commercial wine bottles and hoped the Jiose thermal label printer could produce similar labels. Unfortunately, the thermal printer wasn\u2019t up to the task. While the Jiose printer had no problem with simple black-and-white graphics, it does not print shades of grey. All greys are printed in dark black. However, simpler graphics are printed acceptably, like the label with the black and white grapes. A slightly wavy line on a different test label didn\u2019t print solidly.The Jiose thermal printer is designed to print shipping labels and, based on my experience, it does that well. An outstanding feature of the printer is that it needs no ink, thus making it inexpensive to use. However, this thermal printer does not have the fine-line reproduction capability that graphic printing calls for.Although the Jiose thermal printer didn\u2019t do what I had hoped, its ability to flawlessly print shipping labels makes it a keeper. My kids and I are always shipping things to each other and this new printer makes doing so easier.",
