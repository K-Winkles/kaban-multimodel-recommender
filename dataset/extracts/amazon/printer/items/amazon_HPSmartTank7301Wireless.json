I objected to the automatic ink replacement plan, so that eliminated many of the HP models. HP was my preferred brand, based on past experience \u2014easy set-up, reliable performance for many years, intuitive problem-solving. This HPPrinter is none of the above. Unboxing and initial set-up was easy. As I attempted to connect to WiFi, the process was incredibly confusing. It involved installing the Smart App and visiting 2 other HP sites. After hours of trying to set this upon my own, I decided to contact Customer Service. Customer service involved online links with info that was not user friendly & went in circles. When I attempted to contact a human CSR for free help with set up, I learned that it didn\u2019t exist. I was furious. I finally asked a tech savvy friend to help me with set up. It was also very frustrating for her. It took her more than I hr. to get the printer in operation. If I could have returned it, I would have, but I was beyond the 30 day return period and the large inkreservoirs had already been opened and installed. I have had some minor problems with paper feed, paper jams, etc. which should be easy to resolve. Again, it is not.I am done with HP. If I could rate this zero, I would.",

                "reviewText": "Unbox, find the quick start guide. I used the cord from my previous printer so didn't even have to fish any cords. This one is on the larger side for a home printer, but it still fits in my desk cabinet designed for printers. Adding ink is super easy and zero mess, with countless more ink than the little cartridges I used to get and replace. I love that the new paper goes in the front, and the printed page comes out the front. I also love that the ink volume shows for each color and black on the front. The top controls are a lot easier to see with my old eyes. Setup to my computer and my phone was a snap. I've been using this printer for awhile, and there hasn't been a single blip or bad word said in frustration. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace my ancient Epson WorkForce 635. That worked great for many years before the scanner wouldn't communicate with the computer after upgrade to Windows 11.First Impressions is that the HP is a pretty solid printer. I compared it to another Epson and a Cannon Tank printer before settling on this. Setup was okay, lots of stuff to do and not really plug and play. I wanted to use it with a direct USB connection but HP does not provide that cord. Luckily, the Epson cord worked fine and used that. My son also wants to print, so I set up WIFI but had to actually add the printer as a second printer to use as WIFI. I may have missed something on the setup there, not sure because the instructions are so vague. Like the Tank option vs cartridges. Also has replaceable Print Heads. Time will tell how long the ink lasts. I just use it for home use. Other Criticism is that all the controls are on top vs in the front. Hard to see the buttons if its not mounted at eye level. Also the little display screen is worthless. Anything you want to do, Scan, Print, Copy etc. is best done through the HP Smart App.Last criticism is that there are no card reader slots like the Epson had. Had to buy a USB Card Reader.",

                "reviewText": "Our old HP cartridge ink all-in-one finally passed on due to failure of its wifi connection system. I suppose it was coincidental with Prime Days and the price seemed reasonable, so we went with the 7301. Easy to setup, including the ink bottles and wifi connections. We certainly like the legal size capabilities, ink tank capacities and two-sided printing. At first, we were a bit put off by not having a \"scan button\" on the machine, but quickly realized that if we are scanning, the app is needed anyway - no hard button needed any longer. The HP app is intuitive and has been great so far. At some point in the future, I may update this review for durability but for now this is a terrific device.",

Sometimes you see blue dots even if your design is only black.4- hp support will not help you even within the first few weeks and under warranty coverage, they will try everything to prove you have a bad settings, papers, connection, etc.Conclusion: for this price, it\u2019s a total waste of money. Plastic build and material are very cheap for a 450-550$ printer. Now I bought another printer from another brand for more than half of its price and it is performing way better.",
