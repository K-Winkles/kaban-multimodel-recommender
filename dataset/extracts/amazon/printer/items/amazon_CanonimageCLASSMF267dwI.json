I cannot scan, print, copy and just type a email address or reply with attachment from printer or forward it and send. It's a big production typing in on printer and after all that doesn't send.The remote App on iPhone way says I cannot use the feature.Also saving a document it only saves to drive which I never can find. It finds photos fine and old attachments but that doesn't help. I want to send a real time file legal document by email. It will save to on my phone but when I try to attach the file it will not come up to attach the file I want to email. I've tried many ways. I usually have to try to copy file and try to place it in a folder I can just open with email attachments. I email it to myself then TRY to copy it and send a new email to the person I am replying to. The software is really messed up. Buggy or something. And/or iphone12, gmail,or the Canon software. I just know when they all fix it to work in co very together it will be fast. Convenient. I just cannot stop and troubleshoot while working trying to send documents fast to attorneys, doctors, legal stuff they need. I end up having to find sone way just to put an attachment reply to an email and it's a circus. For me anyway. But the printer works great. It's not color and a little pricy just being a laser b/w laser. I've bought two. I hope they fix/patch a update on the software or send instructions instead of being sent to trouble shoot on their support looking for the specific problem to either understand it or repair a problem. I just cannot search help trouble shoot while working just to bc attach a document after scanning, copying, etc etc.",

It was something super silly that was not clicked, but I had to set up authentication, special passwords, all kinds of stuff that I did before the geek squad even came. I would recommend if you have your own IT guy/team. But if you\u2019re not tech savvy and setting this up in hopes to use the scan to email feature I\u2019d look elsewhere. I had to pay half the price of the printer for the geek squad to come set it up!",
