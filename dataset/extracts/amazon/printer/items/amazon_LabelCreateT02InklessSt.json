I printed some pics of my pup's faces (adorable), and those were a little easier to tear, although I crinkled both in the process. Then I wanted to print some labels for some folders, but every single one was un-useable because they ripped in half while I was trying my best to tear them cleanly. I had my partner try to see if it was just me, but he also wasted a bunch of the paper trying.-My first order came without any sample paper. A bummer, but Amazon sent some. It's a small sample roll and will need to be used sparingly to last. Replacement rolls run around $4 a roll.Overall, I was between 3 and 4 stars, but because I can't use it for the primary use of label creating I wanted to, and I can't think of anyone I would personally recommend this to, I settled on 3 stars.",

                "reviewText": "The box and quickstart guide is labeled \"Phomemo Mini Printer\" with the product model \"T02.\"I like mini thermal printers because I think it is neat to take/print/stick pictures into my notes and other items. I already have another mini thermal printer (Nameer Label Makers Mini Portable Small Printer) but had trouble finding compatible paper/sticker paper and needed to do alot of adjustments to use other company's paper in that printer. I got this mini printer (LabelCreate T02 Sticker Printer -> which is really the Phomemom T02 Mini Printer) since it seemed to be easier to find compatible T02 paper and had an inner spool (labeled \"adjuster\" in the manual) to help line up the paper.Thoughts:- cute little size- easy to turn on- no need to buy ink refills- thermal printers are like the old fax paper printers we used to have -- They can only print in black/gray/white. The ink is heat sensitive, and can fade and become hard to read and scan over time. Thermal labels are sensitive to abrasions and exposure to water, chemicals, and strong sunlight. For these reasons, direct thermal printing is not the best choice for long-term use.USE:- download the app \"Phomemo\" and then connect to bluetooth and pair with \"T02\"- software a little clunky and slow- limited templates (greeting cards, fun, to-do list, frame, schedule, business card)- there is no template for labels- when you go to \"Print Images\", you are able to search your gallery on your phone to select an image, then edit (crop, rotate, filter, adjust) and print it out- this is better than the Nameer printer because it has an inner spool that you put inside the roll of sticker paper to keep the paper loaded correctly and not shift while printing. The other printer (Nameer) tended to have the sides of the paper/sticker paper get stuck and caused curling/crease folds on the side once printed out).- Read the manual carefully to figure out how to replace the printing paper and insert the spool/adjuster in the correct orientation- Only came with one sample roll of sticker paper (adhesive thermal paper)- But there are plenty of places to buy compatible paper for the T02 printer (paper equal to or less than 55 mm wide). Search for \"Phomemo Printer Paper\" or \"Self-Adhesive Mini Printer Paper for M02/M02 Pro/M02S/M03M03AS/M04S Mini Pocket Printer.\" The paper should be equal to or less than 55 mm wide.Compared to my other thermal printer (Nameer brand), I like this Phomemo Printer more due to the better alignment and compatibility with more types of paper. However, it is mainly used for stickers and probably would not work as well for making labels (especially since it doesn't have label templates (like my Nameer brand does).",

                "reviewText": "This little printer can fit in your pocket. It is so cute and makes a great gift! It comes packaged in a nice retail style box.What I like about it?-Comes with a sample roll of sticker paper-does not need ink (uses thermal technology on thermal paper/stickers-works completely wirelessly via bluetooth through your phone or tablet-very simple to open and close to load the roll of paper (which is available very easily to buy more)-works with a great app that has lots of templates and is very intuitive-includes USB type C charging cable and holds a long charge. You can print on the go, in your car, literally anywhere with nothing plugged in, straight from your phone!-The build quality is excellent and just what I would expect if spending twice this amount at the local big box store.What I dont like?-The roll of paper that it comes with is not that long. Its more of a sample roll, but more than enough to get started and print a bunch of stickers.-black and white only (the nature of all inkless thermal printers) however you can get coloured thermal paper of all kinds including transparent for very affordable on Amazon.Overall I like having this little printer, and a few others that are similar to it. I notice that they take quite standard sizes of thermal paper rolls. I think this is also an inexpensive way to introduce a young child to the joys of scrapbooking, or label making, or just learning to use printing technology in general - and you wont find it at this price anywhere locally. Only on Amazon have I seen these printers for this great price.",
