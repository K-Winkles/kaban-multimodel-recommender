                "reviewText": "My five-star rating is somewhat tentative, because I just got the printer up and running yesterday. I did a lot of research, and read more than a few online printer reviews. I narrowed my choices down to the HP OfficeJet Pro 9025e and the Epson EcoTank ET-4760. I was replacing an Epson printer that served me well. I read about the pros/cons of EcoTank printers. Bottomline, they're cheaper with regard to ink, but ink drying can be a problem if you don't print frequently (and I don't print much anymore.) I liked the Epson touch-screen better, especially the one on my outgoing printer. (Additionally, IMHO printers are not visually attractive objects, worthy of display, so I tend to like black which seems to make them more invisible. The HP is not available in black.) The reviews on the HP were sparse. I then discovered that the ET-4760 has been around since July 2019 and the HP was introduced in March 2021. Obviously, in the world of technology things can change a lot in two years. I was really on the fence with the two printers, so I basically held my breath and bought the HP. The only hiccup in the unpacking/set-up process was getting the printer to join my wireless network. I tried twice using the phone app. (iPhone XS/iOS 14.4.2), and once using my laptop (MacBook Pro 2019/macOS Big Sur) to no avail. I started to get worried. However, I was then prompted to use the \"Wireless Wizard\" on the printer itself. I needed to enter my password manually on the printer touchscreen. Success! All in all, it was a lot less painful than I expected. I registered with HP+ but vetoed, at least for now, the \"Instant Ink\" program. I'm printing from my laptop, my desktop (Mac Mini 2011/macOS High Sierra), and my phone without any issues. Perhaps, I've had a succession of noisy printers, but I am not finding this printer to be noisier than any of the other printers that I have owned. The copies are as good as my previous printer, which is as good as I need them to be (and for a printer, it doesn't look that bad...). My first impression is that the HP 9025e is worthy of five stars at this point. Longevity will be the real test...",

                "reviewText": "Meet the new HP 9135e all-in-one printer. This beautiful printer is feature-packed and is incredibly powerful. When looking for a printer, I need something that prints fast, is easy to use, and can be a workhorse for my business. Ink supplies need to be readily available and affordable. The 9135e exceeds my expectations in all of these categories. Here are some highlights that I found important and I needed in a printer.- Fastest color print, copy, scan, and fax; features faster scan; mobile/wireless- Professional-quality color for presentations, brochures, and flyers- Ink subscription ready- HP Wolf Security- Print Speed: Black: Up to 24 pages per minute; Color: Up to 20 pages per minute- Equipped with two 250-page input trays- Upgraded 4.3\u201d Touchscreen control panel.One I can actually see whats going on Inky sharp display That allows on board Controller as well as Mobile app controls. The ability to print from anywhere with a data connection is Great and extremely useful for business purposes. I actually owned the last generations variation. I have found that everything feels more polished and fluid. So if you are looking to upgrade but wonder if you should? My recommendation is absolutely upgrade as you will definitely notice the difference. The build quality feels superb. It has a removable power cord. And that might seem silly to care about a power cord? But it really matters if you have ever had your cat decide to chew your cord lol. Simply replace it and you are ready to go. Bottom line is at this point I highly recommend This new printer from HP. It has all the features I need. Most importantly they work Flawlessly. It has beautiful Inky printing capabilities. Whether you want to print documents or photos. It all looks great. With many more options available. If you are in the market for a new printer? You need one that can literally be used for anything? Whether it be Simple everyday printing? Or printing for a small business? I say Look no further Then the new HP 9135e all-in-one printer. If you decide to buy it you will be happy you did.",

                "reviewText": "When it works, it's pretty good. The problem however, is that it randomly and regularly won't print over wireless, and always at the worst possible times. How does it know?Running it's diagnostics program reports no problems when it is clearly not printing queued up jobs. I've run out of patience with it and getting a Canon printer. I've had VERY good luck with Canon.This HP printer is just too aggravating to keep. Not only that, but it comes with their instant ink plan which was HORRIBLE. Inks never came and when I tried to opt out of it, HP makes it nearly impossible to do so. After *finally* removing myself from this scam, they started charging my credit card again months later without any ink delivery at all. It was like pulling teeth to get HP to stop it once again.Tech support was very poor, and the way they push you to stay with their ink plan (with scare tactics of all sorts) is extremely offensive!Stay away from this company!!!",

                "reviewText": "The out-of-the box set up was easy and intuitive! Connected to WIFI and the HP Smart app instantaneously - no issues. Sturdy construction and good footprint on my desk. I signed up for the instant ink plan - 12 months free and can cancel/change anytime, understanding that the printer came with the required ink cartridges (approx. $200 value!). I had the OfficeJet Pro 8600 for 10 years - it was a workhorse - the printer head recently failed and it was too much of a hassle to get repaired/replaced (costly and couldn't be bothered to be honest). Amazon had 20% off on the 9025e, so I went for it. I'll save approx. $330/year with the instant ink plan, if not more - no brainer in my opinion! Great deal overall!!!!",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Instant Ink Program - not the printer itself which I am quite happy with except it doesn't have a direct feed tray. Bear in mind that if you buy the printer with the \"e\" designation you are paying extra to have access to the Instant Ink Program. Now on to the Instant Ink program.The first thing you need to know is that you should not sign onto the free trial until you use up the cartridges that come with your printer THAT YOU HAVE PAID FOR. HP doesn't tell you that your free trial starts right away - not when you get the Instant Ink Cartridges and put them in your printer.Secondly - know that the HP Smart interface and the HP Cloud Services (that links your printer to Instant Ink) are slow to load and quirky. Really a PITA for slow loading (and I have 1 GB service).Third - if there is any problem with the HP servers syncing with your printer - whether the problem is at your end or theirs - your printer stops working. I just went through two days of not being able to use my printer and almost a complete lost of productivity for those two days because HP Servers were going through maintenance and could not sync with my printer - so my print capabilities shut down. What an asinine way to design a service like this.Finally - the pages per month contract really does suck if you have to print a lot of pages with less than the average amount of coverage per page. You really get beat up there because if you print a page with only 1/4 lines - or a page spilled over (unknowingly) and printed out another page - even if blank - it counts as a page in your monthly contract.Coupled with the fact that HP intentionally disables printers using aftermarket cartridges (ink and toner for laser printers) - this company has become one of the \"bad operators\" out there.The concept of this program (Instant Ink) is great - the execution sucks as do the apps and interfaces and, unfortunately, I have come to realize I should expect that from the HP of today. I have been an HP diehard (for both computers and printers) for over 40 years, but they have lost me.",
