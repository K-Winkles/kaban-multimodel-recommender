                "reviewText": "I have owned HP printers for over 15 years and until now have bought HP ink cartridges from either HP or Costco. The packaging for those cartridges always specified a \"warranty end\" date and almost without exception, the date is anywhere from 12 - 15 months from date of purchase. In November 2017 I bought HP 951XL colour cartridges (3 pack) from Costco that shows a \"warranty end date of April 2019, the expected standard.Last week (April 12, 2018) I saw the HP 950XL Black cartridge on sale at Amazon (from Tech Wise Electronics) for a good price. I ordered the ink and the product was received on Friday. Great delivery time. However, on examining the packaging there was no date shown under the \"warranty ends\" heading. There was a pre-printed label on the back that covered some printing. I tried peeling the label off and it showed a date of December 2018, 6 months from now. No indication if this is a best-before-date as there was no other indication. I now expect that the sale price was meant to indicate that the product is nearing its shelf life. I am not happy with the situation but will live by my mistake in jumping on the sale. I'll return to HP or Costco for future purchases where I can see the end date before buying.",
