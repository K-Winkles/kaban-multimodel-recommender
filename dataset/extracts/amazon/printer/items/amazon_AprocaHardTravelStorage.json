So, plan on carrying those items separately. Also, from an engineering standpoint, the carry handle is on the hinge side of the case, so, if you're not careful in making sure you have zippered closed the case you could dump your very expensive printer on the floor. This, honestly is the main reason for not giving the case a 5-star review. That and the lack of additional storage. With those issues in mind, if you're looking for an relatively decent case for your HP Printer then this case will serve that role just fine.",
