I ordered correct but off brand replacement ink from Amazon.The use of these trigger a firmware update which disabled my printer. Epson support asked, \"didn't you read the box?\".No I didn't. I read the specs to ensure this machine met my limited needs. I didn't read the little notice on the box when Amazon delivered it\"Articles online indicate they only started adding the information on newer models after a class action lawsuit made them act like a decent & ethical company. Still didn't cause them to make a sincere and apparent disclosure.Let's not pretend they want consumers to be well advised about this or they could & would make a real effort to provide forthright disclosure before disabling my new printer.This tells me everything I need to know about Epson.Throwing out their machine. I don't trust companies that use dubious techniques to take my money. This offer you can't refuse method of commandeering products to force sales of their products should be treated as extortion.I want to know exactly what the off brand ink does that Epson claims damages the printer. Because it was working fine until EPSON disabled it. So who damaged my new printer? Seems like Epson did not the replacement ink.",

                "reviewText": "We had an Epson that lasted eight years. So much printing that the print head actually wore out. We bought an HP Deskjet to replace it. Eleven months nightmare. Trashed the new HP this morning. This XP4200 setup was easy and connecting it to my Android took under three minutes. Easy instructions. Epson stuck with a good thing and it works. Very happy with Epson as usual.Total time from box to printing was forty five minutes. That's excellent!Note: I never use off brand cartridges. A few have posted about this printer using only Epson ink or requiring a Firmware update for off brand cartridges. I never used off brand with our old Epson and for eight years it had no issues other than in the last few months of that eight years the print head was worn out. It was very similar to this one and three Masters Degrees were earned by our children and that printer was a workhorse!!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something simple, quick and cheep. Cheap I got, simple and quick NOT. I wanted to plug in it, turn it on and print, not fiddle with it.Took almost an hour to download and install stuff, some of which I didn't even want ... like .Net Framework. And that's just ONE computer. I have three more on the network to do.They don't even include a manual. You have to download that.Then it want you to enter the serial number as a password.Screen is very small with even smaller print and some arrow and other keys that are not backlit and difficult to see and read.I have no idea how long it will last, but they insist on using their own proprietary ink and seem to threaten to disable the machine if you use anything else. I print very little, maybe 50 pages or so a year on average. Ink tends to dry in the heads of these cheap inkjet printers and buggers the whole machine, so I may need to print a page a month just to try and offset that.",
