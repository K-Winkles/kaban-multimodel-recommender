BUT, I credit that to the fact that I DO NOT UPDATE THE PRINTER SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE regardless of the constant prompts on the printer to do so. My experience has been that the printer will recognize the third-party cartridge and then update the firmware to make sure they will not work with future similar cartridge installs. Hence, no reason to do an update, and enjoy the lower price of these units. The quality appears to be the same at a much better value.",

                "reviewText": "My wife needed a printer of her own so she could occasionally print higher quality color images. We have a color laser printer, but the output is not high-quality for color. I bought her an Epson printer, and she used it sparingly. Just a few weeks after purchasing the printer, the starter cartridges ran out. So I purchased this so-called high capacity set of cartridges only to find out that only the black one is high capacity. The color ones are all standard capacity and they seem to use up about a fourth of the ink in each cartridge when they prime themselves for first use. Two months later, these cartridges are empty. I just threw the printer in the garbage and got an Epson eco-tank printer that has a higher initial cost, but they come with large bottles of ink that last up to two years. Don\u2019t waste your money on a cheap Epson printer only to find out that you have to buy $60 worth of ink every couple months.",
