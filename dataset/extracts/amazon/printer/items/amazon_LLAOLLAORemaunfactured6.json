                "reviewText": "I got these for my HP 4510 and it fits and works perfectly. I was worried because normally my printer is pretty fickle when it comes to replacement cartridges, depending on the maker, but this worked instantly!The colors are bright and vibrant, and it's been a few weeks and I have zero issues so far.Usually by now, I can see some difference in the darkness of the black ink, it'll start to get a little grey or get some tiny lines around the edges, but nothing like that has happened so far. These seem like a really solid replacement, and definitely a good value as a result.",
