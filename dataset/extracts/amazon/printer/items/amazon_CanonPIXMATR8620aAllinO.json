Just be sure to go into the LAN settings on the touch screen and connect it to the WiFi network. Then, be sure you connect your computer or smartphone to the same WiFi network, and it will just work.I have a 4-year-old version of this printer (a slightly different model), and it has been amazing, so I bought this one for the office.The print quality is good on paper, but on the glossy 6x4 photo paper, it is absolutely outstanding! Printing photos straight from an iPhone 14 is so easy, and the quality is superb.I am very happy with this printer. Oh, and in my old printer, I use 3rd-party ink cartridges and have never had an issue.I really like that the ink is in five separate cartridges. I have had other printers before that combined all the colors in one cartridge, and when the magenta or yellow runs out, you have to replace the whole thing, wasting a bunch of ink in the other colors. These cartridges are generous in size and last a long time, and you can just replace the one color that runs out.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Fine replacement for Canon MX922",
                "reviewText": "After eight years of good use, my workhorse Canon MX922 encountered the dreaded C000 Service Code and could not be resuscitated. I decided to purchase the TR8620a, which seemed the most similar Canon model as of summer 2023.From ordering to setup and first use, it was only a couple of hours thanks to Amazon Prime. Out of the box, the TR8620a is much more compact and flimsier than the sturdier MX922, but the newer model more than makes up for it with its user-friendly setup, standard features, and much faster startup time. Overall, and as of today, I am happy with the purchase.Here is a breakdown of the pros and cons of the Canon TR8620a.PROS:-Much faster startup time than MX922-4.3\" LCD touchscreen operations-Smaller footprint than the MX922-Can be set to power off automatically and then power on automatically when printing. No more having to press the power button each time!-Easy setup right out of the box. No complicated Wi-Fi setup.-Beautiful resolution that exceeds that of the MX922 toward the end of its life (specs say MX922 has 9600 x 2400 and TR8620a has 4800 x 1200)-Duplex printing-Two paper source inputs for different paper sizes, although the rear paper input is exposedCONS:-Unit is built from cheaper, flimsier plastic than the MX922. Feels like an early 2000s printer.-Although I don't have to press the power button on and off every time, I do have to manually flip up the front cover and extend the paper output tray when I want to print each time, which is a hassle. Why didn't Canon add a built-in motor to gently raise and lower the front cover for printing?-Output tray is flimsy and cannot support a lot of paper, unlike the MX922.-MX922 had a nice glossy black finish, but this unit has a flat black finish reminiscent of an early 2000s printer.-Single paper tray. I commonly switch between printing on 8-1/2\"x11\" paper and 4\"x6\" photo paper. The MX922 has two dedicated paper trays for loading both types of paper at the bottom of the unit. This unit only has one dedicated paper tray at the bottom, which holds less paper. I have to load photo paper at the rear of the unit and leave it exposed, where it will surely collect dust which will enter the unit.",

                "reviewText": "Terrific printer, but one detail is not spelled out: you need to lift the front panel all the way up. If not, you keep getting the error code 1240: the printer thinks the support tray is not pulled out. A glitch in an otherwise great printer. A significant improvement over my old Canon MX452.Update: I let the printer use wi-fi on first installation. Big mistake. While my wi-fi signal is strong enough for phone calling, printing proved to be extremely slow since all that color data had to go upstairs to the router and back down to the printer. I plugged in a USB cable connected to my computer (not supplied with the printer) but the printer still wanted to use wi-fi. I had to spend another session with Canon tech support to uninstall the drivers and reinstall the USB driver in first place. Now printing is swift.BUT: duplex printing is slooooow. The printer prints the first page, then pauses for about a minute, then sucks the paper back inside to print the back side. Printing a long document is going to be very slow.Still, for the price, this is an amazing printer. My digital art work prints beautifully. Still giving it 5 stars.",

All systems work (at least scanning and printing, which is all I use.) Kind of flimsy and clunky, but it works well, so what's to complain? Replacement ink is cheap. I like iet and would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "The Canon PIXMA TR8620a is a budget-friendly all-in-one printer that offers basic printing, scanning, and copying functions. While it's appealing for its affordability, some compromises have been made in terms of performance.Pros:Affordable: The TR8620a is one of the most affordable all-in-one printers on the market, making it a good option for casual users who need basic functionality.Easy to set up: Setting up the printer is quick and straightforward, even for those with limited technical knowledge.Cons:Mediocre print quality: Text and graphics appear slightly grainy, particularly when compared to higher-end printers.Slow printing speed: Printing documents takes longer than average, especially when using high-quality settings.High ink costs: While the initial purchase price is low, the cost of ink replacements is relatively high, making long-term printing more expensive.",
