                "reviewText": "I tried printing a copy of a printer purge file that had all colors and check which color was having a clog. Two colors had a 100% clog. I tried printing several times with the same result. Then did a light head cleaning (3 minutes) and that did not work. Stoped doing the 7 minute clean up until I tried this product.I reluctantly purchased it as a last option before I gave up on the printer. Was already looking for new printers. When it arrived, i was ready but my ET-4700 did not readily lifted up to get to the printer heads. You have to remove two little screws right above where the printed page comes out. Then the top part goes up and you have full access to the printer heads.You have to put something to keep the top of the printer opened. The next step is to put paper towel right under the printer heads. You have to fold the paper very tightly as there is not very much clearance between the printer head and the bottom of the printer. The syringe can eject 5mm at a time. This is good so that you don't flood the bottom of the printer. The bottle comes with 100mm and it is recommended to flow no less than 20mm into each color head with a possible clog.After the paper towel is in placed between the printer bottom and the printer head, you have to gently take the soft plastic tubes out of the cassette (a little reservoir box where the ink passes right before it prints to the page) that sits right on top of each printer head.You have a choice to make as to where you plug the tube that comes out of your syringe.1st Choice: Place the syringe tube on the same place as the soft plastic tubes that flow the ink from the big reservoir.2nd Choice: Remove the cassette (a little reservoir box where the ink passes right before it prints to the page) that sits right on top of the print head and connect the syringe tube where the cassette makes contact with the print head.I chose the first one as it seemed the most thorough option. The videos I saw stat that it is almost always right on the head but I though why not clean anything in the cassette as well. Plus the syringe connection to the print head did not all that tight (worried about leaks).We did 4 flows (as the syringe has 5mm) for each troubled color (we had Yellow and Cyan with a complete clog). I had to be careful when i replaced the plunger after I filled the syringe with the clear fluid that came with the product. The plunger seems to have a very tight seal and I was afraid of shooting the liquid really fast as I replaced the plunger.After you shoot 10mm of liquid; move the head towards the other side of the paper towel to get that side ready for the other 10mm of clear liquid. If you see the paper towel completely soaked in ink. Then replace it. I recommend using the gloves (plastic bag material) that came with the product of use your own nitrile gloves. The paper towel will be very saturated with a clear solution and remaining ink. Move the head to the left or right and remove the paper towel. Use another paper towel for the next color but if you see too much liquid, clean the printer bottom before moving to the next clogged color.We only had two colors to do so, we used a few more paper towels to clean the bottom of the printer when we were done. Replaced the soft tubes that go to the cassette (gentle and slow proces) the tubes felt pretty delicate.We went ahead and did the full printing head clean regardless (7 minutes). You have to turn the printer off and then hold power button + help button for a few seconds to turn on into full cleaning mode. I had full ink on the tanks before I started this process and then seven minutes later I saw that all had gone down, mostly the black ink for some reason.Test post-product:Printed the head alignment page and surprise!! I SAW ALL FOUR COLORS in all their glory!Then printed a personal document and it was perfect.Very good product and resulted just as intended. Will definitely have this on hand and also use the printer more often from here on.Satisfied Customer.",

                "reviewText": "Took 3 tries over a couple hours, but it got the job done. My HP 6978 had stopped printing any magenta. I removed the print cartridges. I put a folded-up paper towel under the print head. I used the supplied adapters, tubing, and syringe and forced about 1cc of the cleaning fluid into the little orifice where the ink flows from the cartridge and into the print head. I let the fluid sit in the print head for maybe a half hour, and then cleaned up the area with rolled up paper towels couple dozen Qtips (not supplied). I removed the paper towel I had put under the print head (there was a lot of gooey ink on it). Then ran the printers \"Clean Print Head\" routine. I did all this three times. After third iteration it suddenly started printing like new. Wow -- I was impressed that this actually worked!One caution -- the directions mention leaving the fluid in the printhead over night to soak. If you do this, do not leave the print cartridges off the printer. The ink inside the print head will dry out, and things will be even worse than before. I let the magenta soak overnight, but I had also removed the cyan and yellow cartridges. And surprise -- cyan and yellow were no longer working in the morning - the ink in the print head was open to the air, and dried out. Though more applications of cleaning fluid fixed those as well.Only gripe is that the instructions are very non-specific as to printer makes and models and what to do with the supplied adapters. But you can sort of figure it out.I was ready to junk this printer, but it is working like new now. Very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "This is kind of long.We were about to buy a new printer because it stopped printing black. We have had the ET-4550 for over six years and saved enough on ink to buy a new printer! Great. Then I saw some videos about cleaning the printer head. I bought this product and armed with the videos to watch I started this project.MAKE SURE YOU COVER WHATEVER SURFACE YOU ARE WORKING ON TO PROTECT IT! It went very well. I cleaned all the colors while I was in there. Had to do it a few times. Being the klutz that I am I knocked over the cleaning solution bottle. Luckily I was done. You then have to go to maintenance control utility on the printer and run the head cleaning setting about 20 times before the solution is washed out and you get all your color printing againOne problem I had was when I was drawing the solution into the syringe. There are a few different sizes of the tubing connectors that I had to connect to it. I had an awkward U shape of tubes that I had to dip into the solution bottle to draw in the liquid and then take it out and attach it to the ink intake valve. That was how I tipped over the bottle and lost the rest of the cleaning solution. It sounds more confusing than it really was.Very happy with results.",

Found a YouTube video that recommended this product. It was easy to use and cleared the blockage. Just an fyi... once you use this product, the color may not print consistently at first. I had to do a couple more head cleanings through the printer diagnostic menu until all of the cleaning solution cleared out of the yellow print head. Printer is now printing all colors as it did before. Worth the $10 for the solution, plus plenty left over incase any of the colors get clogged again.",
