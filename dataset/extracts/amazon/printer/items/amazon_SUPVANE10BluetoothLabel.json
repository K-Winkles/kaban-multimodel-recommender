                "reviewText": "I purchased the SUPVAN E10 Label Printer and have been impressed with its performance. The wireless connectivity via Bluetooth on the app is extremely user friendly, and the setup was very straightforward.The machine itself is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around and use in different locations. The printing quality is excellent, with clear and crisp text and graphics although emojis seem to come out bad. The label maker also comes with a range of customization options, allowing me to choose from different font styles and sizes.One of the standout features of this label maker is its compatibility with the SUPVAN app, which allows for even more customization and ease of use. The app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to create and print labels on the go.I highly recommend the SUPVAN E10 Printer for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient label maker. Its compact size, wireless connectivity, and impressive printing quality make it a great choice for both personal and professional use.I got this product so I could label my world banknotes. I was able to label 46 of them while using about 4 inches of label per banknote sometimes more. I thought it would run out a lot sooner than it did, there is quite a bit of label tape per roll.The cost of getting new rolls is a bit expensive, $9.99$, but the fact I don't have to buy ink makes it much better. Just with the roll it comes with when buying it you should be able to label just about everything. I saw another review saying they didn't receive a roll with the product, but when I got mine, it had a roll of continuous label ready to go + charged.Edit: April 19th, 2023. I bought a refillable roll and accidentally purchased the small labels instead of the longer continuous white labels. Happy accident, the smaller labels look more professional and last longer than the continuous label tape. instead of being able to label just 40+ banknotes I was able to label all 50+ of my coins, and nearly all 100+ banknotes. I highly recommend buying this label maker plus the smaller labels that aren't continuous. The small labels are perfect for labeling coins/banknotes because of their size. Small enough to fit a label on a coin holder, yet large enough to be able to fit all the needed details. You can find the refills here; https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JP4FMCF?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsAlso, I don't see why anyone has a problem with this product regarding their data collection policy, most companies have similar policies including the one we are all shopping from.Edit July 14th, 2023; Product still works great. I love how easy this makes labeling my coins, and it makes it look professional.",

This worked perfectly and was very easy to set up. Came already charged too so I could test it right away. The tape is easy too by having a split down the middle to easily take the backing off to stick where needed. I don't think this would hold up on clothing though if washed. I think it would just come off not like other brands such as Mabel labels. I've only tested printing in black so I'm not sure if there is a coloured option yet. It'll be great for labeling my kids stuff too so they don't mix them up if they both have the same toy. Has price barcodes too if someone has a small business and price tags.",
