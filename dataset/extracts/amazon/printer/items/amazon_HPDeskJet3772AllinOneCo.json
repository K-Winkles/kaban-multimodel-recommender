                "reviewText": "When something is labeled as \"refurbished\", I am always wary, but I needed a printer for a Christmas project and I needed one fast. I don't typically use a printer for everyday use, so price point was also a heavily considered factor: I wanted something affordable and practical.The printer works perfectly for printing (haven't tried using it any other way). It was a little tricky to set up but the manual was very helpful. Couldn't figure out the wireless mode, but it worked fine with the provided USB. It does its job and printed beautifully on cardstock for paper crafts. It's nice and compact and easy to store away when not in use. The printer itself is lightweight and doesn't have too many components, so it could also be brought along somewhere if needed without too much hassle.Definitely recommend for someone who doesn't need a printer too often, but would like to have one at home for those unexpected moments. Probably too small and not enough ink for someone who heavily uses a printer (ie - office jobs, work from home, etc.)",

So while I just wanted to plug in the printer to my computer and print, that couldn\u2019t happen (and since it\u2019s a work computer I have to live with what version I have). I was able to connect my phone and print from there no problem though. Came out great, fast. Super easy. I even printed a pic from my phone and it came out awesome. I\u2019m bummed bc it was the perfect printer for what I needed. The scan feature was easy to use too. Perfect size and not a scratch on it. Just double check your computer and system requirements before buying. I wish it worked out because it was real cute",

I wouldn't have this for HEAVY printing or business printing. I have a Brother printer that handles heavier jobs . The printing QUALITY is GOOD.... YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR WI-FI PASSWORD right from the start to SET UP... imo the BIGGEST PROBLEM with this printer is NO INSTRUCTIONS (booklet) included.. you have to GO ONLINE and set up an ACCOUNT (which imo is ALL about you BUYING INK) and follow your way around and YOUR left in the DARK some.... personally I PUSHED buttons and figured it out.... also I made sure I would NOT commit to anything.. Folks \ud83d\ude0a a little instruction booklet would go VERY far to HELP the ease of using and setting up the printer for the whole experience.. anyway, after you figure it out it's OKAY.. I think it goes through INK a little fast.. and from what I'm seeing the INK cartridges are approximately $14 / $15 a piece for generic ink.... The ink cartridge is 65xl- BUT make sure it has the Printer NUMBER listed there 3772.. some say 65 XL with NO 3772 printer listed?? I say this because you know how sometimes the INK cartridges DON'T work when you buy a different brand then HP ink.. anyway \ud83d\ude0a I'm certainly glad I caught it on sale and in my opinion it's NOT a $90/$100 printer and there are others ..but bottom line it's OKAY and it does the job..
