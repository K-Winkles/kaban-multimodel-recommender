The print quality is crisp and clear. I don\u2019t print a lot so I\u2019m sure the printer cartridge will last quite a while. I purchased this as my other printer (that used ink from bottles) stopped working due to the ink drying up and gunking up the print jets. I quickly decided that I wasn\u2019t going that route again, so while searching for a replacement printer, I found this one while it was on sale. I\u2019m happy with this purchase!",

The B&W is fine for us--and so much cheaper. The cartridges last us probably over a year.We have not tried the envelopes function. Easy connection via the HP setup process.Make sure to put the printer on the same WiFi as the laptops/smartphones/iPads in the house.

After weeks of wrangling with this printer I finally just plugged it into a network plug with a Cat cable and finally got it set up to use on the network.
