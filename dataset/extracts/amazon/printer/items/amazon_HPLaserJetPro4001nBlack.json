Quick reliable printing that just works. The downside, printers have not changed designs for MANY years and are kind of antiquated tech that is way past due for an update. The sleep mode serves almost no purpose and has actually caused more issues with the printer not responding and requiring a power cycle to reconnect with the computer.",

I printed a document that was 12 pages long, and it was done in just about the same time as printing one page on my inkjet. The print quality is excellent. It was very easy to set up. I just had to plug it in and download something from HP. The only negatives are that this is NOT a wireless printer. This was not clear to me upon ordering. Also, this printer only prints in black and white. Other than that, fantastic printer!",
