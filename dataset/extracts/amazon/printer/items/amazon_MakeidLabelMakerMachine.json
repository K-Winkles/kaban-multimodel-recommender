                "reviewText": "I purchased and am reviewing this one: https://amzn.to/3PCqp7EUPDATE and adding one more star: You can use your own pictures, so you can, in fact, make your own style and templates! You can create a word in Japanese for example in your favorite graphics editor, then add it to your label!!! GREAT!You CAN make a template in your fav graphics editor, select \"picture\" in the MakeID app, put in on your label and the MakeID app will allow you to type text over the image/picture! Great.Cons:I cannot add my own fonts or templates!I would give this 5 stars across the board otherwise (for the price).BUT, I need OTHER FONTS. I make labels for my Bonsai tree creations and I need a Japanese font.https://amzn.to/3XuQnf2Also, I need to make other templates! The templates included are ridiculous.Can't modify them or even upload your own graphic.No hearts on labels that don't say MOM and just so, so limited.TAPE IS EXPENSIVE. https://amzn.to/3NQGy71At the time I bought this, a roll of tape was almost half the price of the label maker! Ridiculous.So, no 5 star until price of tape comes down.Pros:For a cheap down and dirty label maker, this works.I DO LIKE that you DO NOT HAVE TO create an online account to use this. APP is easy to install.(Words of wisdom: \"NEVER EVER BUY A TOOL in where you are forced to create an online account to use it\". Also, once an app in installed, ANY APP not just this one, go to settings and remove ALL PERMISSIONS for said APP before you do anything else!)So... I pulled this out of the box, moved the included tape in correct position, turned it on, connected to my android via blue tooth and DONE, I made several labels within minutes of opening the box.The app was very easy to use.Seems to hold a charge for a while and I like the portability.Re-iterating - Easy, down and dirty if you need to make some easy, simple labels.Fin:If tape were cheaper (half of what it is now) and I could at least add my own fonts, I would label everything, use for all my projects and buy a couple more of these at this price point, no more.I will update you on longer performance after I go through both rolls of tape.",

                "reviewText": "Updated review as of 2/4/24The company reached out and asked me what the issue was with this label maker and after discussing the issue it was determined that if the battery gets too low for too long it will do a lockout to protect itself. The company offered to send me out a new label maker and it arrived safely and I have had no issues with the new one. I will keep it charged per their instructions in hopes this doesn't happen again. I do love this label maker as the app is simple to use and has a good amount of fonts to download, no emoji's but there are boarders that do have cute designs and that are simple. I do love this label maker but aside from that I wanted to comment on the customer service, they are a small company so they really listened to what the issue was and offered a solution. I, by no means, asked for a replacement as that was them offering it to me but for them to reach out and figure out what the issue was and then fix it was top notch in my book. Thank you Makeid!---------------I purchased this January 24, 2023 and I have only used it enough that I just bought replacement tape in November 2023. I have been trying to charge it for 3 days, it will stay yellow for about 15 minutes then turn a blinking red. If you buy this just be aware it won't last long.",

                "reviewText": "I specifically chose this label printer because I wanted something to use for labeling quick file folder tab inserts, and the 12mm continuous tape is great for that! On an iPhone, the app works seamlessly and it\u2019s very user intuitive. I printed a label a couple of minutes after unboxing. However, the cutter on this label printer sucks! See the photo I posted in my review for reference. I am guessing the cutter isn\u2019t accounting for the curve of the label after it unravels from the roll, so when it slices, it\u2019s a bit off. This crookedness bugs me\u2026but for $15, I\u2019m going to try to ignore my perfectionist mindset because this still beats using a Sharpie for labeling, and the app is so darn easy. I do wonder if there is an upgraded version of this that cuts straight, and maybe I\u2019ll downgrade this printer as a \u201cbackup.\u201dOh and one more thing, the labels for this printer are kind of pricey for the amount you get. I\u2019m hoping to find a generic label tape that\u2019s compatible.",
