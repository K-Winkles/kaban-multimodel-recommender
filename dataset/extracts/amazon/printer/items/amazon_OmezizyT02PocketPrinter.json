The printer only prints in black but there are coloured sticky labels available if you want to brighten up your labels. This printer can print images as well as text - even photo's from your photo album and the great thing is that, unlike thermal printing in the past, these prints are said to last for up to 10 years!With a rechargeable battery and being of such a diminutive size (roughly the size of a matchbox) this is a truly portable device which you could find many different uses for. Highly recommended especially at the current price.",

It charged via USB C and requires you to download an app in order to use it. I am using it with an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it's works perfectly.It comes with one roll of thermal sticky paper which you need to align before first use. You then can design your sticker in the app and it will print. The quality is what I would expect of a sticker printer - not photo quality just simple and basic.I've been using it to print stickers for my meals I've been prepping for work and they adhere well to the plastic tubs.Its currently priced around \u00a337 which I think is a bit too expensive - At this price I'd expect to kit to be a bit more comprehensive with at least the inclusion of some more thermal sticker paper.",
