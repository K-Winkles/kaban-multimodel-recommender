Hopefully as we print pictures we won\u2019t run into this issue again.Ran out of ink after 30 sheets. It is supposed to last 40 sheets!!! The pictures work out to 30 cents each if I can print 40. But the ink ran out at 30 sheets. So I have 10 sheets of paper and no ink. This totally increases the cost per picture and isn\u2019t acceptable! The ink cartridge itself says 40 sheets right on it. I have one other cartridge. We\u2019ll see how long this one lasts. VERY VERY disappointed and feeling cheated.",
