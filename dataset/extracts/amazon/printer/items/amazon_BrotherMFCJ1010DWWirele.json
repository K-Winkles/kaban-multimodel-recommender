I\u2019ve been using a Brother home printer for years so I already knew they offer the quality. This little printer is just sophisticated enough to do everything you could possibly need, but also be VERY user friendly. I was able to set this up in a very short amount of time and my Dad has no trouble using it. I also like the look of it, it\u2019s compact and the screens are easy to see and operate. And for the price, it\u2019s really a great option for home printing! Highly recommend for home office users, even 70ish year-old Dads. \ud83d\ude42",

I\u2019ve owned this less than a year have probably printed 60 black ink only pages and the ink is low already. And now the plug isn\u2019t working. I have to jiggle the plug in the outlet until I hear a buzzing noise and then it will come sometimes come on Takes a few minutes. Probably not safe for me to do this. Bad wiring in the chord / plug. Nice will it worked. Not interested in the instant reorder ink option.just purchased:This was easy for me to set up. I\u2019m only printing black and white documents. Did some scanning of documents to my email and that works fine. I\u2019ve printed less than 50 sheets and the black cartridge is less than 1/2 full. I don\u2019t see ay decent generic ink for this model on amazon. Lc401 or Lc401xl ink. I think the xl version is just more ink, prints more pages. I like the printer but turned off about the lack of generic ink availability. Wish they would charge a fair price for their printers instead of trying to gouge customers after the sale into buying their name brand expensive ink. But it\u2019s been a great printer otherwise. I didn\u2019t need to call tech support when I set this up so can\u2019t speak to that. I\u2019m reasonably intelligent, middle aged and not very technical. Suggest potential buyers search amazon for lc401 black ink so you know what your future cost will a be. Haven\u2019t tried printing photos. Pretty quite too. Would buy again.",

It\u2019s not a laser one that\u2019s used at work where it will inject out pages after pages within seconds but for the price i think it\u2019s a really good printer. It\u2019s great that you are able to instal it pretty easy, but the downside the printer is pretty thirsty per page (PTP). For a hone personal printer I would rate it 4.5 stars if I could for the ease of Installing and the price. The replacement cartridge is also well priced even though it can give little glitches. You can see my other review. Other than that I think it\u2019s solid. Go ahead and click buy if you have been browsing for a while.",

This brother printer is very compact which means it can actually fit on a shelf and not take up half of my office desk like that last canon printer did. I love the wireless printing and setting up the printer for that was dummy proof and only took about 5 minutes. The step by step instructions for that and general set up was very easy to understand and I\u2019m not a technical person. It looks sharp and printed super quickly single sided papers. This is my first time owning a brother but so far I\u2019m happy with it.",

Sent it back and purchased the Brother. What an absolute pleasure to set up the Brother. 5 minutes, it did it all for me. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Up, working, running - like it is supposed to be. WHAT? Not a single call to tech support? WTF!!! Now when do you guys come out with a PC?",

                "reviewText": "Bear in mind this is a day one review.After battling my 10 year old printer for the last time I spent an hour on Amazon reading reviews and comparing printers. I liked what was said about this one and went for it. I did that yesterday. It was here today. Even though it is a completely different setup from my old HP Deskjet, it was pretty easy to get going. The colors are just slightly lighter than my old printer but I'm sure that's just a setting I haven't figured out yet. But the clarity is much better. I thought my old printer was great (when it worked) but this one is much sharper print. BUT!!!! What I absolutely LOVE is ... I am a real estate agent and I make all my own planners, and forms, and I have a lot of MLS sheets and disclosures to print. And THIS little beauty prints both sides WITHOUT me having to do a thing. I just say please do that and it does it! lol What I ALSO love is the paper tray is a pull out on the front so I can push the printer all the way back against the wall. No more wrestling stacks of paper to go in just so. And because of that I think I can just push it under my shelves on my desk.I just printed 39 colored pages in batches of 13 (each one took about 5.5 mins) You can see how much ink was used from the packs that came with the printer out of the box. What I also like is that I can order JUST the color that I am using most of, seems yellow lol, instead of having to replace the whole color cartridge.Honestly, it does everything I need it to do. And the price was insanely good. I'm a happy REALTOR\u00ae ;-)",
