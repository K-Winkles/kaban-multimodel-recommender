It always happens around year 5. I couldn't clean the absorber myself because it's inaccessible. Ink cartridges can still be found for less than $20 (I only use black). Printer will not work without the color cartridge, so leave it in there even when it's empty. Printer comes with both cartridges at purchase!One of the print heads seem to go about year 4 but still legible and ok for my work. I print monthly reports. Very easy to set up although the cord it comes with is kind of short, maybe 3 feet. I used my own cord from my tower to the printer which is 5 feet because I have big desk with two monitors. Great value!",

No where in Amazons description was this mentioned. So now I'm stuck with an unsupported printer in the USA. I will be contacting Amazon for a refund.Edit: Amazon offered a refund. I was able to register it on the Canon Canada site so kept the printer as it was needed to complete a project on time. If it fails I will look at other than Canon for a printer, although the issue probably lies with the seller Amazon uses.",

I have no paper jams like I did with the last machine.Now that I know WHY the ink absorber was full, I don't think it will happen with this machine.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Original review of Pixma MG2525 follows but after the first ink-death, which came too soon, we find that the PG-243 and CL244 cartridges are very short-lived, even in a world of short-lived cartridges. They're also unusually and needlessly awkward to remove. Not terrible, does the jobs, but I think there are better budget Canons. Here's the original review: WELL . . . IT PRINTS AND copies. Like some of you I've been a Canon fan for a long time; this MG2525 replaces a rock-solid, single-function Canon that lasted almost 14 years and printed beautifully even on Draft, then died suddenly. I needed a printer/copier fast with no time for research so here's the scoop: Lightweight, thin plastic, but aren't they all. The USB cable you get is only 3 feet long so if necessary, like for a desktop setup, have a longer one ready. Setup is not really aggravating -- although inserting the cartridges is awkward -- but DO NOT CONNECT with the USB cable until after you've downloaded the software, using either the enclosed disc or from a Canon download: If you do, it will cause you pain. This model doesn't offer wireless connection but it says it scans, which I haven't tried. I think it prints a little faintly on Draft setting, but to be fair I'm comparing it to my terrific old printer; it also copies a bit faintly. Someone told me I should have shaken the cartridges first . . . worth trying next time. It's fast, I'll give it that. Don't put it near the baby's room: It goes KALUNKK! WHIRR! KRAKK! This is a basic okay budget model at a budget price. And there you have it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this printer knowing it was basic. I knew there was no wifi connection. I knew it only worked via USB connection. With that in mind, I purchased it. Because I need a printer.Now, was I under the impression that through various USB adapters I would be able to connect my other devices to it? Yes. But I also have a desktop computer so the fact that I could only use it through desktop is inconvenient, yet still doable.With that in mind, I went through the set up CD steps as ive done numerous times before with various printers in my life. Yet it wouldnt work. Evidently, because I had a more advanced canon printer software already downloaded from previous printers, this model would not finish downloading its set up and as a result, I couldnt use it. I then went to the link provided in the instructions for the canon website to get the software online. The link wouldnt work.So I opted to return the printer as I couldnt get it set up. I was responded to the next day and the agent even remarked upon how other customers run into the same issues but \"that is the model\". Hmm. K. So when I went to print the return label, I come to find that it is NOT prepaid, but a standard \"ship it back yourself\" style label. I was miffed, because Amazon is supposed to provide free shipping up to 20$ on returns. I was left with the impression that I was not warranted a prepaid label, as they were claiming the printer wasnt inoperable but \"that is the model\" I ordered. So I took the hit for 18$ return fee and shipped it to the label the Amazon link gave me, which the return address was in Quebec. Now, I am not new to a return process. I shop on amazon a lot and any seasoned shopper knows you don't always get as advertised. I know how to access a return label. I know how to return a product.Cut to over 2 weeks later. My records show the printer had arrived in Quebec 8 days prior to me reaching out to inquire about my refund, as it had not yet been processed. I get, in my opinion, a condescending email from a different agent, claiming I had not followed the \"step by step\" directions from the previous agent, and had used an \"incorrect shipping method\" instead. They also claimed that they did send me a prepaid shipping label, and therefore they are not on the hook for refunding my shipping expense because I apparently elected not to use the correct label. I wasnt even asking them to refund my shipping, but yet they felt the need to add some salt to the wound. Now again, I know how returns work, it was NOT prepaid when it was printed. Even the person I had print for me (as I had no printer) commented on how it was NOT prepaid, because as an avid amazoner herself, she too was surprised.He issued the refund, and then I checked my return lable again as my return status had changed. NOW it was showing a prepaid label, this one was not going to Quebec, it was addressed within Ontario. Wtf. Like Im sorry but you can't just change the label type AND address and claim that *I* did it wrong and \"didnt follow directions\". Classic \"covering their own butts\" tactics here.Overall, printer was too out of date to be functional, and customer service gives you the runaround. I bought an Epson Ecotank from Staples instead. You get what you pay for!",
