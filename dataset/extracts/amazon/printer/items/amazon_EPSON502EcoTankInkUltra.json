When it comes time to buy more ink, you save up to 80 percent on low-cost replacement ink bottles (2). Plus, these ink bottles feature exclusive autostop technology, with each color uniquely keyed for easy filling of each tank. Ideal for everyday printing, these ultra high-capacity inks mean you can go longer before replacing them for an unbeatable combination of value (3) and convenience. 1. Replacement ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit our official site. 2. Savings comparison based on the purchase cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the manufacturers\u2019 online prices and yields for the highest-capacity cartridges for the best-selling, similarly featured consumer inkjet printers priced at $499 or less per NPD, July 2016. Actual savings will vary based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. 3. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 150 pages (ET-2700, ET-2750), 300 pages (ET-3700, ET-3750, ET-4750).",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that the ultra-high capacity of this ink bottle is an absolute game-changer. With a whopping 127 mL capacity, I can print thousands of pages before needing to refill the tank. This means fewer trips to the store, less time wasted on cartridge replacements, and more money saved in the long run.The quality of the ink is equally impressive. The black text comes out razor-sharp with outstanding contrast, making it perfect for printing professional documents and reports. The ink also dries quickly and is resistant to smudging and fading, ensuring that my prints maintain their high-quality appearance over time.One of my favorite features of this ink bottle is its drip-free nozzle design. It makes refilling the ink tank a breeze, with no messy spills or wasted ink. The bottle itself is also compact and lightweight, making it easy to store and transport.As an environmentally conscious shopper, I'm pleased to note that the EPSON T502 EcoTank Ink is manufactured using eco-friendly processes and contains less plastic than traditional ink cartridges. This makes it a more sustainable choice, and I appreciate that I'm doing my part to reduce waste.Overall, I can't recommend the EPSON T502 EcoTank Ink Ultra-high Capacity Bottle Black (T502120-S) enough. With its impressive capacity, exceptional quality, ease of use, and sustainability, it's a no-brainer for anyone looking to streamline their printing experience.",

Black print is fine; color is pretty true to life but somewhat fainter than optimal; my wife's HP gives a more crisp color output. Printing time is a bit slow but acceptable; I like the available two-sided printing when I'm doing multiple pages. Footprint is nice; the machine doesn't take up a lot of room. Control display is very small and not always easy to read--this feature seems like it would be easy enough for Epson to improve. Setting up the connections (I used WiFi) took longer than I would think it needed, but I did get through it. Overall a good printer, and I like the \"tank\" ink system.",

                "reviewText": "I have had my printer now for a little over three years and have just now, for the first time, filled all the ink tanks and I do a fair amount of printing. My total page count is over 3500. The ink arrived intact with absolutely no leakage. Each of the tanks filled perfectly and I still had about 1/4 of a bottle left over for each color. I know there are a lot of aftermarket brands of ink out there but quite honestly, it just doesn't make sense to buy a knockoff in order to save a couple of dollars a year. With my previous HP printer, I had been replacing at least one of the color cartridges every couple of months. As consumers, we have been complaining for years about the high cost of replacement cartridges and asking the manufacturers to produce just one printer where we could refill it with bulk ink. Epson has done that and has priced the ink quite reasonably. In the last three years I have only had to run a printhead cleaning cycle a couple of times when I noticed that there was a slight degradation in the print quality and it was corrected immediately. The print and picture quality is quite good. I just don't see any reason not to buy original Epson ink. I support the manufacturer that supported the consumers.",
