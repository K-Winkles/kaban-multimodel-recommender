                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5)I recently purchased a Brother brand printer, and it has proven to be a reliable workhorse with a few minor quirks. Here's my detailed review:Setup & Connectivity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)The initial setup and Wi-Fi connectivity proved to be a bit challenging. Unlike some other printers that come with detailed instructions, the Brother printer's setup process felt less intuitive. Connecting it to Wi-Fi took a few attempts and required a bit of patience. It would be immensely helpful if the setup process were more user-friendly.Cable Not Included: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)One notable drawback was the absence of a USB cable in the box. While many printers come with a USB cable for wired setup, this one didn't include one. This could be an inconvenience for users who prefer a wired connection or don't have a spare cable on hand. However, this is a minor issue as most setups nowadays are wireless.Performance & Print Quality: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5)Once I had the printer up and running, it performed admirably. Printing quality was excellent, with sharp text and vibrant colors for photos. It handled various paper sizes and types with ease, making it suitable for both everyday document printing and occasional photo printing.Speed & Efficiency: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5)The Brother printer proved to be impressively fast, particularly for its price range. It spat out pages with impressive speed and efficiency, which is a huge plus for busy households or small offices where time is of the essence.Reliability & Durability: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5)Reliability is where this Brother printer truly shines. It consistently delivered crisp prints without paper jams or other hiccups. The build quality feels solid, suggesting that it should hold up well over time, making it a long-term investment.Additional Features: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)The printer comes with a range of useful features, such as automatic duplex printing, which helps save on paper costs. It also has mobile printing capabilities, allowing you to print from your smartphone or tablet. However, some users might miss the absence of a touch screen or a more intuitive control panel.Value for Money: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)Despite the initial setup challenges and the missing USB cable, the Brother brand printer offers excellent value for its price. Its performance, reliability, and print quality make it a strong contender in the market.In conclusion, the Brother brand printer is a dependable workhorse that excels in performance, reliability, and print quality. While the setup process could be more user-friendly, and the absence of a USB cable was a minor inconvenience, these issues can be overcome with a bit of patience and an extra cable purchase. Once set up, this printer delivers exceptional results, making it a worthwhile investment for home or small office printing needs.It would have been my fault to setup the wifi connect so I'm giving 5 stars overall.",

                "reviewText": "So, for awhile now, I've been considering getting a laser printer since inkjet printers have not been kind to me, at least ink wise. I don't print stuff off very often, like once a month at most, so with an inkjet the ink would dry up or whatever by the time I used it again so even after like getting it to work or whatever, I would have to buy a new cartridge. Which, considering how expensive ink is these days, I could easily buy a cheap inkjet printer for $30 which is less than the cost of the ink for some brands and just buy a new printer every time the ink ran out.So, to avoid that, I decided to go with a laser printer. I rarely ever need to print in color. If I do need to print in color, I'll spend the few cents and go to Office Depot or a friend's house, but most of my printing needs are satisfied with black and white prints. (I play D&D so I mostly just need to print off character sheets and basic maps so black and white is all I need) and I knew I wanted to get a Brother it was just a matter of which one.I looked at a few different models and finally decided on this one since it had all the stuff I needed to do. Automatic 2 sided printing, scanning, copying, print from wifi or mobile device. I don't need fax but I definitely needed to at least scan stuff so this is definitely a good middle ground. It's a bit big so you'll have to make sure you have room for it. It's about a foot tall and about as deep as my dresser (which is where I keep it at the moment. I'll probably move it to the closet sooner or later)It prints FAST! I printed out almost 200 pages (double sided) in like half an hour give or take. It's definitely fast, and the quality is amazing! The text is crisp and pristine. Pictures aren't the same quality like on an inkjet printer. They look fine, but that's not what this is meant for. This is meant for office work like documents with maybe a few graphs here and there.It's quiet-ish. It's definitely quieter than some other printer's I've used, but it's not like whisper quiet. Unless everyone in the house is a light sleeper, I don't see why it would wake anyone up.Set up was fairly simple. It took awhile for me since my internet speeds are VERY slow (which doesn't impact the printing) so it took forever to download the software onto my laptop in order to print stuff, but if you have decently fast internet speeds the download shouldn't take too long. After it got downloaded it was only a few clicks away from being set up.But honestly, my friend bought the same one a few years earlier (I didn't know this when I bought it just a fun coincidence) she's still using the toner that came with the printer and she hasn't had to buy more toner once. So yeah, I don't have to worry about buying toner for AWHILE! But seriously, this was the best $100 I've spent. Definitely worth it.",

The speed is excellent, the quality is excellent and it was easy to set up. I almost bought a laser printer that was a bit less expensive but after doing some research I decided on this one because the print quality is better and it also has WiFi which makes installation and printing from multiple computers a breeze. I am very satisfied with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have an HP LaserJet that I have owned for a few years. Printed pages from it are tack-sharp, it was easy to setup, and has never had a problem. This Brother printer/scanner is none of that. The prints (and scans) are not crisp and sharp, but they're not terrible. The setup was a little laborious and required more tech savviness than it should. The printer case, lid, access panels, etc., all feel a little flimsy, especially compared to my HP printer. That said, this Brother printer costs quite a bit less, so I think you get what you pay for. I've only had it for a couple of days, so I can't comment on its durability, but I will update this review if I encounter any problems.",
