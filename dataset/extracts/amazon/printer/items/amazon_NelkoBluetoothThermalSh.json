I have only used this item via the app on my iPhone. The app lets you print via images or files so it makes it pretty easy. Overall I have no complaints.",

I couldn\u2019t be happier! It\u2019s super easy to use and I do everything right from my phone! You download the app and you can purchase your shipping label right through eBay (or whatever selling platform you\u2019re using) and open it up in the provided app, I rotate, crop, and print\u2026. it\u2019s that simple. Shipping was the one thing that kept me from selling online but I\u2019m glad I tried it and this printer makes it so incredibly easy anyone can do it! It\u2019s also thermal so you never need to buy anything except labels! No ink required! It also comes with a very generous amount of labels, 50 I Think!",

So convenient, efficient, and fast.It saved me from spending on cartridge, paper and the label sleeve when needed to ship.I purchased the other thermal printers, spent over 2 hours to try to figure out how to install and operate. I ended up returning it and switching to this one.This one took me 5min to install and print the label easily.Pros: fast, convenient as it has bluetooth where I can print from upstairs or downstairs, space efficient (so small and light), cost efficient Cons: sometimes it doesn\u2019t print straight from the label provided from the stores. I have to save it to my photo library in order to print the label wirelessly. But it\u2019s quick to compromise this cons anyways.Overall, i\u2019m happy with the purchase. I should\u2019ve purchased a while ago.It would be the best if I can print this directly from the app without transferring to my photo library.5 stars from me!!! Recommended!Well, after 2 weeks I used the product. Not sure how long it will last! It is another story :)",

Die Bluetooth Verbindung \u00fcber Handy sowie \u00fcber Laptop klappt schnell und reibungslos. Man stellt die korrekte Etikettengr\u00f6sse ein und dann kann es auch schon losgehen. Wir drucken damit nur DHL Versandlabels und das klappt gut, sowohl mit der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der originalen DHL Etiketten (103x199 , dazu muss man allerdings im Drucker bei den Druckeinstellungen ein Custom Label anlegen mit den passenden Ma\u00dfen, also 103x199). Mit den Labels, die dabei waren (4\u201c x 6\u201c) klappt es auch. Hier sollte man allerdings die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe im DHL Gesch\u00e4ftskundenportal vorher anpassen. Aber alles kein Aufwand. Nun zum wichtigsten, der Drucker erkennt sich automatisch die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe indem man neue Labels einfach einlegt und die Taste auf den Drucker etwa 3 Sekunden dr\u00fcckt. Danach f\u00e4hrt der Drucker das eingelegte Label mehrfach ab und kennt dann die Ma\u00dfe und alles ist kalibriert. Die St\u00e4rke sollte man etwas hochdrehen, ich habe sie bei 8, damit sind alle Barcodes perfekt lesbar. Und au\u00dferdem druckt der Drucker sehr schnell. Das perfekt ger\u00e4t f\u00fcr kleinere Firmen, die nicht 100e Label am Tag drucken. Anders auch wenn es mal mehr wird, macht der Drucker eine gute Figur. Kloster Empfehlung!",
