                "reviewText": "Just got my label printer and has been great so far - Easy to use and easy to print from my phone. I just wish that we could automatically print whatever we needed without going into the app and just have it connected and print from whatever screen that needs to be printed. But overall it was a smooth and easy process and now i can just print my shipping labels for poshmark and slap it on the package instead of printing then cutting then taping. Such a great thing to have and happy i purchased. It also printed clear and easy to install.",
