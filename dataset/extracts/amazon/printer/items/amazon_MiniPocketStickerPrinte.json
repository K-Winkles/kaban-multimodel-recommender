                "reviewText": "I got this for my daughter who loves to take pictures, especially of animals. This printer is really easy to connect to the phone, in a minute or less. It comes with everything needed to start having fun with it right away. I did get her the pink version and it is absolutely adorable. It comes with a lot of paper which I am very grateful for because it means it will be a while before I have to order more.The Kit comes with a charging cord which is awesome and will save me money since I don't have to worry about batteries. It also comes with markers that add a little color to the printouts in black and white. One issue we've found is that the pictures do not tear off perfectly. Some were even ripped in half when trying to be extra careful. Now she uses scissors to cut them off and now they're all perfectly separated into their own pictures without them ripping apart. It is small enough for her to take it with her anytime she wants to go out and about. This is a wonderful pocket sticker printer set that we are all enjoying as she prints out her wonderful pictures.",

I have been looking for a mini printer but so many lack quality or come with only 1 roll of paper. This kit comes with a variety (and plenty of it!) Of paper. One blue, one pink, 4 sticker rolls and 5 regular paper rolls. That is a wonderful bonus.Not only super cute, but it prints out images, photos and text beautifully. Amazing quality for being so compact and amazing value too.This is easy to use and installing the paper is simple.I have installed the app and printed pictures from their clip art vault (pic shown as examples), as well as my own photos and also images I downloaded from the Internet. All are wonderful considering the size and that this is thermal paper. My favorite thing to do is print out my son's favorite cartoon characters, and then we color them in and make them into bookmarks (laminating afterwards) or stick them in our scrapbook.The battery life seems to last for a while too. I have used it many, many times over the last 2 weeks, and only charged once so far.I honestly 100% think this is excellent value and would order again if I needed to, or gift as a present.",
