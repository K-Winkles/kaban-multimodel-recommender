                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars XL ink tanks cost per page vs. non-XL (i.e., regular ink tanks) cost per page",
                "reviewText": "I did a little research using adjusted cost per page when the products were bought at Amazon and the bottom line is, it is cheaper to purchase individual XL tanks for the 4 color tanks than it is to purchase a 4 pack of the regular ink tanks, despite the seemingly great looking price of the 4 pack.You can basically stop here. From this point on I go into detail, including some math, as to how I arrived at this conclusion. If you are interested in the background, please feel free to read on.At the time I wrote this, I saw on Amazon that they are selling packs 4 regular ink tanks, one of each color (Y, C, M, BK) for $37.94, which is about $9.485 (bear with my fractional cents here, there's a purpose) making it cheaper per ink tank than Canon's list price of an individual regular ink tank of $11.99. So it got me thinking, is the XL really cheaper than the regular-sized ink cartridge 4 packs? Canon's list for the XL tanks are $17.99 and Amazon cells the same XL ink tanks for $16.99, some XL color ink tanks on Amazon at the time I wrote this are even cheaper at $15.06 per cartridge. I did the math at the more costly $16.99 to show there is a savings at this price, meaning there will be more of a savings for the XL color cartridges that cost $15.06.Let me explain with math:I found a web site review of the MX922, that actually broke down the retail ink tank cost to a per page price. At Canon retail prices, the regular-sized ink tanks cost $0.166/page (16.6 cents/page) and the XL at retail cost $0.128/page (12.8 cents/page). Now that gives me a baseline to which I can figure out the cost per page of Amazon's price on an individual tank in the 4pack vs. an individual price of an XL tank on Amazon.The math goes along these lines:Cost of the regular tanks in the 4 pack when bought on Amazon is: $0.136 per page a.k.a., 13.6 cents per page compared to Canon's retail on the regular tanks of $0.166 (16.6 cents/page). [If you want the math, here it is: (($0.166) x ($9.485)) / $11.99 = $0.136]Cost of the XL tanks per page when bought on Amazon is: $0.121 a.k.a., 12.1 cents per page (rounded up the last digit) compared to Canon's retail on the XL tanks of $0.128 (12.8 cents/page) [If you want the math, here it is: (($0.128) x ($16.99)) / $17.99 = $0.121]Summary:Canon regular tanks bought in the 4 pack at Amazon costs 13.6 cents per pageCanon XL tanks bought at Amazon costs 12.1 cents per page (even less for the XL tanks that cost $15.06)Bottom line:Despite the great price break of the 4 pack, it is still cheaper per page to buy the individual XL tanks.The baseline prices of retail Canon ink tanks were done in a review of the MX922 printer and the review included the printer's ink usage cost for the different size tanks. The review was conducted by a third party meaning their website is outside of amazon.com (and canon.com for that matter). Amazon rules say I cannot provide a link to the external web page that reviewed the product and it's per page price testing. All I can say is, those really are the results of the research and I did this cost break down in this review because I am in need of purchasing all ink cartridges and am now going to be buying all individual XL ink tanks as a result of my research into the Amazon cost per page breakdown. I thought I'd share what I figured out in cost savings since this stuff is pricey to begin with. 12.1 cents per page is still pretty pricey, (ouch!), but my printer is about out of ink in each of the tanks that came with it. I have to bite the bullet and purchase the XL tanks now (I need to do more grey scale printing to save on buying all the color tanks every time!).Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "Sure am glad that I have Amazon Prime. I received these ink cartridges in 2 days. My Canon MX922 bulk black ink ran out. You need to refill inkjet cartridges ASAP to prevent the printing head from drying out. I learned that the hard way. My last Canon MX922 had the ink cartridge run out and I took my time getting a new cartridge. The print head dried out and never worked correctly again. I tried cleaning it but that did not work. A new print head cost almost as much as a new printer. I bought the new printer. Now I never let the ink dry out. Ink cartridges are much cheaper than a new printer is. The Canon MX922 printer does a great job of printing directly on DVDs. I bought a complete set of ink cartridges and an extra bulk black cartridge to replace the one that ran out. I will buy another complete set when I start using this complete set so that I will always have new cartridges on hand. These inkjet cartridges and my MX922 print almost as good as my Canon color laser printer does.",
