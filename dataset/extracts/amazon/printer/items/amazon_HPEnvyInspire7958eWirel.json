                "reviewText": "DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRINTER. I run a business. I needed a new printer. I paid over $200 for this printer. What they FAIL to tell you about this printer is if you do not want to subscribe to HP's ink service you cannot use the printer with the ink they sell. We got the free subscription with the printer and as soon as the trial ended I couldn't use the printer unless I paid the subscription. So I kept the subscription for a month after and got the bill and they charged me for printing \"too many\" invoices because you can only print 100 pages for $6 a month. How are you going to charge people to print the paper THEY PAID FOR on the printer THEY PAID FOR because you want to greedily continue to charge people when they already paid for the product. I decided to cancel the subscription because the whole idea behind it is bogus, but they still sent new ink in the mail because it was reading low before I cancelled the subscription. The subscription cancels, the next day I go to print off invoices, and I have an error message saying I cannot use the brand new ink cartridges they sent me because they're only usable with the subscription and cannot print a single page on MY PRINTER, that I PAID FOR, with the paper I BOUGHT because I choose not to subscribe. Not to mention the plans they have for you to choose from are just absolutely ridiculous. They limit the amount of pages you can print with each plan varying from 10-700 (at $.99/month-$24.99/month). Who the f wants to pay more just to use THEIR PRINTER AS MUCH AS THEY SO CHOOSE TO. So unless you want to pay $50 for each ink cartridge in stores, or pay every month to subscribe and over pay if you actually use your printer, buy something else.Also, it cannot print more than one page at a time on single sheets even with double-sided deselected. You have to print ONE PAGE AT A TIME or rip the first page out before it sucks it back in and starts to print on the back even when you tell it not to.find something else. for the love of god, find a different printer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a failed Canon megatank printer, which had a litany of issues. One of them was that the nozzles would be clogged whenever I went to use it. I was looking at laser printers when I came across this unit at a price I couldn't pass up. And since the print heads are part of the ink cartridges, I figured clogged nozzles wouldn't be an issue.I was wrong.I print only intermittently - a couple of times a month or less, though some of those jobs are many pages long. The first month this printer was great. Always ready and prints were acceptable. And then nozzles started clogging. Easy fix - clean them. But that uses ink. Expensive ink. Two months after purchase I had to run a cleaning cycle before every print job. Not acceptable. I just replaced the first set of tanks today, and I'm disappointed to report that even after a printhead alignment (which uses ink) large dark areas are still \"bandy\". This is NOT a photographic printer, and I didn't expect it to be. But I did expect consistent, even coverage in large areas of color. It does not deliver.The good: Setup was easy. Software automatically finds the printer on each PC, Mac, or phone. It's fairly quiet (in quiet mode) and reasonably fast. The scan/copy functions work as expected.Print quality for text is good. Pages of text with small graphics look great.Auto duplexing (printing on the back side of the paper) was a nice surprise.The bad:It's ugly. Ok, that's subjective, but to me it is. The software package is heavy and it wants each user to register for HP's instant Ink service. Only one user needs to do this. The software works if you don't register, but it would be nice if that was made more clear during the install.The touch screen is not terribly responsive and there is no feedback. The paper tray cover, which is also the output tray, does not easily slide into place.Ink doesn't last long. That's the reason I went with a megatank printer last time. Ink tank life is reduced by the need to clean the nozzles every time I print. Did I mention that ink is expensive?Print quality for pictures is sub par. Dark areas are bandy. It's probably acceptable for a picture embedded in a report, for example. I wouldn't expect to use a printed picture on display in a frame.With moderately frequent use, a couple of times a week or more, this is probably a good printer. If you're like me and sometimes go months between prints, this is not your printer. But then, most likely no inkjet is.One last note, in case HP reads this. The Canon that this printer replaced lasted well over a year before I had nozzle clog issues. This printer didn't make it three months.",
