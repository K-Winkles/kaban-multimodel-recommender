It is shoved in in such a way that it is obvious this printer did not print the test print.I've tested several label printers.

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Easy Setup...Fast Printing... But the Print Quality is Meh.",
                "reviewText": "I have two businesses that ship physical products. For years I've been printing my shipping labels on plain paper, cutting them out and taping them to the boxes. That was ok until my businesses started booming and I had to ship out 100+ packages per day. I needed a more efficient way to tackle the shipping process. That's where this little thermal printer comes into play.PROS====1) EAST SETUP = All you need is two open USB ports for the setup process. Plug the printer into a port. Plug in the included USB key. Choose the driver (Windows or Mac) and double-click the file. The driver installs in 30 seconds and the printer is ready to use. ** If you don't have two open USB ports, don't sweat it. You can just plug in the USB key and copy the drivers to your computer, unplug the USB key, then plug the printer in and run the setup file. Easy peasy!2) FAST = If you're used to a regular inkjet or laser printer, you're gonna be as surprised as I was at the speed this thermal printer can pump out labels. I mean... it's practically instant. You can print a label per second!CONS=====1) PRINT QUALITY - Well... I love how fast this printer can print. But the quality isn't that great. I mean, for shipping labels it will be fine. I wouldn't go printing bridal invitation labels or anything like that on this printer. The letters are a little blocky and washed out. Just not sharp like an inkjet or laserjet printer is.Overall, I have to give this printer 4 stars based on price, ease of setup, and printing speed. If the print quality was a little better, this would definitely be a 5-star product. Would I recommend this to a friend with a business that needs a label printer? I definitely would!",

Huge plus!It cranks out shipping labels in no time! My ink jet is slower. The print quality isn't the clearest but I don't need it to be perfect! Just legible enough for shipping.

                "reviewText": "I am rather interested in that \"test\" label that was shoved in the back of this. It is absolutely perfect. I mean, not a smudge, not a missed millimeter of print. I have tried 4 different 4x6 labels from 4 different brands, and none of them come out that perfect. I have a feeling that those test labels are a complete lie.Setting this up wasn't that difficult. I have no idea what I did with that little USB drive that came with the drivers on it, but finding the drivers online wasn't that difficult. If you find yourself in that situation, just google MUNBYN and then go to support, and look for ITPP130. Plug the printer in, turn it on and then install the drivers. Windows 11 had zero problems recognizing and then using this. To load this, you just stick the label in the back and then press the feed button. It should load it automatically, but it can be rather difficult to get it to use the first label. It usually wants to spit out the first one and use the one behind it.Printing is like any other printer. Thankfully, windows 11 already knew it should be using 4x6 labels, so that was done for me. The teeth for cutting the labels do a pretty bad job compared to other label printers I have used. They cut, but the results are always pretty jagged.Right now, I am using a roll of 4x6 shipping labels. It will feed the next one, but I end up needing to adjust it because this didn't come with any sort of stand for label support. I suppose I could try to 3D print something, but for the price, a little plastic stand isn't asking for much.",
