                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this printer mainly for printing ID cards using brainstorm's MP tray. It works beautifully; see the video. The print is almost perfect, with the exception of a little Cyan ink spill on top of the reverse side (not shown). I also printed some 5x7 photos, and they are slightly better than my HP OfficeJet 3830. It appears that this printer prints with a higher resolution. To be fair, I was using the Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II on both printers.Here are the bad parts Canon can improve (if they care):1. The LED/LCD screen is almost NOT readable! I thought I had received a lemon and was about ready to return it. Now I can get by with a flashlight, hahaha!2. The WiFi setup instructions suck, big time! Canon video instruction also sucks! I ended up watching a video that shows how you can connect it with onscreen instructions to do it manually. P.S. the setup process does not work with dual-band WiFi. Just spend a minute to do it manually by entering the password for your WiFi, a minor hassle.Other than that, the printer is excellent (so far)!1. Good print quality2. Large input tray, plus top loading3. Multipurpose tray for CD (included) and ID badge from the third party4. Relatively fast5. Cheap (not sure about the ink yet)Update (02-08-23): I tested it with 120 lbs 325 GSM cardstock, and amazingly it works beautifully! Settings: 5x7, rear tray, cardstock, best quality. Another pleasant surprise - the printer prints 2-sided documents pretty fast. The draft quality looks fantastic. Lastly, the bundled ink lasts for a long time. I printed 10+ full-color 5x7 photos, and it is still 1/3 being used. Will see.If you are not 100% happy with any desktop inkjet printers that are 3 years or older, recycle them and get this one. :) P.S. this may be true for any newer models, Epson, HP, Brother, etc. Technology is just making them so much better nowadays. I chose Canon because of its multipurpose tray.",

Also Prints at Decent speed. Quality is Excellent. I also love the fact that it's Wireless.... Which brings me to my one complaint. Sometimes when turning the printer on and getting ready to print... It's slow about being recognized by the computer. I'm assuming it has something to do with my wifi network, so maybe that's just a problem I have, I don't know... but I have turned the printer on and a minute after it boots up, I try to print, and the computer tells me the printer is not ON. Not always but Sometimes the Printer takes about 30 to 60 seconds to recognize the command. Then it starts printing and Everything is fine. But overall. Great Printer.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Win 10 PC. The printer replaces my 4 year old iP7200 which stopped printing in color and problems with the paper rollers. The TS702a is an excellent printer in terms of print quality....once you get it installed.The installation setup was puzzling. I carefully followed all the steps in the Getting Started booklet, downloaded the set-up file, clicked Start Setup and went through the motions, selecting UBS cable connection, but the driver installation failed. Next thing I know, the printer is printing out the alignment patterns. The little screen (why Canon couldn't rig up a tiny backlight for illumination is beyond me) then went to normal configuration showing the 5 squares for each color. I had to add the printer to my Windows Devices directory in Settings and was able to print out a test page. However, the driver was not listed in the Control Panel-Programs directory. OK..let's see what happens. I picked out a sample text from Documents, selected Print and, voila, out it came.I decided to delete the printer from the Devices list and delete the downloaded setup software and start from scratch, this time setting it up for wireless connection to my router. Same thing... everything went well except the driver installation failed again. But, as before, I was able to operate the printer (after reinstalling it in the Devices directory), but the driver still was not listed in the Programs directory. Hey...if it works, let it be! I'll be calling Canon tech support about all this.Draft print speed is very good, but duplex printing is very slow. It takes a full 15 seconds to go from the end of printing on one side of the page to the start of printing on the other side. On my old iP7200, the cycle was completed in less than half the time. Very disappointing.Finally, you have to remember to pull out the output tray before you print or you'll get an error message on your monitor. With the iP7200, there's no tray, but a door that opens automatically if you forgot to do it when you start to print. But the main thing is that if it prints text well and has good, accurate color graphics and photos, I'll be happy.",
