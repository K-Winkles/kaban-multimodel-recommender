The quality isn\u2019t the greatest as far as sharpness and clarity. However, she's just using it to play with and it works great for her. She loves being able to have her own printer to use with her iPad. It's easy to use with the app. It's a great price to!",

The only change I would make it for the tear teeth to be towards the top rather than the bottom of where the paper exits. It feels more natural to tear the paper in that direction.",

This printer requires putting an app on your phone to connect with the printer. The final picture size on my test print was 1-3/4\u201d x 1-1/4\u201d. The paper it uses is essentially receipt paper. It came with 5 rolls of paper, 5 rolls of sticker paper and some small markers for coloring. The paper is easy to replace in the printer. It\u2019s a cute printer for kids to play with, but that\u2019s about it.",
