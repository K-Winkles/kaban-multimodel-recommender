                "reviewText": "This is a great little affordable printer option if you want to print out messages, small pictures or drawings, etc. It works really well depending on what you're trying to print. If you try to print a high quality photo, it isn't going to do a good job because that isn't what this printer is meant for. Since it is thermal, everything is printed in black and white and it won't show up the same way as the original picture. I wouldn't get this if you're wanting something to print photographs quickly. It is great for printing drawn versions of your pictures, text, small documents or files, etc. There is an app that you use with it that has tons of other printing features as well.",

                "reviewText": "I did not know what to expect when I first got this product. It shipped very fast and came in a professional box with everything that you need. What excites me the most about this product is how easy it is to use and the functionality. All you need to do is to download the app and connect it wirelessly through Bluetooth which is flawless not always the case with some of the items that I buy. It also comes with plenty of rolls both receipt paper and sticker paper. I really love the app because it is so versatile with so many different options. The main reason that I got this is to make label stickers for my travels so if I lose an item people know how to contact me and it is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I was not impressed with the print quality, but my kids were. It was incredibly easy to connect it to our devices wirelessly, and the app has a few fun things to do, such as printing photos from the camera roll or even describing something to the AI to design and print. The paper it comes with is rolled up very small and tight, so no matter what we print it immediately curls up. Overall it's fun for kids.",

I like that it came with a decent amount of paper/stickers...5 sticker rolls and 5 additional thermal paper rolls, with a full additional roll already loaded...so 11 rolls total. A set of mini marker, and the charger were included, as well. The app is easy to load and use, and I had this printing in just a couple minutes. The quality of the printer and the print quality itself is pretty good for a mini printer. I am very happy with this order!",

                "reviewText": "This little printer is fun, and it comes with quite a lot of paper, both regular rolls and adhesive-backed rolls. Setting it up was easy. We downloaded the phone app, opened up the connection tab, and it paired right away.2 quick negatives to note. The app has crashed a couple times. Not too big of a deal to open it right back up when it happened though. The other is the print quality has a defect. You can see in the photo there is a white line. It seems like there\u2019s a defect in that one part of the print mechanism which causes a \u201clighter\u201d zone as it prints.It is very easy to swap out paper rolls. You just flip open the front door, pull out the old, drop in the new. There are no complicated parts to fiddle with. Both the regular rolls and adhesive sticker rolls work well. My son (8) uses the app to make looooooong sticker signs to attach to his sister\u2019s door when she\u2019s not looking. Oh this reminds me, the adhesive on the included rolls is really strong. I got this for my kids to use, but I think you could get some good work done with it like labeling work related items, storage bins, or probably a million other creative use cases.",

It connected quickly via its app and the print time is only a few seconds. I think it's great for printing neat images for our kiddos or if you're wanting to print individual name tags (rolls of stickers) included as well as standard thermal paper. Overall, a very good value in a compact size portable to almost anywhere.",
