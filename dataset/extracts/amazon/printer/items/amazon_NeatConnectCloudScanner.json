Backing up my database to the cloud has taken many weeks with no end in sight and virtually no help at all from the Neat Co. I finally had to stop uploading and will resume trying to get this done when I have several weeks to spare. Rather than a time saver this product has become a time waster.",

The software is not nearly as intuitive as they advertise and the scanner it self jams and misfeeds commonly. I was \"upgrading\" from a NeatDesk Desktop scanner after the feed motor died to the NeatConnect thinking and hoping surely a newer model has been upgraded and feeds better. No, it doesn't other than the shape has changed they added wifi and NeatCloud support it is exactly the same scanner with exactly the same problems.Now I've been using neat for about 5 years. I have a lot of information saved in my Neat software. I wouldn't know how to transfer all the info (or it wouldn't be easy even if i had the time to) or I would try something else.

The scanner can be controlled by dedicated desktop software which works in conjunction with the \"cloud\" service to process files.

In going back to the previous version, now what I have in the \"cloud\" is not exactly the same as what I have on my computer and I'm afraid of losing files as well as the chance that there are probably files missing that I'll just never know of until I look to retrieve them if the IRS comes and does an audit of past years.The scanner is impressively fast and quite good quality. It does though have trouble feeding the first sheet at times and occasionally wraps and destroys a receipt in it's rollers.I'm getting the job done but I am hoping the lost and shredded documents don't come back to bite me in the...",
