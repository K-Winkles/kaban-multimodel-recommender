I had to install the Ap to set up the printer, but it would not let me print from my graphic programs (Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, etc). HP customer service was able to help me with the problem. I had to Uninstall the Printer Driver on the Mac and then download a new driver and install it. Once I did that, the printer has worked for my graphic programs. I use a wireless connection. The colors printed are just as they should be. I do like that the inkwells are on the front of the machine so you can keep track of the ink supply.",

Was very easy using the HP Smart app which has a step by step visual instruction for removing all the tape and stabilization inserts along with a pretty forward step by step set up.I did have a small issue with the installation of the Printer Heads. I think it was mostly my fault due to my printer table being quite low and I was sitting up higher. Anyhow..one of the heads was a tad bit off center and I couldn't perform the alignment and scan functions. I eventually used the Virtual Diagnostic in the app and it scans my printer then proceeded to give instructions to remedy the issue.Worked really well and my Printer Heads got seated properly and when I ran a print function from the printable things option a really nice crisp pic of Santa came out.Afterwards I printed out a study manuel. I Ran off about 200 sheetsflawlessly with no jams or extra blank pages from the feeder grabbing more than one sheet. I did 'Fan' my paper prior to placing on the feeder and I also only placed 30-40 sheets in at a time. The paper capacity is supposed to be 100 sheets. I'm very impressed! I like the light weight and compact size as well. Good price for a little work horse.",

                "reviewText": "The printer was pretty easy to put together, and is nice and compact. I'm not thrilled with it though because it's difficult to connect to when I'm trying to print. I don't have to print papers everyday, just maybe 1-3 times a week. Every time I go to print something, the printer is off, can't connect, doesn't have a signal etc. I find this pretty frustrating as it's advertised as a smart wireless printer. Overall it still works and prints fine, but constant disconnecting is quite annoying.",

That\u2019s one of shortfalls, with all other actions being done through the app or through the online access.It is quite a fast printer.One downfall that I can\u2019t seem to figure out, is Eprint. For my HP printers of the past I\u2019ve always relied on Eprint when I\u2019m traveling or just using my phone in the house, and send an email, with a document attached to the printer via Eprint.If there is a way to make eprint work, I could use some help.",

It came with plenty of refillable ink cartridges and the color images I have printed so far are crisp and bright. Good luck on your search!",

The entire process took maybe 15 minutes. This test page I printed was just perfect. It prints a little slow but not unbearable. My only complaint is that when you aren\u2019t using it, it makes incredibly loud clicking noises. I\u2019m going to end up moving it out of my room or that is going to wake me up at night (hence the 4 stars). Otherwise I am incredibly happy with it! Ignore the review that complained about taking all the orange pieces out.the app walks you through and it took about 4 seconds to remove them. So far- I highly recommend this printer !",

                "reviewText": "We have owned a few printers over the last 30 or so years. Most have been HP and we have always liked them and had good luck with print quality and features. The one sticking point has always been cartridge cost and reliability. And they have never worked well refilling them.Our last printer was a Canon and we will never buy one again. I had been watching the ink tank printers but price was the stumbling block. With the 5000 series the ink tank printers they are finally affordable.This printer makes very nice crisp prints in both letters and pictures. It does scan, the tray is direct feed from the rear top of the printer making it nice if you make water slide decals or anything similar. Super easy to set up and install the software, print heads fill tanks etc. Once on your network it just powers down and waits for the next time you tell it to print.The printer appears to be a winner and now we just have to test it for long term reliability of print heads etc. But as it stands we are impressed and do recommend this if you are tired of the small amounts of ink in cartridges and the high cost.",
