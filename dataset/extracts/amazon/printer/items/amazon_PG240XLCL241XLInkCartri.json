(If any dirt, ink or paper dust is on the contacts, the printer may indicate that the ink cartridge is bad. ) To ensure a clean contact, follow the steps below: Use a pencil eraser (preferably rubber) and firmly rub over the contacts, then gently brush away any debris. Re-install the cartridge into the printer (You may have to take it out and reinstall it 2-3 times). If the problem persists, reset your printer by: 1. Turning off the printer with the cartridges installed. 2. Unplug printer and leave everything off for 2 minutes. 3. Turn on printer and attempt to print again.
