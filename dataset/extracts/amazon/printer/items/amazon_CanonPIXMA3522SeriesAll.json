Second, it continually becomes disconnected from the network so I have to repeatedly reconnect it with canon connection software. I'm not sure this is the printers fault but our last printer never had this problem. Lastly, if you are doing 2 sided printing, you have to grab the printed front sides of the pages and manually turn them over so the second side could print. Again, our last printer handled this automatically.",

I bought a cable because I anticipated that WiFi setup would be iffy. Setup was easy and intuitive. WiFi worked perfectly at first attempt (by following the included instructions and downloading the appropriate software). Not only did it work with my HP Pavillion right off the bat, but it also worked perfectly with my Samsung A53 phone. I've been using it for a week now, have never plugged in the cord. When the sample ink cartridges ran out, replacement was simple and intuitive, and the printer fired right back up without having to clear errors or go through other annoyances. I am delighted with this purchase. I will protect it from bumps and be gentle when manipulating parts. Well done you, Canon!",
