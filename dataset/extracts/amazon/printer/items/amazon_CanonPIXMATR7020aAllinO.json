That was a do it your all type printer and you could do all kinds of things with it, but also was cheap for the price.I seen this printer on Black Friday and it was a good price. It allowed us to do photos, print scan items and email things.I was kind of nervous on how the set up would be however, it was so easy to install and set up. It was amazing the best part about it honestly was it came with a black and color printer cartridge. It told me how to set up and place the printer cartridges into the printer, which was so easy compared to my old printer where I had to mess around with it forever and it was a hassle. Every time I had to change the color ink or black ink. This one is so easy you lift up a tab and you place it in close the tab and you\u2019re done changing the color And black ink colorIt wirelessly connected to my laptop, super easy and printed with no issue from anywhere in the house. I was also able to connect my smart phone to the printer so that I could print items from my smart phone directly to the printer as well. Highly recommend this printer.",

                "reviewText": "My Hp lasted 15 years and quit working. I wanted to buy another but after reading several of the reviews I decided to switch over to Canon. I'm glad I did. Setup was easy, onscreen menu is easy to navigate and the print quality looks good. It's also not as noisy as my old Hp. Pages print quicker as well. I've set it up using WiFi since it did not come with a USB cable. I may purchase the cable at a later date if my wifi starts having trouble. The only negative I've found is the plug itself. It connects very loosely in the back of the printer. Any slight movement of the printer disconnects the magnetic plug so I've taped it in. Some of the reviews indicate the scanner bar is constantly lit up. Mine isn't so Canon may have corrected the problem.",

The true test comes over time -- but they ask you to write reviews after just a few test drives, so this assessment reflects a small sample size. But, so far, so good. As others have written in reviews, it's a bit on the \"cheap plastic\" side, but not so much so that it causes concern. It's fine. And no complaints about difficulty in set up or early performance. Get back to me in 12 to 24 months when we have a more long-term view.",

                "reviewText": "It works fine when it is recognized, but that in there lies the problem. Nearly every time I want to use it with my computer, it says it is offline. I can print from my phone just fine because it is obviously not offline, and I can use the scan function just fine, but printing, nope. At first I tried restarting my computer, which worked but is obnoxious when you are in the midst of work and have a bunch of things open, but then I realized that I can go to the printer settings, and print a test page. That kicks off the original item to be printed and also prints a test page. This is both a waste of time and money (ink and paper).The first time I printed an image, it was muted to all heck. I was like no way this is the way. So I Googled the issue. Now I can't remember how I fixed it, and I am sure I will have to Google it again the next time I want to print an image and actually see the colors.When it does print without issue, the quality is good. It is loud, which I didn't think would bug me because I don't print that often, but it is kind of annoying. Nothing I can't manage though. The scan function takes awhile, but so did my old printer, and this one has a document feeder that my old one did not, and that has been WONDERFUL. The paper tray doesn't pop out automatically, a feature my old printer had, and I miss that because where I have the printer, I don't like to keep the tray out because I fear it will get broken by my wonderful daughter who pays no attention to her surroundings.The software doesn't have Canon in the name, which makes it hard to find if you don't remember that it is IJ blah blah blah. It also looks like it is straight out of the 90s, and just has mediocre functionality. You do need an app to print from your phone. There is a Canon app, but I think the Mopria Print app is the one you want (Android).Basically do not get this printer if you don't have some level of technical acumen or if you don't have admin rights to your computer, and be prepared for having to do some research when things don't go as expected.DISCLAIMER: If you are buying this to use with a work computer to which you do not have administrative rights to create new users, DO NOT get it. This printer requires not just an admin user to install the software but a LOCAL admin user. So calling IT won't get the job done unless they believe you that it needs a local admin user and are willing to create one.",
