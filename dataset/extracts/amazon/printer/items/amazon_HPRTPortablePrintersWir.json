                "reviewText": "I recently added the HPRT Portable Printer MT810 to my travel gear and it has been a game-changer. Here's my take on its pros and cons:Pros:1. Truly Portable: This printer is compact and lightweight, making it incredibly easy to pack into a backpack or carry-on.2. Wireless Convenience: The Bluetooth functionality allows for quick and hassle-free printing directly from my iPhone, Android, and laptop.3. Inkless Printing: The thermal inkless technology is not only environmentally friendly but also eliminates the need to carry around ink cartridges or toners, making it even more travel-friendly.4. Quick Setup: It was pretty straightforward to set up. The manual is clear, and I was up and running in no time.5. Versatile: I\u2019ve used it for printing out invoices, tickets, and even quick snapshots while on the road. It\u2019s proven to be extremely versatile.6. Good Battery Life: I was pleasantly surprised by how long the battery lasts. It's sufficient for multiple printing sessions without needing a recharge.7. Quality Output: The print quality is quite good for a portable printer, especially for text and simple graphics.Cons:1. Paper Size Limitations: The paper roll sizes are smaller than standard paper, so it\u2019s not ideal for larger documents.2. Price of Paper Rolls: While the printer itself is cost-effective, the specialized paper rolls can be a bit pricey.3. Monochrome Only: It only prints in black and white, which is fine for most of my needs but may not be suitable for those requiring color prints.In my opinion, the HPRT Portable Printer MT810 is an excellent investment for anyone who frequently travels for business or leisure and needs the ability to print on the go. Its ease of use, compact size, and inkless technology make it incredibly convenient, and the quality is more than satisfactory for most tasks. Although it has some limitations like paper size and monochrome printing, these are minor trade-offs for the portability and convenience it offers. Highly recommended for the modern traveler.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It\u2019s my first day, but so far I love this thing. I\u2019m an independent field tech who gets work from a platform. This means as work orders are posted or routed to me, I either request or accept the work. There are many different companies that assign me work and they all require different paperwork. They also require me to print a badge for each work order.This thing is handy because not only do I sometimes forget to grab pre-printed work orders and badges, but sometimes I get assigned a work order while I\u2019m already in the field and have no way of printing out the necessary documents. This printer gives me the ability to be ready for any paperwork regardless of the situation.Right out of the box it was already at 89% battery charge, so if needed it was ready for me. It comes with a simple but informative instructional booklet with a QR code for the app of using on the mobile device. While the instructions didn\u2019t specify how to put the printer in pairing mode (BT), it wasn\u2019t hard for me to figure it out, as most devices use the same process.Once the app was downloaded and the printer was paired, test printing was a breeze. As many have mentioned, the print quality is compatible to a fax machine, but in my personal opinion, it is a higher quality than any fax machine we had in the house when I was growing up. Regardless of opinion, it works perfect for printing the documents I need for work. It is dark and very legible, and the paper is definitely thicker than the fax paper I\u2019ve seen in the past.So far I\u2019ve only seen two down sides to using this printer: I sometimes get an error about parsing the document when I try to open a document from the app. More importantly, I can\u2019t print a document directly from its source, such as my work portal or website. I have to save the document to a folder on my phone, open the print app, and then search for the document. While it\u2019s not terrible, it\u2019s a little inconvenient. I don\u2019t know if the issue is with the app or with the iOS, because the printer doesn\u2019t show up in the list of available printers when trying to print from source. If that changes I think I won\u2019t have any issues, but again, it\u2019s too early to tell.Lastly, there is a travel/storage case available for the printer. I\u2019ve made a separate review for that, so I won\u2019t repeat it here. But I do recommend getting it. I believe I paid $15 for it.Hopefully this review helps you decide, if you\u2019re on the fence about it. There may be printers out there with more convenient features or better quality -idk, but if like me, you\u2019re on a budget and just need something simple for quick prints or on the go stuff, I highly recommend this product.One last thing - for the manufacturers: I work with cables all the time and have to seldomly print labels. My label maker kind of sucks and I see that there are wrap-around label paper for printers. The issue is they\u2019re mostly for laser printers and some inkjet. For my work, I don\u2019t always know the specific label titles that are required until after I arrive. If someone could develop these wrap-around style label paper for this type of thermal printer, that would be amazing. Just putting it out there.",
