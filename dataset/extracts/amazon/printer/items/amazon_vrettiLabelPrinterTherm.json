                "reviewText": "The printer itself is excellent and works perfectly as a USB device. The wireless part is another story:- The wireless connection software you download to your phone is useless and doesn't connect properly;- There's a \"diagnostics\" program on the CD which lets you talk to it from a PC. This works, but you have to work for the United Nations to figure it out, because the software is pretty much experimental: some of the buttons and prompts are in Chinese, and only some of the functions work.But it's possible to get to the thing wirelessly if you try hard enough, and from there, it's possible to set a fixed IP address into it - and if you don't, then the chances are that if you power it down and back up again, it'll acquire a different address from DHCP, and the drivers for the computers are stupid enough not to be able to figure it out. But, once you get it set up properly, it works flawlessly.As a programmer myself, I found the software more amusing than annoying, but don't send one of these things to your grandma for Christmas.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this printer for it\u2019s advertised wifi capability. I saw some reviews complaining about connectivity issues but I\u2019m very technically adept, I work in information security for a large tech company so I ignored them. I have the unique perspective of running Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu Linux, and iOS. Let\u2019s go into each process.Windows : Easiest setup, most supported. While the setup is the easiest it\u2019s also somewhat involved for a printer. Their configuration app is archaic and not intuitive.MacOS : Doesn\u2019t feel as supported as windows. The issue here is the printer configuration is somewhat hidden, selecting paper size or darkness is necessary but there\u2019s no real instruction to do so. I had to watch their setup videos to set something up that should be intuitive and I still had to go digging through menus to find where to set the print darkness.Linux - Bare minimum support, they walk you though configuring the printer with CUPS, they include a binary to download that requires root to install so you don\u2019t really know what the application is doing, it\u2019s not a shell script so when it can\u2019t find a directory it\u2019s just spits out an error and you have no ability to change directory paths if a file lives elsewhere. Once again had to watch a setup video to get the settings situated and things still weren\u2019t greatiOS - Terrible 4BARCODE application, it doesn\u2019t integrate to your normal printers. You have to send the PDF to 4BARCODE if you want to print it. I can\u2019t just select a printer from the list and the UI is awful, not intuitive, not directed at all.So after I\u2019ve gone through setting up all my devices I start running through my labels, around the 20 label mark my printer stops printing and has a very fast blinking red light. I boxed it right back up and initiated a return. This process should not be this difficult only to have a faulty machine. Terrible.",
