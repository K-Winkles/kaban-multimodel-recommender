                "reviewText": "I bought this as a photo printer. I am a photographer and I print a LOT of photos. When I first got it I thought no way this thing will print good pics. It seems cheaply made and I don't like how the paper sticks out of the top. But I swear the pics look soooooo professional. And the ink is dry instantly. No need to wait for it to dry. Its clear bright and spot of with color balance. I am soooo happy with it. I would buy it again 10 times over. My ONLY real complaint is there isnt a option to print on a disc. I give photo CDs/DVDs a lot. I had to keep my old printer just to do the discs. But I think Ive printed maybe 200-300 5x7 and 8x10s now and the ink is just BARLEY starting to show use. JUST under the first line. And the replacement ink cost is so low it's crazy if you get the knock off brand! But unless you print constantly it will take forever to need to replace. If you print photos, business cards etc you NEED this! Thank you Canon and Amazon!!!!",

                "reviewText": "After reading many reviews and watch YouTube videos I decided to go with Canon over Epson! This review is day 1 & specifically about the purchase & initial setup! Promised delivery in 2 days occurred. Setup out of the box was basic and fairly easy! Loaded the print heads, ink & paper with no issues. Scanned the QR code to get to & download the Canon app! Setup the WIFI to work with the phone, no issues. Later added the printer to my laptop! Printed out my first pic and looked great. Switched to a Word doc and printed on paper, no concerns! Went back and printed 4 more pics, all looked great. For my first day I'm totally satisfied with this printer. If things change over time ( I surely hope not ) I will update my review! Lastly, the ink tanks are great, so much better than cartridges! Verified purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This printer is my second Canon printer after the first one lived for over 15 years. So far it's performing really well, clean page prints, good color, and the scanner is pretty great. I like that they use the scanner to perform the head alignment after you get a head print out. Processing the image to make sure everything is OK insures clear and clean quality. This is not a photo printer, but the pictures are fine. If you're looking for a true photo printer you want something with 5-6 inks, not 4 like this unit. I love the mega tank. Easy to fill, easy to see when you need more, and seems to be pretty efficient.Drawback: setup sucks. It takes too long. The app is not so great at doing it. I resorted to using the tiny screen on the unit to do it faster. I also don't see the purpose of the app except to sell you more stuff. Everything you need is accessible on the face of the unit.",

                "reviewText": "I love how easy this printer was to set up and actually use. It prints perfectly fine, scans wonderfully, and it's just so easy to use. I can use my phone to send things to it, or my computer.... It's just very flexible and nice and it doesn't take up a whole lot of space. I haven't had a new printer and at least 10 years and it's just mind-blowing how fast it is and how quiet it is. I also love that they're the tank filler instead of an actual ink cartridge because that just feels so much better if that makes sense?It's just very sleek and definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Had to replace an old MG7xxx series all in one I bought back in 2016. So I decided to buy this model to replace it since I'm a Canon guy. First, my old printer probably weighed x2 or x3 more than this printer, it was built like a tank. This printer feels a little cheap and very plasticky. Also, my old printer had a decent sized, color, easy to read screen. This printer has a super tiny b/w screen, looks like a cheap Casio watch from the 1980s. I do like the real buttons on this printer better tho. My old All In One had hidden/touch buttons w/o any feedback. Was surprised that the print heads ship separately, I think this is a good thing. Maybe it will extend the life of the printer if you can easily/cheaply swap out the printer heads. There are 2 of them, 1 for black and 1 for color. Loading the ink is surprisingly easy. There is a nipple that seems to only flow when it's connected to the top of the tank. I have only printed a few things thus far but it appears to work well and the print quality looks good.",
