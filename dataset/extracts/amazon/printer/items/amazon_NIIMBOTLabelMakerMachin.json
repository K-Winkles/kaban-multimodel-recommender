Yes, the refill cartridges are not too cheap at $11.99, I guess that offsets the price of the printer and this is where they make the money back.The setup was easy. Took a few prints to get the calibration correct, after that, it was simple.Print is B on W, or you can inverse it to get it W on B (which looks pretty cool if I say so myself.) Picture added.You can easily download some different fonts, which is nice and there is the option to buy the VIP and get premium fonts and other things if you want.I've only had this a few days and the Bluetooth connects pretty well.Small size is a big plus, easy to store and carry around if needed.Well worth the purchase imho.All in all a good",

The labels stick well and the print is sharp and clear. Lots of printing options.The labels are a bit expensive if you buy rolls individually, but when you buy in a multi roll set or and assorted roll set the cost goes down considerably.Very nice product.Also, setup is easy and bluetooth connection is quick.",

                "reviewText": "Going to keep this short and sweet, and highlight at least one sore spot on this.It prints reliably well. The app is easy to navigate, no annoying advertisements. The cable labels are good to work with: I've used the cable labels and I much prefer them over the things I've seen from conventional label printing.It's portable, light, easy to use. The different kinds of labels for the device are auto-magically recognized: it knows what you're trying to use (spooky, or cool? you decide).The one sore spot is that, sometimes when trying to cut a label off of the reel, the teeth for cutting into the paper portion doesn't seem sharp enough.Note: The app was incompatible with a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite. What's that about??",

                "reviewText": "This is a fun, easy to use tool that can add value and joy to your life.Ease of use: ExcellentPrinting ability: Excellent. Labels print quickly.Size: Excellent. Size of an iPhone 8, only thicker.Refills: Easy to purchase on Amazon (search for \"label maker tape\"; one roll is approx. $12 and you can even buy clear ones* or a roll with cute animal backgrounds**.)Ink toner: Don't need to buy any. This label maker uses thermal printing. You only have to buy refill tape rolls. This only prints black and white. No color.Charging: Easy. Charges using an included USB cable. Holds a charge for a long time. Turns off by itself. It sings a little song when you turn it on and when it turns off (no joke, it really does).App: Not perfect. It was easy to download the app onto my phone and to have the app connect to the label maker using Bluetooth. I did not have to register and create an account to use the app. But, without registering for an account, you cannot save labels. If you close the app or let a lot of time lapse, your label will be deleted and you have to retype the label.When I was really annoyed by having to repeatedly type the same label, I tried to create an account even though I read reviews that highlighted potential privacy concerns. But, registration requires a verification code and Nimbot would email me the verification code after 10 minutes and by then, my registration would have timed out. I am unable to create an account even if I wanted to.Using the App: Good, not excellent. The instruction guide that comes with the label maker is vague so you have to play around with the app on your own. The app opens up and is able to automatically detect the type of label maker tape that is loaded (e.g., size, shape) which is great. You then double click on the label in the app to start typing. The text box is usually bigger than the label, so I always have to adjust the sizing and location of the text box. It gets annoying. I wish that by default, the text box would appear centered and sized to fit the label.Usefulness: Very useful. I created labels for all of my hanging file folders. I find folders more quickly. I can read the labels a lot faster when the font is typed out compared to handwritten labels. I also bought the label maker to trivia night and had fun printing out labels with our team's name (A Long Hard Day at the Dildo Factory) to put on our answer sheets.Conclusion: Overall, I am very happy with this label maker and have found it to be extremely useful. I highly recommend this label maker for someone who wants a simple, easy to use, and inexpensive label maker.*https://www.amazon.com/Address-Waterproof-Sticker-Supplies-NIIMBOT/dp/B0956SCWTV/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3KM7Z6F04WM96&keywords=niimbot%2Blabels&qid=1656791005&sprefix=nimbot%2Blabel%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-6&th=1**https://www.amazon.com/Address-Waterproof-Sticker-Supplies-NIIMBOT/dp/B0956NG1FD/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3KM7Z6F04WM96&keywords=niimbot%2Blabels&qid=1656791005&sprefix=nimbot%2Blabel%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-6&th=1How to add emojis: Open app, open a template, double tap on the text box as if you are going to start typing.

                "reviewText": "You can use this without any account or even a network. The app was straight forward to install on my phone (Android) and is pretty easy to use. It made the Bluetooth connection without me doing much of anything. I don't need any graphics or other nonsense, just label what's in the drawers on my shop. If you want to store/save the labels, then I think you might need to have a network connection and an account created by registering. I'm not really sure. I didn't register or anything. Just downloaded the application from Google Play, charged it up using the included cable and turned it on and started making labels. The charging is kind of interesting. I tried to use a USB C cable on both ends, and the device did not charge. If I used the USB A to USB C cable it charged right up. Seems to be able to print a lot of labels on one charge. I wasted a total of one label getting it to line up right. Another thing that I liked with this is that you don't waste tape like in some devices. Also, the roll that comes with it seems to be a full roll, not just some sample size. The print does not seem to smear if it something rubs on it (like my finger when sticking it to the drawer). Changing the Font size to get things to fit on the sticker is the only catch, but the print preview that shows up automatically on the screen makes that pretty easy. I'm still on the first roll and I've printed quite a few. Glad I bought an extra roll, because it's going to come in handy. Bottom line is: It does the business, adhesive on the labels is good it's pretty fast and was simple to use.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who values organization and efficiency, I recently had the opportunity to try out the NIIMBOT D110 Thermal Label Maker, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my labeling needs. With its compact size, wireless Bluetooth functionality, and mobile phone compatibility, this portable mini printer offers a convenient solution for creating customizable labels in various settings, whether it be at home, the office, or school. In this review, I will delve into the features, performance, and overall user experience of the NIIMBOT D110, shedding light on its strengths and potential areas for improvement.Design and Features:The NIIMBOT D110 impresses right from the moment you unbox it. Its sleek, minimalist design and white color give it a modern and stylish appearance that blends well with any workspace. The compact size makes it highly portable, allowing me to easily carry it in my bag or backpack.One of the standout features is the wireless Bluetooth connectivity, which eliminates the need for tangled wires and provides seamless connectivity with my mobile phone. This feature opens up a world of possibilities as it enables easy editing and printing of labels directly from my phone. The printer also comes with 1 roll of tape, with a printable width of 12mm, which is a good starting point for most labeling needs.Performance and User Experience:Setting up the NIIMBOT D110 was a breeze. After connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth, I downloaded the accompanying app, and within minutes, I was ready to start printing labels. The app itself is intuitive, user-friendly, and offers a range of editing options, including font styles, sizes, and various symbols.The thermal printing technology used by the D110 ensures quick and high-quality printing, without the need for ink or toner. The printed labels are clear, crisp, and smudge-resistant, which is essential for durability. The printer also supports both text and image printing, adding versatility to its functionality.During my testing, I found the printing speed to be satisfactory. While it may not be the fastest label printer on the market, it delivered consistent results without any jams or paper misalignments. However, I would have appreciated a slightly larger tape width option to accommodate more extensive labeling needs.Pros:Portable and compact designWireless Bluetooth connectivity for seamless mobile printingEasy setup and intuitive app interfaceHigh-quality thermal printing with clear and smudge-resistant labelsSupports both text and image printingCons:Limited tape width (12mm) may not be sufficient for all labeling needsPrinting speed could be slightly improvedConclusion:In conclusion, the NIIMBOT D110 Thermal Label Maker is an impressive tool for those seeking an efficient and portable solution for their labeling needs. Its sleek design, wireless Bluetooth connectivity, and compatibility with mobile phones make it a versatile device for various settings.
