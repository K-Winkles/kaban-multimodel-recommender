They do wrinkle somewhat if the bottles sweat alot, but the sticker doesn't absorb the moisture and cause the text to bleed. It also doesn't become more likely to rip if it has gotten wet.All of my labels are crisp and very legible. They look great.They peel off the backing easily and stick like a champ.Because they only print in black, I'm also thankful for the different colors.The price is great.Very pleased!",

When I stumbled across a thermal printer, I bought these pink ones because they match our company logo. So what I would say about these labels, is there high-quality, they are waterproof, they are smear proof, and they look amazing on our packages. I would definitely recommend these to anybody that\u2019s looking for good quality labels for their thermal printer. AAA+",

Each 4-inch label prints clearly and adheres well to various packaging materials, ensuring that my shipments are professionally labeled and easy to track.The compatibility with most thermal printers is a significant advantage, eliminating the need for ink or toner, which is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. The labels are also resistant to smudging and fading, which is crucial for ensuring that barcodes and addresses remain legible throughout the shipping process.However, while the labels generally perform well, it\u2019s important to handle them with care as they can be sensitive to heat and light exposure. Also, ensuring your printer settings are correctly adjusted is key to getting the best print quality. But overall, the MUNBYN Thermal Direct Shipping Labels have simplified my shipping process, making it more efficient and reliable.And for a dad joke: Why did the package go to school? Because it wanted to improve its \u201cclass\u201d of delivery!",
