                "reviewText": "I had been printing a lot of 4x6 inch shipping labels recently and it\u2019s a hassle to load special paper into my printer every time, so I thought it was time to get a dedicated label printer. I wanted something simple to use, reliable, and that didn\u2019t cost a small fortune. I am happy to report that this printer has turned out to be everything I had hoped for.Set up was a breeze. One plug goes into the wall. A USB plug connects to my computer, and then I was ready to go. Well... not exactly. I had to load the software driver for my Mac, but that was simple. There is a bluetooth connectivity feature, but as of now it doesn\u2019t work with the Mac. But I\u2019m using this printer with a desktop iMac, so I don\u2019t mind using a USB connection.The printer comes with two small packs of 4x6 inch labels in folded stacks, and all you have to do is insert the edge of a label in the back, press a button, and the printer will automatically calibrate where to position the label so everything is aligned right.My first label didn\u2019t come out right. But fortunately, the support for this printer is good. There is a printed user manual, an online version, and a website with videos that give clear instructions. And if all that doesn\u2019t help, there is an even a phone number to call for help. It took me one 3 minute video to figure out that I hadn\u2019t changed the settings in the printer software from letter-sized page to 4x6 inches. There are even helpful videos for printing from common sources, like eBay, Shopify, PayPal and a bunch of others.The printer will print different sizes and shapes of labels, and you can set custom sizes with the software. But honestly all I need it for is an occasional shipping label. My monthly duty cycle will probably be less than 50 labels. If I were printing a lot more, I might have gone for something more heavy duty. But so far, this printer seems ideal for my needs. And with the savings in ink costs (because this is a thermal printer that does not use ink), I expect it will pay for itself within a few months.",
