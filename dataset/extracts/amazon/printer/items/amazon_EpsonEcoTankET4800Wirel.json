        "description": "Your home office needs a printer that\u2019s fast, affordable, and easy to use. That\u2019s why we developed the EcoTank ET-4800 \u2013 an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you\u2019ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink1. The ET-4800 features genuine Epson print quality, an auto document feeder, fax, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display \u2013 making it the perfect basic home office printer. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of May 2021. | 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of May 2021. | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel App download. Data usage fees may apply. | 8. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 30,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 30,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), you must register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details.",

                "reviewText": "I've had probably a dozen printers, mostly laser printers, in our home the last 20 or more years. All the printers we've owned have been fine; nothing special but they all did a decent job. I tried an ink cartridge color printer but found the color poor and the cartridges short lived.But the Epson ET-4800 printer is a pleasant surprise.PROS:It's reasonably priced.The ink tank technology is great. After 2 months and approximately 400 pages, (about 80% pages with color) the black ink tank is still over 50% full and the color tanks are over 80% full.I had no setup problem at all. It took less than 30 minutes.The standard color is fine for handouts and presentation. The high resolution color is fair to good photo quality.The black and white printing is fast enough for me, and the same for standard color printing.CONS:The display screen is small, but I have not found this to be a problem.Printing on both sides is not automatic, but I've worked around this.There is no paper tray; you have to load the paper from the rear and it holds about 50 24lb sheets. For someone doing higher volume work this could be a problem.The printer makes a real racket while printing, even with my very poor hearing. No printing late at night. This is the only real issue with me.Again, I'm very pleased with this printer. It fits my needs.",

Once you setup the printer from phone, you can just add this printer to any device and print it from there. No unnecessary USB cable required. Everything is from Wi-Fi. Epson is hands down a leader in printing technologies. Had an HP printer before this, which I tossed in the trash within 6 months. I am extremely satisfied with the ease of use and high-quality prints from my EPSON ET-4800. Thanks, Epson!",

                "reviewText": "While this is a better deal due to the ink cost: you are supposed to be able to print up to 2000 pages with the ink bottles provided as opposed to 50 pages with the ink cartridges of other printers.BUT: the front display is WAY too small. You need to be very close to read it. A display 4 times the current size with bigger fonts would be much better.The unit works well with WPS WiFi. I tried the Ethernet connection and it worked after first setup. However, it lost that ability on power up the next day and I could not get it to stay on Ethernet.",

                "reviewText": "The ink lasts forever. I\u2019m a primary teacher so I print in color A Lot!! And I still used the same ink for almost a full school year before refilling it. And when I did buy the refills, it was 23$ for all colors together. It is a little more expensive up front to buy, but you get your money back in ink the first year you use it. I will never spend 75$ or more on an ink cartridge that lasts only a month. I\u2019ve actually bought 2 different models (2800 and the 4800), one for home and one for school, and they both work great. I love printing student activities in color. I save money on board letters and other classroom signs because I can print them in color myself instead of having to purchase pre-made ones. I love these printers!!",

                "reviewText": "The software side of this printer leaves a lot to be desired, particularly for scanning my previous Canon had a bulletproof connection over the network and scanning was easy. With this Epson, the document feeder when scanning is terrible as the scanner harder ever recognizes there are sheets in the ADF for scanning and I have to go back and forth between my printer and my windows PC several times to get it to connect, recognize documents in the ADF, and scan properly over the network. Major weak point in an otherwise excellent all in one printer. Also scan options are limited and no where near as evolved as what Canon has for their AIO printers. Major shame.BUT I love its print speed and quality. I miss having a paper tray, but the feeder in the back is fine enough. I love the ink tank system and am looking forward to never buying those awful and expensive cartridges again. Very pleased with this, but if you scan a lot, be warned, their scanner software is terrible. Took a star off for that.",
