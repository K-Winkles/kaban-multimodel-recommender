                "reviewText": "PROSI appreciated how many different label sizes it could print allowing me to use it for several selling platforms. I found it quite easy to just plugin in the USB cord to my laptop when I needed to print labels.The printing software and interface are very easy to understand. I ended up purchasing a 4x6 thermal labels on the side.CONSThe one thing that in my opinion Rongta could do better as a product, is it does NOT automatically come with thermal printer sheets. So, you have to buy those yourself along with some kind of sheet holder.I found it kind of a messy process to try to find a random sheet holder and thermal labels that work well with the Rongta. The company would do better to offer its own thermal sheets and holder that works well with the Rongta to cut down on the uncertainty for customers trying to find accompanying products to make this printer work.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Setup out of the box took 2 minutes. All files you need are on a handy little USB drive. There is also a selection of help files on the drive. All I have done so far is install the drivers and it was immediately available to print from Word (I had to set my own paper size when using it this way) There is a printing utility file but I haven't had the need to use it just yet. I popped in a strip of labels I already had and it auto detected the size AND where the label started, so there was no need for the finicky process of lining everything up. Hit print in word and *bzzzt* out came a perfect label, even on my old crummy labels I had lying around. My only complaint is that it didn't come with a small pack of labels, but everyone's needs are different as far as sizing, so I guess it makes sense to buy what you need. So far, happy with my purchase \ud83d\udc4d",
