It\u2019s very easy to use and the Labelife app you use to print labels is super user friendly. They even have tutorials you can access directly through the main screen in the app.Setup is straightforward and I\u2019ve been using it though Bluetooth which is reliable and connects quickly after I\u2019ve had it paired to my phone. It also has a cord that you can use if you\u2019re planning to use it with a computer but I do everything from my phone so I have yet to need that, it is a good accessory to have though for those who work directly from their computers.Printing labels are also included with this set which is nice, assembling them into the machine is easy and even when you power off the machine and turn it back on you don\u2019t waste any labels, I have a label machine for small round labels and for some reason every time it gets turned back on a label gets pushed out so it\u2019s pretty wasteful, I\u2019m glad this machine doesn\u2019t have the same issue seeing as these labels are much bigger and cost more.Overall this label machine is awesome, I highly recommend it if you\u2019re looking for something reliable, user friendly and affordable for shipping.",

                "reviewText": "I've been installing 4\"x6\" thermal label printers for quite a while. They're simple to install and easy to maintain. In industrial settings, I tend to like the units that have the labels feed into the printers from behind. In these installations the labels feed from a separate tray placed behind the printer and feed through the printer into a box/basket in front of the printer. Using the external tray allows for a larger supply of blank labels and therefor less down time replenishing the labels. I prefer to use fan folded labels as once they've printed they can stack in front of the printer neatly.For smaller businesses that don't need a dedicated label printer, I prefer this model. This printer stores the labels (on a roll) inside the printer. There are 2 major advantages. First, if you're not using the printer all the time, it keeps the labels protected from the environment and also it makes the printers footprint (including trays and the like) smaller. Taking up less space in a small business or home is an advantage.While a lot of printer manufacturers make thermal shipping label printers, I've gravitated to Phomemo as my manufacturer of choice. They make a solid product, at a very reasonable price and they're also sold by many different vendors.The set up for both Bluetooth and USB is very simple but very different. For Bluetooth connections to mobile devices, you need to download the app and then print using the app. For PC and Mac a driver needs to be installed and then printing from whichever program using this printer as the printer. I use them both ways. You need to know 2 things about connectivity. With the PC and Mac you must connect by USB cable and for IOS or Android you must connect using Bluetooth. Also, the printer gives priority to the USB connection. Meaning if you use both connections, when using Bluetooth you will need to disconnect the USB cable.For myself, I keep one of this model at home and use it both from my Samsung phone and my Windows 11 PC. I love being able to print my own shipping labels for shipments and for returns.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first ever Thermal Printer. It has everything you need to get started. I wanted something simple to use for my eBay labels instead of copying and taping the labels on. With this, I go through less tape and ink! It's actually pretty easy to set up. I have mine connected to the computer but you can also use your phone with the app they provide. Do note, unplug cable to computer to use printer from phone. I had no issue printing from my computer; however, I was having trouble getting it to connect to Bluetooth from my phone. What I found that finally worked was turning my Bluetooth off, then back on and then turning the printer on. I have had to do this every time I want to connect to Bluetooth with the printer from my phone. Then go to the app and up in the right-hand corner is a small printer image, click on it. That's where you connect the printer to Bluetooth. Once I got over that learning curve, it was very easy. I found lots of practice labels on line and saved them in pdf to the app and printed them off for a trial run. Also, when first loading the roll of labels, push the button on top of the printer and that will align the roll, just tear the first label off and you're ready to print. The print itself is very clear and bold. It also prints lightning fast! If you don't like the roll type labels, you can also use the stacked labels that thread from the back. I haven't used all the options yet but I'm very happy with it so far. Suits my needs perfectly. Just made printing labels off a lot easier and cheaper than what I had been doing.",

I'm only using it with the Bluetooth connection on my android phone with the Labelife app. The app took a little figuring out, but once I did, printing was a breeze. I haven't tried hooking it up to my computer yet.This is such a money saver for me. I used to print out the mailing labels on a full sheet of paper, and then have to cut them and tape them to my packages. The cost of ink is staggering! This printer will pay for itself in no time with the savings in ink cartridges.I use this printer for home use. I probably ship a dozen packages a month to family and friends. I can definitely see this being beneficial to someone with a small home business. I highly recommend it.",
