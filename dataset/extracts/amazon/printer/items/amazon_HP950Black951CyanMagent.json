                "reviewText": "This bundle of 4 authentic HP print cartridges is 5 times more expensive than so many compatible generic brand names. It\u2019s very tempting to get a generic brand when your printer needs replacement. However, I learned through personal experience that it\u2019s absolutely worth paying $100+ for authentic HP cartridges than buying something that costs around $20+/- HP cartridges are by far of supreme quality, lasts 3 to 4 times more and also your printer head is perfectly protected compared to any generic brand. In March 2020 I got one generic brand after reading some positive reviews just to save some pretty $$$ and to see if it worked for me. In the beginning, the black printouts looked ok but within a month or two it began to show poor results. The color printouts were awful right from the beginning. Within 6 months the quality went from bad to worse, and I am not a heavy user of my HP 8600 Premium. I thought my printer was ruined and will have to get a new one. That\u2019s when I decided to pay much more and go back to HP brand for its superb print quality and peace of mind for having your printer in better hands. It\u2019s so true when they say that.. you get what you pay for. To those who still want to go for saving money over getting a quality product, good luck! Just remember this. Don\u2019t fret if your printer gets damaged and it costs you much more then to either repair or replace it with a new one.",

I had to use the head cleaning function multiple times. I thought my printer head was toast. I removed them as soon as my order arrived. As soon as I put the proper HP cartridges in it worked properly. The printer was fine again and the copy quality was really good. Very happy I returned to the fold!",

The one I had bought from that store was expiring in 4 months , since I'm not printing very often, after 4 months the printer stopped working, with the error 'expired cartridge'. The expiration date is written on the box of the cartridge.So, I'm glad to see that the one I just bought on Amazon has the expiration date in 2022, which gives me plenty of time to use it.",
