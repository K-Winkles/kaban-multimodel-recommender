Local stores only had expensive printers with even more expensive inks and had a complete shortage on cheaper printers. I managed to get this one from Amazon in a day or two and it has fax, scan features along with a document hamper to do large copy jobs easily. It works fine in the last month or so, seems to get decent ink mileage so I am a happy camper. The big bonus is that it can use generic inks...which cost a fraction of the name brand inks. Such a racket on ink prices...generic ink works just fine and I can actually afford to use the printer.",

                "reviewText": "Printer works great after set up, but part of that set up was really dodgy. Contacted Canon online for some help getting my Mac to talk to the printer. Got connected during that online chat to a third-party consultant, who asked permission and then took control of my computer for less than a minute in an apoarent attempt to solve the connection/driver problem, 3rd Party failed to solve the problem and handed the mess back to me. Read Canon docs again, trusted my Mac and, after a bit,completed the setup. Still nervous about that 3rd party from Canada having had control of my machine - my bad for giving that permission - but so far no repercussions. That\u2019s my sad story with happy, I think, ending.",

But with this one there's a lot to complain about so I'll just stick to the facts. It's rather large size compared to the market. It has a lot of difficulty picking paper out of the tray. Printer constantly shows as being offline. I have to play with the print queue in windows to get it to pick up the print job. When it does get the print job it'll sit there and make machine noises for 5 minutes before it even starts to print. I've gone through two full sets of ink cartridges in a year yet I've only printed maybe 20 pages total. Oh and the print quality just SUCKS!!! Purchasing the printer was a BIG mistake.",

This thing works ok but only buy if you are a patient person. I recently tried to print one page from a PowerPoint and this thing had to process and think about it for about 2 minutes before it actually printed. Imagine if you wanted to buy a car and a 1995 Honda Accord was an option. She's cheap and she'll still get you from A to B reliably but not with style and on cold stays she might run a little rough.",
