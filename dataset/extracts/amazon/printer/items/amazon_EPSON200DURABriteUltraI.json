Had to save and then reopen, and it would only print in 'best photo'.A small business headache.I HATE spending this much on ink. But if you have a finicky printer and no time to deal with the problems that can occur with non-Epson, better bite the bullet.C'mon Epson. It's no accident that my Epson printer only likes Epson ink. But sixty bucks?!",
