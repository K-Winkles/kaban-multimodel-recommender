                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Itari reached out to me after my original review to assist with the issues, and after a quick email exchange, we both decided to try a new printer. They shipped it out very quickly and I received it this morning.They didn't have the purple printer in stock so they gave me the option of replacing it with another color (I chose white, and I really appreciate them asking instead of just sending what they wanted). I unpacked the printer and used the same drivers for the laptop that I did for the original purple printer.It works perfectly tethered by USB. Multiple page prints wait for the next cut sheet page to be inserted and the print quality to me seems just a bit better than the original printer. I also loaded their application to my phone and tried all the options by Android/Bluetooth and it worked just as well.It is rare these days to get amazing customer service, and Itari really does deserve all the four and five-star reviews...they are amazing and even though it seems like I got a dud on the first try, they worked with me and I am very pleased with the end result. I highly recommend Itari and their thermal printer.*******************I have to reinstall the drivers almost every time I turn this on/plug it into my laptop. I wanted this to work with USB (which it says it does) but 8 times out of ten uses, I have to uninstall the drivers, stop what I'm working on to restart my laptop, and then reinstall the USB drivers and sometimes I have to do this multiple times to get it to work. So much for easy.Yes, it's very portable (so is a brick). When it works the print quality is ok for what I need (basic documents or pdf printing. I've used the roll of paper included with the printer and purchased a 100-pack of 8.5x11 sheets as single feed. The USB drivers do not let you control variations like cut sheets vs continuous. So when you print from USB using cut sheets, you are basically sending the document one page at a time to the printer or you will get errors.I don't need this to hook to my phone by wifi/Bluetooth, I want this to hook to my laptop by USB for basic, quick print jobs (which the description says it does)...but it's incredibly unreliable. I thought this would be a time/ink/money saver...but it's just not worth the frustration. It doesn't even give you an install path or directory for the driver set to manually add the drivers. I can't recommend this product",

                "reviewText": "Let's face it, traditional printers are bulky, messy, and chained to their power cords. But what if you could **ditch the ink cartridges and print on the go**, with a printer that fits in your backpack and connects to your phone like magic? That's exactly what the **Itari M832 Portable Printer** promised, and I was eager to put it to the test.**First Impressions:**Out of the box, the M832 surprised me with its **compact size and lightweight design**. Seriously, it felt like I was holding a fancy tech gadget, not a printer! The **sleek white finish** and **minimal buttons** gave it a modern, user-friendly vibe.**Features that Traveled Well:**This little printer wasn't just small; it was packed with features that made me want to pack my bags and print the world:* **Wireless Printing:** Connect via Bluetooth to your phone, laptop, or even car (with an adapter) for effortless printing from anywhere. No more hunting for cables!* **Multiple Paper Sizes:** Print on regular letter/A4 paper, or smaller rolls for labels, receipts, or even stickers. This versatility covered all my on-the-go printing needs.* **300dpi Resolution:** The prints were surprisingly crisp and clear, perfect for documents, photos, or even QR codes. I was impressed with the quality, especially for such a portable printer.* **Rechargeable Battery:** No need for endless batteries! The built-in battery lasted for a decent amount of prints, and recharges quickly via USB.* **Easy-to-Use App:** The Phomemo app is intuitive and user-friendly, making printing from your phone a breeze.

I printed invoices, letters and receipts directly from my phone app. The battery held up surprisingly well, and the prints were clear and legible even in outdoor lighting. Back at home, I used it to print labels for organizing my pantry, and even surprised my friend with a custom sticker using a photo from our trip.**The Verdict:**If you're looking for a **compact, versatile, and user-friendly printer for travel, home office, or even occasional car printing**, the Itari M832 is a great choice. It's affordable, easy to use, and delivers surprisingly good quality prints.

                "reviewText": "I had some issues getting this to work on Windows. The key points are that the printer must be connected to the computer via the USB cable and switched on before installing the driver. If the printer is not visible during installation, the printer shows up with a message stating that the driver is not available. Once I resolved that issue (with a reboot in between), the printer is working flawlessly, with the USB connection (no Bluetooth for the PC).It has truly been designed for portability - lightweight, sleek, no leaking ink. If you are printing out something small and wish to save paper change the size - this won't affect the width of course (no matter which page size you select), but at least it can reduce the length of the tear-off page. Also, since there is no ink, you can print at the maximum DPI.I was a little put out that I had to download an app on my phone; I do not like downloading odd apps for every little device, so I use an old phone connected to its own WiFi for modern gadgets which all seem to require their own app. In many cases, the app is used to connect the device to the Wifi and then one does not really need the app, except to make configuration changes. However, I could not do that in this case, as the app has to be on the phone from which I want to print, and that is my normal phone. And, yes, it does print from my phone via Bluetooth.All in all, a nifty device that is easy to use.Review for: Itari Portable Printers Wireless for Travel - Support 8.5'' x 11'' US Letter & A4 Paper, Bluetooth Thermal Printer Compatible with iOS, Android Phone & Laptop, Inkless Mobile Printer, 300Dpi",

Included in the box is a few small rolls of thermal paper, portable strap, a user manual, and a charging cable. The battery is 1200mah I believe and therefore it doesn't need to always be plugged in which is great for portable charging.In order to print, you need to download the app (available on iOS and Android) and the printing is done via Bluetooth. It's pretty simple to set up and takes a few minutes at most. Just in case it wasn't clear, all printing is in black and white, so it's perfect for documents mainly.Overall, it's well made, easy to set up and the portability is fantastic.",
