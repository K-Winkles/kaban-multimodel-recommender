                "reviewText": "What can I say about printer ink? I mean, wow. It didn't turn the printer into a 3D printer capable of recreating the toenail I lost back in 'Nam (toenail fiasco aside, it was the vacation of the 2000's so far, most definitely), but it does print out some legible (and sometimes steamy) love letters to my Jr. High crush and doesn't complain if I go vanilla and choose the Arial font. (though it prefers Heveltica (sp?)).Alas it also fails to print plum baby plum trees that I could bring with me to my new place since the bank took my house (and that prized tree), but it does do a stunning, crisp job of printing the story Plum Baby entered into the most recent NPR three minute fiction contest. Surprisingly enough, it prints the whole thing, not just an excerpt, but I've recently heard it should have ended after the sticks hit Mama in the eye (or missed her altogether - whatever).This ink also doesn't print out road kill raccoon carcasses, but it does print out beautiful \"beware of stentch\" signs in case I leave another one under my bed with the plums and shoulder pads Mama likes to put her hand on while she's modding and nodding into catatonia. Oh Mama.So over all, I have to give this ink 5 stars. It's been fabulous, never ever giving me a hard time for printing worthless crap - including lots of wedding bands I bend and tape around my caterpillar fingers. I love it. I think I'll write a story about it for NPR. I wonder if there will ever be a found item round, 'cause this ink was the find of the year, and I ain't ever giving it back. (Well, I might recycle the container when the ink dries up, but I might just place it lovingly under my bed and hope it regenerates. Good price or no, it still costs money, and I'm saving all my money to buy my plum tree (and my house) back from BMO Harris.Five stars.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars No problems (3+ years) whatsoever since abandoning refills and using only Epson OEM",
                "reviewText": "I know that Epson and other manufacturers (HP, Canon; but maybe not Brother) have switched to \"chipped\" cartridges long ago, and have been \"updating\" the firmware in printers to both add or fix features, as well as to discriminate against older-dated refilled cartridges (I'm pretty sure of this after reading various posts -- it's much like the ever-changing copy protection on DVD/Bluray discs).However, I also know that in the early days of attempting to use \"quality\" refills (Costco stores, do-it-yourself kits and online reputable firms) that I was having hit-or-miss printing quality and capacity issues; i.e., I wouldn't be getting the number of pages per cartridge, thus increasing the cost/page of the \"bargain\" priced refilled cartridges.I even bought a sensitive precision scale to measure new OEM cartridge before/after weights, then the weights of before/after using refill services. I found that (at least for the Epson XL extra-high-capacity T127 cartridges) rarely did the weight of a returned \"filled full\" cartridge approach that of a new/unused \"full\" one -- typically it was a few to many grams less, reducing the cost/page value of the refilled cartridge.Also I was having to run the printhead cleaning cycle more often to remove streaks from printed pages (again, leaving less ink for actual page printing).Maybe it was the firmware silently executing a \"punishment mode\" routine upon detection of a refilled cartridge, even though they were Epson/OEM with a reset chip -- I dunno, but it's possible... Or maybe, as the manufacturers would have us believe, it's truly a customized concoction of secret sauces and magic ingredients, blended especially for each model printer vs. the generic ink of the refillers.At any rate, since switching back to non-refilled/new Epson OEM cartridges the printer performance has been near flawless -- lots and lots of pages with little to no streaking and very seldom need for cleaning cycles (maybe over a year since the last one?). Just pop a new one in and it's back online, usually without an extensive ink-wasting priming cycle (as long as I don't wait until the previous cartridge is \"sucking air\" by ignoring/overriding the multiple warning messages and trying to squeeze more printed pages from the cartridge until it's really empty -- then I lose more ink from priming the full cartridge than I lose by stopping/changing when it reports \"low\" for about the third time!)In the end the hassles of trying to coax the refills to work properly and get lower cost/page printing just wasn't worth it in using this model printer, an Epson WF-3540 which, for several years now, has been the best, most trouble-free one I've owned so far among many (no more pricy-ink-gouging HP inkjet printers, ever!).Oh, yes, the order experience itself:3/5 stars for Office Depot getting half of the order correct:Ordered 2 Epson inkjet cartridges, both to be XL extra-high-capacity: 1 magenta, 1 cyan.Received 2 cartridges: 1 extra-high-capacity magenta (OK), but (OOPS!) 1 high-capacity (i.e., standard) magenta5/5 stars for customer service from \"Vincenzio\" (Amazon.com Marketplace Support / Office Depot, Inc.) for swiftly processing a refund for the wrong item shortly after I posted my complaint -- thanks!1/5 stars for UPS claiming to have delivered the order to my \"front door\" address on Tuesday; Wednesday I checked on the whereabouts of the missing order and saw that the seller, Office Depot, posted a conflicting arrival time of 5-9 days for order fulfillment (i.e., well after Amazon's originally-estimated shipping arrival day posted at the time of order placement, so OK, just be patient...); Thursday it shows up at my door, so perhaps a neighbor dropped it off from being wrongly delivered to their address on Tuesday?",
