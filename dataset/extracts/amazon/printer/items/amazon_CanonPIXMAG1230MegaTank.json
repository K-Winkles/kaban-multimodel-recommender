                "reviewText": "Would I be lying if I said that the ink lasts \"forever\"? After a decade or two, I finally replaced my old printer. I was just getting used to refilling the holes of the ink cartridges in my old printer every week or two. It was such a pain having to blow thru the insert holes and cooking them in hot water to get the four ink dispensers to do their thing. In the long run, I was spraying too much ink on my clothing, the dinner table and the rug. Time for a new printer. This one seemed very affordable. I cannot speak enough superlatives regarding the consistency of vivid colors. After heavy use the visible color ink shown thru the visible tubes on the exterior of the printer indicate that only about 5% of the ink has been used up. Oh, I wish the gasoline in my car would drain so slowly! I have seen comments that the tray in which the printed pages are dispensed onto seems flimsy and will break soon. Well, if you used this tray as a table to support heavy objects then it might be of concern, but after each printing I simply slide it back inside the printer. The cat has never sat on it, so it still slides easily since it is not heavy and will not jump off of the sliders. After several months of heavy use, I have found this printer is of professional quality and I highly recommend it. I cannot address the tech support, because it wasn't needed.",
