Save up to 80 percent on ink with low-cost replacement ink bottles vs. ink cartridges (2). Plus, exclusive, uniquely keyed EcoFit bottles make it easy to fill each color tank. 1. Replacement ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 2. Savings comparison based on the purchase cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the manufacturers' online prices and yields for the highest-capacity cartridges for the best-selling similarly featured consumer inkjet printers priced at $499 USD or less per industry available data, August 2018. Actual savings will vary based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions.",

That about covers it. So this 5-star review is as much for the Eco Tank printer itself as it is for this refill ink. I don't know why anyone would buy a printer other than an Epson Eco Tank, especially when you have a company like HP trying to force customers to buy their expensive cartridges by bricking printers that use knock-off brands. The Eco Tank makes printer ink affordable again.",
