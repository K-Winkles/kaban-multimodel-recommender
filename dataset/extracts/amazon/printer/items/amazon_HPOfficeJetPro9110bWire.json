While printing in low quality and normal, the ink cartridges last forever. My estimate puts the cost per page at about 1 penny for ink. It prints fast and it has built in two-sided printing, which is one of my favorite features.There is also a quirky \"quiet mode.\" This is an interesting idea and I liked it because of the originality, but the functionality of this mode is lacking. It makes the printer significantly quieter, but it accomplishes by reducing print speed.It is easy to install on both Windows and Mac OS. If you are looking for a good, reliable printer that has a low cost per page, the HP OfficeJet Pro 8210 (This Printer) is a great bet. I love this product.NOTE: I have not used any of the wireless features.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace the OfficeJet Pro 8200 that I bought about 3 years ago and that I thought had gone bad. It turned out that the problem was merely a paper jam in place that you would never expect and, thus, I did not notice until I removed the cartridges and by that time I already had the 8210 in use.The installation was not flawless - the install program kept asking for a number for the printer that had to do with its wireless address and I could not find the number - However, all along I was planning on connecting it via a wired Ethernet connection and was able to do that without too much hassle. However, it was more by happenstance than by following step-by-step directions. The written instructions and the set-up program did not mention that it had to be added to the Ethernet network through Windows before running the set-up program.I have used the printed daily for about two months and have had minimal problems. On a couple of occasions it would not print and I could not delete the print job from the queue. With one exception, I was able to resolve the problem by shutting down the computer and the printer and rebooting. There was one occasion when that did not work. When checking the HP support website I located and downloaded the HP Print and Scan Doctor troubleshooting program which worked like a charm. It was great to resolve the problem without having to go through the hassle of talking to a support person.The unit prints significantly faster than the Pro 8200, which is nice but not a major advantage in my case because I am rarely in a hurry. With two exceptions, the print quality is what I would expect from an inkjet printer. There are four quality settings: General Office, Professional, Presentation, and Maximum dpi. I have two complaints regarding the quality settings. It often defaults to the Professional setting, even though I have General Office set up as the default. So if you want to be frugal with the ink (how many people do not) you need to check the quality setting in preferences every time you print. That is an aggravation. Also note that the Pro 8200 had a Draft quality setting, whereas the 8210 does not. I assume that the Draft setting is lower quality and uses less ink than the General Office setting so that is one disadvantage in comparing it to the 8200.Despite the reservations noted I think the unit rates 4 stars and could be higher if It lasts several years without major problems.",

                "reviewText": "In 2023 this printer's software automatically installed a firmware update that freezes the printer if you try to use a non-HP, less expensive ink. It renders the printer useless unless you keep buying their $100+ ink cartridge package! Living in a remote area, the news of this happening when I critically needed to print was devastating. The frustration is unbelievable, particularly since they did this without warning as the firmware wasn't in place upon purchase. I just bought an Epson ecotank to replace it - this HP piece of junk is going to the trash! I had been a supportive HP purchaser since the mid-1980's - going back to their lazer printers in the good old days. NEVER AGAIN will I buy an HP product after this fiasco!",

I unboxed it and set it up in less than 30 minutes. My prints are beautiful. So if you are looking for a decent print quality this would be my recommendation.",

For the most part, I found HP printers often took a long time and were very difficult to install. Not this one though. My OfficeJet Pro 8210 is connected to my home network which includes 2 laptops (Windows 10 and Windows 7) and two desktops - one with XP and my main desktop with Linux Mint. Installation was quick and flawless - about a minute to install on my wife's Windows 7 laptop with an SSD drive and a couple of minutes on my Linux Mint desktop (also with an SSD drive) once I downloaded the latest HPLIP software and followed HP's instructions.All work flawlessly. Good print quality.",

The issues never got fixed but the customer service was impeccable.Conclusion:Don\u2019t waste your money on ten year old tech. Go buy an HP Tango printer instead. They\u2019re slimmer, cheaper, higher quality, more efficient, easier to use, and much more reliable.",
