                "reviewText": "Ok Folks.When installing the new HP62 cartridge or any cartridge on any ink jet printer, for that matter. DO NOT, I repeat do not run the head alignment routine, you can cancel it at anytime it comes up. Why? Well, When you properly snap the new cartridge into the print head cradle, it is aligned already. I have no issue with print quality when avoiding the Head alignment routine. If you perform the head alignment routine and you observe the print out that is produced you will see that about 75% of your ink cartridge was used to fill that paper with huge squares, rectangles and thick lines etc. This step is not necessary and wastes a huge amount of ink and is a HP gimmick to get you to buy more cartridges. SO Don't do print head alignment, just \"later\" it or cancel it each time it comes up. You will be amazed at how many pages you can print avoiding that step. After having reported this, I will have to enter the \"Witness Protection Program\" ;)",
