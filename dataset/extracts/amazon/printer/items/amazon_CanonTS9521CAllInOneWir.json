                "reviewText": "This is my dream printer and so far it does not disappoint.Pros:-12\"x12\" printing-copy and scan functions-individual ink tanks (ink is still pretty expensive but at least I can change individual inks as needed.)-wireless printing (With the canon app I easily can print photos from my phone or ipad. Very cool)-photo printing is very good-set up was easy, canon software was easy to install and I just followed directions on the screenCons-ink cost, due to photo printing I'm afraid to use 3rd party cheaper inks in this machine.-size, not a deal breaker and is totally expected, but it is a \"bigger\" printer because of the 12\" print width functionality so plan your space accordingly-the front panel needing to be flipped up to print. It's just annoying and so far I just leave it up and open so it is what it is.-sublimation. In terms of being a \"crafter's\" printer, I feel like sublimation ink options is the only ball left dropped. If there is a good option for this I haven't seen it being talked about.",

                "reviewText": "I owned an epson artisan 800 printer that lasted me 16 yrs. yes 16. I bought a cis ink system for it and in 16 yrs I filled it twice with ink. the photo quality was hands down amazing. it finally died and I really did not like the way the new epson printers looked and felt. So I switched up and took a chance. I bought this canon and I wanted to make sure I bought a decent one so it was the TS9521C . So far playing with it I am very impressed. double sided printing. cd printing. basically everything my epson did plus alot more, It connects directly to your google drive one drive, ect all the cloud based storage and your stuff is just there. for the print quality? SUPERB. I am talking full hd photo prints. better than you will get from film development at your local cvs. the scanner is amazing, it has more than good resolutions for scanning anything you need. It doesn't say it features a fax but it does fax using windows fax manager. I mean this thing has crazy features. It comes with all kinds of preloaded templates ect. the wifi was a lil confusing at first, the printer was telling me to setup network at the pc and the pc was telling me to set it up at the printer. by default the wifi was disabled and I had to find it and turn it on. the software wasn't really good at finding the printer and I had to manually set it up to connect but once you see how it is youll understand it pretty easy. it comes with carts. but we all know they are half full so they can get you to buy some within a few prints. so far I printed 5 things and the carts are about 1/4 empty. I suggest you purchase a set of refillable cartridges and 100ml bottles of ink. and you should have ink for at least a yr without depending on canon to provide it. the printer wants to auto detect the ink when it gets low and automatically order it for you. no thank you. there is way to many features to type here. I was scared because my epson was a one of a kind printer that was way way ahead of its time. but I see canon wasn't playing around when they designed this bad boy. don't buy an hp as we all know hp is getting sued for bricking there printers when the ink runs out. plus you have to login to a service to print anything. not cool. the epson printers are real nice don't get me wrong. but they dont give the features this thing had unless you purchase the 699.99 expressions 15000 or something like that. which is a real nice printer. but. for 299.99 you can not beat this printer. the quality is just amazing. I can't get enough of it. I am going to print everything under the sun just to look at the quality and see just how lng the ink really does last per ink cart. listen, you can not go wrong buying this printer. bottom line. you will be very impressed just as I am when you see the things it does and has. I give it a 10/10 for everything about it. quality, print quality, features, ease of use ect. Buy It. you will not be disappointed. I promise.",

                "reviewText": "I wish Canon made this printer sturdy. I love the 12x12 size, the ability to print nice quality photos, the ability to print regular papers, the touch screen, ease of loading smaller sized photo papers, thick/very thick paper, etc. I had Canon printers before and they were much sturdier than this. When I accidentally put cardstock paper in the regular paper feed, it got stuck. I was able to pull the paper out but it screwed up the alignment so everything I printed after that didn't print correctly. I tried everything I could to fix it including the systems own alignment test but they all failed. I didn't feel the need to call Canon because they would probably tell me to do everything I've already done. I replaced the printer instead. Before I switched back to Canon I had an Office HP printer which was super sturdy. Got a cardstock stuck and when removing it, a few plastic knobs flew out but the printer still worked great. I also have a laserjet HP from a decade ago that is super heavy and sturdy that I use for printing large amounts of papers such as research/essay papers and school papers. I had a cardstock stuck in it once too (thought I'd try printing crafting stuff with it because it felt like it could handle it) and after I pulled the paper out (nothing popped out like the Office HP) it worked wonderfully still. I'm willing to pay more for a sturdier Canon photo/multi-purpose printer. It's unfortunate this printer was made so cheap. I feel like I have to be super careful when I use it.",
