Getting a separate printer for shipping labels is highly advised because the ink can dry out so easily! I only needed a few minutes to set up the machine. Within minutes, I had it set up and was prepared to test it. Loading was very simple. Certainly not as difficult to use as an inkjet printer. I then installed it on my computer and tested it out. Oh, my! So easy. So easy. And a lot more effective. And now for the added bonus. This is thermal. Because there isn't any ink, the ink doesn't dry out even if I don't use it for a few weeks.",

                "reviewText": "\ud83d\udd0e Overview \ud83d\udd0dThe biggest gripe of a my small business is creating shipping labels and attaching them to the shipping package. Having a thermal printer not only saves me time but it also saves money as it is essential to helping me get parcels out efficiently. This bluetooth thermal printer is fantastic for the price. It prints accurately and quickly all while using no ink at all. It seamlessly connects to my Mac, PC, and to my iPhone via bluetooth. My favourite way of using the printer is by saving a label as an image, sending it to the shipping printer app, and scaling the label to fix a 4X6 label. My dislike of the product is the apps themselves as they are not the most intuitive and it takes a bit of fiddling to understand the capabilities of the software. I think a bit more improvement needs to be done on the software side of the apps but the hardware is perfect.\u2705 Pros \u2705- Well designed machine- Inkless printing- Fast printing for multiple labels at a time- Wireless connectivity to help save time from using the computer\u274c Cons \u274c- The softwares require a bit of attention. Especially the app itself. It is a bit clunky and requires a bit of a learning curve to understand how to scale and print on it. The UI needs a major overhaul.\ud83d\udcdd Overall \ud83d\udcddOverall I think this printer deserves a 4.5/5 stars. I've had the opportunity to try out many wired versions of these thermal printers and by far this one was been the most efficient thanks to the wireless connectivity. I would happily recommend this to small business owners who are looking for a price conscious thermal printer that works well!",

                "reviewText": "This label printer is compact when used as a desktop device. I found it worked ok using my smartphone and bluetooth, but much better when used with my laptop in terms of typing out label text.For my smartphone I used their \"Shipping Printer Pro\" version of the app that allows you to type in text for printing the label. At the time of review, the features for font size and type were very limited but functional. It is probably best to use labels (files) that are already prepared with the smartphone.I was very satisfied with this printer's performance when I used it with my laptop, after downloading, scanning and installing their driver. I used word, chose the 4x6 size and was able to print out exactly what I wanted.The printing is practically silent and quick. The labels are easy to peel off and have a good adhesive.This labeller is great for printing address labels but also, in my case, for labelling boxes and containers. The labels stick well to metal and plastics, as well as, paper and cardboard.Handy to have and easier to use than full sized printers.",

                "reviewText": "At-a-glance (full review below):PROS:- Bluetooth connection was simpleCONS:- MacOS driver does not work at all- Mobile printing application barely works- Poor design compared to other options (large, bad hinge design)- Poor and incorrect instructions- Missing the USB drive with the driver and samples- No Bluetooth security (anyone could connect)\u2014\u2014 Full Review \u2014\u2014I\u2019ve used another thermal printer before, but was hoping that this one would make it easier for me to print thanks to the Bluetooth connectivity. Unfortunately, this printer is anything but easy.Out of the box, I was a bit surprised by how big the printer is. It\u2019s larger and boxier than the other one I used before. Apart from that, the other included items (USB cable, USB A to C adapter, 4x6\u201d labels) look quite standard and okay quality. Unfortunately, the product I received did not include the USB drive which is supposed to contain the drivers and some sample documents you can use to test the printer. The hinge on the printer is also not great, and it opens by \u201cleaning back\u201d. This means that loading labels is cumbersome compared to printers where they hinge to the left or right. The label guides do an okay job of aligning the labels, but its still difficult to get them to be straight (this is the same as with the other printer I\u2019ve used, so this is about what I was expecting).Thankfully, the driver is available on the support site for this printer, but it there is a lot of different models so it took me a minute to find the right one. After that, the installation was straight-forward (if you\u2019ve ever installed MacOS software before, it\u2019s nothing special), and I went to add the printer. I was able to see the printer in the list of available options, and selected the correct driver as instructed. However, the paper instruction manual included does not match what is on the website, nor what you actually have to do, and the website instructions are poorly edited to show the proper steps. Clearly, there is very little QA here.I fought the printer for while, but no matter what I did or how I tried to configure it, it refused to print anything from my laptop. The error message \u201cNo printer available\u201d was always displayed, leading me to believe that the driver does not actually work, or the USB interface on this printer is defective. Given the similarity to the other printer I\u2019ve used, I tried using that driver as a last-ditch attempt, and still no luck.Just to try to get something to print, I downloaded the Bluetooth printing app to my phone. I was able to connect quickly to the printer, but I\u2019m a bit disappointed that there\u2019s no security on the connection. By that I mean, there was no PIN that I had to enter and no switch to toggle the Bluetooth on and off, so anyone nearby could\u2019ve connected if they wanted to. This is disappointing in 2022.Once connected, I was able to load a PDF in the app and print it. Sadly, the app is not very intuitive and it took me multiple attempts to get it to print on a 2.25\u201dx1.25\u201d label properly (the size that is provided in the app is 1.25\u201dx2.25\u201d and did not auto-rotate, despite my attempts. I had to manually set it as a 2.25\u201dx1.25\u201d size, though specified in millimeters). Once I finally got this working, the alignment still looked off (it pushes right up to the edge of the label and does not fill it, and the two alignment modes made no visible difference), but I did see that there is an offset option that can be configured buried in the advanced options.Given that I need to be able to print from MacOS, I didn\u2019t even bother attempting to set this printer up on my Windows PC. Perhaps it will work better on that platform, but given my experience so far I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.Overall, this printer was a waste of my time and I\u2019m going to go back to what I was using before. The poor instructions, non-working MacOS driver, and mediocre-at-best mobile app make this printer a horrible choice, no matter what you pay for it. I would strongly suggest you look around for other options, as there are many in this market segment which actually do what they\u2019re supposed to with less hassle.",
