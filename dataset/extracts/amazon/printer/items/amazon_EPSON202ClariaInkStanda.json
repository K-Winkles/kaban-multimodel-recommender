                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Excessively (and Unnecessarily) Expensive Ink",
                "reviewText": "It seems that Epson engineers have been working overtime to maximize the monetization of ink sales. Even if you are printing documents with black ink only, the Epson WF 2860 printer will consume yellow, magenta (red), and cyan (blue) ink. The printer apparently assesses cartridge ink levels by the number of pages printed, and not by the ink actually consumed. Thus, to the printer, a cartridge may appear to be empty when it is actually half full. And, when the ink level in any single cartridge appears to be low, the printer will not function. In other words, the black ink cartridge may be full, but the printer will not print if the yellow ink cartridge appears to be low! Epson ink is very expensive. Some WF 2860 printers will accept less expensive third-party ink cartridges; but Epson offers users a software update that renders third-party ink cartridges unusable. Members of \u201cThe Epson Team\u201d concede that \u201csome updates may affect the functionality of third-party ink.\u201d One suspects that this is the principal purpose of these updates. The only guidance provided by \u201cThe Epson Team\u201d is to tell you to purchase overpriced Epson ink. So you can be required to replace a costly yellow ink cartridge that is not empty in order to print with black ink. The Epson engineer(s) who conceived this system probably received a healthy bonus.Note that Epson and third party manufacturers offer high yield (202 XL) cartridges in addition to the regular (202) cartridges. The regular and the high yield cartridges both have the same exterior dimensions, so providers could actually market a single cartridge with high yield capacity. Instead they market a regular cartridge that is only partially filled, and a completely filled cartridge as a special, higher cost, \u201cXL\u201d cartridge.Amazon presents the following as the top positive review: \u201cHaven\u2019t gotten to use it much . . .but hopefully it doesn\u2019t run out as quickly as it seemed before.\u201d If you can believe it, that\u2019s a positive review! If you analyze all the reviews for this product, you will find that (as of now) 56% of the reviewers complained that cartridges quickly run out of ink, and that Epson ink is very expensive. From a slightly different perspective, 36% of the reviewers of the WF 2860 printer itself gave it a one-star rating. In many cases, their dissatisfaction arose from the limited capacity and high cost of ink cartridges, and the Epson software updates that prevent the use of third-party ink.According to the users\u2019 agreement, Epson software may automatically connect \u201cvia the Internet to check for available updates to the Software, such as bug fixes, patches, upgrades, additional or enhanced functions, plug-ins and new versions (collectively, \u201cUpdates\u201d) and may either (a) automatically electronically update the version of the Software that you are using on your personal device or (b) give you the option of manually downloading applicable Updates. If you do not wish to allow Epson to check for available updates to the Software, you may disable this feature by uninstalling EPSON Software Updater. By installing the Software and not disabling any automated check for Updates, if applicable, you hereby agree and consent to automatically request and receive Updates from Epson.\u201d But this provision offers little help with the problems described above.Addendum: A special concern with the WF 2860 is that the printer will not print unless it is connected to the Internet. This is purportedly so that the Epson Team can detect whether you are using third-party ink, in which case they offer an \"upgrade\" that will force you to use Epson ink, or so that they can sell you more ink when they think you need it. Whether you are a Donald Trump Republican, a Bernie Sanders Democrat, or something else altogether, do you want anyone to have Internet access to what you happen to be printing on your personal computer? I think this is a very slippery slope that Americans will want to avoid.",
