This new 3755 injet has many more features, was extemely easy to install, and has worked flawlessly for 3 months. The only area I had issues with is the whole process of getting it hooked up to the MyHP.com website. Numerous trys and not very good documentation. You don't need this to use the printer and some people probably don't ever get connected. I like it because of the remote printing capability which allows you to email a document the HP site and it will print on the 3755 printer. You can bypass the whole email-it-to-me-and-I'll-print-it-here, cycle.",

This is because the cartridges must go into the receiver thingy (LOL) at an angle or the print head gets damaged. This HP, like every HP I have purchased just snaps in easily. The print quality of this HP is fantastic printing color pictures onto regular copy paper! The Canon Pixma (no matter how much I tried aligning the print cartridges) prints horizontal streaks on every single color pic or diagram. All of my HP's in the past have lasted at least 2 years. The canon Pixma lasted 12 months, stopped printing, and will only flash trouble codes which translated to \"TAKE THIS PO$ TO AN AUTHORIZED CANON SERVICE CENTER\". One thing which doesn't bother me: the Canon printed much faster (but who cares with all of the problems?).",

It is so nice to finally see something other than either a white printer or a black printer but something with color it just adds an extra pop to your office. Space. It was super easy to set up is a great size fast little printer holds a lot of paper and for a good price I don\u2019t think you go wrong if you want. Just a nice little printer in your office. I don\u2019t know how this will be when you have to do a lot of printing, but for a couple of pages here and there it\u2019s a nice little printer.",

                "reviewText": "If you are about to make the same mistake I did by purchasing this printer b/c it's the least expensive one available for same-day delivery via Prime, then save yourself time and money by reading this first. I literally spent 5 hours working on setting this up today and finally ended up having to call HP Support for assistance. They took 45 minutes to troubleshoot over the phone.1. This printer ONLY connects to 2.4ghz wi-fi, and not all wi-fi routers are \"manually\" switchable. So if you have a non-manually-switchable 5ghz router (like I have through Spectrum, model sac2v2s), then you have to call HP Support to get 5ghz drivers by letting them remote-in to your computer because the drivers aren't easy to find. The person I spoke with at HP Support even installed the wrong driver pak on my computer initially. So if you fall into the category of having a router that auto-switches between 2.4ghz to 5ghz without the option to manually switch, then getting the right drivers installed is the ONLY way you'll be able to connect to wi-fi.2. If you can't connect to wi-fi, then you have to connect via a SPECIAL USB cable... not just any old USB cable. And this printer DOES NOT COME WITH THE CABLE! You must purchase a USB-A to USB-B cable separately (one end is a normal USB connection but the other end is a big old fat square shape with a slightly curved top). It's an \"old\" printer style cable.3. But I couldn't even connect via USB, so had to call HP Support for assistance. After the technician remoted-in to my computer, installed the wrong drivers, installed the right drivers, tried figuring out why the printer was showing an error for the ink cartridge (after it super-slowly auto-printed 2 pages of wi-fi setup instructions TWICE, for a total printing of 4 pages overall), then they made me \"watch\" a video on how to remove the ink cartridges b/c they couldn't tell me how to do it (and there were no instructions included about it), they finally determined there was an issue with the black ink cartridge. She said it happens periodically where the cartridges arrive already \"dried up.\"- This normally wouldn't be that big of an issue since you can print using the multi-color cartridge, but since it's 5 days before Christmas and I just bought the printer this morning on a Prime same-day delivery rush to print shipping labels since my big printer died last night, I'm going to end up using a lot of the color cartridge to get the job done and HP said they were ONLY going to send me a new black cartridge. I had to protest MULTIPLE times since their \"defective\" black cartridge is going to cost me money because I'll have to replace the color cartridge sooner than normal. The Tech finally got approval from a Supervisor to send me a color and black cartridge - and I'm supposed to receive them in 17 days. SEVENTEEN DAYS!*** Do your homework before buying this printer. When I think about how much time I wasted today and all the hassle I went through just to print labels to ship Christmas packages, I truly wish I had spent $100 more and bought a \"decent\" printer. This one is AWFUL and the setup experience was beyond horrendous.*** Your only safety net for ensuring you'll be able to print quickly upon delivery is to buy backup ink cartridges and a USB-A to USB-B cable (if your router isn't \"manually\" switchable or if you're unsure). And even with all that, it will still probably take you a while to setup so it's usable. And you'll still end up with an old model printer with poor print quality that requires you to download the HP Smart software through the HP website before you can do one darn thing!Trust me, keep shopping.",

It even has a program for how much you print so you can get ink sent to your home!Only issue I have is that the print quality is actually not great compared to school and work printers I've used. compared to a high quality print, I'd compare this printer's quality to be a 9/10 compared to the high quality ones. The print isn't exactly smooth around the edges, but if that wasn't an issue then the print would be perfect!Edit: It was the page. I used an old piece of paper and that's why it looked bad. I bought new letter sized paper and it came out flawlessly! One issue I have is that it requires a PIN from a router label which isn't located anywhere around the printer itself and isn't printing a sheet it said it would. That's a problem that I really would like fixed considering I did not previously know there was a pin. It also says that the password is \"12345678\" as default but that didn't work. I did not change any password or pin of any sort so that confuses me.",

                "reviewText": "Let me preface this by saying I'm a pretty tech-savvy person. I don't usually need to use manuals when it comes to things like printers or other computer peripheral devices, because usually they're very simple and easy to sort out on their own. But setting up the wireless connection on this printer (as well as the HP Instant Ink feature) was a lot more painful than it should have been. I think most of my issues were a result of this printer only being able to connect to 2.4GHz wifi networks - it cannot connect to 5GHz wifi networks. Luckily I have a router that broadcasts both types. Next, none of the connection instructions worked for me - following the instructions in the manual did not work. I had to watch several videos and even then, those instructions didn't seem to work either. Finally, I had to download some sort of \"Printer Doctor\" software from the HP website and I had to plug the printer into my computer with a printer cable, and only then could I connect to the printer. On top of all this, the next time I turned on the printer, I had to go through the ENTIRE PROCESS all over again because it was like my computer forgot the printer - it was still listed in my printer devices section, but had the \"Offline\" status and was not able to print. So now I just leave the printer on (I think it goes into a power-saving/standby mode after awhile) so that hopefully I don't have to repeat all this again.But aside from these issues, the printer itself works well when connected and the print quality is great. Hopefully you have better luck connecting it than I did, because it really is a great printer!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this printer and it works just fine. Some reviews on amazon and a few other websites claim that the setup for this printer is \"impossible\". Either these people are completely inept at computers or they have a defective item. Many claim the instructions are too hard so I will do my best to explain it here.First off It requires you to install from the CD, so it's not plug and play. Once you have plugged the printer into your computer and turned it on, you will then need to install the ink cartridges. Open up the front panel that has the HP logo on it. The ink cartridge head should automatically reposition itself for you so you can install the cartridges. (Make sure the printer is turned ON when you do this). After you have done that you will need to install the drivers from the CD that is included. (or you can download the software online) Once you do that you're almost done. It will ask to install not really necessary software like to make calender's and other things. you can choose to not install that. I recommend then opening up the HP deskjet 3700 series software and click on \"Manage Your Printer\" and print a diagnostic page. If everything is aligned and there is no streaks on the page as the test say's then you're done. You can now start using your printer.I did a diagnostic print myself and everything was perfect nothing else was needed on my part. Printer prints fine and it prints pretty fast over all. The only \"con\" of this machine is that the paper feeder is at the top of the printer. It would save more room with people who have full on computer desks if the paper feeder was on the bottom in a slot.",
