                "reviewText": "Like others have mentioned the wireless setup requires several attempts - just follow the prompts very carefully and don\u2019t let the \u2018failure to detect\u2019 message deter you. It will connect and once it does, from my experience, the connection is good.The print quality is very good - I was surprised at just how good the detail quality was on standard printer paper. However, I print large scale tile prints and after one 20\u201d x 20\u201d full color image I\u2019m at 50% ink. The good thing is Canon brand ink for this printer is around the same price as 3rd party ink. DO NOT BUY 3rd PARTY INK! I\u2019ve ruined many printers with 3rd party ink and the ink quality is very bad hence the cheaper price, however, Canon brand ink for this printer is between $25 - $33 which is not bad at all.The only other con is the print speed - my very first print was fast, a 20\u201d x 20\u201d image over 6 pages took 5 minutes. The same exact print an hour later is still printing which I started nearly 25 min ago.All in all if you\u2019re buying this printer on sale so far I can say you\u2019ll be happy. A solid 4 stars if this is how it functions going forward.Pro: Print Quality, only 2 cartridgesCons: WiFi connectivity is a process, print speed is slow",

I successfully printed 5 return labels, applauded my abilities, wildly denigrated the whining idiots who'd posted negative reviews, and went on with life.2 months later, I attempted a print job using both sides of the paper, and it jammed. I cleared the jam, reset the printer, cleared the job from my laptop, and initiated the same job anew - this time asking for print on a single side. The printer - still fully, wirelessly, connected - spit out 2 clean sheets of paper, made a few noises, stopped, and generated an error message on my laptop indicating printer was jammed.I went to the Canon website and read their troubleshooting suggestions. I also spent some time on Google, where the following phrases auto-populated in rapid succession:- canon mg3600 series printer not responding- canon PIXMA stopped working- canon PIXMA not printing wireless- canon PIXMA wireless not working- canon printer not responding WIN10- canon mg3600 not printing IOS- canon printer not working with MAC- canon printer not working with DELL- canon printer not working with PCI began troubleshooting.I took printer back to factory resets, reset the printer, cleared the jam, cleared the job from my laptop, and initiated the single-sided job anew. The printer spit out 2 clean sheets of paper, made a few more noises, stopped, and generated an error message on my laptop indicating printer was jammed.I deleted software/drivers and reinstalled, cleared the jam, cleared the job from my laptop, and initiated the same job anew.

The printer spit out 2 clean sheets of paper, made a few more noises, stopped, and generated an error message on my laptop indicating printer was jammed.I tried calling the CANON HELP LINE. After 20 minutes navigating the IVR, the uncontrollable, hysterical laughter started. I unplugged the printer, lifted it approx 4 ft in the air, and slammed in into the floor.I'm not optimistic about further troubleshooting.",

So I needed to print out some important documents. I ordered this printer after reading a couple of reviews. In my mind there are going to be some good and some not so good but this printer had a lot of good reviews. I ordered it at 10am. It arrived same day at 3.50pm. It took me maybe 10 minutes to set it up and that was really just skimming the instructions. It's just super simple. It picked up my wifi immediately and I printed off a pic in my photo gallery ( it asked me to). The print looks just like the pic. Ithen printed off the documents Ineeded. All said and done about 15minutes. Great price for a very easy printer to use.Maybe some printer expert can take my old printer and do something with it. Lol!",

Imprime con facilidad documentos que tenga en su iPhone de manera inal\u00e1mbrica as\u00ed cmo archivos que tenga en su laptop. Configurarla no fue nada dif\u00edcil ya que el software con el que viene se encarga de todo. Funciona con iPads y iPhones sin necesidad de hacerle ajustes extras pero con tabletas y celulares Android si ser\u00e1 necesario descargar el app de Mopria Print pero no es algo complicado. Para uso dom\u00e9stico funciona a la perfecci\u00f3n y es muy pr\u00e1ctica. En la cuesti\u00f3n de los cartuchos adquir\u00ed un kit de recarga y quedaron a la perfecci\u00f3n. El \u00fanico detalle que para recargar los cartuchos se tienen que seguir las indicaciones de recarga al pie de la letra para que te queden bien los cartuchos. Siendo que ya tengo algo de experiencia recargando mis propios cartuchos este proceso me toma 10 minutos y no he tenido problemas. Obvio esa es una alternativa a comprar cartuchos nuevos cada vez que se acabe la tinta de los cartuchos que est\u00e9s utilizando.Dada la facilidad de uso de esta impresora, la calidad de impresi\u00f3n y su precio la recomiendo ampliamente.",

One was a laser mono colour and lasted years and the other is a multifunction ink jet which failed because it has to be taken in to have a reservoir and ink pads cleaned. Nowhere did I see any reference to this issue before I bought it and it is too heavy to take it in for service. This Cannon is to be a replacement. It comes with a power cord and ink cartridges. As usual, you will need a printer interface cable which is not supplied. It was really easy to set up. The printed page was much better than expected even though a few reviews noted disappointment. I do need to print each month but the amount will be minimal otherwise printing in colour would be costly. If you run out of only one colour you will have to replace the whole cartridge. I haven\u2019t tried but I doubt that it will accept cartridges made by other companies. Many printers have a chip or firmware to prevent that. One good point is that you can choose to print in black only. I haven\u2019t tried that yet but that may suit you if colour isn\u2019t a necessity. It also copies which is nice to have. For me, this printer will work out if you have lots to print it may not be right for you.",
