                "reviewText": "This label printer used the same Print Master (android) app as another similar thermal unit I have with different (also 12mm) label cartridges. There's a way to pair the desired printer. The included cartridge is not as full as the first set of replacement ones I ordered, but it is a useful supply.Others have reviewed the printer from the app standpoint and since it's the only software I know which is used to create the content, much of the performance is bound in this software, which is reasonably functional. It's graphics can be best characterized as what computer software used to call \"clip art\". There is a capability to print user supplied pixel graphics, but the print head limitations means no color or grayscale so don't expect photo files to satisfy (it'll try). That said, it would be nice to have an accurate print preview. (Maybe I'll look for some sort of a 12 mm label printer emulator.)It's nice to have a rechargeable battery. Also note that 3rd party cartridges which have proper overall shape matching the sample may be missing two holes to clear a couple of interlock plastic pins in the cartridge cavity. Furthermore, observe that the printer disengages the tape drive roller when the cartridge door is not fully closed, but will run the motor and thermal head futilely in that state.If you need basic 12 mm mono printed adhesive plastic labels, this printer delivers in a useful way. I found I needed some iteration: design-print-evaluate-tweak-reprint is often required, so there's room for improvement regarding the app.",

I got around this by making all the labels 'one' (app photo) and cutting them apart. Unfortunately this eliminates being able to use the borders.",

                "reviewText": "There are lots of reviews for this, so I want to clarify the battery information before moving on to the usage. This is model M960 which comes a lithium (rechargable) battery preinstalled and mine was already charged. There is another model M960D that uses AAA batteries. This model (M960) does not require AAA batteries (and cannot use them) and it appears the lithium battery cannot be replaced (I couldn't remove it), however it can run via the USB-C cable if the battery fails. I expect the battery to last many years (maybe 10) so for me that's not a concern.The label maker itself is really easy to use. All I had to do was turn it on and download the app and print - I didn't have to adjust the tape at all. The app does not require an account to use, but to save your labels for future use, you'd have to create a login.The label maker comes preinstalled with a long spool of label tape - in other words, it does not have fixed sized labels. Instead, here is a button on the left that you press to cut the label (kind if like a receipt machine, but it cuts for you, so no tearing is required). The positive side of this design is that it can print messages of any length. The negative is that if you print more than one label at a time, you'd have to cut the labels yourself, because the cut button has to be manually pressed. You can still peel the back off the label and stick it on your item when you are done though.Overall I really like it. I checked to see if I could buy individual spools of tape and this model is compatible with other brands like brother and there was even some clear tape that could be used. So there should be plenty of options for a long time. I like it for $19",

First thing I did was do all of the drawers in my toolbox, so much easier to find anything! The machine was easy to set up and print right from my phone. It feels well made and I think it will last a long time. The tape reals are easy to install, are inexpensive, and come in tons of colors. For the cost, this thing is the best, get one!",
