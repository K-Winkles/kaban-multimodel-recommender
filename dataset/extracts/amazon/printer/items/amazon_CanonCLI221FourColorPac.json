If you have one of the Canon printers that requires this ink - as I do - you either use it or you don't. (If you don't, you won't be able to print out this five-star review!)Seriously, though, from my long experience with Canon printers (and other products), I highly recommend purchasing these genuine Canon ink cartidges. The quality always seems to be better than the do-it-yourself refills or the off-brand refills from other sellers. (I have nothing against these refill-sellers - in fact, not only do I wish that the quality was as reliable, but I highly recommend that you recycle the empty OEM cartidges so that they can be re-used in the refill market.)The Canon ink that I bought here from Amazon is very reasonably priced, and is the high-quality stuff. My black printouts seem blacker, my yellows more yellow, and I am sure that (when I replace the cyan cartridge) the cyans will be cyan-er. (For New Englanders, I would like to say that the magentas are more magenter.)Enjoy your Canon ink. (Hopefully, you also enjoyed this goofy late night review, too!)",

                "reviewText": "and for selling these Canon inks at the lowest price around. The inks for the MP980 are expensive, and the ink in these cartridges does seem to run out quite fast (my reasons for rating 4 of 5 stars). I need to order more cartridges for my printer (so to have an extra supply on hand when needed), and I notice that today's price for the CLI-221 4-pk is a few bucks lower than what I paid 3 weeks ago. If Amazon can go even lower on their Canon CLI ink prices, I would be most ecstatic! And by the way, I do love my Canon PIXMA MP980 printer. Photos turn out great, and text printing has been superb. Compared to my old printer (bought 5 yrs ago), this MP980 prints at a very fast speed. Also love the auto-duplex feature. I also use my MP980 as a scanner and photocopier and have no complaints. I haven't used the scanner to scan negatives or slides yet, but can't wait to do so. My only hope is that the quality of scanned negatives/slides is pretty darn good. I've always been partial to Canon photo products-cameras, etc.-and this MP980 printer does not disappoint me. I would definitely buy another Canon printer. And, I will definitely keep buying my inks from Amazon...best prices (so far) and very fast shipping. Every product ordered through Amazon for the last 10 months has arrived as expected (except for one item, though wasn't fault of Amazon), and the packaging & shipping of products has been just superb. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I have learned the hard way from buying cheaper off generic brand ink compatible cartridges (Epson & Canon) only to have my printer clogged up or leaking with ink that ruined a couple of good printers. Yes, the off brand inks will work for awhile, but will produce slight color variations in the finished quality print and eventually WILL CLOG your print heads and leak. Printers are much cheaper now and YES, the price of NAMED BRAND ink cartridges cost as much as the printer but that's the price of QUALITY CONTROL to maintain your printer working in top form for many years. I purchased the CLI-221 (4pk COLOR INK) and the CLI-220 (3pk BLACK INK)for the third time in a row without any problems. To me this is a lot cheaper than the head aches and time consumed measured in hours or days of not completing a print job and the mess of cleaning from a clogged or leaking print head inside my nice printer that is now worthless. Also add the time that it takes to drive (gasoline) to a local store and get a new printer to replace your clogged or leaking printer. If you want to save some serious bucks go to AMAZON for the best ink prices and best printers prices too, if time is not of the essence and still no tax and with FREE SHIPPING to my house! I will not compromise my time nor quality ever again, to save a few dollars that will cost me triple the amount including a new printer to replace from a clogged or leaking printer by using off brand generic ink compatible cartridges. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR A SUPER DEAL ON A GENUINE CANON PRODUCT!",

                "reviewText": "I have a Cannon pixima mx870 printer. This ink is worth getting. It seldom clumps up or dries out. It almost always uses the entire tank. In fact, so far it has never failed but I hate to say never because there is always to chance. I like to keep a box or two ahead of my anticipated needs. This ink lasts a long time and produces more copies than several other inks I have used in the past. I don't have to mail back empties or go through the manufacturer either. So good deals can be had from different locations in addition to this site. You get your monies worth. Also by getting all the colors I need for this printer at one time in one box I am covered. How fast each color is used depends entirely on what color printing you do. But individual tanks beats one all in on tank by a mile.",
