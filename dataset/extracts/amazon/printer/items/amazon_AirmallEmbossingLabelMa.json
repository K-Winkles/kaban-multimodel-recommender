                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Simple, Durable, Excellent Label Maker",
                "reviewText": "PHOTOS WILL COME SOONFor how cheap this label maker is, it is one of the best organizational tools I currently have. Let me go through the pros and what they could improve on.The Pros\u2b50Print Quality - It works by physically stamping a letter onto a piece of film. Once you have printed out the words you wanted, you would then cut them off with the integrated cut feature. It takes a little time to get used to, but the print is seen and does not fade over time or while in the sun.\u2b50Durability - I am a very clumsy guy, and so when I dropped it out of my hands several times, I expected the label maker to stop working. I was incorrect. Despite multiple drops of up to 6-7ft, the label maker was fine and suffered no damage. I would not recommend dropping it, though!\u2b50Adhesive - The film the label maker provides is of superior quality. It does not feel cheap, and even better, the adhesive actually sticks to many different materials. Out of all the labels made so far on leather, popcorn walls, plastic, etc., they have all stuck and have no indications of falling off. The adhesive is top quality, and I can not praise it more\u2b50\u2b50The value of this product - This product comes with a label maker with the film already in it and several other roles of film. Out of my week of constant everyday use, I could barely get through the first roll. This product outclasses every other label maker at similar prices with the value it provides.The ConsFor the price, there are no cons to this product. Everything below is just me being very nitpicky.Build Quality - I called the product incredibly durable, but that does not mean it is perfect. The product is completely plastic and is very weird ergonomically.\ud83d\udc4d TLDR:This is one of the most competitive label makers with its price compared to the features it gives to the person. This product is a wonderful organizational tool and will make your life so much more convenient. I highly recommend this product.",

I was acquainted with this company as I have one of their mini printers (which I adore!), so I hoped I would enjoy this product just as much. Well, I definitely do!Right off the bat the product was super easy to use. The instructions are some of the best I've seen, simple enough that you don't get confused with a bunch of extra info, but also clear enough to understand! I also really love the included problem guide, it feels like a really handy table for if I ever run into issues in the future, though I haven't yetI love the range of labels that came with the machine as well. The metallic colors are beautiful, and I love how subtle the transparent labels are as well! I feel like there's something here for every use, and I can't wait to use this to aid with desk organization as well as crafting projects :) definitely a new favorite gadget!",

Of course this all happened 3 days after my return deadline. Frustrating. A thermal label printer may be the way to go for a more reliable inexpensive product to label unimportant things at home.
