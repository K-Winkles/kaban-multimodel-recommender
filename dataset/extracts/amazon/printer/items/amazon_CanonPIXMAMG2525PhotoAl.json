I bought this because my original model (MP280) that I've had for 20 years has decided to give up the ghost and I was told that this model (MG2525) was the replacement . I have not had it long enough to test it properly but a quick test of a color photo was not as good as the old unit. I am presently attempting to rectify that problem and go through a full test of its capabilities which should be finished in February. For now I'm saying that the new is not as good as the old.",

                "reviewText": "Straightforward setup, only took about 10 minutes to complete. However please note, this is an extremely \"barebones\" printer with very few features. To start, this inkjet does NOT have wireless capabilities, you'll need to source a printer cable as one is not included inside the packaging annoyingly. Another shortcoming is the lack of a screen and user interface, this printer has 4 buttons in total (power, stop, black copy, and colour copy) so using it without a computer is extremely limited. Value for money is great as this was on promotion for 50% off from regular $99, I was pleasantly surprised to find a printer that you can still purchase for under $50 in 2023. One set of starter ink cartridges are included however these are known to become used up fast given their low introductory page yield; typical 3rd-party remanufactured cartridges run for about ~$50 per set for the 245/246XL and the genuine Canon ones run around ~$85 before taxes. This is an inkjet printer so it is recommended to print at least one or two pages per week to keep the ink cartridges fresh and prevent clogging/drying up. Overall an excellent buy if you're looking for a reasonably priced wired inkjet printer just keep in mind its limitations and shortcomings.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this printer a year ago as I needed to print some stuff out. I managed to do so with the ink that comes with the printer (and it is NOT much!). Then the printer is out of ink and I don't need it for months, so it sits. **Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago.** I just bought ink for it, and need to constantly print stuff off for my child in this time of quarantine. I am not printing difficult things. Simple black and white documents. But. This. Printer. Won't. Let. Me.It constantly malfunctions while printing. It jams 75% of the time (I WISH this was an exaggeration). I am just wasting ink and paper, as when things do start to print out, it often catches mid-way and then it jams, but continues to print in the one line. Obviously the printer must be un-jammed and the document re-printed.I have calibrated this thing, I have opened it up and inspected the inside for damage or warpedness that might cause the rollers not to catch the paper properly. I have played with different papers, sizes, amounts, you name it. The best part are the terrible noises it makes when jams and malfunctions. My kid actually just ran from the room with her hands over her ears.Have you seen the move Office Space? It's an oldie, but a classic. If you haven't, let me paint you a picture of the highlight of the movie. Workers from this office have a hate on for a photocopier, and in the movie, they take the machine into a field, and legit lay the beat down on it. I am a very upbeat and cheery person. I also work with a machine line and have jokingly said before that I'd like to have an \"Office Space moment\" with parts of the line that break down and give us problems. I am NOT joking when I say I look forward to punting this piece of garbage into a trailer that's on it's way to the dump. No tears will be shed. No vigil lit. I might throw a party in celebration, and order another printer, which I can guarantee you, will not be a cheap ass canon printer. I hope you heed this warning and do the same.",

                "reviewText": "3 stars for this basic printer but only 1 star for the experience,. The printer is vey basic but entirely adequate for my needs. It requires a Canon USB cable connection to the PC which is not included (very cheap sale tactic) which I already had from another Canon product and I prefer to WiFi.Printer commands are simple but the scanner menu is very annoying as it is mostly promotion material and only 1 out of about a dozen icons actually controls the scanner. Scanned docs can go to Documents but not to a Document subfolder, so an extra step.The CD included is useless, none of the files work. The driver can be downloaded from Canon support site. An instruction note should be included in the package so time is not wasted. A testament to extreme cheapness of the seller.The buying experience was bad, Printer came with a defect (fault) and had been obviously incompetently repaired and probably had seen several returns. In addition to the mailer to me there were 3 others still apparent. Amazon must have known about this. No idea how old printer is as it first came out about 10 years ago. I have since bought one from the Source and it works fine.Do not buy this from Amazon.",
