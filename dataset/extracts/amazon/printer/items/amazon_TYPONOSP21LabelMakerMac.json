                "reviewText": "It's wild that you can get a bluetooth label printer this small and relatively inexpensive, that somehow all works! This Typonos P21 label maker is a thermal printer, it heats up special paper stickers to darken them, not a new technology at all but a good use of it here, the right blend of high-tech and simple. It does need app connection from a phone or tablet, but that lets you print all manner of simple graphics and borders as well as text.It comes in an attractive enough box that's eco-friendly cardboard except for the shrink-wrap. The instructions aren't that hard to parse, there is a roll of label tape included but it's packed inside the machine and not ready to print until you load it properly. The instructions were simple and easy to follow.The printer is a cute little thing, slightly thicker than a smartphone, surprisingly lightweight but not cheap-feeling. It has a USB-C port on the bottom and a silicone hand strap on the side.The label printer needed charging when it arrived but once that was done it set up very easily. Loading the roll isn't that complicated, labels face up with the first label sticking out a little, it self-aligns after pressing the power button quickly.The power button is flush in the side so it's a little awkward to press and hold, but nothing terrible, and it beeps softly once when it turns on, twice when off. Once on, tapping the power button prints out a MAC address; long-pressing powers the unit down. The unit self-aligns after printing out that first MAC address label.The cutter is manual, it's so simple that I hadn't realized how effective it was, slide the switch up and it cuts the label, leaving it in the machine until you pull it out.Printing labels from a device means using the Labelnize app, which is easy to use and has good data security policies; it does want location access and an account log in every time, though this can be skipped. It says it can do your own images in 203 DPI, but as it's a black and white thermal printer, it really can't do anything complex, line art is about all it can output to look like anything. Normal text looks decent, as do the included icons and borders. Finer text doesn't seem to vector evenly, some thicker and some thinner, but it is adequate enough for my tastes.",

                "reviewText": "I used this to help me to set up a system for organizing my apartment; I have trouble keeping things in their place sometimes, so labeling shelves in the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom helps remind me that things have their places. It's a fairly easy install on the phone, but the instructions are not too clear, and the app isn't totally intuitive. (I wish I could send the labels to the labelmaker from my laptop but it's mobile-only, to the best of my knowledge.) Trial and error helped me figure it out, and now I make simple, clean labels to help me organize. There are options to use images, too, but I'm mostly using words. I have no idea when I'll run out of the label roll or ink (I wish there were a gauge where I could see about how many labels/how much ink are left), but I've used it to print about 20 labels and it still works.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Impressively versatile label maker that has an unexpectedly well-made app",
                "reviewText": "With pretty much unlimited customization options, you can be sure that the label you print is exactly the way you want it.From opening the box to turning on and connecting the label maker to my phone, the whole setup process was a breeze. Kudos to whoever wrote the instructions because they were brief yet informative enough with pictures and text to allow me to easily start using this thing. The machine comes with a roll of labels inside that easily peel off and stick to whatever you need. Although I ended up wasting a few labels setting this up to print properly, you just have to feed the label through the opening and print a test label to get it aligned.I wasn\u2019t expecting too much from the app since it appears to be exclusively for this manufacturer\u2019s label makers, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well-developed it is. You are not required to make an account to start printing, but you can choose to do so if you\u2019d like to unlock all the features. Nevertheless, you do get plenty of customization options including fonts, images, clipart, and more. I have a Brother label maker as well, and I have to say that this one is easier to use, smaller, and more customizable. The print quality may not be the best as it struggles slightly with fine details, but everything printed out has been legible.Currently, this is priced at $26. There is a $4 coupon that reduces this to $22. Compared to similar products on Amazon, this label maker is priced fairly. I was surprised by the number of alternatives that also print these small size labels, and although I can\u2019t comment on their ease of use, I can say that this label maker meets all my criteria of being a product that performs well without going overboard. Based on the price, I highly recommend this product.Overall, for anyone who wants to create creative/cute labels for their belongings, the label maker hits all the marks while being compact, simplistic, and lightweight.",
