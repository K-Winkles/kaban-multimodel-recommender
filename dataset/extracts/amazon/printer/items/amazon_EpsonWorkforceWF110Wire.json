                "reviewText": "Inkjet printers have existed since the 1980s and Windows 10 has been around since 2014. How is it possible in this golden age of technology that a tech company could have such a difficult time providing something as fundamentally basic as a printer that simply prints a document sent from Windows? Seriously, Epson? Is it too much to hope for that when I press print that a document with comes out of the printer without having to reboot or reinstall a driver or spend hours on the internet looking for obscure solutions for your poorly executed product? I am not trying anything exotic like cloud printing a PowerPoint from my Android phone from halfway around the world. I am sitting at a laptop on my home network printing a test page. With all the money you make from the replacement ink, there should be a little budget somewhere to hire at least one developer who could track down the bugs and and address some of the reliability issues.It is an understatement to say that this printer has been one gigantic frustration. How long did I spend wondering why the \"next\" button was grey out on the install until I realized I needed to click on the picture of the printer in the dialog? More than I wanted. I am not a tech idiot. I know more than enough about printers, drivers, networking, and software development which means I know this is probably not a chair to keyboard interface problem. If it is, then it is one caused by Epson's inability to make something usable by mere mortals. I also don't accept the cheerful \"we care so please contact support and we will work it out for you\" suggestions that always gets posted as a response to these negative reviews by image management companies hired by tech companies like Epson who are to preserve sales of poorly executed products. Anything support will tell me to do is already available on the web and I have already tried it. Plus, should I really have to spend 4 hours on a weekend trying to get something as trivial as an inkjet printer to work? This is not complicated technology. It should just work, out of the box, period. IMHO, this printer is a symbol of the complete lack of respect Epson has for the user experience. I am sorry I bought it.",

I was a bit worried that it would not be a reliable option, being so compact, but that is not true. this is really a quality little printer! I travel 6 months out of the year, so having this along is great. I highly recommend getting the co2CREA case for this, also on Amazon. the case is sized so that it can hold a supply of 81/2 x 11 paper as well as the printer and all the extras.",
