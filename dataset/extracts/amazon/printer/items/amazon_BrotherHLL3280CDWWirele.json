                "reviewText": "Color laser printers get a bad rap as far as printing anything beyond simple graphics.With decent photo paper, I've gotta say, I'm really impressed with how well this prints photos, as well.Sure, it's not quite professional quality, like you can get with a good inkjet on photo paper. But it's WAY better than I expected, and really plenty good for the rare situations when we want a photo printed.And other color graphics/images look as fantastic as hoped/expected. Even on normal laser printer paper, you can print off nice color graphics for kid crafts or embellishing hobby projects, and they come out really nice.While it's true that most people don't NEED a color printer, it's been a more useful and fun luxury than we anticipated.And while the cost-per-page is going to technically be higher than say an ink tank inkjet printer, this is an overblown concern for many/most people. The (relatively small) difference in the cost of the printer itself might justifiably matter to some. But the cost of toner vs ink is only going to be significant if you are regularly printing a LOT.What matters more to me -- and I suspect many people -- is that (like any laser printer) this sucker NEVER DRIES OUT. You can go a month between printings if you want, and it doesn't matter! You don't get sideswiped by clogged nozzles when you just want to hop on really quick and print something. You don't have to go through cleaning cycles and spew out tons of ink and use up paper. You simply print stuff when you want to, and it just works.It starts printing pretty quickly, too, within 15 seconds or so for the first page. I don't know why I saw at least one other review claiming it took much longer than that.I'm glad it has an ethernet connection in addition to the WiFi option. And the little color touch screen, while not necessary really, is kinda handy sometimes.So far the toner economy has been phenomenal. Even the skimpy starter cartridges lasted way longer than I expected. Again, it all comes down to your print load. If you're pumping out hundreds of pages a day, yeah, you probably want to look elsewhere. For a typical home load, I maintain that this thing is amazing.",

                "reviewText": "The printer itself is fine it prints quickly, and for a laser style printer. The output is fair. When printing pictures, the color is not saturated like the original. It\u2019s all doll and flat even blacks show up that way, but that\u2019s just part and parcel of the kind of printer it is.Setting up the printer was needlessly involved. Vendor software is just a shell to download more software, and all of it is designed to just install unneeded components. Got tired of jumping through hoops to just have the printer installed and deleted the vendor software which still hadn\u2019t managed to actually setup the printer.Adding the printer to the wireless network wasn\u2019t smooth either yet at first wouldn\u2019t detect any wireless networks, and trying to enter a manually was a bust. Fortunately, attempting to set up the wireless network a second time it found the wireless network it was able to connect to the network. From there setting up the printer trivial just added printer. It was found automatically and configured automatically by the operating system.Through the entire unboxing and set up process the vendor constantly tries to get you to subscribe to a wasteful print supply agreement where you will always and unavoidably throw toner out. This appears to be brothers way of bringing the farce of inkjet printer supplies to laser, printers, and artificially increase the cost of printing, while simultaneously increasing waste, which is bad for the environment.This extends to the printer itself, which is designed to prevent you from actually using all of the toner and toner cartridge. I knew this going in and had verified that when the printer refuses to use more of the toner the block can be overridden. It\u2019s annoying and has to be done every time for every toner cartridge. Not the end of world but an unnecessary annoyance.",

                "reviewText": "Brother HLL3270CDW Wireless Color PrinterThis is one of the most cost effective color laser printer on the Amazon market. At the time of review it's a sub $400 ***laser**** color printer. !!!! I think the only one I can find on Amazon market that's a bit cheaper is one from Lexmark. I chose this because of the fact I can get third party color toner for a fraction of the cost of OEM. This tremendously reduces cost of ownership which is a huge deal when it comes to color toner. The Lexmark laser just didn't have as ubiquitous a market for third party toner replacement. I couldn't find any . So from longtrrm cost of ownership perspective, this Brother beats the Lexmark easily.This is a really large printer . You need a good amount of desk space to hold it. It is also fairly hefty with the weight. You need a good stable desktop to hold this up.Installing wifi or wired is preferred choice as it leads to easier placement and PC and laptop and phones can easily access it around the house. I chose and prefer wired connection for most reliable network access printing. For legacy, you still have the usb connector. Printing from your phone is a no brainer too. Download printer app on android (and apple) and it's so easy to reliably print a doc from your phone.The printer is ultra fast and quiet when printing. It has a low fan noise of course but from older laser printers I have including older brother lasers, this model seems to be significantly quieter when operating.Pages are crisppppppp. Text is sharpppppppp. Lines are smooth like pro print lab. Colors are vivid as well. It helps to have good paper quality ultra white 25 lb laser paper. Does it print photos? Sure... But don't expect photo I lnkjet quality prints. I have a Canon Pixma pro series for photo print which is far superior to this . But for quick photo prints for small draft work or kids school usage, it's ok.I'm really impressed with this . If you're looking for a daily printer that's easy to justify with your wallet that prints fast and crisp, and cost of ownership is really budget friendly for a color laser, this one is easy to recommend.",
