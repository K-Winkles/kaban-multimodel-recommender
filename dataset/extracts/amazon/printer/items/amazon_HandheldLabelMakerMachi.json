I also have a lot of remote controls, and labeling each one sure helps you figure out which remote control you need.I've had it for a little while now, and I really like it. It's packed with features I haven't even used yet. The labels I've made and features I've used are all good and simple to use. The print on the labels has all printed nice solid black words.It comes with four rolls of tape and a USB cord (no block). It's not rechargeable; the power is supplied by either plugging it in or by batteries.I love that it is standalone, and I don't have to connect it with my phone. I'm looking forward to I being more organized.",

                "reviewText": "This label maker is a monster. It's like holding a mini computer in your hands. To clarify, those are positive comments.. It's also light in weight, which wont strain your wrist from excessive holding. The keypad is similar to a computer keyboard (QWERTY). Holding shift, plus selected button will select a special function, and you know that you are selecting the correct symbol, as the shift is annotated with yellow symbols. This product has options to make labels for different items. All of the symbols that you can think of are embedded into this label maker, which is awesome for my OCD friends that need everything perfect. There are 3 different size options, and an option to make copies. Another cool feature is the mirror feature that will print the label in reverse.. After playing around with this product for a few minutes, I noticed that it was extremely intuitive and you can pretty much figure out how to operate all of the functions without instructions. The label make is powered on using a USB-C cable, or you can install 6 AAA batteries, which is okay if you plan to use this device here and there but, if this is going to be used on a daily basis, then I highly doubt the batteries will hold up for a long time. It will probably be best to invest in rechargeable batteries. This is actually why I knocked off a star. If this product had a built in rechargeable battery, this product would easily be a 5-Star Product. Other positive notes; this product comes with a lot of extra label tapes. It's enough for the next 6 months for me. . Overall, it is a good product at a good price.Best Regards,Amazon Vine Voice (Product Reviewer)",
