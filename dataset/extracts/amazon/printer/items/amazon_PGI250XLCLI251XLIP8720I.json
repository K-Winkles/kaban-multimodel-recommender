                "reviewText": "I've have bought two sets of this ink, and they work great in my Cannon MX922 printer.Note: this is not OEM Canon ink. However this is a high quality ink that works great, and is much more affordable the Canon ink.I printed out a photo on glossy paper, which came out great.If you see the text is fading, stop printing immediately and replace your ink.If you see double characters, it is likely you need to replace the print head. You can get a new OEM print head by calling Canon Parts (for about $100). Search for \"ordering Canon Parts\". You cannot order them online, but you can order them by calling the Canon Parts number. Also consider buying a printer strip at the same time ($2 more).",
