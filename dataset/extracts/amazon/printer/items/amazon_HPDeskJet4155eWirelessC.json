                "reviewText": "I know some reviewers had issues setting this up so I was a little worried. But it was super easy! I'm old fashioned and I guess you can't get a printer that isn't wireless very easy anymore. I was worried about it being wireless...we've all had issues with internet, wifi, or phone issues since back when it it all began. I was hesitant expecting issues with signal, communication between printer and phone, iPad,etc.WOW! I am VERY happy with this printer/scanner!! I cross stitch and buy a lot of PDF patterns. I can just download to my phone and print! Also, the patterns in my magazines, I can scan and print only the patterns i want, and keep my magazines on the shelf. When I buy a paper chart/pattern, I can scan it for my working copy (so I can use a highlighter or pen to mark on it), and sell the original, or give it away and not have to ruin the original by marking it up or bending it with lots of use. I use the XL ink cartriges and print in 'draft' mode which saves ink, but prints just as good as normal mode. If you're printing photos you would want the better quality print mode of course. The app is super easy to use! I've had no issues with internet or communication from any device. The ink that comes with it prints quite a bit depending on the settings you choose for draft or quality print, and if you're printing a lot of color pages, the ink does go quickly. I put a new color and black XL cartridges in and printed 70 pages that were full pages of dark browns and dark colors filling each whole page. My ink levels are low but still printing all colors and black with no lines or fade looking color like it will when you are at the end of your ink and keep printing till its so faded its time to change ink. Yeah, I get my moneys worth out of my ink...I first print what needs to be clear and perfect and when ink starts looking light, I print what isn't so colorful, and doesn't have to be perfect just able to actually see it or read it until it prints that page that is a 'I can't tell what's what on the page' or it starts getting really light and makes weird line breaks in the color.Over all, this is a great printer/scanner!I am very happy with it.Take your time setting it up and do every step properly as you go.One tip I learned a couple days ago: if you change your wifi password, you will have to remove the printer from your app, and reset it up as you did out of the box...but it only takes a couple minutes. The most frustrating part of that was the time I spent trying to just go into the app and change my wifi settings for a password change. I couldn't find anything for that, and I'm not too fond of 'tech support' no matter what item,brand,service,etc. So there may be a way to do that without removing it and resetting it up, but that worked for me without having to deal with tech support.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new printer and the reviews here won me over. After doing some additional research, I ordered. Now, several weeks later, I must say I love my HP DeskJet 4155e! I am absolutely satisfied.The packaging was nice. Then came time to setup and I was super anxious. After taking time to read the easy to follow steps, setup was a breeze. I've had to ask a few times is the printer printing. I click print and don't hear much of anything. This quiet and quick enough printer, and print quality meets my home office needs perfectly. Considering the value, the price is great. And the ink trial? A nice bonus. Setup ink is included with the new printer. Your first shipment of ink arrives a week or so after you complete your new printer account setup. I was pleased to find out you can print up to 700 pages during the free trial. There's an option to also add HP paper to your plan which I thought was great.I purchased an all-in-one HP computer in 2020 at an unbelievable price and it exceeded my expectations. My experience has been the same with the printer. So, HP again gets a win from me. The only small thing I noticed was when I used a highlighter, the black ink smeared a bit. Tech support can be better, but the app is sufficient. Way to go, HP! I look forward to purchasing another computer soon.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a compact all-in-one printer to fit onto the printer stand of my small desk (in the pics, it's sitting next to my 24\" mac). I read that the 3755 was highly rated on different review sites but I got the 4155 because it offers mobile fax which I need occasionally to work from home. I used to have the big heavy 8610 model I used for school years ago and which I gave away to mom after graduation. It was a great work horse of a printer. This printer prints slower and print quality is fuzzier. But the compact size, print/scan/mobile fax, and wireless/bluetooth capabilities all make up for it. I wish the paper tray was built-in rather than in the back but then it'd make the printer bulkier. I would love to have automatic double-sided print option but it's not a deal breaker. Overall it works well as a basic home printer and meets my needs. I used Instant Ink for 8610 printer and found it to be a great affordable option. I have never thought it's based off of the number of pages printed like one review noted. It always showed the ink level on the app and ordered more when it was low. Years ago before Instant Ink I used to buy regular HP ink cartridges at $25 a pop and tried the cheaper refillable options which didn't work for me. I think Instant Ink is a good flexible option to get ink. I will definitely update this review if I run into any issues. If you print regularly, need sharp high quality print and printer size isn't important, I would recommend getting something more powerful with the built in paper tray and double sided option. But if you need a small printer for occasional printing I think this printer is a good dependable option.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the HP printer from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase. The setup process was easy and straightforward, and I was up and printing within minutes.The print quality is excellent, with clear and sharp text and vibrant colors. The printer is also fast, delivering pages at a quick pace. I appreciate the ability to print from my phone or tablet using the HP Smart app, making it convenient to print from anywhere in my home.One thing that I really like about this printer is its compact size, which makes it easy to fit on my desk without taking up too much space. The paper tray can hold a decent amount of pages, and the printer is compatible with a variety of paper sizes.Overall, I highly recommend the HP printer for anyone in need of a reliable, high-quality printer that is easy to set up and use.",

The only \"negative\" thing I have to say thus far is that the box it came in was slightly damaged, but I bet that was cause it was delivered by intelcom (I hate them). The other is that the colours weren't as great as I'd hoped they'd be, but it recommends to use the HP paper for colour... If it changes once I get some, I'll change to 5 starts.",

                "reviewText": "This is absolutely the best deal you can get for a color printer, first off the printer is an amazing price, secondly it comes with 3 months free ink! (The first shipment takes a bit of time after signing up, but after that the ink just keeps on coming!!) Plus if you stay subscribed you pay as little as $1.5 a month for ink! The quality of the printer is perfect and I've printed well over 100 pages already. So happy with this purchase. Only issue was the setup took a while, the printer doesn't have the best UI so if there is printing issues it's difficult to debug. When in doubt, power off and power on (sometimes it takes up to an hour after turning back on to reconnect to all services).",

The machine starts whirring and you can hear wheels turning. Then the machine coughs, starts whirring and spinning again, and nothing happens. The input paper tray did not pick up any paper, which was fresh out of the package. I tried a couple of more times and gave up.After struggling to find a trouble shooting guide online, I tried 2 or 3 suggestions to remedy this. What do you think happened? Right. Zero.This machine contains 100% plastic parts, obviously not working. The guts of this machine would be better off in Toys R Us.Long story short, it is presently on its way back to Amazon. Don't buy this machine. In fact, stay away from HP. Their quality level is poor at best. They are a low-end supplier, and spend too much time trying to get you to buy ink.",
