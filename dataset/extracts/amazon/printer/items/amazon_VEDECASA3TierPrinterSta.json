Not only does the stand have an aesthetically pleasing appearance, but it is also well-made and quite sturdy. The printer stand has an all-metal frame, 3 sturdy wood veneer shelves, and a roomy (collapsible) fabric drawer that can be positioned anywhere on the stand. You can configure and rearrange the middle 2 shelves and the drawer to your liking, making this printer stand quite versatile. The charging station has 2 receptacles and 2 USB ports. The charging station is powered by an attached cord that plugs into a wall receptacle (outlet). This printer stand was easy to assemble (tools provided).Besides being used as a printer stand, this stand also would work well as an end table or as a nightstand.This printer stand is sized a bit small to adequately accommodate a HP ENVY Inspire all-in-one printer. A printer of this size will hang over all 4 edges of this printer stand.",

Someone said that it was not strong enough to hold a standard printer, well I have a Canon printer on the top and an Epson photo printer on the middle shelf with a thick ream of paper in the drawer at the bottom. I don't recommend that you sit or stand on it but this is not a weak or wobbly printer stand. The casters roll around easily and I can move the printers without having to pick them up and make my back hurt. I'm very happy with this printer stand. Oh, it looks nice too.",
