                "reviewText": "I desperately wanted to love this printer because I have a Jaden\u2019s thermal label printer that I love. It\u2019s super compact, lightweight, prints quickly, you can charge it and use it without it being plugged in, take it with you in a purse or backpack, there\u2019s a third party zip holder you can get, it\u2019s bluetooth/wireless, and has an easy set up on an iPhone app. (note that I\u2019m already used to how Jaden\u2018s printing works so it was easier for me to set this one up then when I had to learn how to do the thermal label printer-it\u2019s a little different than typical printers). Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t realize that the paper that thermal printers use is essentially fax paper, which are very thin. Youths-google fax machine ;)Also, good luck writing on it with ink without it smearing all over. I think they sell special markers to write on it. But that\u2019s more $$$. If you use the paper rolls, the print out won\u2019t be flat. For this, I recommend getting the flat paper that has perforated edges that they sell, but that paper also has its own issues which I will review separately. Paper costs about $20 per hundred pages, which is a lot compared to regular printer paper and the cost of ink! some things to note (about this one and other thermal printers): it doesn\u2019t print double sided, you can\u2019t print in color (it uses heat and not ink), and paper runs out very quickly.I exchanged it for a cheap ink printer (with a scanner, copier, and fax that thermal printers don\u2019t have) that gives 6 months of free ink and paper. It goes through ink like I\u2019ve never seen before but my other ink printer broke after many years.I think this printer would be good for certain people depending on your needs. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t meet my needs.I ended up returning and getting a regular ink printer.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It\u2019s really small and compact, convenient for my dorm room. It came with a roll of paper in it already and refills are pretty cheap too ($20 for 4 rolls I believe). I love the design of the printer and it prints pretty dark! The only thing I don\u2019t like is that the paper comes out rolled (because it\u2019s literally in a roll) and that it doesn\u2019t print double sided. It\u2019s not that big of a deal though since i can just flatten the paper out myself and I can deal with one-sided sheets.Also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant but I have an IOS and the app works perfectly with my phone. Not sure how well it works for Android. Other than that, I would recommend this printer <3",
