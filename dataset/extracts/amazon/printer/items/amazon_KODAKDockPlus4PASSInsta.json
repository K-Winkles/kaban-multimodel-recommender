I successfully replaced the ink cartridge twice, but then the cartridge got jammed inside the printer. When I was able to remove it, I found the print film was split. Keep in mind this took a couple years to happen. Regardless, I am ordering this unit again as it prints quality photos and as most, it can just do so wirelessly through the app and my iPhone. It's small enough to travel with and packs every quality I expect.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Very poor instructions. For something so simple, instructions should have been easy.",
                "reviewText": "For something you might think should be simple... print a picture from my phone, Kodak made it incredibly difficult. First, the instructions are so TINY I had to scan them into my computer and enlarge them. Even then, at the largest I was able to clearly make them, they were so small they were difficult to read. I suggest buying a microscope with this product to read the instructions. Then again, the tiniest instructions were just the safety precautions, so I suppose you can get by without reading those.The instructions leave so much out. \"Just launch the app, choose photo, select print number, select printer icon.\" Right. Very little in those steps matched what we experienced on our phone. In the instruction images, step 3 has a hand pointing to the lower right icon that says \u201ccopy.\u201d The instructions call that \u201cSelect print number.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine how those relate. The instructions just leave it there.There is an extraneous asterisked note: \"*Select SNS if you want to print the photo from it.\" Nothing else about SNS in the instructions, just a random phrase in the \"Printing in the App\" portion. Nothing in the text above that linked to the asterisk.First, don't download the app until you have the printer connected to your phone through your Bluetooth configuration. Otherwise, on Android, you'll repeatedly be taken to the system app settings page instead of the app. You'll have to uninstall the app, turn off the printer, turn on the printer, connect the phone to the printer through Bluetooth, and reinstall the app to get it to work.In the app, the Bluetooth icon starts red. When the App's Bluetooth icon is YELLOW, it's ready to print. Yellow doesn't indicate to me something is ready. Green or blue would have been more appropriate for \"ready\" or \"go.\"For some reason, the phone's native photos received a warning about low resolution. So far, only photos received from another phone seem to be full resolution. We didn't notice a difference in print quality, however.If you get a \"jam...\" good luck. On the second photo we tried to print we received a paper jam. It didn't look crumpled or mutilated, it was just half-way through the printer. We followed the instructions on \"Paper jam.\" The printer made a bunch of noises. The paper stayed in place. We had to remove the paper tray and the ink cartridge and pull very hard to get the paper out. It ruined the paper in the process. It appears we can only load one page into the printer at a time or it \"jams.\" We don't want to waste the paper, so we're hesitant to load more than one sheet at a time.Finally, the printing process is slow and cumbersome. It prints the photo in four SLOW passes. Yellow forward and back, Magenta forward and back, Cyan forward and back, and a clear coat pass called \"Protect\" forward and back. I expected more advanced technology at this stage in the game.We're very disappointed in this printer. If I had known how poorly designed it is, we'd have paid a bit more money and chosen a better product.",
