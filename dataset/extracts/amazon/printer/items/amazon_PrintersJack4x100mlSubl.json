The inkjet printer sublimation ink is used for Sublimation Heat Transfer Printing, not for Direct Sublimation Printing. 3. Our sublimation ink can be used for dark color fabric(include black) but should use with sublimation paper for dark colors Polyester Fabric or other products with coating. 4. The heat press machine setting will vary (include temperature and time) when the substrates are different. Time & temperature settings may vary by artwork and material thickness. If you are new to sublimate or haven't used this ink before, I would suggest a practice on some scrap substrates before committing to your best substrate. 5. Please avoid mixing sublimation inks of different brands, which may cause the print head to block. (This sublimation ink is different from other sublimation ink under the brand of Printers Jack, So it can't be mixing use with other Printers Jack's sublimation ink.)

                "reviewText": "I don't write too many reviews, but I feel as though this brand of sublimation ink is not getting the attention it deserves. I spent days researching sublimation ink brands before finally choosing this one, and I'm glad I found it. The print quality is superb, the price is competitive, and the number one reason I chose this brand was the fact that I would not have to tinker with the color profiles on my computer in order to get the correct colors. I filled the ink up to the lines on my Epson ET-2800 and set my printing options and started printing. I will never use another brand. If your buying sublimation ink for the first time, look no further. An added bonus is that this brand is designed to work with converted Epson eco-tank printers. My sublimation designs come out beautifully every time and the colors are bold and bright. This stuff deserves 1000 stars!!!",

                "reviewText": "Ink ColorWith the exception of black, magenta, cyan and yellow look to be vivid and vibrant colors. The black however, looks like an off shade of black. The black looked muddled - looking like a mix of purple and brown.Ink loadI had no issues loading black and cyan into the cartridges, however - I ended up having issues with yellow and magenta. I did the syringe trick, but it took too long, so I ended up poking holes at the bottom of the bottles to see if the ink siphoned better, it did. There was a little bit of a mess, but the ink is where it needs to be.Print JobUnfortunately, the black is very faded just like a few of the comments that were mentioned. I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s only the test run and I can adjust the depth of the blackness in the settings. I did order another ink set, so I\u2019m hoping that the first one was just a bad batch - unfortunate for my current projects\u2026UPDATE from 3 stars to 5 starsI printed a few jobs and I'm not sure what changed, but the print job came out brighter, the blacks were more defined and darker. The reds, yellow and blue come out vibrant and full of color. I alternated between koala and htvront sublimation print paper, so I don't think that the paper was the issue, it maybe just time. I recommend users to do a few print test jobs before initiating the final step of your product.I am thoroughly satisfied with the print ink.

Refilling the cartridges on the 1400 is a nightmare and the cartridges for the Ricoh are so pricy. Just purchased the Epson ET2760 for regular printing and was impressed. So, purchased another to use getting back into sublimation. Now, sublimation ink?Almost purchased from another highly rated seller on Amazon, but we're back to syringes. Fortunately, stumbled on to Printers Jack with the bottles made for the Epson. There were some negative reviews. However, if you are familiar with sublimation, you know that the print is going to look dull. It is the heating process that does the magic. And magic this was.I printed up several shirts (100% polyester) and OMG the colors are fabulous. The colors are vivid and just POP off the shirt. Best inks ever. The convenience of not having to purchase new cartridges and chips and no syringes are such a bonus.The pricing of the inks is great. They were shipped quickly. I highly recommend this product and seller. Now, off to create more beautiful prints!",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try this sublimation ink after reading many positive reviews about this brand. The print settings provided did not work with my Windows machine, the colors were way off with printing from Photoshop to my Ecotank Epson. But, I read someone else's comment to keep color handling as Photoshop Manages Color, then printer profile Epson Standard RGB - Gamma 1.8 and then in print settings, change paper type to premium presentation matte and in more options, click custom under color correction, then click advanced and change the color mode to epson vivid. After that change, the colors are AMAZING! I actually prefer the prints to my Sawgrass 1000 now. With ASUB paper, the prints have much more saturation and vibrant colors that are mostly accurate, just a few strange ones every once in awhile that I will have to play with the settings to get exact. And, the price is like 1/10th of the Sawgrass ink, so overall, very, very happy. Will be purchasing this again when needed. Hope that helps someone with the same machine having the same issues with the printer ink profile.",

It has given me the brightest colors and I have never had a problem with it drying. Filling the printer with this ink was very easy! The bottles are shaped just like the brand name ink bottles that came with the printer. (DO NOT USE THE INK THAT CAME WITH YOUR PRINTER FOR SUBLIMATION!) You open the Printer Jacks Sublimation ink bottle one at a time and open the matching color slot on the printer and place the top into the slot and watch your ink fill up the tank. If you did not use all of the ink, save it and use it again when you are getting a little low.They shipped they ink very quickly, and they arrive in a plain cardboard box with a pair of gloves if you want to make sure not to get ink on your hands. I have never needed to use the gloves. It's that easy.",
