                "reviewText": "I started a small printing company and bought a brother 5855. It worked well so I decided to purchase a second printer to use as a backup. This was the only one being offered on installments. I should have realized right there that something was amiss but thinking it would work just like the 5855 I decided to purchase. Boy was I wrong!!!1. The ink cartridges (402) are smaller than the 406 used in the 5855.2. Runs out of ink extremely quickly!!!3. The printer has a permanent memory that records every cartridge you put in.4. This means you cannot reuse a cartridge even if you refill it or swap it out with another one first.5. You cannot buy cartridges in bulk and stock since they carry a batch code and the printer will not recognize a new cartridge if it carries the same code as the old one.6. You have to wait until Brother or whoever came up with this rubbish to decide to manufacture another batch of cartridges with a different code in order to purchase and again you run into problems 3 through 5.7. Looked at ALL the reviews available before purchasing and no one had mentioned the ink problem.8. What good is a printer if you cannot print???WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!",

I've had low usage for about a month and still am on the supplied ink. It prints a little slow for a full page color photo but that is not what I need so I don't consider it a 'con'.I researched many all-in-ones at this price range and below and the only 'con' I could say about this is it is a little big. Bit it also appears to be quite the workhorse. If you purchase, enjoy!",

Previo a este equipo ten\u00eda un 6920 de la misma l\u00ednea (solo que m\u00e1s antiguo, obviamente) y la verdad es que ha Sido una mejora sorprendente, mayor velocidad de copiado e impresi\u00f3n y acci\u00f3n del alimentador de documentos en definitiva es superior. El cambio m\u00e1s notable es el tama\u00f1o del \u00e1rea de escaneado ya que el cristal no permite el copiado desde este mismo de documentos superiores al tama\u00f1o carta. Para copiar documentos tama\u00f1o oficio y doble carta hay que hacerlo desde el alimentador de documentos y las hojas hay que colocarlas desde el dep\u00f3sito de hijas trasero y de una en una (esto te tomara un poco m\u00e1s de tiempo) pero si no haces muchas copias doble carta o impresiones ni siquiera te resultar\u00e1 molesto.
