It\u2019s not what the photoshopping on the ads for this product show, but I was not expecting a \u201cphoto quality\u201d product.I DO however wish that there was more sticker paper, and the colored paper (it comes with green, white and purple sticker paper) was optional, not standard.Other than that, it\u2019s a pretty cool little toy, and good for decorating stuff, and journaling!HOWEVER: I have only had this for a short time, so if there are any issues, they haven\u2019t popped up yet. The printer itself feels sort of chintzy and it warns about leaving it plugged in too long for overheating? (Yikes?) If I have issues down the line I will update.",

She can customize and print her own pictures or notes but also can choose to use their suggestions. The notes print in black and white. She is quite the artist and is loving that she can colorize these herself. The printer is so easy to use and she enjoyed being able to use right out of the box. I enjoyed that the seller is so easy to do business with and has great communication through the buying process. All in all great experience and super great product.",

                "reviewText": "Regrettably, my experience with the Memoking Mini Portable Sticker Printer T02, bundled with 3 rolls of paper, has left me with strong reservations. In all honesty, it's challenging to find redeeming qualities, and I express these sentiments not to discredit the product but to share my genuine disappointment.The first caveat comes with the understanding that this is an affordable product, and expectations should be tempered accordingly. However, the printing quality is subpar, to say the least. It's reminiscent of sketches drawn with a toe \u2013 blurry, undefined, and lacking the clarity one would expect from a sticker printer.Furthermore, the darkness of the prints adds another layer of frustration. The images come out so dark that discerning finer details becomes an arduous task. This not only detracts from the visual appeal but also renders the prints less useful, defeating the purpose of a sticker printer.The choice of film for the stickers is another letdown. It resembles receipt paper, thin and lacking the adhesive quality one anticipates in stickers. The lack of proper adhesive makes the stickers prone to peeling off, significantly diminishing their practicality.While one might argue that you get what you pay for, it's essential to note that even within the realm of budget-friendly products, a baseline level of functionality is expected. The Memoking Mini Portable Sticker Printer T02 falls short of meeting these expectations, and its drawbacks significantly impact its utility.In conclusion, my candid assessment of the Memoking Mini Portable Sticker Printer T02 is one of disappointment. The printing quality, darkness of prints, and the thin, non-adhesive nature of the sticker paper collectively contribute to an unsatisfactory user experience. For those seeking a reliable and functional portable sticker printer, exploring alternative options might be a more prudent choice.",
