Reviews from several months ago indicated the black cartridge for this printer was hard to find, but that hasn't been the case; I ordered & received them just fine. I think Brother had a distribution problem at the time which was solved. The printer works great, better than the one it replaced, and it's faster. It has a small footprint, and the display is very clear and easy to use. I chose not to go with automatic ink refills--these companies get aggressive at promoting that--but if I can handle ordering ink when it gets low, which I think I can, this little guy will do the job just fine for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "Historically, I've been an HP and Canon Printer guy. But the quality of them have really declined. After I tossed my last printer in less than a year I branched out to other printer manufacturers. I eventually decided on this printer and it did not disappoint. The overall size (form factor) is about 60% of the size of my last two printers yet still has all the same features. Print quality is great. Print speed is fast for an ink jet! Cost for replacement cartridges is reasonable. The instructions for Wifi connectivity for my PC's and mobile devices might have seemed a bit daunting at first but in the end it was pretty easy. The printer does go to sleep but it wakes right up when a job is sent. I've even caught it performing its own printer head cleaning maintenance! You wont find that on an HP or Canon! As an IT professional I am very pleased with this printer; and that's not all that easy to do. I strongly recommend this printer!",

I bought this cause I've had a Brother black and white printer for years and have loved it. the reviews I read for this said the prints looked great so I bought it. Set up was super easy but as soon as I printed something, I was not happy. The colors were a little dull and grainy. I printed the exact same thing with my black and white printer and this printer and, to me, the print quality was very different. My old printer has dark blacks and sharp lines. The new one was subpar. Brother customer service really tried to help me trouble shoot but eventually, I just returned it because nothing made it better. They had me try doing a cleaning that apparently uses ink to flush the system. It used up all the starter ink and didn't finish the cleaning. Customer service said they would send me free ink to make up for it and to finish the cleaning but two weeks later the ink never came. That's when I returned it. I still love Brother products, just not this printer.",

                "reviewText": "Hey, I\u2019m just like most of you guys out there, I don\u2019t know jack about printers, all I want is to NOT get ripped off buying some piece of junk that is going to piss me off and cause me a bunch of aggravation and hassles before I end up reboxing the damn thing and hauling it down to UPS to send back for a refund. That scenario I have been through several times before I found THIS one. This particular Brother Model was recommended to me by the computer geek who came over to try to get my previous printer repaired and told me it was unrepairable and to send it back and get THIS one. Which I did and am eternally grateful to him because THIS printer performs flawlessly and was a breeze to set up and prints easily off all my devices including cellphone, laptop, iPad, and desktop. ZERO problems after 4 months now.I know it\u2019s a roll of the dice whenever non techy people like you and me go surfing around Amazon for stuff like this. Believe me, I feel your pain. Just let me assure you that if you are looking for a reliable, hassle free, no nonsense printer at a reasonable price that won\u2019t have you cussing up a storm and screaming at the top of your lungs trying to get the damn thing to work right, well, THIS is the one. Hope this helps.",

I'm the only person that uses it, there is nobody ghost printing things, essentially when it wants to work, it works great, but otherwise I would look elsewhere.I thought perhaps the ink cartridges were misaligned and removed them and placed them back. For 15 minutes the printer could not \"find\" them, and advised I place them. Out of seemingly nowhere, it then detected them, and reminded me again of the Brother ink replacement program, which seems like a scam if they truly give you such a small amount of ink to bate you into buying their replacements.",

Print up a test page drop it on the scanner and bingo the printer is calibrated. Excellent job Brother. I bought this as a 3rd printer in my home. I needed one on the main floor of the house because climbing stairs has become difficult. I own 2 Brother laser printers one of them is a high end office machine the 9840CDW. I always bought Brother printers because they are perfection. This new one is no exception. The Wi-Fi setup was a breeze. For this price it\u2019s a bargain. I signed up for the automatic ink replenishment because it was inexpensive and this is not my main printer so I only print about 40 pages a month with it. The big jobs I save for the 9840. Also this printer is very fast much faster than the laser printers because there is no warmup. So don\u2019t bother with Hp and go with Brother. I was never happy with my HP printer so years ago I switched and never looked back. No disappointments here.",

En d\u00f3nde escanea estaba un poco tallado de la parte de apoyo. Supongo que porque la compr\u00e9 con descuento. No la devolv\u00ed porque realmente la necesitaba, al principio se trababa y me aparec\u00eda que ten\u00eda atascon, la revisaba y segu\u00eda con el mismo problema, hasta que la voltie y vi que en el riel hab\u00eda un tap\u00f3n anaranjado de una entrada de cable. Sin contar todo lo anterior funciona perfecto, m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida que la que ten\u00eda, imprime perfecto a doble cara, la calidad de las copias y escaneo tu las eliges, la pantalla touch es genial. Lo malo es el materia de dicha pantalla, es muy sensillo parece una bolsa de plastico pegada. Otro punto negativo es que no hay cartuchos (y vaya que he buscado), por lo que tuve que recurrir a rellenarlos y funcionan muy bien, la tinta de los cartuchos que vienen en la caja me alcanz\u00f3 para 26 impresiones saturadas de color y 100 impresiones en negro (incluyendo copias).",
