                "reviewText": "Got this in hopes of using it for labels, maybe some fun stickers, and other small items. It's a nice compact size, it's very easy to set up, and it prints pretty quickly on a variety of labels. Let's dive right in for some more information.The printer will handle label paper between 1 and 4.6 inches, and it's easy to adjust to the appropriate size to print. Once loaded, the printer will figure out what size of label you have inserted, and will handle that size until you change it. Depending on what labels you're putting through, it's nice to have a label holder/roller stand to feed things to the printer in a controlled way that won't get jammed in case you're printing a lot of labels. I've put 4x3 standard labels, the 4x6 test pages that came with the printer, and 2 inch round stickers through and the printer easily recognized each type as it was inserted into the printer.Printing is fast, and a huge benefit of thermal printers is that they don't require ink, toner, any separate cartridge, they just happily print with heat, as the name would imply. That does mean that no, these do not print in color. The printer does print things very clearly though, saying it's 203 DPI. Small detail isn't going to come out super clear, that's just not as easy for something like this to do, but as long as you're not expecting this to do anything it's not meant to do, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the print quality. Addresses, some short stories for a project, and simple graphics all came out looking really great.The Labelife software is available for multiple platforms, I tested on PC and Android. Being able to connect to the printer via both USB and Bluetooth is really nice. Sometimes you just need to print a quick label and having more options to do that is better than being stuck with one way to do things. The software didn't want to work with my PC initially for some reason, but waiting a little while and then trying again I didn't have issues. Might have caught it just before an update or something, who knows? There are tons of pre-set label sizes that you can choose from to either work from scratch or start from a template. You can save frequently used labels for later use, and the software is pretty easy to work with.So far I'm very happy with this printer. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and does that very well. If you've got an Etsy shop, ship a lot of things, or just need something like this for creative endeavors, it's worked really well and I think it would be a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "I am very disappointed. I bought the printer for the Bluetooth function and it does NOT work. I connected it via cable to my laptop and print labels, totally NOT what I bought the printer to do. There is an app that is required in order to connect to the printer using Bluetooth. It does not work. If you want a shipping label printer for your computer, it works wired but not wireless. My laptop recognized the printer and it works well that way. Not a total loss but by no means met my expectations...hence the single star.I am adding this to my review since after just a couple week use, the printer started jamming the labels and now will not print at all. It just blinks a red light. Not worth the frustration and definitely NOT worth buying!",
