                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A very good printer, if you can ignore its demands to update firmware",
                "reviewText": "Summary:It is an excellent printer (4.6 out of 5) if you don't mind its constant requirements to update the firmware, which I have not since the day I bought it. I have had this printer for over a year. It has printed close to 5,000 pages of different sizes, papers, colors and document types. As someone said in the other posts (a big thank you), firmware update is only to drive users to get Epson's proprietary ink cartridges. When the printer harasses me to update the firmware, I just keep on ignoring it. Epson does a good job to harass you both on the printer and computer - just ignore it.Pros:1. Only printer for <$500, which could print Ledger paper (11x17), which was a must for me. This thing prints beautiful and very crisp AutoCAD drawings. The lineweights and scales are phenomenal.2. Excellent printing quality using stock and generic print cartridges. The printer can be really customized to get the right tones and textures for your print. Works very well with heavy stock papers and photo papers. I am yet to try any stickers, but I do not foresee any issues with it.3. Good printing speed. It is not blazing like the commercial printers you find in the offices, but it is very fast for what it does.4. Excellent connectivity. I had no issues with using either Ethernet or wireless. The printer can print on my Windows devices and Mac machine. I do not print from my phone, so cannot comment on that.5. Heavy duty. The printer has printed approx. 5,000 pages so far without any troubles. I have not seen it overheat nor do any weird activities when it is printing.Indifferent:1. Scanning. While scanning quality is very good, the direct scan option is cumbersome. You cannot use the scan button on the printer to scan into the computer disk. You have to go to the computer and activate the scan software to perform scanning. This can be an issue, if you have a setup where your office is on one floor and the printer is on another, like I have in my home.Cons:1. Heavy. This thing is decently heavy and bulky. Don't try to keep on moving it or have it in your mobile office. Also, make sure to have a good sturdy and stable table. The printer twerks, jerks, sashays, parries.2. Constant harassment to update the firmware. It can sometime be very annoying, but that's a small price to pay, if you get to ignore it. Look at the bigger picture.Price:When I bought it, the price was just below 3 bills, I understand it has gone up by half a bill (however, I am seeing the price going >$400 on some occasions). The new price of 3 and a half is not bad given the shape of the economy and supply chain issues. Also, the OEM cartridges (812) are cheaper at Staples than trying to Subscribe and Save here.Bottom-line: A very good printer, if you ignore and disprove its petulance to update itself.Update 3/23/2023 - I have had it now for over 2 years. The printer continues to print flawlessly and as of now has little under 10,000 pages printed of different sizes and paper weights. It still begs to update its firmware, which I have not done since its purchase. The only wishlist item I have for this printer is if it were to come with the Epson ink-tank.",

                "reviewText": "I had a WF 4530 that I bought over 10 years ago - that printer was a tank and the ability to scan was HUGE. That printer recently died on me - over a decade with inkjet - with no issues despite long stretches of no use - I can't complain one bit.I bought the 7820 WF - it's an upgrade in every aspect. Quiet. Fast. Great print quality. Edge to edge printing. Wide format (if/when I need it). I've added a photo to the review of a printout I did using HP photo paper (4x6) to give you an idea of the quality - for home printed inkjet it's (IMO) top of the scale.One note: Don't use windows 10 or windows 11 drivers - download and install the drivers from Epson - they give you scan to pdf, scan to your computer, and the printout resolution from the windows drivers is horrible - the epson drivers are really needed.",

                "reviewText": "Lets start with the good. I needed an 11x17 scanner, that scans both sides, and has a decent size automatic feeder. I bought it, ran 3000 pages through the scanner. It jammed 3 times. All seemed to be false jams,, I could hit reset and the software recovered. This took around 2-3 hours. At one point I got side tracked reading one of the manuals, If you wait too long(or use a lot of memory opening PDFs), the scanning App will fail to save the scans, it will say something about being out of memory on the windows 11 epson smart scan app. This means that it is best to divide the scanning up into sections/chapters. Just use a PDF merger software afterward. I would not Scan in 3000 pages using the + scan more feature. You get an hour in and the software can crash.This is all good, because I bought a Cheap HP printer, and it literally did not have the software capability to scan a stack of papers, flip it over and scan the other side. It literally wanted me to scan 10 pages, scan another 10 pages, and then have me manually drag and drop the second half of scans into the proper orientation... manually... I got around 100 pages in before I decided to buy this printer. As far as a proper automatic feeder, and the software required to drop pages into a feeder, scan, and save without hours of manual BS.... Even with the above issues I had, The workforce was a good buy.Now for the bad. Do you see all the reviews complaining about Ink and it only runs 20 pages lol. So I set this printer up today, I run through the setup, and everything is fine. I go and hit the firmware update button, The firmware update, threw an error on the printer. The error explains that the ink cartridges are the original ones with the machine, that they are for limited testing only, and you have to buy ink. The firmware update also greyed out the previously working ink levels on the display after the update.This means on a 300 dollar purchase, it comes shipped with an error that you are out of ink. I'm pretty sure this is the response to the poor reviews on the device. Their fix, was to add a firmware update, to tell you, you need to spend 60 dollars on vendor locked ink. This makes the True cost of the printer 360 dollars. I've been purchasing printers since the 90s. Ink comes with it, these are not \"batteries not included\" devices. Quit your BS please.Now On the second note, You should NEVER EVER EVER update the firmware on this device unless windows 12 comes out or something, and the driver will make it work with a new PC or something. You are ALLOWING them to vendor lock the ink cartridges by updating this printer. The Ink cartridge competition will figure out how to bypass the vendor lock. When you type in the Ink name, vendors will say \"new updated cartridges guaranteed to work yada yada\" Then Epson will figure them out, and update your firmware to lock the machine YOU OWN, with an update that costs you money.Lastly, If you got this far. People are complaining in the comments that \"the ink is expensive but I have to run my business\" For the love of god, if you are using black and white prints, you should be buying a laser printer and toner cartridges! Inkjets are mainly for color prints. If you are printing stuff in monochrome, 30 bucks prints 1200 pages on a laser printer's toner cartridge.I never planned on using the printer on this device, its a backup for my laser printer, and I needed a good scanner. I'm really irritated this thing comes shipped with a giant orange fault light, that I can't clear, and a nag screen telling me to buy ink. Don't be cheap. I didn't buy cheap. I got cheap. Send the stupid printer with ink.",
