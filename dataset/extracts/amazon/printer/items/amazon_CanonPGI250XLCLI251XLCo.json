I learned (the hard way) years ago the many printer manufacturers install firmware on their machines that cause \"disruption of function\" if they detect the installation of non-brand name ink cartridges.Since I don't want my printer to become an expensive non-functioning \"paperweight\", I will have to return this product to the shipper.",

It's 1/3 the cost of the Canon brand ink and there's no difference in quality that I can detect. Also, unlike \"ink refills\" I've tried in the past, these cartridges are recognized by the printer and you'll see the \"low ink\" (or \"out of ink\") message when using the printer. I'm definitely a satisfied customer!",
