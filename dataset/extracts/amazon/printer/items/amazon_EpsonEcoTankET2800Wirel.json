        "description": "Your family needs a printer that\u2019s fast, affordable, and easy to use. That\u2019s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2800 \u2013 an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you\u2019ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2800 features genuine Epson print quality, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display \u2013 making it the ideal basic home printer. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of May 2021. 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of May 2021. 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. 5. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel App download. Data usage fees may apply. 8. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 30,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 30,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details. 9. SmartWay is an innovative partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that reduces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and improves fuel efficiency.",

                "reviewText": "My original package was taken by a porch pirate and the seller promptly refunded me. Customer service is prompt and excellent. I couldn't wait for another to be shipped because I needed it right away, so I had to physically go to the store to get one. I almost got a different model from Best Buy, but I was able to find the same model that I originally wanted (the 2800) from my local Office Depot store. I don't need double sided printing because I got my ecotank specifically for converting into a sublimation printer.I am fully aware that converting to sublimation voids any and all of the warranties of my printer and I shouldn't be broadcasting that I did it... but here we are. I used Tounker brand sublimation ink to fill my tanks and have been getting clean, crisp, beautiful prints. Because sublimation ink is thicker and more prone to clogging it is recommended to print at least once a week, so I have been trying to print at least once every three days at the longest in between uses. I have some pattern sheets that I use for earrings etc that are great time filler prints.I feed my sublimation paper into the tray one sheet at a time and I have not had any jams this way. The ink lasts seemingly forever, and the details of my prints are crisp. I want to buy another ecotank specifically for normal printing jobs, probably in white so it is easier to tell them apart and not accidentally print on the wrong machine before I've had coffee to jump-start my brain.The printer was super easy to set up with easy to follow prompts on the display. I didn't have any trouble connecting it to the wifi. I love my printer and will be buying another one when I can afford it, and I will be buying it from this seller again because they were very kind and understanding to work with when I bought my first one.5 enthusiastic stars",

                "reviewText": "In the past I bought HP printers, but became weary of their expensive, wasteful cartridges. A couple Canons were OK, and their separate inks a huge relief from HP's system. But one Canon became buggy, and a second broke, so that was enough of that. This Epson is my first, and I sure hope it proves reliable, because the ink system is FABULOUS. Refilling the separate tanks is easy and makes zero mess; the front-panel level indicators are brilliant. And the company's ink is so reasonably priced that knockoff stuff isn't necessary. Yes, as others have said, the single paper tray is a drawback, and the front-panel screen is so small and fuzzy to be utterly useless. But the smartphone app works well and I haven't missed the second paper tray. And print quality is mighty good. (My previous Canon also made such a prolonged racket at the start of every print order that I thought the thing was about to cough up its guts.) So, thus far, this Epson is a winner. And with HP's recent moves to brick its printers that don't use the company's expensive cartridges the decision is easy: HP -- never again.",

I HAVE that you DO NOT have a paper TRAY option. I only wanted the back feed tray for that card stock!! THE MATERIAL of this printer IS REALLY CHEAP PLASTIC! AND OVERPRICED AT THAT. I AM NOT A TECH-NO-WEENIE person, so trying to set this thing up WAS A PAIN IN THE A... for wireless. GIVE ME A PLUG IN ... and had it going in FIVE MINUTES!!! TECH SUPPORT ... uh, maybe, maybe not. I was just using my phone or the instruction sheet in 40 languages to set it up .... frustrator! Get you a USB cord & say NO on the do you want to set up wireless question. It goes so much faster.THIS DOES NOT NOT NOT COME WITH THE STINKIN' USB CORD YOU NEED if you don't want to use wireless. I'm OLD, and OLD-SCHOOL!. I like simplicity. Plug er' in & let er' rip. USB cord allowed me to DO JUST THAT. AND I'm lucky I had a snag of cords stuffed in a box ... wallah!!BUT:I LOVE THIS PRINTER if for no other reason than the 110# card stock that it can handle effortlessly! Now that I've attempted to test my digital kits for junk journaling ... the print quality is undeniable .... GOOD!!I WANT BORDERLESS ... and even though I spotted it somewhere ... it's not letting me find it again. SO, at this point, I don't know if it really DOES OR DOES NOT print borderless. When you see pictures of the machine on Amazon it SHOWS a beautiful BORDERLESS print sitting in the output tray ... so I'm thinking there has to be a way. AND digitals can be wishy-washy anyway...I'll be hunting around in the menu on the control panel (menu panel) to see if it can be set from there. Right now I\"M EXHAUSTED from attempting to set up wireless ... I should know better. This may beat out my hp and put it in the grave. BUT I'm hanging on for now to see how this baby performs and if the ink really does put out the volume of copies they say it does. Only time will tell.",

After reading reviews, I decided to switch from another brand to Epson.It arrived promptly, as only Amazon can do, well packaged and protected from clumsy handlers.It was simple to unpack, strip adhesive tape on movable parts and start it. The printed instructions were straightforward. I found pouring ink into the unit's tanks more promising than cartridges. The process was simple and easy, without a handful of plastic wrap left over. as with cartridges. I have added more ink since I bought the unit, and it's very simple - no spillage or mess. Additionally, the ink is less expensive than the cartridges I used on my past printer and holds more ink,The setup was simple as well -with one proviso. The included CD dropped the needed software onto my desktop; I loaded the paper and had my first print. There were a couple of illegible lines on the test print, so following the written instructions, I cleaned the ink heads, which fixed that.This brings me to the \"Proviso\". The integral screen that provides information and direction for various actions by the printer is tiny- 1-inch square. To read the information/directions I had to get down on my hands and knees. Bad eyes I guess, or bad placement ( under my desk) but the screen is still very small.The print quality is 1st class, and I am very satisfied with the glossy, colour-accurate photographs it produces, as well as day-to-day B&W and other basic colour prints.The Wifi connection to my computer was automatic.For the price, quality and function, I think it's a good buy, notwithstanding the small screen.",
