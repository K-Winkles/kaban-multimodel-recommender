The WiFi never worked well. Bought a USB direct connect cable. It worked for two weeks and just quit working at all. So I found and bought the Epson XP. For the price it's the best printer I've owned. And the scan functions have options that will work great for me! User functions are straight forward. Quality is just plain great. Thank you Epson for a great printer at a great price!!",

The Epson printer connection checker can't find it, despite the thing being on and installed, with the correct driver. Windows troubleshooter says it works OK, but when I try to print to it, the doc sits in the queue with an error that the printer is disconnected (it's not). This is so frustrating. I've re-installed the driver multiple times and made sure it's the latest version. When connected, it works OK and prints quality photos, which is why we bought it. But I am so regretting that we opted for this POS that is a hassle to print every. single. time.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, I suppose this printer is decent. The quality is iffy on some printouts (tends to blur at the edge sometimes). I have not yet been able to print out a good photo. Maybe it's just me. My biggest gripe of all is that I'm buying ink VERY frequently. I don't print items every day, and when I do it's one or two pages. However, I am buying black ink monthly (yes, it is the genuine HP full price ink). The ink cartridges do not last long at all. When I researched this product it got great reviews, most of them saying the ink lasted an appropriate amount of time. I do not agree with this assessment. Buyer beware....even though the cartridges are cheap (a factor that spurred me to buy this item), they don't last long enough and therefore you're really paying more for ink. The power button is a bit picky - sometimes it takes more than one push of the button to turn it on or off. The printer must be on for the item you're printing, which is different than my old one. Those two are minor issues, but on top of the constant purchasing of ink and the blurring of one side I would not recommend this printer.",

I'm disappointed that the printer doesn't hold more paper though. It makes decent scans. I've had it for a few weeks so I'm not sure how long the ink will hold out as the cartridges aren't very big. All in all, this printer replaces an older Epson. Doing my homework, ALL ink jet printers have problems as feedback shows many people are fed up with them, no matter what brand you buy. This isn't a glowing review, but an accurate review as to my experience. So far it makes an acceptable home printer.",

                "reviewText": "Had a Epson WF 3520 for years and was very happy with it. Unfortunately the WF stopped working and decided to get a new one. Have had this printer for about three months and have hated it from day one. The print quality is very good, especially the photos but the trays are awful. First, everything is black which makes it very hard to see what you are doing. The three trays are flimsy and are stacked on top of each other which makes reinserting them extremely difficult. The paper trays holds a quarter inch of paper so you are constantly having to refill the tray. The part that keeps the paper from falling on the floor is constantly in the way when trying to insert the tray and with it being so flimsy also afraid you're going to break something. I was going to also complain about the constant (daily) firmware updates that prevent you from printing unless you tell it to do something but found a YouTube that gave directions on preventing that. Bottom line I would not recommend this printer to anyone.",

It's essential for printing to an Epson device. Like any Android app Print Enabler will be periodically updated. Until you open the Enabler app and agree to the license terms, the printer will be unavailable.So be warned; every couple of months Epson Print Enabler will be updated and your printing is nada until you accept the updated license terms.",
