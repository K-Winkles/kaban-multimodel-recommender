This A4 sized G620 mega tank printer/scanner, by far, has the lowest ink cost overall of any printer I have ever owned. The G620 uses six colors of ink, due to the extra gray and red colors. These six colors make a noticeable difference in the photos over the 4 or 5 color printers. The true red ink is especially helpful. Anyone wanting to print photos without having that guilty feeling of high expense, this is the solution. The quality of the printed photos seem to be pro quality. Photo enthusiasts, I highly recommend this printer. Only two negatives. The scanner is high resolution but not super high resolution, and the pro quality photos prints are a little slow to print. This printer' price is low for its great prints. Still, watch for Canon sales on Amazon, and it will be a photopaper's dream solution come true.",

                "reviewText": "Let's get the PQ question out of the way. The Canon is very good, and having 6 inks is very helpful, but in the Canon/Epson/HP battle, Epson is #1, HP is #2, and Canon is #3 in terms of PQ. That's been true for a while. Remember-- all of these printers are better than process prints you purchase online or at Walgreens. They are all fantastic. (Full disclosure, I'm a former HP engineer.)Epson has a unique piezo technology that results in very consistent dots so their peak PQ is extremely good, even if the dots are large. But based on my experience, nozzle clogging with Epson is a problem.HP does a great job with printhead maintenance so their nozzles don't clog per se. They have beautiful small dots that create wonderful print quality, when it works. But because of the small HP dots (eliminating the need for multiple inks), when the printheads age or get out of spec, you experience nozzle-outs and banding, which ruins the picture.Canon provides a nice compromise where the technology relies on non-aggressive water/dye inks, with large dots, that should work for several years. I've only had mine for a few days but have printed 1000+ photos with no nozzle-outs.Where Canon completely falls down is in their UI/customer experience/ease of installation. For such a mass product, they really need to improve their game. Good luck trying to get this G620 to scan a photo using its embedded wireless adapter--it requires a perfect Wi-Fi connection (mine is 88%). I eventually had to connect to my main PC using wired USB to use the scanning function, whereas my previous HP scanned seamlessly over Wi-Fi.Overall the G620 is hideously difficult to use for any modern product. I know you have many great software engineers, so please fix this Canon.Overall, 4 out of 5 stars",

Color fidelity is high. The speed is also quite good considering that I am printing these at a high resolution.I like the ink tanks, too. I have used other photo printers with cartridges and they are hugely expensive and run out of one color at the most inappropriate times. So far, the ink usage appears to be minimal.This printer would not be good for general use, although it could be used for occasional document printing. It does not have a duplexing feature, so no two-sided printing. It also does not have a paper tray. Paper needs to be loaded into a feeder. Since I'm usually printing one photo at a time, neither of these features matter to me. It would drive me nut, however, for printing multi-page documents.Before buying this printer, I read all the negative reviews, many of which concerned setup and support problems with Canon. I had no problems in connecting the printer to my network. Everything worked as advertised, so I have no experience with Canon support.I am really pleased with this printer and would highly recommend it as a photo printer.",

I use this at home for only about 12-24 pages per month, so it's very light usage. And that's where this printer has shined. My old ink jet printers would clog after sitting for a few days. Not this one! I mean what I say in the title. After owning a half dozen printers over the years, this is the best one I've ever purchased! I haven't had a single clog. I'm able to print from my Windows laptop or my Android phone. I've only printed on paper and card stock, but I've purchased glossy paper, peel and stick labels, and water slide labels. I'll update this review of I experience any issues. So far, this has been an excellent printer.",

                "reviewText": "This printer is incredible!! The print quality is outstanding and the ink is not only affordable but you can print hundreds of pictures without refilling the ink. This is NOT an exaggeration. I am very impressed with everything including the price EXCEPT for the print speed. This printer is S-L-O-W to print. One picture takes 1.5-2 mins to print. But after printing hundreds of pictures and leaving the printer run all day, it did not disappoint. So as long as you have time to wait on pictures you will love it.",
