                "reviewText": "Ordered the purple version of this printer. It is perfect for getting labels printed lightning fast. I don't know if I can rate this printer highly enough, I would do 10 stars if I could! Easy to set up and worked great right out of the box. (The only problem I had was with Bluetooth connection and it turns out you just need to make sure you have \"advanced\" selected in the Bluetooth devices discovery option for it to show up.) It was very well packaged with everything needed to guide you step by step to using the printer. Love the quality and ease of use! If you need a thermal printer, don't hesitate, buy this printer!",

(it says the adapter is included as per manual, but it is missing in my order). After following all instructions to set up the printer and finally i printed the sample label, the label is not as clear as i expected. and when i want to print the label that i wanted, the printer shows offline. after several attempts, i gave up. very disappointed experiences. I have to return this product.",

                "reviewText": "Jumping into the world of online sales, the myriad of tasks can be daunting. However, the REKDOM Bluetooth Label Printer swiftly took 'shipping hassles' off my list. This isn't just any printer; it's a small business enhancer. The wireless feature was a massive plus, freeing me from the tangle of cords. It flawlessly connected to both my tablet and phone, making on-the-fly label printing a breeze.The 4x6\u201d labels are just the right size for most of my packages, and the clarity? Top-notch. Given that it\u2019s thermal and inkless, I was thrilled to bypass the frequent ink replacements, saving both time and money.I've primarily used it for my Amazon and eBay shipments, and the compatibility with USPS was an added boon. Set up was pretty intuitive, and the prints were consistently sharp. A little heads-up for Windows users: ensure you have the latest driver installed.All in all, the REKDOM Bluetooth Label Printer was a game-changer for my venture. Whether you're an eCommerce veteran or just starting, this tool is sure to elevate your shipping game. Efficient, compact, and reliable \u2013 what more could one ask for?",

I started over hoping to get someone else, mentioning I got no help from \"E\". Instead of getting actual help \"E\" answered me; he apparently didn't read my emails, so had to answer again. In the end he gave me some things to try, which I had tried most of them already.
