Here are my thoughts.. this printer offers impressive print quality with its EcoTank system, providing vibrant and sharp prints. The long-lasting ink tanks are a cost-effective solution, and refilling is generally straightforward, minimizing hassle. The user-friendly interface enhances ease of use, making it a reliable choice for any printing needs, whether it\u2019s business or casual. It quickly connects to wifi with no problems. I use this printer with my Mac and iPhone. I have enjoyed this printer, I have had no issues at all.",

                "reviewText": "For years, I have been using HP all-in-one printers with disposable cartridges. This one is incredible. I printed two double-sided, full-sized, color work and activity books (A4-sized pages) for my 8-year-old son, and the ink level is around 3/4. If you keep the heads clean, this printer will serve you well.I read some reviews about the low quality of prints with this printer. Well, my experience was just the opposite. So, their experience does not represent the whole; they should be outliers. These people might need to learn more about the printer's preferences for the basic printing rules. Printers print according to what you feed them with. The higher your raw and paper quality, the better the print you'll get. And remember to check the preferences for better print quality as well.One other complaint I read was about the wifi connection. It does not reflect the reality as well. The wifi card on the printer does not lose connection at all. The units these people have might be faulty. That does not mean these devices lose connection. And if you have a stable 2.4GHZ internet wifi router. This printer will keep its connectivity, unlike multiple HP products that I had previously. I had to turn wifi off and on every time I had to print something.The best part is that even the whole set of inks (black and two colors) is cheaper than the entire set of HP cartridges(Black-color).On the other hand, here are three things that are annoying about this printer: 1) the paper feed is from the top. 2) the LCD screen is too small. 3) generating a printing job outside the local network is crappy and glitchy. They need to fire the whole department of software developers in charge of this part of the software solutions. There is no excuse for an internationally sold product's software solution to be this glitchy.",

They were so easy to fill and have an auto shut off when full! Kudos to the designer who thought of that! The printer itself is a nice size and doesn\u2019t take up too much desk space.However there a couple things I find disappointing. While the black & white printing is very nice quality, I am not pleased with the photo printing. I print a lot of genealogy pages which include color photos and I find they lack color, intensity, clarity and brightness. I hope these issues resolve as I learn more about the printer.",

Great performance, never runs out of ink, ink tank is the only way to go.Churning out my Christmas cards bing bang boom.UPDATE 10/19/2023I LOVE THIS PRINTER. Soooo much more dependableI than my expensive HP. When sending a print job to the printer it wakes up immediately and prints. Connected via WiFi. In the past my expensive HP printer would pause and pause then had some issue with connection. But not with this Epson. it connects and prints like a charm. Just wish this Epson was not a top loader. Maybe Epson will fix this with the next model?I don't know about others experience and there are a wide range out there, but my experience has been a huge positive. The ET-2850 printer is smaller than I was lead to expect. The printer is lighter weight than I was lead to expect. The print speed is very good and prints much faster than I was lead to believe from those \"other\" reviewers. The ET-2850 connects to my WiFi easily HOWEVER could not find my 5G Wifi, only the 24G of the home network. However, my iMac is connected to the 5G home network and the printer still works fine even though the printer is on 24G side of the network. When a print file is sent from my iMac, the ET-2850 the printer wakes up right away and begins to print. The ink tanks filled fast and easily following setup instructions. ONE PROBLEM, using the phone-app for the initial setup process the app hung and appeared to have stopped during the \"INITIATING PRINTER\" process. So I ended up doing the installation using the printer screen itself. That went smoothly. I just wish this printer was NOT a paper top-loader. But with the hopeful $$$ savings on ink I can tolerate a top-loader.",

                "reviewText": "I operate a small home office and print about 300 pages per month, with approx 10% using various levels of colour. Before this, I used an Epson toner printer sitting next to an HP colour printer. The reason for this was to minimize the cost of constantly printing with expensive colour cartridges. The Toner unit served me well for several years, but it was just time to replace it. I committed to order the ET 2850 on behalf of two respected colleagues. Two aspects caught my attention, one of which was dual-sided printing, and the second was the cost of maintaining an ink supply. Admittedly, I was skeptical about the latter. Amazon delivered as usual (always great to deal with!), and everything exceeded my expectations! I donated the other two printers to a charity. The 2850 is robust, easy to set up, seems to have an endless supply of ink, and the print quality is better than the other two units! I found the WIFI print spooling a little slow, 10-15 seconds, so I cabled it and solved that slight lag. As a side note, it had not occurred to me that this printer now sits next to my Epson 400 scanner, my next favourite device! I highly recommend both of these Epson products! Paul",
