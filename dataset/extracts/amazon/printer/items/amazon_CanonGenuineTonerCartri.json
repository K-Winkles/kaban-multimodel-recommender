I attribute this to the fact that I only use genuine toner cartridges in it. This is after not using genuine cartridges in prior Canon and Brother printers and paying the price for that.My experience has been that the non-genuine products are far less expensive in the short term, but far more expensive long term. Using non genuine toner I ran into bleeding, fading, dust, poor print quality and ultimately filthy print trays that destroyed the printers. These were costly mistakes I will never make in the future.I\u2019ve had ZERO issues using the genuine toner. I print everything from basic product labels, to letterhead, to invoices and the colors come out crisp, clean and true.",
