It worked well and I love the aesthetic of the labels it made but it started to give me issues just a few times of using it. The label plastic started not feeding through the mechanism and the letters stopped working. I noticed that the two pieces that make up the letters has shifted and that the letter W had broken off completely. I\u2019m very disappointed in the quality of this product as it gave excellent results but was made poorly which caused it to break.",

                "reviewText": "The embossing and cutting mechanisms are a little sketchy. The letters are not perfectly spaced or perfectly indented and tape cutter is a little stubborn. But it's very easy to use and, considering the purchase price, I am more than happy with it. I've paid much, much more for label makers that spaced letters perfectly and made clean lettering and tape cuts, but they were so complex to operate and and, since I don't make labels very often, I'd usually have to refer back to the instructions every time I used it. Time consuming and frustrating. This one isn't perfect, but it's quick and easy, and no stress. Perfectly readable labels for household cleaning bottles, etc. where an immaculate label isn't a a necessity. Oh, and all the letters and numbers are available, but not all the usual symbols. Symbols included are ', \", !, #, $, /, @, -, _ , and the comma and period.",
