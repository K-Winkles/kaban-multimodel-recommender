                "reviewText": "This printer was a replacement for my old HP printer that still worked, but the ink was expensive. I wanted this printer because of the separate ink cartridges and the auto-duplex printing.I had some trouble figuring out how to print on small format paper. The smallest size it will accept is 3.5 x 5 inches. This must be fed through the tray in the back one piece at a time. I had to reformat some of my documents to fit that paper size. The HP would accept small paper as long as the document would fit on it; this one won't. The paper size of the document must match. But there's a catch: when printing small documents such as cards, don't change the paper size in the print dialogue box; change the paper size in the document only. Leave the paper size set to Letter in the printer properties box unless you are printing on Legal size or larger.Also, when printing multiple page documents through the rear tray (such as greeting cards), I would separate the document into single pages and print them one page at a time. I eventually discovered that I could print multi-page documents through the rear tray, but there's a trick: Put the first page in the rear tray, then print the entire document. When the first page comes out, wait until the printer prompts you to insert the next page. Put the next page in, then press OK. It's slow, but it's better than separating the document into single pages and printing them one at a time. Apparently, when the first page of a multi-page document is placed in the rear tray, the printer expects the rest of the pages to be in the rear tray also. I could not find this explained anywhere and only discovered it by accident.If I print #10 envelopes in the rear tray, the printing exits left edge down. But if I print smaller #6 envelopes or single cheques, the printing exits right edge down. If the orientation matters, cut practise sheets to size and try them.The auto duplexer works only for letter (A4) size paper. Letter paper must be fed sideways in the printer--even in the rear tray. The printer will not make double-sided copies from the auto scanner. You have to scan one side, then turn the pages over and restack them. However, if you scan the pages manually, it will print on both sides. It will make multiple copies from the scanner.The paper output tray is too small. If I send a job to the printer from another room and I am not in the room with the printer to catch the paper, it will often throw the paper on the floor.If you put overfill the feeder tray, it will misfeed.The printer uses some ink not printing. Occasionally it will start up by itself, sip a little ink, then shut down. This is normal, because it has to run a little ink through the print head now and then to keep it from clogging up. The print head is not normally replaced when you replace the ink. Oddly, it seems to use the magenta ink faster than the others.In spite of all the quirks, I like this printer and recommend it. it prints fast, and the print quality is very good.",

                "reviewText": "For me and my family, this printer has been fast and makes excellent color, gray-scale and black & white documents. Also, the scanner has worked well for us the two or three times that we have used it. I bought this printer because: 1) our old B/W laser printer was dying; and, 2) I needed a printer that would print on 11 x 17 (Ledger/Tabloid) size paper for Engineering Drawings. We are pleased so far! We'll see how it goes in the coming days. I will report back with an up date, after a suitable period of use. Only thing I did not like was having to pay 167% of retail price, but there was nowhere to purchase this printer, and it was highly recommended by InkOwl - an aftermarket ink and cartridge supplier.Unit is easy to use, relatively quiet, fast and easy to set up. JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!One tip... If you want to print Tabloid WITHOUT removing the Letter Size paper from the paper-tray, you MUST FIRST insert the Tabloid sheet into the MANUAL FEED SLOT. Otherwise, it will start printing on the letter size paper from the tray, and give you an error - something like \"Print Job and Paper Size are not compatible\". The good thing is that it does stop printing, so that it does not waste ink and make a mess.",

                "reviewText": "I normally have two printers because I am a business owner. My 12 years old HP D7160 printer and my 5 years old Epson WF3640 died at the same time. My first replacement was the Brother HLL2395 monochrome laser to reduce my printer cost. I liked HP printers but HP recently redesigned their printers to reject all non-HP ink cartridges so HP printers would have increased my printing cost. Disappointed with Epson because this printer started going bad after 3 years and died 2 years later. This also happened to a Canon printer. I needed a color inkjet to compliment the Brother laser black monochrome printer so I decided on this one.I am impressed with the quality and speed of this brother color all-in-one. I got a 4 year warranty because inkjets tend to clog and inkjets tend to be less reliable than laser printers that uses black toner cartridges. This color all-in-one compliments my black and white printer perfectly because I only need color 10% of the time which will reduce my overall printing cost. I really like that it only takes about 4 seconds to start printing from the moment I click print on my PC. The quality and printing speed matches my laser printer.Both brother printers are the two best printers I ever had as far as speed and quality so my only issue is long term reliability. I am still concerned about cloggimg with inkjet printers and the high cost of inkjet cartridges. However, my 4 years warranty protects me from premature clogging problems and my brother laser printer should reduce my printing cost. Buyers should be aware that ink jet cartridge replacement costs over the years can exceed the price of the original printer by a factor of 3 or even 4 so it makes more sense to me to buy two printers for high volume printing. Both printers were under $200 each so I really happy with this all-in-one color printer. I recommend this color all-in-one as long as you can deal with the inherent high cost of ink and the inherent lower reliability of inkjets due to clogging.",

                "reviewText": "I'm extremely happy with this wireless printer. It was delivered promptly, and I was able to use it pretty much out of the box. Setting it up to \"talk\" to my personal router/modem was simple, and my computer was able to print to it even before the Brother drivers were loaded. The drivers are, however, required for scanning and faxing. Printing is fast, and while not the same quality as a laser printer, is good enough for most purposes. Scanning resolution is decent--not as good as a larger, more expensive, system, or a dedicated flatbed scanner, but for my purposes it's good enough. For overall usability and ease of setup, this is a good choice for a home printer.",
