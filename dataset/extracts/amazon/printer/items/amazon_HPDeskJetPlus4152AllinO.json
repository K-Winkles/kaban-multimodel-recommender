                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with this printer so far. After my old reliable multifunction printer stopped working, I needed a new one and this seemed like an inexpensive option, even though it\u2019s a factory-renewed unit.I was worried after reading some of the reviews on Amazon, but the setup wasn\u2019t terribly difficult. The only problem I had there was with some of the questions that asked me to share more information than I was expecting with HP and deciding whether it made sense to sign up for their ink replenishment service (so far, I haven\u2019t run out of ink). The print quality seems pretty decent, considering the price. The scanner and copier functions also seem to work well enough with a Windows laptop, though I was disappointed that the software didn\u2019t seem to work with my Chromebook. It seems you need a Windows computer (or maybe a Mac). But the HP Smart app seems to work well on my Windows computers as well as an iPhone and an Android phone.It\u2019s nice to have the wireless functionality, which my old printer didn\u2019t have. The one difficulty I had during use was when my computer switched over to a different Wi-Fi network and couldn\u2019t connect to the printer. But I figured out eventually what the problem was. It would be nice if the printer had Bluetooth connections available. There is a USB port that can be used with a USB cable and that may address some of the Wi-Fi issues some reviewers have commented on.All in all, it\u2019s got plenty of features. I haven\u2019t signed up for the mobile fax service since I have nowhere to send a fax, but it\u2019s nice to know that\u2019s available for 2 years.",

But when I return I have to switch to the HP Printer through my WiFi settings. Kinda lame to have to manually switch any time I need to use the printer. Not a problem except nowhere on HP\u2019s website is that factoid made accessible to the user...so had to find help in user subs. I tried to print some coloring pages for my child today. I used the browser files and downloaded to my photo library. Tried printing and failed. Downloaded to my docs/files instead. Then tried printing from that destination, unfortunately it failed. Tried using the coloring pages that are available through the HP Smart App\u2026still failed. It presumed the size I wanted printed for the document to be 4x6 in size, but refused to print on 8.5 x 11 paper. The printer would not print unless I had the correct size of paper. I tried to find the setting options within the app and on the printer itself so I could change the printer paper size that it would be printing on. I unfortunately could not find that anywhere. I searched forums and HP Help and Support, but nothing. I guess I am too old school because I remember printers not giving a damn and just printing on paper that was in the printer. But unfortunately this printer is particular and temperamental. Your loss HP. I read the reviews and though the connection issues were fluke occurrences. But this particular printer does not like Apple products or Chrome books.",

I work hard and have only the evenings and early mornings to get papers ready for classes. I spend weekends fighting with this printer trying to print out copy sheets to then take to school to copy on their large printer. I will print out about 20-50 sheets of items that will need to be made into multiple copies for my classes. With no planning period, I have no time to waste. With this printer I have been wasting hours\u2026.not minutes, HOURS! I do not have time for a printer that will not wake up from its coma to print a single sheet of paper at 5:30 in the morning! Take this sucker back! I hate it. When it DOES print (few and far between moments) it is wonderful! But it will take us 1o-2 hours to get it to wake back up and work with our iPads! Maybe it is a PC only or Cell phone only printer. If so I missed that! I do not like buying electronics from the internet and this just helps to prove me right. 3 stars because when it does print, it does it well. I do not recommend to anyone who needs something done now.",
