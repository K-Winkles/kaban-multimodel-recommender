That's partially true, but I feel like a wired printer is more reliable than not wired. I know it's just a matter of time before wired printers will no longer be available. The setup was pretty easy, I did have to go through the steps a few times but it was only a few steps. The thing I was doing wrong was that I did not delete the old printer. Fortunately this printer used both of the same cords - power and computer connector as the old printer. The old printer was a Brother and it had a paper jam which I could not remove. So I had to get rid of it - drag.",

                "reviewText": "I've been installing printers for 30 years.... this was the most frustrating install ever.1. They REALLY want you to get the smart app from MS store. You can find an allinone driver online if you look, this is what I did.2. The printer could not be found in wifi discovery mode using a win10 virtual machine. I tried running the install/discovery over usb with my virtual machine only to end with an \"unknown error' in HPs software.3. I had to dig out a full win 10 laptop for this to find the printer at all.... It did find a printer on the network (i guess step 2 kind of worked when it prompted for wifi / pw). I had to again go through half a dozen questions about sharing info, create accounts etc...4. With the software finally complete (1hour in) I launch the HP smart app in win10 because I want to scan a document. I am prompted with a \"In order to scan, please sign in with your HP account\" .... WTF??? No, just no. I am in no way signin into HP services to use my own scanner.That's the last straw.So, I can't scan unless my internet is up and running since scanning is now an HP cloud service????Every time I launch the HP smart app, Ihave to again answer the same \" please share your diagnostic data with HP\" over and over and over.I had a Brother all in one.... that is what I should have bought again.... serves me right for going cheap.A printer should plug right in or be wifi configurable from an LCD panel. It should scan to a network location/nas/connected storage without the need of an online cloud service. It should work with a a linux 'generic laser' printer device. This P.O.S. does none of that.Do not buy this. I promise you it is frustration in a box.",

I finally contacted HP tech support and the woman walked me through a variety of things to try and make it work but to no avail. She suggested I pack it up in original box and send it back to Amazon, or she could send me a replacement. I opted to send it back to Amazon as I felt they needed to be aware of problem. I promptly arranged for the return through Amazon and just a few days later I received a new replacement. This new one seems to be working just fine so far. Very pleased with the service I received.",

I don't print often, and got tired of inkjet cartridges drying out after almost every use, so decided that a laser printer was cheaper for me in the long run. I needed an all-in-one as I actually use the copy and scan features more than I print. Set up was relatively easy, as I am using it connected via a USB cable as my desktop PC is not wireless capable and is hardwired to the router. I did need to make sure I downloaded the correct software for this direct from the HP site. My Windows 10 computer had no problem recognizing it right away. I have taken a point off as I am not yet sure of the longevity of this cheaper model. I may change this later.Edit: Adding the extra star. This little printer just works, even if I've let it sit for a long period of time. No fussing around trying to get the computer to recognize the printer again if Windows has updated.",
