                "reviewText": "TLDR: good printer, works with eero wifi mesh system, set up in less than 10 minutes - great step-by-step instructions via HP Smart app. If you need a basic printer for occasional printing that's super easy to setup, get this. I initially bought the Canon Pixma MG3620. Downloaded their app to get things setup and what a nightmare. I have an eero wifi and the PIXMA printer would not show up on initial scan. I would select scan again after clicking a series of buttons on the printers and then it would popup only to show my wireless network listed 4 times with me being left to determine which one I connected to. I assumed it didn't matter but it did given after selecting 1 and inputting the password, it wouldn't connect. I would click the series of buttons on the printer again to begin the process again only to have all the wifi networks show up (mine + other networks it found) but in a totally different order. This meant I couldn't even weed out each of my 4 networks to find which one was right. Also, the one time I did manage to get it to connect, I had to set my eero wifi in legacy mode for it to connect. As soon as I removed it from legacy mode, the printer began failing again only for me to begin attempting to get it connected again. I looked on many forums but eventually couldn't find a solution as many other people had issues as well.Why do I mention the printer above? Because I then bought THIS hp printer and simply downloaded the app, plugged in the printer, turned it on, and followed the step-by-step instructions (with animations) and it immediately found my network and connected. No duplicate entries, no hassle, it just worked. I was printing within minutes. I then tested printing on my mac, my downstairs PC, and my phone with AirPrint and it all just worked. I spent almost 2 hours on the canon printer troubleshooting and it was just a huge headache. As for print quality between the two, I couldn't tell you, but if you just need a basic occasional printer, you can't beat this for the price and simplicity. Hope this helps.",

The printer is doing exactly what I expected and will be wonderful to have. While I was unable to connect it, the HP people who tried to help me connect were great.

                "reviewText": "My journey with the HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color Inkjet-Printer has been an enlightening experience, to say the least. As someone who works from home, a reliable printer is an essential part of my day-to-day activities. While I found several noteworthy features in this model, I can\u2019t overlook some significant drawbacks that have affected my overall satisfaction. This review aims to provide a balanced account of my experiences, helping you make a well-informed decision.\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Easy Installation and User-Friendly Interface: An Idyllic StartFirst impressions are everything, and the HP DeskJet 2755e scored well in this regard. The setup was incredibly straightforward, involving a few quick steps guided by an intuitive mobile application. Within minutes, I was ready to print my first page. The printer interface is equally user-friendly, a godsend for those who might not be too tech-savvy.\ud83d\udcf1 Mobile Printing: Modern Convenience but Room for ImprovementThe mobile printing feature caught my eye, given how much I rely on cloud services and smartphone apps. While it\u2019s great to have the option to print from your mobile device, I\u2019ve found the function a bit finicky. I\u2019ve often had to restart the app to get it to recognize the printer, which has been a mild annoyance.\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Print Quality: Color Reproduction and Clarity Are On PointWhen it comes to print quality, I have to tip my hat to HP. The color reproduction is vibrant, and text comes out crisp and clear. This feature has been incredibly helpful when printing out color-coded documents or high-resolution photos. However, like any inkjet printer, it does struggle with handling bulk black-and-white text documents at times.\ud83d\udd12 HP+ Subscription: A Double-Edged SwordOne of the things I find controversial about the HP DeskJet 2755e is the HP+ subscription for Instant Ink. On the one hand, it\u2019s convenient not to have to worry about running out of ink. On the other hand, I have reservations about being tied to a subscription model to fully utilize a product I\u2019ve already purchased.\u23f3 Speed and Efficiency: Where It Lags BehindWhile many of the printer\u2019s features are above par, its speed is notably lacking, especially when compared to some other models in the same price range. A high-quality color print can take up to a minute, which is not ideal when you have multiple pages to print. This is particularly cumbersome when I\u2019m in a rush to print important documents.\ud83d\udca1 Wireless Connectivity: A Hit and Miss ScenarioWhile wireless printing is convenient, I found myself wrestling with connectivity issues more often than I would like. The printer has a tendency to lose its Wi-Fi connection, requiring a restart to resolve the problem. Given the competitive market for wireless printers, this is an area where HP could certainly improve.\ud83d\udc6a Family-Friendly Features: All Ages Can Use ItOne of the things that can\u2019t be ignored is its family-friendly appeal. With easy-to-use features, even my kids have had an easy time navigating basic functionalities like scanning and copying. This is a plus for families looking to use it for various purposes.\ud83d\udcb0 Cost-Effectiveness: Could Be BetterIn terms of cost-effectiveness, the printer is a bit of a mixed bag. The initial cost of the machine is reasonable, but the ink cartridges are on the pricier side, especially if you opt-out of the HP+ subscription. It\u2019s crucial to consider the long-term costs involved in maintaining the printer.\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Durability and Build Quality: Middle of the RoadThe build quality is robust but not exceptional. It\u2019s made mostly out of plastic, which is standard for most printers in this range but doesn\u2019t exude a premium feel. However, it has been able to withstand the daily wear and tear typical for a home office setup.\ud83e\udd14 Overall Impressions and Final ThoughtsIn summary, the HP DeskJet 2755e is a printer that does many things well but has distinct areas that need improvement. It offers excellent print quality, family-friendly features, and a convenient setup process. However, its shortcomings in speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability cannot be ignored. Therefore, I\u2019m giving it a 3-star rating.If you are looking for a basic home office printer that can handle a variety of tasks but are willing to overlook some quirks and are open to a subscription-based ink service, then the HP DeskJet 2755e could be an option worth considering. Thank you for taking the time to read this detailed review; I hope it assists you in making a more informed purchase decision.",

Connecting did take a while due to having to add an app to use this (Windows) software.I make and sell greeting cards and use my printer a lot. I also use the HP ink plan and absolutely love it. I find the quality of my copies are excellent. I print in Hi-def and am not disappointed. The standard printing is fast. If you want good resolution it does take a bit. Yes the cost is low but I've found the features are many and I've had little issues. Mine are due to not using Windows.The only thing I've found that I don't like is no border-less printing. If this one goes belly up, probably get another.",

                "reviewText": "I do a lot more scanning than I do printing, but when I need to print out my assignments, I can do so now from pretty much anywhere. I haven\u2019t tried printing while I\u2019m at school and the printers here at home but I\u2019m sure there will be a time when I need to. I don\u2019t like paying for paper at school. It\u2019s stupid, I ended up paying half the cost of the printer last time I was in school and I have at least four maybe five more years of schooling to do so this will save me money in the long run The scanner copier works phenomenally not stupid slow like I thought it might be just because it\u2019s flat top scanner but it doesn\u2019t take more than 15 to 20 seconds I am probably gonna have to upgrade to a different printer. Eventually that has a dual sided scanner. I just couldn\u2019t afford one this time. There\u2019s a budget friendly option that is under $200. I would recommend this printer to anybody and everybody. They give you six months subscription to their ink delivery service that will allow you to print out 700 pages per month if you really needed to and when they start billing you for that plan of 700 pages it would cost you 30 bucks I don\u2019t need that much paper so I went with a cheaper plan it cost me like five bucks a month for 50 pages worth of ink and when I\u2019m not using the printer for school, because I\u2019m back at work I can cancel the subscription cancel any time you want and it will finish out the month and won\u2019t bill you for the next month if you don\u2019t End up using your 50 sheets worth of ink. It will roll over to the next month gives you more printing which will allow you to do more printing the next month, which is great when it comes to end of term homework close to end term if you follow few simple requirements. You get a whole bunch of bonus features. There\u2019s nothing I can say about this printer that\u2019s bad thoroughly impressed.",

Purchased some at the store as i desperately need to print some forms and can you believe it is telling me it won\u2019t print until i connect to go instant ink....when you go to the hp app it doesn\u2019t tell me how to re establish the connection. needles to say I am feed up with this thing!needles to say i am beyond sick of this thing!",
