                "reviewText": "Must read! I bought the P12 but it wouldn\u2019t stay connected. Called customer service first time and that person was not informed and said it was defective. Amazon refunded everything. I ordered it again because I still had the extra tape and thought what are the chances, right? Well it did it again. This time I emailed the company as it was late. I am not kidding when I say I got the greatest customer service rep this time. It sounds crazy, but they were so helpful we have emailed back n forth 30xs! Only because I was so hesitant but they assured me it was the charging block! You MUST USE a 5v-2A charging plug or the stream of power will cause the unit to shut off! So they offered and sent a brand new, upgraded P12Pro which is rechargeable and does not need batteries which I wanted but didn\u2019t know the original P12 was battery operated. I bought the correct charger from Amazon and it works beautifully!!!! And I ran it so long on one charge I used the whole roll of tape! It charges very quickly too! So I had mentioned I was looking at getting colored tape when I told the service agent how thrilled I was with the product and he is sending me free colored tape rolls!!! This customer service just can\u2019t be beat and that\u2019s what matters most when I buy anything! They have been very kind, replied immediately to every email, knew exactly what the problem was and replaced the second unit I was refunded for with an upgraded model at no cost or inconvenience to me! All the while replying instantly to emails with great kindness and patience! I HIGHLY recommend this P12Pro label printer! The app is so user friendly and installed in just a minute! You must connect the device thru the app not your phones Bluetooth or it won\u2019t connect. I couldn\u2019t believe how long one fast charge lasted and my main reason for this printer was having a continuous tape so I could make a label as long as I want! Not all, actually very few have that option! You can trust this company completely! And email them directly with any questions- you\u2019ll be blown away by the knowledge and very kind customer service! I\u2019d leave 100 \ud83c\udf1freview if I could!",

                "reviewText": "I haven't had a label maker in many years. This looked like a good way to get things organized. The labels go on easy and come off easy if you want to replace them. That always used to be the drawback with these sorts of things. The Bluetooth connects easily and doesn't ask a bunch of invasive information. You don't have to log in and join a crowd and do all sorts of other drama just to get your labels made. I had mine out of the box and making labels in less than 5 minutes. I also discovered many functions this little machine does that I didn't even need but I'm enjoying. I'm ordering more color labels and I'm going to use it for other things. Definitely worth the inexpensive price and it is surprisingly sturdy for its low cost. I think I will get a lot of use out of it.",

I need things to be put away in specific spots and certain ways.After looking at several labelers I went with this one. Glad I did. The price was good and the refill ribbon was cheaper than most. (Huge impact as to why I picked this one)I love that I can multiple lines at a time. I'm able to create labels with specific details needed. I have made several labels with no problems. The edge cut crisp, the spacing at the beginning and end are even. I love this feature!!! There's a lot of cute features that I can add to the labels. Different fonts, stickers etc.It's all done on my phone, which makes it super convenient.I definitely would recommend this label maker.",

At first I was having an issue with the sample that came with the printer so I contacted the seller and they were amazing at replying and helping me out, I sent out a picture and video and they sent me an entire set of labels which was really great. The printer works perfectly and the app is very easy to use",
