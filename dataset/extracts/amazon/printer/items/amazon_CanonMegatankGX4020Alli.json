I print hundreds of copies for my work with preschool children and to illustrate the songs I teach to Primary children. This printer prints beautiful pages on multiple types of paper; super quickly and high quality. Set up was easy and any glitches with wireless printing or finding any unusual settings were quickly solved. The touch screen is small but works very well. Canon updates the software often and when I experienced a printing \"error\" message, I clicked on the link which took me to the online owners manual solving the problem easily! Filling the ink tanks was easy and is definitely more economical than replacing ink cartridges. The rear tray and output paper tray are sturdy. It also has scanner and fax capabilities! this is a wonderful all-in-one machine!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased the Canon printer to replace a Brother printer that went through ink cartridges every month. We use the Canon for personal and small business printing. I needed an all-in-one with a scanner and an ADF for larger documents. I did compare with a similar Epson printer and chose the Canon because the scanner could accommodate larger documents.Pros:1. I have not had to add ink to the machine since I purchased it. I can't believe it. I have printed 200 cards with several photos on the cards, work documents that include color maps and photos, tons of other documents, color signs and nametags for an event. I have had to do one maintenance ink nozzle cleaning. My Brother printer needed to be recalibrated after every big job and wasted sooooo much ink.2. It is efficient and fairly quick and quiet.3. Scanned documents look good.4. Two trays for paper and a rear feeder for envelopes make it unnecessary to constantly change paper settings or reload different paper.5. Print quality for black and white and color documents is excellent.Cons:1. Scanner software from Canon for the desktop is not great, kind of clunky, and seems like it's from the early 2000s.2. The tray for the finished printed documents is very small, and won't hold a big amount of paper. Larger documents end up on the floor.3. The touch screen is a bit small. I have big fingers.4. Scanner does OK. The Brother scanner was fabulous - I could scan in 50+ pages with no problem, really the only plus for that all-in-one printer. Canon scanner does the job. I don't leave the room if scanning in more than 10 pages. The quality of scanned documents is good.Overall, I love the Canon Printer. It's efficient, does good quality copies, and I'm not spending hundreds on ink cartridges.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought only Canon printers for a number of years because my experiences with other brands have been so disastrous. When my older Canon inkjet printer died, I looked for a replacement and decided on the Maxify GX7021. Both my wife and I needed a printer for business-type activities and in addition my wife is an artist and sometimes uses it to print photographs or graphics. I also scan a lot of documents and I wanted a printer with a high-quality scanner which is capable of one-pass double-sided scans.This printer installed pretty easily for me and worked with my router. I used an Ethernet cable, so I didn't need to do the WIFI setup. Once I installed the drivers, both computers on my network were able to print and scan easily. Since I had already used Canon products in the past, I was fine with the scanner driver and this scanner worked just fine with Presto! PageManager, the software I use for scanning and document management. So all good there. The printer prints quickly and I like the large paper try. Double sided printing is also easy and quick. The scanning is where I have a problem. The ADF does not like to suck in single sheets of paper. Even though I put the paper in the feeder and hear the beep, the ADF cannot seem to pull the sheet in. I have tried some rubber cleaner/conditioner and it makes the problem better, but I am not happy. I might have to get warranty service, but I am not sure if this is a design flaw or a broken printer. At my work, I have a Canon color laser printer that was actually cheaper than this printer and the scanner works flawlessly. But I guess Canon uses cheaper parts for an ink jet printer because the ADF is smaller and has this problem.If you need a top-notch scanner ADF, then I suggest you look at the Canon laser printers and don't buy this one. Disappointing.UPDATE 3 months later: After the rubber cleaner/conditioner, I have to say that the ADF problem has disappeared, so scanning is now very reliable. I am not sure if the issue will come back later, but for the moment I am very happy with this printer. If it wasn't for that, I would have given the printer 5 stars.",
