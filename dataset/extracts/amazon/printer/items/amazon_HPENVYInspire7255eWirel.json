I've seen brands and quality rise and fall.Never before have I encountered such a magnificently disappointing printer. So bad!Setup is not as simple as they wish you to believe. Plus, you can only use the printer through their proprietary app.The feature that let's you switch to less costly generic ink cartridges is no longer available. They tell you it is, but when you do it... nothing changes.So, you are trapped using the extremely expensive HP ink. Of course, it runs out so fast it's not worth buying.Our install ran about ten printed pages. All told, we didn't even print thirty pages before the ink was low and streaking / fading.If I could, I would return this disappointing flop. Unfortunately, we waited until after Christmas to install it, so we are recycling it.Rather than buy the overpriced ink cartridges, instead we just added another fifty bucks and purchased a new Lexar Color Laser Printer All in One.Don't buy this HP... it's a total headache!",

We never had any issues with the old one (till it eventually died) using it on a daily basis. This one was super easy to set up and get going. NOTE: After reading other reviews, I inserted the ink cartridges and DID NOT scan the QR code\u2026I don\u2019t want auto shipping of replacement ink, because I found with our last HPE printer that the less expensive ones work just fine. Wi-Fi set up took literally seconds. The paper tray holds a good size stack of paper, and the ink section is easy to access. The little info window tilts upwards or lays flat..tilted makes it much easier to see and use. It has a QUIET print mode, and while it\u2019s definitely quieter than regular mode it significantly slows the print process. Nice looking, clean lines, simple features. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

                "reviewText": "I bought this printer because other reviews mentioned the easy set up, and there's nothing I hate more than fiddling with technology and spending hours struggling with tech that isn't intuitive. This printer was so easy and quick to set up. I originally set it up on my phone, then added it to my laptop, then sent a link right from the app (also easy to navigate) to a family member so they can send documents to print right from their home which is in a different city! The 6 months of free ink was an easy addition right through the app (you do have to enter credit card info), and there's an option for them to notify you that the subscription will run out two weeks before you start to get charged-- I set up the printer yesterday and I already have a confirmation that ink is on the way. The only draw back is that new printers always come up with \"set up\" cartridges that don't have much ink and don't last long at all. Overall, very happy so far even though I've only started using it. I had an HP years ago and I don't remember it being this easy or intuitive, and it looks great too!",

My objective was for a basic printer to get hard copies of documents in monochrome color because haven't purchased a new printer for over 15 years. So far there are no complaints and the printer has gone past my needs. The product quality and capability has improved my opinion of Hewlett-Packard. The printer is affordable, scans film photographs for color printing and doesn't take up much space. It is easy to use, low hassle set-up with much support online. Enjoy using it to see what other functions it has.",
