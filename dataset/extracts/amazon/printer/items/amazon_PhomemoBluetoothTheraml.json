The one down fall is it requires LabelLife App, which has a tendency to freeze/shut down on Mac iOS, then requires restart of app. It is a small pain, but the printer being Bluetooth makes it worth it to me. It allows me to easily switch between my laser printer and this one. Fix the app issues and it would be Amazing!!!!!",

You could easily connect this up to a PC and have it working away tucked in a corner with minimal space taken up or packed up for taking travelling as it takes up minimal space and is quick to setup and get churning out labels and as it's a thermal printer you never need to worry about running out of ink or packing spares cartridges.Overall I find Phomemo a pretty decent brand when it comes to small scale thermal printers and id definitely recommend this model for printing off address/shipping labels.",
