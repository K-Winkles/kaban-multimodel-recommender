I set the printer to charge via USB, and used the QR code in the instructions to download the app, which was quick and easy.The app is pretty intuitive. I found it easy to use, but be aware English is not the first language of the program writer, so there are typos and some items may not be labeled as expected.The teenager immediately found all the fun cartoons and art that can be used for messages, To Do lists and more.A couple drawbacks exist. - The first couple print attempts didn't advance and I had to fiddle with it and reload the paper a time or two before it finally \"caught\" and printed normally. It's been fine ever since. - The print quality for photos or more complex art can change as it prints - You must use the app to use the printer - you will have to learn it, and import anything into the app to print.All said though, it's a lot more silly fun than I expected. Also, the teen has claimed it and takes it to high school in their backpack pocket.",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying to avoid getting named-brand printers because of the anti-consumer practices they engage in. As a result, I've mostly stuck with smaller, specialized devices for my printing needs. Something I didn't have was a small, inexpensive way to print labels, which I've always wanted to do. After a bit of research,I came across this little guy, which I think is a nifty, little device. Something I hated about most of the other printers that I saw was the interface. They all seemed to have tiny, low-res screens, and keyboards... and I much rather prefer something like this that uses an app. This is better for multiple reasons - my phone has a much bigger and better screen to work on, apps are easier to update if the developer wants to add features, no screen or keyboard on the device allows it to be smaller and lighter and less liable to break since it has fewer parts to rely on, and so on. As far as the features go, I like it a lot. Connecting the app to the printer was quick and easy to do, and I was able to print my first label within a minute or two. The app is also preloaded with lots of nice clip-art, and it even has categories that feature artwork dedicated to specific holidays. The printing kit itself comes with everything you need, and a whole lot extra. You get rolls of regular paper, sticky paper for labels, colored paper, and even colored markers if you want to add handwriting to your prints. There are a few shortcomings too. The app is sometimes not very intuitive in terms of its layout and the instructions were very clearly written by someone in which English was not their first language. I remember one particular process being a bit frustrating to deal with... in order to put custom text into my label, I had to double-tap the dragable box, but every time I did, it would interpret it as a drag-and-drop motion. So it would sometimes take between 5 and 10 attempts to get it right. Oh, there was also this weird glitch where the progress bar for a print-out would be stuck on 0% and only restarting the app would fix it. Also, the print quality, especially for photos, is not very great. I fully expected this to be the case before getting this, however. The labels look fine, and that's all I really care about. TLDR - Print quality will vary depending on what you use it for, some glitches with the app, but it's quick and easy to use and works well for what I need it for. 4/5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First off, the instructions are tiny! Once I was able to squint enough to read them I was able to download the app needed to run the printer and get everything set up. I had no problems navigating the program and both selecting a photo from my gallery and a stock photo to print. The quality of the stock photo was good, but as you might imagine it was also a very basic line drawing. The quality of the photo from my gallery was... okay-ish. You can tell what it was, but it was grainy and pixelated. I tried one where I cropped and zoomed in, which made it better, but still not great. No where near the quality displayed in the listing photos. I don't know if it is capable of that type of quality.I haven't tried to run any stickers through it, but I have a larger thermal printer for that. I plan on letting my kids use this one to print photos from their tablet.This is an instance of you get what you pay for. This isn't a horribly expensive printer so you don't get horribly detailed photos.",
