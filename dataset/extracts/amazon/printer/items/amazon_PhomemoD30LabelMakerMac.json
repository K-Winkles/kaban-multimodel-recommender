                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product and some info about QR codes and some easy help to Label Refill woes and confusion.",
                "reviewText": "This product is just great. I have been using it for several weeks now and am constantly in the app thinking up new label ideas.D30 Printer - The product itself is well made, put simply it just works as intended. The printing is fast even if you print a solid black label and DPI is the highest and same as any of the other competitors available. When printing super small there may be some issues with text and legibility. I prefer to keep things simple with 1 or 2 line of big text. At 3 lines it is 100% readable as well. When you start putting super tiny text on there the letters begin to not print as intended due to problems with DPI if I am not mistaken. Letters may not print as they are supposed look thus making it hard to read. We are talking super small at this point though and it is unreasonable to expect to get micro text out of this thing that most people would need magnification to read anyways. Icons still look pretty good even at fairly small sizes. Just buy this one, it is the best one because it has the best ecosystem, the printer is easily equal or best... don't buy it based on just looks but it looks/is decent, app which is super important is complete meaning all it's features work unlike many other printers and it has the most label refill options.The APP - The app you need to download can be downloaded and tested before you even buy. I did just that with this and other best sellers and found this app had more icons and the competing apps actually had a similar app always but lacked icons, had usability issues, and some features that did not work yet because the app was not done yet but they still promote the app features as if they worked. This app seems to me like the best app thus making this the best printer IMHO because the app is the most important part of this whole printer label thing. If you are like me you will be spending most of the time with your phone and the app not holding the printer itself obviously until you need to grab your label(s). It may seem trivial but the app is super fun because you get to create things there then ultimately print them out on labels. The app lets you save all your labels and also manage them by deleting some if you want to get rid of some. The app has two modes, a basic simple mode and a more comprehensive mode. Tbh they are both modes are fine and comprehensive mode is very easy to use and has many features to help you create with great tiny precision so I just use that by default. The comprehensive mode is very intuitive and easy to learn to use. I have been in the app a ton since I got the printer and am always creating something new or saving labels I will print or that are or will be handy or fun to use now or later. Again saving everything is huge, because if you print the same things often you can simply select it before you enter creation mode and just print it.QR Code feature in the app - Short version is it works for sure, but filling it to the 200 character limit seems unprintable no matter what. There are two small problems. 1) First, in the app if you increase the size of the of the QR code via dragging the corner it can sometimes distort the shape. This is doesn't happen every time and I would call it a bug. You want to keep it Square. I suggest two things if resizing the QR code. Copy your text to clipboard before finishing the QR code. Hit the check mark to place it. Don't move it from where it initially appears on the app, resize it in baby steps and remember there is an undo button if the QR code distorts. If trying for max size move it to the top left corner, then finish resizing it to the max. A max size QR code code does work, so does a smaller default size smaller QR code but the number of characters used may make a difference. Also alternately, instead of undo if you distort the QR code, if you have trouble just delete it and make a new one, paste the clipboard, and try again. The real problem is it seems you cannot use the full 200/200 character limit as I am about to explain. 2) Second links and info work fine in the QR code depending on error correction and size, but you can only use so many characters. I tried using the maximum and it could not be read with it set to either LOW or SUPER as the error correction level. I took a only minutes and printed a few tests and I can print 100/200 characters of text at LOW error correction but not at SUPER error correction. At SUPER, 100 characters, the corners were distorted enough where I could tell directly from the app it was unprintable because the corner blocks were too small to be printed due to DPI limitations. I am sure I can go higher than 100 on LOW for example, but I didn't want to do a super comprehensive definitive test just for my review. I suggest you guys play around with both character limit and error correction and don't distort your QR codes!Label refills - Some people and reviewers have had trouble with refills. I came across the same issue as another reviewer yet his solution was drastically different and complicated but the actual issue is trivial but an understandable mistake. The D30 Printer comes pre-loaded with a roll of labels. The labels face outward and you are supposed to put the label side facing the printer head thus it feeds through the left of the circular chamber when you use that first roll. However the refills I purchased came wound up differently so the label faced the inward. I believe this may have been a change in the way they were wound up by the manufacturer and that is all. This means that to get the labels on the printer head you need to feed them through the right side of the circular chamber instead(see my image, that is a refill roll fed through right side). That is all. To me it was obvious but I understand the confusion as the product didn't comer out of the box that way and I too initially fed the refill roll to the left and was confused. Again to recap the D30 comes with a roll with labels on the outside/up and the refills seem to be wound now with the label facing inside/down so need to be fed through the right. Just remember label has to face the printer head or it will obviously try and print on the back of the label paper that you throw away.Customer Support - Top notch 5 Star customer support that responded pretty fast. I genuinely believe they are trying hard to support their products and will continue well into the future and meet their customers expectations and are responsive to feedback and actually try to fix issues that arise.At times I am so bored but since getting the D30 printer I have been so distracted and immersed for weeks in the app creating and thinking of new labels. I have even seen some mental health benefits, my anxiety and stress I suffer from have gone down some because I am in the app so often. Who knew a simple label maker could be so fun!",

                "reviewText": "I got this nifty little gadget for my wife and daughter, who always ask me to print labels on my bigger Phomemo M220 label printer. I was happy to see they offer the D30 in different colors, and they were thrilled with the purple one.Let me tell you, this thing is small and feather-light! And the best part? It costs less than 30 bucks, so I consider it a total steal. Plus, I noticed that it prints darker blacks compared to my M220 - that's a nice bonus.Now, the labels themselves won't burn a hole in your pocket either. There's a wide variety of colors and styles to choose from, I went for the 6 pack of nebula/galaxy labels. My wife and daughter can't stop gushing over how \"super cute\" they are, and at less than 2 cents per label, it's an absolute bargain.The D30 doesn't have its own display, but you can easily check the exact battery levels on the Print Master app, also when the battery's running low, the LED on the device turns red and starts blinking.Speaking of battery life, this baby lasts a long time, just like my M220. You won't be tethered to a charger all the time, which is a big thumbs-up in my book.I couldn't find a direct driver for my Mac or PC computer, but honestly, I think this little guy was made to be a mobile label printer. It's designed to be used with your phone via bluetooth, and I'm okay with that.The Print Master app is pretty sweet, especially for newbies. It's user-friendly and comes with various templates, icons, fonts, and whatnot. But as a graphic designer, I was secretly hoping for more advanced features like grouping elements or printing white text on a black background. Unfortunately, those are a no-go.On the bright side, the app does have special icons and templates tailored for the D30, which don't appear when I use it with my M220. Also the app will only show you your saved designs for the printer that is currently connected. I appreciate the distinction, especially when I've got both printers at home. It keeps things organized.Just a heads-up, these labels are on the smaller side. So if you're in need of larger labels, you might want to opt for a bigger printer.The Phomemo D30 Label Machine is a fantastic little label printer for everyday use around the house. And the best part? It won't burn a hole in your pocket! So if you're in the market for an affordable, handy label maker, this one's definitely for you!",

I was pretty sure that this is what I wanted/needed and waited until I got some gift cards for Christmas.

You do waste a label the first in the roll but its to get things aligned.
