        "description": "You\u2019re looking for an easy-to-use Supertank printer that will get the job done. That\u2019s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2400 \u2013 an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you\u2019ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2400 features genuine Epson print quality and a high-resolution flatbed scanner \u2013 making it a convenient choice for essential, everyday home printing. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2022. | 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2022. | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect\u2122 account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel App download. Data usage fees may apply. | 8. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 30,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 30,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details.",

                "reviewText": "This printer was easy to set up and arrived with plenty of ink in the box.The ink initialization takes a bit longer than expected (~11 minutes according to the information in the setup app) and all setup steps require download of an app onto your smartphone or other device. Total setup time was about 30 minutes or so and the app takes you through everything with adequate detail to make it easy to connect to your local wifi network and get printing. The only thing that was problematic was registering the product for warranty. The epson page I was directed to failed, so I emailed their customer support. Within a short time, I did receive a link via email and was able to register the product through this link.Since purchasing the printer, I have successfully used the print, scan and copy functions. The only thing I didn't like about the scan option is that if you're scanning a multipage document, you need to continually click on the scan app on your computer to initiate the next page scan. It made it more time consuming than is necessary.The print quality is what you would expect from an inkjet printer.Overall, 4.5 stars. Half star downgrade due to the problem trying to register the product the first time. The product provides good quality at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "Epson has been my go-to brad for printing and scanning since I began using their scanners 25 years ago. This new EP-2400 is low priced and has new tank ink technology. Color printing comes out more natural, not oversaturated the way cartridge laser printers are. It scans beautifully. Minimal feeders to reduce chances of jams gives the one downside: scan one page at a time. No giant paper bins but I never needed them anyway. On the plus side is the great new liquid ink. This allowed Epson to have the print heads in the printer, not on a replacement ink cartridge. As a result, the print quality is excellent. Crisp, clear and full color. The ink replacement is easy.TIP: Read the setup instructions carefully and be patient. The first fill also charges the ink system so it takes a while. Be patient.My only setup challenge was with my network, but it self-corrected and worked beautifully. Connects with WIFi Nice!I highly recommend that your next printer be a TANK printer. You'll agree this is a solution long overdue. Well worth the wait, but it's here now.Great step forward for home printing.",

                "reviewText": "We've used EcoTank printers in the past and needed another simple printer so opted for this. After 6 months of random use, we started getting lots of paper jam alerts. In addition to the useless phone app (there is no display on this model) support, while we were looking for loose paper, we found this ribbon cable regularly falling behind a belt. The ribbon cable is also getting frayed up to the level of at least one copper line. Calling in support for assistance, we were told that the ink appeared to be non-Epson and therefore voided the Warranty and they would no longer be able to talk further with us.In the end, this printer will not reliably feed paper, we've tried using loose zip ties to hold the frayed ribbon out of the way, and some guides on manually lightly cleaning the rollers. In the end, its going to have to be scrapped and replaced with something else because its just junk at this point.AVOID THIS POORLY DESIGNED CHEAP PRINTER THAT IS FLAWED AND THE MANUFACTURER CRIES AT THE MOMENT SOMEONE CATCHES THE BAD SETUP.",

This one requires using the app on a mobile device. Now to the good stuff. This is not our first Epson printer. I\u2019ve owned from old dot matrix to inkjet. Also have another eco tank and the performance of that one influenced my decision to get one for my office. I got tired of paying through the nose for cartridges for my Cannon. This will print so many more pages before replenishing the ink. It is very good quality print. Once set up function is seamless. I can use it with my MacBook, my widows laptop, iPads, and phones. Works well using my wi-fi. Highly recommend this printer.",
