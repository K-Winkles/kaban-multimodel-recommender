I am using a cable to connect to my laptop and there is no internet instructions for the most part. Just connecting the cable and the minimal task of setup. It only will print single pages, increasing the cost of paper. but it is oh so easy to use. I bought it for a second printer since my expensive one malfunctions about half the time. Glad I did! My final cost, with rewards was about 71.00. Making me even more happy.",

While not a whole lot of printing happens at the house, it became clear that going to the local library to print things off when needed was annoying.The price of the device was fair. I found it pretty easy to set up and be able to print to, modify default settings, etc.The print quality is not the best, but I also wasn't looking for something with premium print quality. Not to say that I have found the quality to be poor, because it is not, it does a fine job.",

                "reviewText": "Just set the printer up on WiFi. I would have preferred an ethernet connected printer but didn't want to pay the $$. The \"wizard\" took a very long time finding the printer, which is just across the room from me. Once it eventually recognized the printer, everything went fairly smoothly. WiFi is only 2.4G, not 5G, which is a drag but it doesn't make printing impossible.The physical part of setting up the printer was really easy. I was disappointed to see styrofoam packing blocks for a printer that supposedly conserves ink and therefore appeals to more environmentally conscious people who don't want to spend the $$ for cartridge-less printers.I've only printed a few test pages so far. Quality is good but not outstanding. The Android app is pretty cool, though again it took a LONG time to find the printer. But really quick to print once it's set up. I was able to print a file from my Google drive in a matter of seconds (granted, I choose a small text file 'cuz it was just a test).The ink cartridges do seem on the small side, but on the other hand the replacements are reasonably priced. Unlike other reviewers, I will withhold judgement on how long the ink will last, but remember page count is based on some type of standard page with a fairly small percent coverage. If you're printing photos, maps, charts, etc., you won't get that page count. If you're printing monospace text from a text editor, you'll probably exceed the page count significantly.Low rating on tech support is based on website, I have not needed to actually contact tech support but the website is less than sterling for finding information.",

                "reviewText": "I own a small business and bought a Brother MFC J1205W for my office after seeing the excellent reviews, reputation, and supposed reliability.I bought this printer a little over a year ago, and I have only used the initial set of Color cartridges, which were supposed to last a long time but as most of you experienced did not last long at all.I need a very important document printed in color for something business-related, I won't go into details, but this form is required for me to collect a significant sum of money for the business.After spending $60 replacing all the ink, the printer REFUSES to print ANY color. Now mind you I have only used the color enough to replace the ink ONCE and it doesn't work. TERRIBLE product design.Now, I am not a novice when it comes to tech. I cleaned the Printer Heads multiple times, blew the lines, ran solutions, and all the tips and tricks that were recommended. Drivers and software updated. Multiple settings, different devices. So, after hours of that, I reached out for support.This is the reason you want to stay away from this company, I had one of the single worst experiences getting hold of customer service/support.1st attempt - Chat, waited close to 30 mins for nothing.2nd attempt - Call in and use the callback option. A person calls back from the number about 30 minutes later, they call ONE ring and hang up. Wow...3rd attempt - Call in on hold - I waited close to 2 HOURS yes 2 HOURS on hold when the company quotes 15-30 minutes.4th attempt - We are now rolling into the next day; I call in again and wait 30 minutes. No response.5th attempt - While I am on the phone, I queue up for a live support chat.Sure, buy Brothers printers if you want, you'll be on your own for service and support because you won't be able to get ahold of anyone,What is the reason for a 2-year warranty if you can't get ahold of anyone to do a return??!!!!Never again and our company is moving into a much larger office soon and we were going to significantly upgrade our printer to a business industrial printer, and after this experience with your terrible product design and service. WE WILL NOT be buying Brothers products and I will be cautioning all I know not to either. As this is beyond unacceptable.",

Nice change to your printers Brother!I don't print that much and never do any pictures so I can't tell you how they come out. I don't see any problems with the print quality, so I gave it 5 stars.",

The wireless connectivity is a pain to set up, and as it turns out, does NOT work with my eero wifi router, according to Brother themselves. This wouldn't be a problem except there isn't even an ethernet port on this thing, only USB.",
