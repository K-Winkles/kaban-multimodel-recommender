                "reviewText": "After 24 years, my Canon photocopier went belly up. Turns out you can't find a dedicated copy machine these days, only all in one printers. Okay. I already have two good HP laser printers in my home office so I thought I'd look at an inexpensive laser AIO to use primarily as a standalone copier. After a little checking around, the Brother L-2640DW seemed to fit my needs, has excellent reviews, and is at a very good price point. I didn't expect much for $200, but then again I don't need much from it other than to perform basic copying duties. Well, I am pleasantly surprised.The printer was very well packaged and is surprisingly well constructed. If you have any technical knowledge whatsoever, setup should go smoothly and quickly. It identified my WiFi network quickly and had no problem connecting (though it would have been easier if there was a keypad - even a virtual one on the screen - rather than having to scroll through the alphabet and digits to enter each character of the ssid). Software download and installation was flawless, easy, and quick. There is a software update you are prompted to install (which is done simply by highlighting the update and clicking on \"OK\"), and as has been previously mentioned that update is required for the scanning utility to work. I installed the driver s/w on several computers and all quickly identified and connected to the printer.Unpacking and physical set up took less than 15 minutes (including connecting to the network), and software another 10 -15 minutes. All in all, there's no way it should take anyone longer than 20 - 30 minutes to have the printer up and running. If you are looking for an all in one laser printer at a very reasonable price, I have no qualms recommending the L2640DW. The only drawback so far is that it does not handle legal size paper, but in my case that's not an issue since my HP MFP 281fdw does.",

                "reviewText": "I love Brother printers. They are more affordable then an HP, Toner lasts forever and just very durable and rugged. This printer is no exception. If you need just a basic Monochrome (No color) that also has a color scanner and Copier, this is the one for you.It also has Built in Wired and Wireless Networking. This printer DOES work with the Brother android and Apple apps and prints very nicely from you phone. This was a prerequisite for the client I purchased this for.The only thing I wish it had was a better way to navigate the menu system. Its using the arrow keys and the ok button. It works, just takes some getting used to.Same goes for entering the WiFi password. You have to arrow to each letter. Her password was all lowercase so that was easy but if you have symbols and uppercase that takes a little more time to enter. Another area that gave some issues, but setting up the Scan to PC funtion. I never could get it working properly. She also didnt need that function as you can do it right from the PC itself so we never spent too much time on it.Otherwise the printer is very fast and good quality printing, Durable and should last for many many years.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this machine for my home-based business. This is by far the BEST all-in-one machine I've had - and I've owned at least 10 different ones. If you are OK with the fact that it is only black and white (which I totally am), everything else about it is STELLAR. Simple to use software, no fluff, no pesky additional marketing, no drying ink, and no need to replace toner every two months. In fact, I've had this printer for 6 months so far, and there is plenty of toner left. Print quality is superb.Everything in this printer works as it should. The build is solid and reliable. I use it wirelessly, and it has been operating flawlessly with all my machines and phones. No Wi-Fi issues. In fact, printing from my iPhone is super easy. My friends and guests are nicely surprised when I tell them how easy it is to work with it. Solid 5 stars. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first laser printer and about 2200 pages in, it is shaping up to be a huge win in usage costs. I don't print a ton and certainly not dozens of pages at a time and never got close to the kind of yields promised by ink jet printers. This printer has lived up to its claimed prints per cartridge and delivered exceptional cost per page (about 2.5 cents per page for me so far). Printer delivers excellent quality text and fairly bad, but usable graphics. While the graphics are a bit of a disappointment, they are fine for the charts and line art stuff I might use for work, but not good for the pictures I used to include on my recipes. Still, removing pictures of food from my instructions for making food is a small price to pay for reliable, cheap printing \u2026 even if I really really like food (which I do)! Setup was simple and Linux support was flawless, a big plus. Large paper reservoir (much larger than any of my previous printers) is also a nice feature. The ADF is a bit of a let down, though it feeds reliably and reasonably quickly most scans end up noticeably skewed. Everything looks crisp and legible, just not straight. This can be fixed in software, but I was hoping for a more reliable feed when scanning multiple pages. ADF scanner also produces a lot of color aberration when scanning grey/black sections in color. Scanning in greyscale is fine, but that's no good if you have color on the pages that you want to preserve. Overall I'd absolutely purchase this printer again. If it lasts a couple years + I'll be a very satisfied customer.",

Just insert the utilities CD and follow the instructions. I do agree it's REALLY noisy though. You may think the printer mechanically struggles to get the sheet from the tray and route it internally for printing, but it's not. For the price, can't complain much about that. The bottom line is that the printing quality/price ratio is excellent.",
