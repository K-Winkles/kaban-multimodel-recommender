The directions were really poor, but online directions were a breeze. It is a good size and made decently. The printer is slightly louder than my other one but I like it. They only give you starter ink and want you to join a membership for ink replacement. Too much hassle for me as I like to purchase my own ink when I need it. Overall, very good for the price and we are happy.",

                "reviewText": "I had a decades old Epson printer that was just dying and so I was looking for a replacement budget printer. I work from home but I just need to print like 5 pages a week BUT I do occasionally need to print, scan, and copy more.This printer was inexpensive and had good reviews so I went with it.And it does print well straight away. I have it plugged directly into my laptop and it didn't try to make me download a program to run it which is great because my work computer probably wouldn't have allowed it and we don't have an IT person anymore so idk who would have helped me... Fortunately, I can print while connected to the computer.I did manage to connect my phone to the printer so it'll do printing via a phone app (using Bluetooth, possibly? Haven't used it more than once but it did connect pretty easily).For some reason, I can't get it to print via WiFi. As far as I can tell, you'd need to be able to set up the WiFi connection while on a computer? (Instead of entering in the WiFi information directly into the printer, like my decades old Epson printer did). I don't have a non-work Windows computer however and had no luck getting it to connect with my Chromebook. My father tried connecting wirelessly with his HP laptop and I believe was eventually able to get it to work. So perhaps eventually I'll figure it out too.Just wanted to mention it because WiFi set up may be difficult because you apparently don't work solely with the printer to get it connected to WiFi and it requires a computer from what I understand.Maybe I'm just bad with directions?Also: THE INK IS EXPENSIVE. As usual, the cheaper the printer, the more expensive the ink. I paid $25+ for the cheapest replacement Black ink I could find. Which is kind of crazy since $25 would get me multiple replacement cartridges for every single color on my old printer combined. Just something to be aware of if you do a lot of printing and go through a lot of ink.",

                "reviewText": "This printer was an unmitigated disaster. There was no easy way to install drivers. I had to go through the entire \"experience\" of the Cannon install... after downloading their installation package, each time I ran the program as I struggled to get this to work there was a pause for 16 additional files to download. SIXTEEN. But that wasn't the most frustrating thing... It just kept not being available. Printer offline. I opened the network map on my router I could see the IP address of the printer and verify the MAC address but when I printed it errored the printer was unavailable and when I tried to ping it... there was no reply. I tried opening the UI via the IP address and this is what is frustrating... ONCE I saw the UI and it let me go to the log in page before erroring and not being available. This says the printer was installed on the network with a proper IP and it was available for minutes before losing communication. I was never able to see the UI again. I would run the install program over and over and most times it would say printer not found ensure power is on... or offer me a wired installation... which totally defeats the purpose of a wireless printer... Additionally when it did work which was twice with a factory reset and reinstall that was lost as soon as it went to sleep... the printer never asked for my wifi password I don't know how it was ever on my network... but I saw the MAC an my network map? And I did successfully print one test page and one proof of insurance before it got extra buggy and would not do anything. Just give me the driver package and let me install the thing.",

                "reviewText": "My old Pixma 495 is 12 years old, malfunctioning at times, I also wanted a printer that would connect to my cell phone. I needed to smallish one to fit on a low shelf of my computer desk pull out shelf. Since it's down low, I wanted the controls on top. Also wanted a scanner. Also did not want to risk an ink spill while filling up cartridges from a tank. So the Pixma TS3520 fit those bills. Instructions were good. However, it took me two hours and multiple tries to link it to my router and my tower, windows 10 computer. I kept getting an E38 error message (cannot connect to wireless router). Press \"OK\" and start again. I had not restarted my computer after disconnecting my old Pixma. Maybe that was the issue. So finally, I restarted my computer, re-downloaded the \"START\" software from the Canon website and it worked. Of note, you have to press the link button for >3 seconds during this first linking process. But when linking subsequent computers, wirelessly, you do not press this button. (the instructions do not tell you that)Also, of note, desktop printer utility, and scanner utility icons do not appear on you desktop. You have to drag and drop them over from the startup menu.Also this printer is not in the list of printers that qualifies for the AR (Auto Renewal) ink service as best I can tell",
