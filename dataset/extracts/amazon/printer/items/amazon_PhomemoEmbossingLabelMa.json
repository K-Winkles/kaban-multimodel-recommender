                "reviewText": "I ordered this Phomemo Embossing Label Maker (in pink) to held me with organizing. So far, it\u2019s been a great help. I remember having one of these back in high school (class of 1983), but I didn\u2019t specifically remember how it worked. Clear concise direction are included as well as 10 rolls of tape (the adhesive backing is excellent). It was super easy to set up so I started with the white tape first. In my image, the tape that is clear, only showing the white lettering, is actually the \u201cwhite tape.\u201d I was concerned the embossing wouldn\u2019t show up until I removed the backing & realized that white = translucent. It does require some manual force, but once I got the hang of it, making labels became a very easy process.This is constructed out of a very tough plastic. It feels like a good quality tool and it\u2019s very easy to grip. I really like this is a one and done deal. No computer, no charging, everything needed is right at hand. I think this would be great for kids and college students. I plan to hide this when mine comes home for a visit. Or at the price point, if she really wants one, it\u2019s def affordable.",

                "reviewText": "This is so cute and the good results are also so cute! Getting a good result is super frustrating, though. Took me about 2.5 hours for unboxing and successfully creating labels for 2 bins. I will plan on 30 min per label in the future. Ick.The adhesive seems pretty good, but I was still able to pull it off of plastic to reposition right away.The directions are good and give helpful troubleshooting tips, which is good because I had to do at least one tip between each label.Getting the ribbon tape to feed in the first place is super awkward. I had to push the ribbon into the slot while squeezing the handle multiple times to catch it up in the feeder.The automatic cutter only worked properly twice. It seems like it's supposed to cut jut the ribbon part so it flakes away easily, but everything comes out of the mechanism. (The \"DISNET\" label in my picture shows the correct cut.) It didn't cut at all sometimes, but more often it cut the tape AND the backing so I had to peel them away from each other with a fingernail. Then I have to fish the tiny slice out of the mechanism. I tried unscrewing/disassembling the whole machine at one point, but it really doesn't come apart. The best I could do was pry the character wheel apart by like 3mm and try to scrape the stuck pieces out. Not very successful.The character wheel has two halves like a sandwich and each can rotate independently of the other. This does help a little with cleaning, but also lets the symbol get out of alignment with what is actually being stamped. Check they're aligned before every label, as it happened to me accidentally once.The wheel clicks into place on each character, but that is not necessarily \"centered\" on the given character. I got better results holding the wheel in slight tension so the character is dead center in the \"sites\" of the feeder. (Pic of the V in its natural spot is way off center.)Pull the handle firmly, but don't wiggle it side to side at all, as it makes an inferior print. It'll be rough on your grip strength after a while. Oh and each print makes a LOUD clack sound.As the ribbon feeds through, you can only see the second to last character you printed, so don't stop in the middle of a label and keep careful track of which letter is next.The color difference between gold and champagne gold is quite subtle, pic included.I will probably use this again, but I would rather have one that doesn't need so much coddling, even if it cost a little more.",

The embossing gives it a nice retro look.",

I double checked and for whatever reason some letters have larger gaps between them. Overall it looks sloppy. I'll use it for my workshop.",
