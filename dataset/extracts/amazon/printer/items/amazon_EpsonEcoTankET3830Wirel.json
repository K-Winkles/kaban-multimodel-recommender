        "description": "Your busy home needs a printer that\u2019s fast, affordable, easy to use, and has premium features. That\u2019s why we developed the EcoTank ET-3830 \u2013 an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you\u2019ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-3830 features fast printing with outstanding print quality, productive paper handling, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and a large color display \u2013 making it the perfect printer for productive families. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of October 2020. 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of October 2020. 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. 5. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel App download. Data usage fees may apply. 8. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 50,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 50,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), you must register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details. 9. SmartWay is an innovative partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that reduces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and improves fuel efficiency.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An Impressive Printer",
                "reviewText": "Very impressed with this little printer. Has been about 10 years since I purchased an ink jet printer - previous units I owned were great for the first couple times use them but after that the ink cartridges would dry out and was simply a pain to use and cost $150 to buy new cartridges. This little Epson am impressed with the 'Best Quality' settings. The 'Normal' setting I don't really use for daily printing, I have an ancient LaserJet for that. Love the eco tank feature -- to be able to fill up the entire printer for $40, what??Couple of observations to keep in mind: First, when you load up the ink for the first time it uses about 1/4 of level in the tank...was surprised it loaded up that much into the print heads. Second, I use a Mac and I recommend spending a couple dollars to by yourself a true Printer >> USB cable. You can plug and print this unit without doing so but the software install was just the most basic of print drivers / utility. When connected via Printer >> USB was able to instal the entire Epson controls. --This has happened when installed printers in the past...could be me or my Mac set-up but is bit frustrating is not exactly plug and play for the full suite of the software. Once have the correct driver / utility installed can switch to Wi-Fi or LAN connection and don't need to use the USB cable.I bought this unit because of the LAN capability. I print high-res photos which are huge files so wanted the fastest connection. And, speaking of printing photos....I just printed 3 photographs using Epson's Ultra Premium Glossy paper and Oh My Word, this is the closest thing I have seen to a lab print coming off a small ink-jet printer in a long time. No joke. Do not be afraid of using the high gloss paper -- the gloss coating allows the ink to sit on top of the coating and not soak into the paper, so, your whites are whiter and overall range is improved. You probably frame the print under glass so the gloss will get dulled down anyways.As far as non-photo printing...I ran 300 black image only (no color ink) letters on my preprinted letterhead. Fantastic quality -- I used the 'Better' quality setting so it took about 3 hours to print 300 single sided sheets, but, the results were much nicer than using 'Normal' setting. The edges of the type were crisp, the black ink was a bit more black. The time to print is no biggie for me, just set it and let it run. Also, I printed a set of 250 business cards on a matte uncoated card stock. Again used the 'Best' setting, print time was slow but quality was on point. My BC's are 2-sided. I did NOT use the auto duplex feature, I simply printed the fronts then the backs because the fronts are black ink only and then I use a bit of color on the backer design. Why I bring this up---I set the 8.5 x 11\" sheet to print 12-up business cards. When cutting the cards down, this little printer was accurate within about 1/8\" at the worst, had a little bit of play but dahang, that is pretty tight for a little printer like this.For the price this is a great little printer.My biggest question is what will happen when I don't use it for a week, two weeks, right? Will the ink dry up? Will it get crusty? Am guessing Epson has finally worked some those issues out but will see. Yes, I recommend this printer. If do not want the LAN connection there is a version (I forget the number) of this which is maybe $50 less cost??Take a look at the photos I posted -- these photos of this guitar are roughly 8.5\" wide x 6\" tall on 8.5 x 11 paper. I think they look great!!",

Scanning within an older graphics program give \u201cmemory not enough\u201d.+ Poor software coordination between Windows print option settings and printer settings (changed Windows options require printer interaction)+ Draft print quality far too lightI bought this printer at this time because of availability, supply chain \u201cnot in stock\u201d for other models. Would I buy it again? Probably, I am coping with the cons. BUT, I would spent the extra 20 to get the document feederPrinter vendors get their profits by selling replacement cartridges or selling printers with refillable tanks. Goodbye to the rip off of replacement cartridges. (Today\u2019s price for my old inkjet cartridge of black / color of less than 700 pages- over 108 dollars, outrageous! Off brand cartridge replacements are not always of reliable quality or may not work at all because printer vendors lock them out).I choose Epson because of their reliability reputation. HP was taken off my list because of their intrusive software, cartridge expense, and my poor experience with their printers paper feeders on many models.",

I crochet and cross stitch and am always printing patterns. So I use a lot of ink. I just cannot afford the HP ink anymore. I researched forever before getting this printer. I had friends who told me the ink would dry up if I did not use it often, and other scary things. But so far I love the thing. The things I print are lots of color. Crochet patterns show you step by step and black and white just does not work for that. So sometimes one pattern will have pages and pages of color pictures. This thing is really easy on the ink. I have printed lots and lots in the 3 months I have had it and it still has plenty of ink. It hold about 250 pages of blank paper so I don't have to reload constantly (last pattern was 185 pages long). And the ink seems to go a long way and is reasonably priced. This printer is also fast. I am glad they produced a printer that I can afford the ink even though I miss my HP. But I do love this one. I do not have to feel guilty every time I print a pattern.",
