                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the MUNBYN Bluetooth Thermal Shipping Label Printer for my small business, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways. As a new business owner, I was looking for a printer that would be easy to set up, reliable, versatile, and reasonably priced. The Munbyn printer has delivered on all fronts.Before purchasing the Munbyn printer, I compared it with the popular Rollo printer, weighing the pros and cons of each. Ultimately, I decided to go with Munbyn, and I'm extremely satisfied with my choice. Not only is this printer aesthetically pleasing, but it is also compact enough to fit perfectly in my limited workspace. Despite its small size, it packs a punch when it comes to performance. The print quality is exceptional, and the printer's speed is impressive. Moreover, as a bit of a tech enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised by the seamless setup process. Unlike some other reviewers, I encountered no issues during the setup. The instructions provided were clear and concise, and within minutes, I had the printer up and running smoothly. It was a relief to start using it without any frustrating technical difficulties. Additionally, one of the factors that influenced my decision to choose this printer was its reasonable price. It was not outrageously expensive, making it a cost-effective option for a small business owner like myself.During my initial testing phase, I did experience a few partially printed sheets. However, I quickly discovered that a minor readjustment of the labels inside the printer was all it took to resolve the issue. Since then, I haven't encountered any further problems, and the printer has consistently produced high-quality prints.One of the standout features of this printer is its Bluetooth connectivity. Setting up the Bluetooth connection with my phone was a breeze, and it eliminated the need for multiple wires connected to a computer. Being able to print directly from my phone has been incredibly convenient and has saved me a significant amount of time. The wireless functionality of this printer is a game-changer for me as a small business owner.To put the Munbyn printer to the test, I decided to print some custom T-Shirt Care labels for a recent order I received. The results were fantastic. The labels came out crisp, clear, and professional-looking. It gave my products a polished touch, which I believe will leave a positive impression on my customers.In conclusion, I highly recommend the MUNBYN Bluetooth Thermal Shipping Label Printer to fellow small business owners. Its easy setup process, reliable performance, compact design, and reasonable price make it an ideal choice for those starting out. The Bluetooth connectivity adds a level of convenience that traditional wired printers can't match. With this printer, you can expect excellent print quality and a hassle-free experience. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ll keep the review fairly short and simple. Build quality is good, mostly plastic but feels sturdy. Instructions somewhat vague, but once you connect it to the app it\u2019s pretty simple to get it up and running. It prints fairly good quality and VERY fast (impressively so). It is a bit on the louder side, but I mean it\u2019s a printer, you can\u2019t expect it to be quiet. It takes a good variety of sticker types, however keep in mind to adjust the little plastic guide rails inside based on which sticker size you\u2019re using (I couldn\u2019t figure out at first why my prints were crooked)App could use some work to make it a little better optimized for cellphones(dials and buttons are small) otherwise it works fine. Overall solid little printer, good bang for the buck4.5/5 stars",

                "reviewText": "I had bought a different thermal printer previously and it was a PAIN to use, but this one is PERFECT! I love that I can print from my phone or iPad via Bluetooth. Or straight from my computer.I think my favorite part about this is I don\u2019t need an app on my computer (just the driver download) and I can print like a normal printer. Others it would make me download an app and have to upload each sticker it was annoying. I can just print shipping labels normal without some stupid app.You do need an app for your other devices but it\u2019s super easy and I use my iPad for mostly stickers so it\u2019s really easy!!Their brand stickers are WONDERFUL too. Great quality!",

                "reviewText": "I love this printer for printing labels on eBay. I tried to make 2x3 labels with a message about returns for our customers, but was not able to do so because 2x3 labels wasn\u2019t a size selection available in the print screen. But I can say this printer prints shipping labels like a beast and is superior to my brother thermal printer in every way: loading new labels is a breeze, no jams, never prints a blank label along with a printed label, and prints immediately. I used their brand of labels and they have the best adhesion. In the past, I had labels on boxes where the edges would curl up if left sitting indoors overnight. But their brand of labels stay put. The printer prints clearly and there are never any smudgy looking labels. It\u2019s such a great machine. I\u2019ve had it since the summer and it makes the shipping process easier and even more enjoyable. As for the return label memo, I may try a 2x2 size in the future, which is one of their print options (along with many other size options). I did call their company about it and they called me within minutes and were very nice. They couldn\u2019t add the 2x3 to the printer options, but were willing to send me a new roll of 2x2 or 3x3 to make up for the money I spent on a 2x3 that is unusable. Great customer service!",

                "reviewText": "My assumption is these little thermal printers are largely the same.This one is totally fine.I wanted to print a lot of labels and this has exceeded my expectations so far.I've only used it Bluetooth to my phone, it didn't seem to want to be detected by my tablet.the app isn't bad. you get i think 1 ad when you load it up, usually for the brand of labels. it looks like you need an account to be able to save anything, even locally, which is lame. good thing everything so far has been a simple to re-create template.I have not yet tried to print shipping labels with this. i assume if i can get the image loaded into the app i can print it but i'll find out when i need to.connecting it via (included) usb cable might be the way to go to do a lot of labels or text entry but i have no tried it yet. it looks like you need to use a chrome add-on to do it. maybe if its detected as a printer you can just send stuff to it.",
