                "reviewText": "I was downsizing my printers as this printer was replacing a HP Color JetLeaser printer that was about 8 years old. I needed a printer with a good scanner and decent printing function. The FAX function does not matter as I use an online service for Faxing when needed. I have a 5-year-old Brother\u2019s leaser mono printer that is very good which help me to decide on the MFC-J4335DW. Another positive point is the ink cartridges will last and the replacement cost is low. I didn\u2019t want to be changing cartridges every few weeks, the MFC-J4335DW stated that there was a years\u2019 worth of ink included. The black text is very good. The scanner is as good as my HP was. The set up was simple and connected with my wireless network flawlessly. The two issues I have with the printer are the printer needs to be turned on each time a print job is sent. The other issue is the color prints quality are fair. I don\u2019t mind the on/off issue as I may print something every couple of days, most of time these days my documents are PDFs attached to an email. The color prints are an issue, which reduced the star rating. Printhead lines can be seen on the paper; matt or glossy paper. The finish prints are fair as the colors do not pop out! As I don\u2019t print much color but when I do, I would like a decent image. I do have a high-end photographic printer, this issue is not that important.",

                "reviewText": "I waited for a month or two before I reviewed this.Scans:I use scans for work and need a scanner that can easily handle multiple pages. This scans a lot of pages- which is great. I used the feeder (and I also downloaded the software from the website). I use the program to scan. It is fabulous. I scanned a 25 page document easily and saved as a pdf to my computer. This is a huge plus because many scanners don't work well with multiple pages. The output was clear and it scanned it quickly. I do have to own up to my first scan being blank as I had the pages turned the wrong way for the feeder (it scanned the backs). Maybe I was in a rush, or I read it wrong-but it took me a second try to figure that out... so if you are using the document feeder make sure you scan the documents with the pages faced in the right direction.I have an older brother at work. You can scan it directly from the printer to the laptop because it is connected via a printer cable. I didn't set that up here, so I had to use the program to do it wirelessly which was very simple (after I did it a first time- see above). It was so easy that I decided to forgo the expense of the printer cable and just use the laptop to originate the scans wirelessly.Copy:This take copies from the glass and from the document feeder. It holds a lot of pages and it copies them quickly and clearly. I was very happy with the ADF because I copy larger documents and this poses problems for many personal printers. The glass was also very easy to copy from and it is clearly marked for orientation. My former computer was a pain because it was not very clear and I had to remember to place it against the right vs. the left.Print:Love this printer, it is fast and clear. The colors are deep and the printer easily and automatically prints (wirelessly) out my papers. I usually print out documents about 20 pages so this handled that well. I didn't have to wait a long time and my ink is still at full.....Overall I am very happy with this printer. My other printer would always give me issues when I needed to print in terms of connectivity and it would take several attempts and a lot of aggravation to print a something. This printer is a blessing in that area. It automatically connects to my computer, even after I haven't used it for a week, and prints it out quietly, quickly and clearly. It is smaller than my previous printer and it is quiet.I recommend you download the software but it is a big file(s) so it takes up memory (as a programmer I watch that load of the programs). I use the program for wireless scanning, but if you are not a big scanner than you could probably avoid it.I recommend this printer. I think it has a lot of functionality for the price-most of which I do not use-- but more importantly it works as it is supposed to - when it is supposed to. That is a big change from my former Cannon- which did what it wanted, when it wanted and took forever.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars ADF is a step up for this price range",
                "reviewText": "Note: This review is mainly addressing users who need reliable ADF scanning.FIRST IMPRESSION AFTER 2 DAYS OF USEBackground:I originally owned an older Canon Pixma MX870 and was overall pleased with its different functions, but especially appreciated its ADF since I do a lot of document scanning, yet could not justify a dedicated document scanner. It had its share of paper jams and mishaps, but nothing too bad for that price range. I had to retire the MX870 because it was no longer being supported and the feeder was getting old and had trouble gripping paper...but I was able to get many years of use out of it.The first printer that I tried was the HP 9018e. This printer was the most \"svelt\", with slick design and really easy setup. ADF performance was mediocre and experienced unusually high paper mishaps (jams, grabbing more than 1 sheet, and slower than the MX870). A printer specialist recommended that I try Canon mainly because of the ink refill setup.The second printer was the Canon TR8620a was the supposed successor to the older Pixma in its class. I am under the impression that the Canon had the best print quality for making photos, but photo quality was not my top criteria as document scanning. The scanning speed was much slower than the older MX870 and I did experience numerous issues when scanning in color such as paper jams, grabbing more than one sheet at a time, paper misaligning as it feeds, grabbing a second sheet before the earlier sheet finishes its scan, and reporting a paper jam when there was no paper in the feeder. These problems seemed to diminish when scanning in black and white.The first impression of Brother MFC-J4335DW:Overall, this printer has the best ADF of the three tried. When I loaded some documents for scanning, I immediately felt like the ADF grabbed the paper with more confidence...almost as if the feeder mechanism was stronger. The color scanning speed seemed similar to the older Pixma, and even faster when scanning in black and white. No misalignment or paper jams in 2 days of testing so far.Also, I read a review that some users thought Brother's software and user interface is confusing, but I did not experience any of that with this model. There is no touch-screen like the HP or Canon, but this was not a big deal for me and I felt the interface was intuitive and easy for me to use. The printed documentation did not mention the password to allow for things like firmware update, but I was able to google it and find the solution. (The password is on the back of the printer...and it is recommended that you change the password if it is connected to your main network to block a potential hack point.)Ink economy is yet to be determined, but I do appreciate that the ink tanks do not drain everytime the printer is turned on (like some other printers as they clean their nozzles)...this gives me a level of confidence to turn off the printer if it is not getting a lot of use.1/31/2023 update:About a week in after regular use of the ADF. I am concluding that this is one of the best ADFs out of all the printers in the sub-$200 all-in-one class. Almost no paper jams, misfeeds, or misalignments. The speed is the best I have seen, especially at 300dpi black and white scanning. One minor disappointment may be in how the scanned paper stacks up on top of the paper that is loading in: for the most part, if you are not exceeding the page limit in the load, it is fine assuming you remember to flip the paper catcher latch up. But for legal-sized paper, the paper catcher will not catch and you might deal with scanned paper spilling over the edge. When trying to grab scanned paper, there is the potential for the user to mistakingly grab the paper that has yet to be scanned.It is hard to describe in writing, but the mechanical sound of the Brother ADF seems more \"professional\" than the HPs and Canons in this class...but this is something you would have to hear for yourself.",
