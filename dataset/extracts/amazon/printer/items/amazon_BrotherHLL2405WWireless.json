                "reviewText": "I made the leap from inkjet to laser with this purchase. This is my first laser printer and I can't for the life of me figure out why I didn't switch sooner. I asked my friends on social media what a good inexpensive printer would be for someone like me who doesn't print much. That's when a friend said if I don't print much I should get a laser printer instead because it's powder instead of liquid ink. I somehow made it halfway through life without ever knowing that! Then I read about how much longer the ink lasts vs inkjet cartridges AND how much more environmentally friendly they are, and I was sold.I was happy to find this Brother for a very reasonable price. My last two printers were Brother and I was always very happy with them, so I was partial to this brand already. I decided to save some much-needed cash and get this monochrome model because I realized that 98% of what I print is black & white text documents anyway. And it's that much less to buy for refills.It's actually a pretty small size for a laser printer compared to some models. The footprint is actually slightly smaller than my inkjet printer and only slightly taller. I like the clean, square shape. The unboxing and physical setup went very smoothly, just pop in the included starter ink and it's ready to go. BUT, I did run into trouble with the wifi setup: It wouldn't detect/connect to my wifi no matter what I tried. I tried several things and was just getting frustrated when I remembered seeing that someone posted their own instructions in a review that I read. So I went back and found the review and Voila! It was connected and ready in 5 minutes. So I STRONGLY recommend ignoring the installation instructions and ignoring the CD and look for a review here by \"Jennifer\" who posted a photo of typed step-by-step instructions that pull up the menu and let you prompt the unit to scan for your wifi router, then enter your password and boom: done. I did see one reviewer complain that they had to enter their password the old-school way by cycling through the letters of the alphabet. That is true, but who cares? Not me! Not for this price. Sure, you can get a better menu with more buttons if you spend more, but I am more than happy with this simple model.The print quality is excellent! SO much better than inkjet, I had no idea what I was missing. It just zips out a printout in like one second, it's amazing. No loud racket of it printing, it's nice and quiet, the thing is a dream by my standards at least. I will say it's a little slower to RECEIVE the printing command (from my PC to the point to when it lights up to print) but to be honest, I think that's my wifi and the position of the printer. My old printer was connected to my PC by a cable, and this new one is wireless and I also have it in a different room from the wifi router unlike the old printer, so I don't even think it's an issue with this model, just the result of it being wireless and in a different room from the router.I'm so happy with this printer, especially at this price point. I don't miss color at all. It's so quiet and prints such nice fine lines. I wish I realized the difference between inkjet and laser sooner because I should have done this long ago.",

                "reviewText": "We bought the printer to replace an inkjet because the Brother printer is such an inexpensive alternative for black and white printing. Almost all our printing is b&w. We just bought the 2305. Early impressions are all positive. Various fonts in various sizes are perfectly sharp even with the resolution lowered from 600 dpi to 300. The first page takes a little time but subsequent pages come fast. Being able to load a full ream of paper is convenient and toner cartridges do thousands of pages. Duplex printing is not available but turning the page over and printing the second side is simple when duplex for one page is needed. As reported by others, setup can be a Sunday afternoon activity. I bought a printer cable as a reviewer suggested \u2013 a good idea. Set up is harder because the few control buttons on the printer have meaningless labels. The tiny LCD screen shows only a word or two. I confess two obvious errors that may save others time. Once the drivers are installed from the CD, disconnect the USB cable before any other steps. If your computer has previously been directly connected to a printer, check Settings to be sure WiFi is on. I subtracted a star because adequate instructions would make setup simple matter.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Brother HLL2305W monochrome laser printer and am pleased with its performance and overall value.The printing speed is adequate, at 24 pages per minute, and delivers sharp and clear prints.The wireless connectivity feature connects easily to my Wi-Fi network, allowing me to print seamlessly from my laptop, smartphone, or tablet. It's incredibly convenient and adds flexibility to my workflow.The HLL2305W is compact and lightweight and doesn't take up much space, making it a perfect fit for my home office setup, but it's a touch on the loud side when printing. Despite its small size, it has a more-than-adequate 250-sheet capacity, so I don't have to refill the paper tray constantly.Setting up the printer was straightforward, but I had to go to Brother's website to download print drivers, which seems like such an outdated thing to do today. Fortunately, even with minimal technical expertise, I could get the HLL2305W up and running without hassle.In summary, the Brother HLL2305W is a fantastic monochrome laser printer that offers outstanding performance, convenience, and value for money. I highly recommend it to anyone needing a reliable and efficient home or small office-use printer.",

Once I got it connected it seemed to work alright and even did a print test from the cell phone OK. Next day, nothing worked and when attempting to get it connected via WiFi it would connect then lose it and the process started all over. It wouldn't stay connected. So, I'm returning it but thinking of getting the same again cause otherwise I liked it. Print quality seemed very good with the little I saw, and the footprint is, relatively speaking, small with the output on top and not sticking out. Defective? Think so.",
