So I had to reinstall the old cartridges, and replace each one individually to see which of the cartridges in the 5 pack was defective. Turns out it was only the Cyan color that was defective. The other colors were full and now I have to order a new cyan cartridge. It would be too much of a bother to call Amazon and ask them to send me a new cyan cartridge, so I will just go and purchase one. These things happen, and I can't blame the seller as it was a sealed box.",
