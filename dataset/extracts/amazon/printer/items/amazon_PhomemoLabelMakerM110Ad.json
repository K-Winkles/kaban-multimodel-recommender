                "reviewText": "This little guy is so cute, and it works really well. It took just a few minutes to set it up including downloading the app. It takes some tweaking to get the labels how you want them to look, but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to format any label for any use.The app comes preloaded with several templates in different categories, plus you can design and save your own templates. You can increase or decrease the size of the font for printing, plus there are several fonts you can download. You can also add text effects such as rounded printing. You have to be careful which fonts you use for whatever you want to print, because some of them are so light they're barely readable, especially at smaller sizes.All functions are controlled through the app, including printing, and you can choose how many copies of a label you want to print at once. This comes in handy for me, as I use this label maker primarily for labeling foods for my freezer. I can just put in how many copies I want to print once I have the label like I want it (for homemade TV dinners, for example) and press print. In a few seconds it's printed say, 8, labels for a spaghetti TV dinner that I've made 8 portions of. I put a label onto each container, then into the freezer they go. I always include reheating instructions to make it easier for me to just pop the meal into the microwave.You can go to the company website and buy replacement label rolls that specifically fit this model, which is M110. There's a Mall section in the app that takes you to the website through your phone's browser, and it warns you before you go to the browser. All in all, one of the most useful purchases I've made.",

Wish they had a regular manual like in the old day, a pdf file with all the information in one spot, as the app is a bit clunky.The printing is fine... the machine \"eats\" parts of the first label every time I print a batch. Now it just started \"printing\" a bunch of empty labels after the first label in a batch (and even when I print a single label). It's frustrating to use, to be honest.Hope people have better luck with theirs, mine isn't working great.",

You can have various sticker sizes but absolutely love the quality of the stickers too. Would\u2019ve loved some colour but I guess colour could be sorted by using coloured label paper too. Would highly recommend! Was much cheaper than purchasing stickers.",
