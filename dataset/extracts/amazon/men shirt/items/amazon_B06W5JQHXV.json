A much better upgrade from the ratty old tee shirts I've worn most of my life, classing up my wardrobe. I plan to get one of each color.I'm not big on hanging clothes \"properly\", and heck, I don't even fold things mostly, but these shirts shake out well and don't show wrinkles at all.The fabric has a nice texture to it and is soft to the touch. It also breathes well and keeps me cool.The size is spot on and fits me and my belly as well as can be expected. Very comfy.",

The material is not quite as thick as I had hoped, but better then many of the ultra thin 100% polyester stick-to-your-skin materials out there. But the medium weight (as advertised) material (50% cotton, 50% polyester) should work well during the summer. Just wish the material was a bit thicker, but other than that, no real issue. Pleased with my purchase ... and oh ... very good price at $9.98 (some of the color selections were twice as much but not the ones i picked: Black, Navy, Royal Blue and Grey).",

The white was not see-through, even with the flash test for pictures. Texture is nice thick quality. Features some buttons which are nice depending on if you like it fully buttoned or not. They both stated without wash they were a little bit. We washed them and it shrank some but not alot which was perfect.PROS: Nice thick white. Works perfect for pictures. Not see-through. Great for the price especially being a 2 pack set.CONS: Runs a little big",
