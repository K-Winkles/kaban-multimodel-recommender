He has somewhat of a tummy - he's 6' and it is sometimes hard to find the right size - either they are too short or too tight around the stomach. Carhartt is known for their quality clothing and they continue to stay true to their standards. He won't wear t-shirts made by any other manufacturer. I got him several, in different colors, including White. I'm not going to review each one of them, but they all have the same qualities and desirability factors for that well-fitting t-shirt. He also wears them under his long sleeved shirts. Size 1XL.",

I have a closet full of old t-shirts I don't really like and wanted to add some all-purpose shirts I can do outdoor work in, so gave one of these a try. It was just right - good fit, side vents help make it breathable despite being thick/strong material. And also liked having a bunch of new color choices.So... I ended up buying several in a variety of colors. No gripes, I still love these.Not sure if I would pick these as my #1 favorite t-shirt, but they're definitely tied for it. Old favorite was 50/50 cotton/poly t-shirts, but these seem to be a little more \"adult\" than all my t-shirts with graphics on them... so now that I'm older, guessing these will get a lot more use.",

                "reviewText": "I have a lighter version of this shirt and wanted a second one but it was discontinued or at least unavailable. So I went with this midweight model. At first I thought it was too heavy, but after wearing it a few times, I like the weight of the fabric. It's heavier but not too heavy that it's uncomfortable to tuck in. I buy my shirts a little big, as I did here, and it fits exactly like I expected.I have a few Carhartt hoodies, shirts and shorts and they are always good quality. You might pay a little more, but it's worth it in the end. Plus, they are made in the US which means a lot to me personally. With the fall weather approaching I plan to buy a second one of a different color.You can't go wrong with Carhartt IMO !!",
