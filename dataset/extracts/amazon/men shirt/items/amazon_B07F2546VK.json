This shirt is again perfect.It feels like they used quality material - not light.I should remind you that it is 100% cotton. I'd prefer just a tiny amount of polyester added to limit wrinkles and fading. After first wash it was a little more wrinkled than I like but acceptable. We'll have to wait and see how it holds up in terms of fading color.",

They're not baggy and look perfect when tucked in with his belt. Sleeves are a great length as well with a little bit of room for shrinkage and his growth. They wash well and don't wrinkle as much as his previous name brand dress shirts when hung up right out of the dryer. Highly recommend and will purchase the next size up next school year.",
