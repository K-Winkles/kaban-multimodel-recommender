I bought an \"XL Tall\" and it is long, so unless you have a really long torso you won't need the \"Tall\" size, just go standard. With the sturdiness of the shirt it's going to take some wearing/washing to get it to soften up, but I'm confident it will. I use the shirt to work outside in the winter and it hasn't let me down, great flannel, great design and well made.",
