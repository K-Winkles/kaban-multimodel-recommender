                "reviewText": "Great casual dress shirt when you don't want to 'really' dress up. You can easily wear a jacket with it, although the collar is maybe a little too small to add a tie. Material is smooth and light weight, but not that silky smooth performance type that carries a shine. Although all synthetic, unless you look closely it could appear to be a natural blend. And of course, you still get the benefit of the synthetic when it comes to wrinkles and care. Like many clothes from China, it comes vacuum packed, so the wrinkle free material will have wrinkles when you free it from its bag. While I have not washed this yet, I have seen it enough times to know they will come out. I'm not one for ironing, which is why I like synthetic materials in the first place.I normally wear an XL, and depending on the cut, it sometimes will be a little tight. This XXL fits pretty comfortably, with just a hint of looseness.Sometimes you just need a solid color casual dress shirt fort the office, that you can wear just as well after work too. This fits that goal nicely, and at a pretty decent price.",

                "reviewText": "This is the 3rd review I have made of Coofandy. last time it dissapeared. the first time I messed up the size. so I tried again. Why? because Ilike the tiny shirt I got before. Now I have one I fit in. and thats huge.These are pretty good shirts that dont cost an arm and leg.They do tend too be SMALL. But, the materials are actually a pretty nice choice with a tiny bit of texture and shine too them.I normally avoid bright colors, but with a synthetic fabric like these I can keep them clean (I'm not great at Laundry I dry clean)The stiching seems adaquat for the price. Yes more would be better but I expect they will last as you would expect. I did'nt find any lose ends or play. They even give us spare buttons. Not that I have any clue how to do that.Wearing it there is a nice amount of flex in it and It looks pretty decent. It breaths like most other Synthetics as in not allot but wear it open and its not an issue. being of light color pallet they will prob be good for sunny places or beachs, I think Synthetics are the only way to go if you are getting wet. I refuse too deal with cotten around water.So do I like these ? Yes. I would buy one for myself.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 200 lbs and 6 feet tall. I wear either a Large or XL. This is my second COOFANDY shirt. The first one I ordered (different style) was an XL and the pocket was ridiculously low - I mean it was just an inch or two from touching the belt. So, this time I ordered a Large in Deep Blue - which I\u2019m happy to say fits nicely. And - most importantly - the pocket is in the right place. It looks nice as well.PROS: - Fits nicely - Not a bad price - Fairly breathable - Doesn\u2019t need ironing - Has a little stretch to it - Nice casual summer shirt - Looks decent tucked or untucked - (2) Extra buttons (small and large) providedCONS: - The collar is a bit small for my liking\u2026but it\u2019s okay - The neck won\u2019t button but I have a bigger-than-average neck - I appreciate the (2) spare buttons but I prefer that they are sewn on the inside of the tail instead of in a baggie which will surely get lost. - The model in the listing is 198 lbs, 6\u20191\u201d with 33 inch waist and they recommend a Medium. I don\u2019t think so. I would go with a Large. I\u2019m about that same size and any smaller than Large would be tight and the buttons popping and this shirt coming untucked (if you prefer tucked)Overall, I like this shirt. I would consider buying another in a different color. I hope you found my opinion helpful.",

                "reviewText": "First, it is a great looking shirt. I like the material. It is indeed wrinkle free (after you get the wrinkles out from the vacuum packing). I like the feel and the look of the material. Looks great with a white, gray, or black undershirt.Second, I ordered navy blue - and it is a very dark navy blue, which I think is fantastic. Not quite black, but it certainly isn't going to be royal blue. It looks even darker than the navy blue on the model.Third, I'm a 2XL. This fit me about a half size too small. It's not a relaxed fit, more of an athletic fit. If I dropped 10 lbs (probably not a bad idea), it would fit perfectly. I would choose a size accordingly, depending on how you like a shirt to fit. Naturally, when you are 2XL, you don't normally want the shirt to fit too tight. Great shirt, just wish it fit like all the other 2XLs in my closet.",

The shirt drapes comfortably without any tightness around the shoulders, and the length is spot-on, which is always a pleasant surprise. Personally, I was also surprised at what really sets this shirt apart, which is the subtle pattern\u2014while it appears simply white in the photos, a closer look irl reveals a refined texture subtly embedded in the stitching that elevates its style. The buttons fasten smoothly, and the fabric feels nice against the skin\u2014a big win for all-day wear. I plan on wearing this in the warmer Southern monthsFive stars for this find\u2014it's not just another white shirt. It brings an air of sophistication while maintaining a laid-back vibe, exactly what I was looking for.---The Dude's Star Rating System (What do my star ratings mean?):1 STAR - Not up to scratch; wouldn't recommend or buy again.2 STAR - Some redeeming qualities but overall disappointing; unlikely to repurchase.3 STAR - Decent; does its job but nothing remarkable.4 STAR - Good quality and functionality; would consider buying again.5 STAR - Exceeds expectations; great fit, quality, and style; would definitely repurchase and recommend.",
