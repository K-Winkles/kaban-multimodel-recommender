                "reviewText": "People are probably getting tired of reading my reviews of Coofandy apparel. It is always the same thing. These guys just have a knack for coming out with great products (mostly men's clothing). I have been ordering clothing from them on Amazon for a few years and have been 95% satisfied with what I have received. Fortunately, this shirt is no different. They have managed to make a very stylish and comfortable shirt once again. The semi corduroy material is soft and stretchy, breathable and comfortable to wear. As an added bonus this shirt does not appear to retain wrinkles, so it is great for traveling. It can be worn as a dress shirt due to the silky look to it but could also be used in a more casual environment if left untucked. This shirt is made of a medium weight material and will tend to sag a little bit, and that is the reason for only four stars in the ratings above.I am 6'3\" 195# and went with the size large, which is my usual size for short sleeve shirts and the fit is perfect. The color I chose (Misty Rose) is a subtle and subdued pink. It is not in your face and therefore looks very good with most color pants. As we are getting into some colder weather now this shirt will get hung up for a while until it warms up.The overall construction of this shirt is very good and up to the usual high standards of the Coofandy brand. I did not have any loose threads or seams and all buttons were intact and able to access their perspective buttonholes without a struggle.Once again, I feel Coofandy has managed to come up with a stylish and on trend, fashionable addition to my ever-growing collection of men's wear. I am very happy with this shirt and can definitely recommend it. If you have not tried this brand before, give it a try and I think you will be very happy you did.",

                "reviewText": "I began to add the Coofandy brand to my wardrobe recently and, for the most part, I\u2019ve been impressed. The shirt doesn\u2019t disappoint either, but be mindful of a couple things.First off, Coofandy shirts are very comfortable. They tend to be built more for a muscular build, but that doesn\u2019t mean an average physique can\u2019t enjoy them. While this shirt is advertised as being lightweight, it\u2019s more in the middle. The fabric is more substantial than other \u201cbeachwear\u201d they sell. Most of this is because of the ridges. They are very prominent, so be mindful of that. It\u2019s a different look and I\u2019ve never worn anything quite like it. Washing and drying is simple and it doesn\u2019t wrinkle. There are no collar stays.As with other Coofandy shirts, pay attention to the sizing chart and the way it\u2019s presented in the advertising. I normally where a large but most Coofandy shirts I purchase are medium and I find them hem length to be just right while allowing plenty of room for stretching, if necessary.",

                "reviewText": "The shirt arrived in a vacuum sealed plastic bag, so I expected when I opened it, that it would be wrinkled, but I was wrong. I put it on right out of the bag, and not a wrinkle to be found. After a wash, same thing, just hung it up, and the next time I wore it, no wrinkles. This is great since I travel, I will definitely take this with me on trips so I can just pull it out of my suitcase and wear it.It's not cheap/thin, but rather a heavy-duty fabric that feels good on my skin. It has that stretchy feel to it, so it's comfortable to wear, and the best part, is it actually looks great. The only thing to know, is that it does seem to run a bit small. I'm a pretty slender 6ft tall guy, and generally can wear a medium, but I ordered a large to be on the safe side, and glad I did, because it's a perfect fit.Very happy with the shirt and will probably order a couple more of these in different colors.",

                "reviewText": "I got this shirt for my husband, since he can always use another short sleeved button up.First, the material on this shirt is very similar to viscose, so it has a decent amount of stretch to it, and does not wrinkle. It seems a bit heavy, but die to the weave, it is very breathable and feels lighter on. It is also true to size.The one compliant my husband had is that the buttonholes are slightly too large, as some buttons would randomly unbutton. Not bad if you have an undershirt on, but could be potentially embarassing if you don't layer.Overall, it is a comfortable and attractive shirt, just watch the buttons!",

Initially, I was skeptical about the brand, but a year later, I'm consistently impressed by the quality of their shirts. This particular short-sleeve button-down has become a favorite in my wardrobe.The shirt's fit is spot on, offering comfort without sacrificing style \u2013 a balance that's hard to find. It's ideal for various occasions, from casual outings to more formal events like weddings or beach parties. The fabric feels great against the skin, and it's held up well over time, which speaks to its durability.What I appreciate most is how I feel wearing it. It's not just a shirt; it's a confidence booster. Whether I'm dressing it up or down, it always adds a touch of sophistication to my look.In summary, COOFANDY has delivered yet again with this shirt. If you're looking for a well-fitting, comfortable, and stylish shirt, this brand is definitely worth checking out. They've managed to combine quality and style in a way that keeps me coming back.",
