                "reviewText": "WHAT I LIKE - It looks good. Great for casual or semi-formal business wear. - It fits well, true to size. I used to get XL shirts for the length (Larges tended to be too short), but I got a Large and it fits comfortably with a good length. Not too tight. - It's very comfortable. The shirt is light and breathable, and I really like the linen texture. It gives it a little character over plain cotton. - The coconut buttons add a nice touch of color to the khaki.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE - While most of it seems to be well made, there were a couple spots where the stitching was coming apart. - Being cotton/linen it does tend to wrinkle pretty bad. I had just finished ironing it, bent to tie my shoes and came up with a bunch of creases.Overall, I like the shirt a lot and will wear it regularly. Just be sure to wash it in cold water and hang-dry for best results and longevity.",

There is nothing better year round in south Florida where I\u2019ve been stuck for a while. This shirt is designed with a spread collar giving it a casual 50\u2019s look and worn with the shirt tail out, which neatly covers my pandemic pounds. It\u2019s not a loose fitting shirt but not tailored tight. The fit is true to size although since it\u2019s 100% cotton/linen it\u2019s going to shrink slightly if you put it in a hot dryer. I\u2019m wearing a large and I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and 190#. There really isn\u2019t anywhere in Florida that I can\u2019t wear this shirt, from the beach to some very nice restaurants. I got the dark blue and it appears colorfast even when washed in hot water. Great shirt for the price, I \u2018d certainly recommend.",

The cloth comes out of the wash with a casual look that nicely lands just short of needing an iron.The profile of the garment has a gentle taper in from the chest to the waist that keeps it from looking blousy. The straight hem makes it look super either untucked or tucked. The picture shows a medium on my 5\u201911\u201d, 150 pound, 40\u201d chest frame.This is a 5 star piece all the way.",
