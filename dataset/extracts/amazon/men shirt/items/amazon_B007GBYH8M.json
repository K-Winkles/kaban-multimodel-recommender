                "reviewText": "Ok first of all this is not a critical review. The material looks strong and the shirts seem to be a good quality. This issue is that it\u2019s much bigger than the 2xlt I usually get from the Port Authority brand. Also, the sleeves go past my elbow. I am 6\u2019 tall and 230lbs\u2026. See comparison pics. Sending back for a refund. Still giving five stars for price and material quality, if they shorten sleeve lengths and properly size the shirts, I will most definitely be back. This may be more akin to a 3xlt\u2026",
