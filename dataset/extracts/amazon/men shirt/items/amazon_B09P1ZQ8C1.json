They\u2019re all like $40-50 per shirt for all these other brands. It\u2019s almost $50 for a single Nike polo. Some were reasonably priced but had weird pockets on the sleeve or odd looking textured. Finally came across these, mid $30\u2019s for 3?! Had to try it. Got them in and they\u2019re true to size and very nice quality and great color options too. Came back to buy another 3 pack! Now I\u2019m all set and have a week\u2019s worth of shirts to wear. If you\u2019re looking for nice polos at a good price, you definitely found the right product. I\u2019m very happy with these.",
