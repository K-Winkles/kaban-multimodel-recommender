                "reviewText": "First of all, all of my shirts I own in the price range of this one as I write this review (44.95$) far exceed the quality of this one. I can't justify the current 'product for price' to anyone. I am rating this a 5 star at the price I originally paid for it which was 29.25$. At that price, this shirt is 5 stars.This is absolutely a great shirt, its my favorite shirt for when it is hot especially. It fits loose how a shirt for hot weather should and evaporates sweat quickly. It's comfortable and genuinely breathable. But, it can tear easily. It's touted as PROFESSIONAL FISHING GEAR so be careful of your tackle or any branches getting snagged on it. Pets too.I came on here to buy 2 more, but I'd essentially be paying for three and getting two. I still may, but not without a pinch of disgust.I'm going to try to find something of equal quality at a fair price from a different company.I paid 29.25 dollars for it, but at the time of writing this review, it is currently 44.95$\u2014it hasn't even been a year since I purchased it.I can literally see hands rubbing together in greed and nostrils flaring at the scent of money on this one.I'm not easily bothered by this kind of thing, and this is the first review I've written like this, but paying 44.95 for this shirt is absurd.If I am paying 15 dollars extra, I'd expect it to be 15 dollars better, and seeing the one my buddy got day before yesterday that inspired me to grab a couple more, nothing seems to be improved in terms of quality or stitching and if anything, my buddy's seemed of a tad less quality than my own worn in shirt.I can't see any reason to justify the price gouge, I'm not rich and that extra 15 dollars per shirt is really hard for me to justify to anyone, let alone make sense of.If I pull the trigger on this again, I'll update this review after some use in hot and humid SE Asia, stacking it against my current one in terms of quality and function.",
