                "reviewText": "I got these because I was looking for casual shirts that looked nice and yet are comfortable in the summer heat if the deep Southeast. These fit the bill nicely. They can work tucked or untucked and look good either way.The material is a pretty good balance between quality and comfortability. It\u2019s airy and wicks moisture pretty well, but it\u2019s not too light that it looks or feels cheap. It looks nice, like a good cotton shirt, not like cheap polyester.The material comes out wrinkle-free if you hang it up out of the dryer. It will wrinkle around the bottom if you tuck it in, but otherwise it\u2019s pretty good. Much more wrinkle resistant than cotton. You probably won\u2019t need to iron it.I don\u2019t really prefer the pattern of the material and I wish there were more solid options available, but it\u2019s not too bad.In terms of fit, it\u2019s on the looser side. It\u2019s not super billowy, but it is loose. I consider myself to be a medium-build, somewhat muscular but also have a bit of tummy, and I wish it came in a bit more at the waist.Overall, very recommended, especially at this price point. Much more comfortable and easier to take care of than typical cotton shirts. Looks nice.",

                "reviewText": "My husband is 6'5\" and we were doing some professional sunset beach pictures. I wore a cinnamon rose satin gown and I needed something that would pair well with that but not take away from me. It also had to be soft, and cool as my sasquatch of a husband is 10000degrees all the time. This shirt fit the bill perfectly. It is a heavier weight material but it was super soft and cool for him. He didn't sweat at all in it and he asked me to get the other colors in this shirt so when we go out on hot days he can still look nice.He hangs dry all of his shirts, including t-shirts so they don't shrink so I can't tell you how it holds up in the dryer, but after washing, it held its color and shape. But we travelled from MD to NC for the photos and even though we hung it up as soon as we got to our vrbo, it was still creased. It did eventually fall out as he wore it thanks to his body heat, but I would suggest having the ability to toss it in a dryer or have an iron available if you can't hang it up.(Don't judge the maroon color of the shirt from the photo because our pictures were taken in the \"golden hour\" that makes everything look a lot warmer than it is due to the color of the sunlight. It is a rich, vibrant maroon color.)",

Maybe it\u2019s a polyester smell? Idk, but we\u2019re not keeping the shirt!",
