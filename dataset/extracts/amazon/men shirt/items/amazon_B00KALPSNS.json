These shirts come in great colors, they are evenly colored and the colors don't run (at least not at a cold wash cycle). I have a bunch of these and they fit great and feel great. At 60% cotton, they are comfy and nice and thick, but still wrinkle free. Never hurts to touch up with an iron, of course, but at least it doesn't take too much effort.After 6 or 7 months, the sleeves do eventually shrink a bit, but at this price, I am happy to get a replacement shirt at that point.",

                "reviewText": "Love the shirt, strong and thick material and great green color. I\u2019m 6\"0 and 270\u2019s lbs I ordered xxl because normally these do run on the larger side but even after a first wash there is still a lot of room in the shirt. The shirt is comfortable and wearable now but if I am to drop more weight it will be too big.Great shirt at a great price. I would definitely say size down one from your normal wear.Excellent mobility in the shoulders and arms and plenty of shirt to be able to tuck without worrying about riding up and untucking. I will be ordering the light blue and white next month.A fast update\u2026 Okay, I liked this shirt so much I didn\u2019t wait the month and I went ahead and purchased the white and blue shirts as well. I ordered those two in just the xl size, same great quality as the first one. Both xl sizes feel the exact same as each other (like they should) and I do not have a problem buttoning them up and they look great however, when I sit down there is some stress on the buttons in the belly. This won\u2019t be a problem as I continue to shed pounds. The regular fit style has a lot of room even for big guys like me. I was very surprised that the xl had measurements that work for me without going into big and tall sizes Neck 17-.17.5 sleeves 34/35 hope this helps when you\u2019re wondering about fitting. This is a thicker style material but very comfortable and quality feel.",

                "reviewText": "You're going to love this shirt \u2014 it's _almost_ the equal of Oxford shirts selling for almost 3 times as much! For many years I've bought these shirts from L.L. Bean and been very happy. But they're getting pricey. As of this writing, they're as much as $69.95 each. Now, Van Heusen is an old and, at one time, a famous brand. So, I thought it was worth a shot. And I'm delighted with the result! The Oxford cloth of this shirt is just a shade less thick than used by L.L. Bean, and the arms don't have the built-in crease either. But in all other respects, the shirts are the same. Well made. Wash well. And fit well. One thing it does _not_ have that L.L. Bean has are spare buttons sewn onto the tail of the shirt. But then I've rarely used these buttons for spares. And 2 things it has that L.L. Bean does _not_ have is (1) a tag inside the collar to hang the shirt on a hook; (2) longer tails \u2014 for me, they reach midway between my hips and knees. So, there's lots of shirt to tuck in and keep you snug. All this for less than $25! Plus they offer lots of sizes, so you can be sure to find a size that fits you perfectly. I'm delighted with the quality, fit and look of this shirt and I'm sure you will be, too.",

                "reviewText": "I've been with my spouse for 6 years now, and like with many big and tall guys who never learned how to shop for themselves (outside of rugby - man knows *everything* about sports gear) or articulate clearly what kinds of clothing he likes/dislikes (he's one of those people who says he's fine with everything, but like all of us has preferences), the clothing struggles (fit, comfort, and durability especially) are real. He's a lawyer and recently made the switch to litigator, (which means he now needs to appear in court), which is where this shirt and I stepped in. I bought two as initial test balloons because my spouse *hates* anything resembling a slim fit in button down shirts, and historically we've just had awful luck finding shirts even in his so-called size that work for him (regular fit or not).His opinion (short version) is that they fit perfectly and he loves them. Long version is that, after trying on these shirts, he was blown away because, for the first time did not pull at the shoulders, armpits, or wrists, and in fact fit him perfectly. He actually was at a loss for a bit because he's become so used to experiencing mild discomfort/pulls under his arms/etc. (he also has broad shoulders) that not having those feelings was just weird for him. Even though the shirt wasn't a \"tall,\" it tucked in well enough to his pants, but still gave him that more classic has-worked-for-decades regular/blousy feel that isn't trendy right now, but still looks good. If you like slimmer lines at all, SIZE DOWN, because this shirt is not going to do it for you otherwise. I'd've named it a \"classic\" fit versus \"regular\" fit if I were at Van Heusen, but that's just me. However, if you are or are shopping for someone who likes a more old-school fit, and/or are looking for someone with broader shoulders and a bigger frame who wants clothes that accommodate that, get a couple and try it out. You might find yourself stockpiling. We also liked how the collars have buttons on them, which means that if he doesn't send them out for dry cleaning, the collars still won't be a mess in front of a judge (an issue with his current suit shirts) because he can keep them buttoned and just weave his ties through. The weave/fabric content is also a smidge heavier, which was nice given that we live in Chicago, which has three seasons of cold. Also, it means that the shirt settles nicely - the issue with lighter shirt fabrics on bigger guys is they sometimes puff out. This drapes beautifully. Finally, the overall quality is nice and durable.tl;dr They were exactly what he never knew he needed in a dress shirt. I have now bought a total of 13 shirts in different colorways for him @ the current $19.99 price-point for him to use and as archived backups for when we inevitably have to replace them. They perfectly suit his needs, and I only wish this particular line had more colorways. Finally, usually my spouse hates it when people buy him clothes, but he was so pleased with my shirt-shopping spree that he went out and got me a fun gardening accessory as thanks. \u263a\ufe0f",

It looks and feels equally well with either a suit or a corduroy jacket and khakis or even jeans.It is definitely not one of those thin cheap shirts with a low thread count and I expect to be wearing it for years to come.Sometimes one has to pay a little more for geniune quality and this shirt is decidedly worth the price.",
