The only negative is the stitching is inconsistent (good on most, wonky on one, and a bad spot on one seam).For the price they're good. And I have some old ones of these that I've had for a couple years and they've held up well (long as the stitching doesn't fail). Wash after wash they never \"pill up\" or get threadworn.",

These shirts, and their identically-fitting V-necks (pictured), really are all I wear 95% of the time. I like the way the shirts feel, the way they fit and how they drape off of my upper body. Apart from the seldom loose string that needs cut, these are nicely made and a very good value for the price.A word of caution: these shirts will shrink quite a bit if you use hot water and/or a clothes dryer. I wash them in cold water and then hang dry. They hold their fit/length for a long time that way.",

So what better way to start off your new look with than Gildan t-shirts? Man, these things are great - comfortable, lightweight, and they don't shrink, at least not with my washer/dryer settings. It's no wonder many of the band shirts I've owned over the years have been printed on Gildan. Course, I sold all of those, so I just have these plain ones. Which is okay too.",

Makes them somewhat awkward to wear, almost like a hospital gown.If, while standing, you can look straight down and see your belt buckle these will probably be a bit generously sized.Otherwise very soft, so much nicer than the cold polyester shirts that are everywhere now.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts 5 pack, and I must say I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. These shirts have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe for several reasons.First and foremost, the comfort level is impressive. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and doesn't cause any irritation or discomfort, even after a full day of wear. The fit is just right \u2013 not too tight and not too loose, making it perfect for casual outings or as an everyday undershirt.Durability is another strong point of these t-shirts. I've washed them multiple times, and they have held up remarkably well, maintaining their shape and color without any noticeable shrinkage. This is especially important for a pack of five, as you want your investment to last.One of the standout features of these Gildan Crew T-Shirts is the affordability. You get five quality shirts for a reasonable price, making it an excellent value for your money. It's an economical way to replenish your basic t-shirt collection without breaking the bank.However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks to consider. The shirts tend to wrinkle easily, so you may need to give them a quick iron before wearing if you want a more polished look. Additionally, the color options in the pack are somewhat limited, which may not suit those looking for a wide range of choices.",
