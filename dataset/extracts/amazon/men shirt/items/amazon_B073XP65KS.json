I tried it on before washing in warm water and again after and did not really notice much shrinking. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and softness given it's price.

I put it on, and suddenly I'm practically hearing chainsaws in the background.The transformation was unreal. I'm walking down the street, and it's like a scene from a romance movie\u2014ladies swooning, dudes giving approving nods. I had to start carrying a metaphorical flyswatter because, seriously, I was fending off admirers like I was the last sexy lumberjack on Earth.The flannel effect is real, folks. It's not just a shirt; it's a statement. The girls in the hallway? Swooning. The guys? Suddenly, they all want to be my buddy. I half-expected a lumberjack fan club to form by the end of the week.I'm not saying this shirt has superpowers, but I am saying that it might just have unlocked a new level of charisma for me. I wear it, and suddenly I'm the hero of my own lumberjack romance novel.So, if you're looking to channel your inner lumberjack and have people practically begging to be your friend, the Amazon Essentials Flannel Shirt is your secret weapon. It's warm and stylish, and apparently, it comes with a built-in charm spell. Just be prepared to navigate through the newfound adoration.All jokes aside - this is a really well-made and comfortable flannel, great for seasonal events. I bought it for a work Christmas party and ended up wearing it many times over the winter. It looks good, is a more than fair price, it washes well and it appears to be well made. Nicely done Amazon!",

I wanted to get a new flannel because I was looking for something a bit warmer and when I got this shirt. I loved it. Thr color is great, ir fits well, and very comfortable around the shoulders and arms. I also have enough shirt to cover my belt line and it isn't this high cut flannel (if that's a thing). Great shirt, may buy more in different colors.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this shirt and a GoodThreads shirt. This review was written for the GoodThreads shirt but also this Amazon Essentials. A comparison. See bottom of what follows. I recommend this Amazon Essentials shirt if you're OK with plaid.GoodThreads Shirt:Bottom line is I was pleasantly surprise with the quality of this shirt. I was looking for a solid orangish-yellow for fall color. Very good material and craftsmanship. Material is soft and strong almost like a \"flannel light weight canvas\". I'm about 6'1\" and 164 pounds, with little muscle tone and/or body fat. The only negative comment is the sleeve diameter is a little tight given the body diameter on the XL size I bought. it's OK, just, I wish the body diameter was a little tighter. If you're heavier around the middle, the fit would be better. Shirt body length should be an inch longer for me. Sleeve length right on. The color wasn't available in tall size. But, it is very hard to find brighter solid colors. If you want solid color, give this a try.Amazon Essentials Shirt (this shirt):I also bought the Amazon Essential plaid in a yellow/black. That shirt has a better sleeve to body diameter ratio for me and is the typical flannel material. Shirt body length should be an inch longer for me. Sleeve length right on. I rate the A.E. shirt 5 star for a flannel plaid-for the money.Both are very good value. The Goodthreads shirt was a few more dollars but the material is better. This A.E. shirt offered a better color selection than what I could find in local stores. The A.E. shirt is a good value for a light weight plaid flannel.I have washed both shirts and observed no shrinkage. You must take out of dryer and hang on hangers right away, otherwise wrinkles.",
