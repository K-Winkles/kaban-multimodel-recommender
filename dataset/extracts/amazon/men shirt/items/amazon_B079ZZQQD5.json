I ordered the \"Sea Blue\" which shows as a medium blue color - what I received is a dark Navy blue. I ordered the \"Pinot Noir\" red which shows as a medium red but the actual color of the shirt I received is a very dark maroon red.

                "reviewText": "The shirt looks good, though it is a little thin. While this feature is great for comfort, it means the shirt lacks a level of body that gives other shirts a better look. This thin fabric tends to look a little crumpled.The fit is as expected. For my closet, though, I prefer the Arrow 1851 shirts.",
