                "reviewText": "Okay, where do I start? I bought two of these because I needed to replace a couple of dress shirts. I thought they were twill, but no, they are not made with Twill fabric, they are a black fabric that seems to be of a good quality. The arms, and neck are exactly the right size, Just perfect. 20 neck, 35/36 arms. The torso, was my only concern. To my surprise, the shirt nearly reaches mid thigh, which is actually pretty hilarious as I have not worn a shirt that oversized since I was a kid. It will be easy to tailor the length on these which makes the value of these shirts amazing. I could not ask for a better fit in the shoulders, arms and neck. The weight of the fabric makes it good for warmer climate. Color was spot on, though I need to wash them to see how colorfast they are. Seems to be a wash and wear wrinkle free fabric and honestly for the value you could not ask for more. I intend to buy probably 5 more.",
