The sizing is extremely generous, if you're a big guy, someone who normally wears 3X than the XXL while be plenty of room for you. I tend to run XL by old navy (Gap) but I was worried it'd be off so I ordered the XXL, it was so big I could wrap the front around myself and it enveloped me. I sent it back but am now debating doing a Large as I am worried the xl might still be too big. In young men and certain brands I run between and xl and XXL if it's slim fit, so I think w the generous sizing I might be able to get away with a LG. Hopefully this gives someone a little reference for which sz to go with. If you're a BIG boy XXL is more than big enough, XL for people that normally order XXL and LG for those who order XL.",
