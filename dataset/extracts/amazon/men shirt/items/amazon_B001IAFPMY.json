The sizing is true - relaxed fit, color true, comfortable medium weight cotton, very supple - use as night shirt, super durable - holds up to a lot of washing.Regarding working with vendor:Received a notice that the product shipped via DHL, but was unable to locate the package. I checked with neighbors and nothing. I filed a ticket requesting vendor follow up with shipper as to where package was left, which happened.After more searching, the product was located inside of the USPS mailbox.The shipping info was misleading, but the vendor customer service was very polite and responsive to this issue.Would not hesitate to purchase this item again and through the same vendor.",

                "reviewText": "This style of shirt is super cool worn casually with some jeans, cargos, carpenters, or anything like that. Although not my application, it is definitely a great shirt if you want something to work in, it has pretty long sleeves, a nice pocket, and feels very rugged, yet still comfortable. The material at least on the black one does seem to get a bit linty but that's not really a problem of design or anything. I would definitely recommend this shirt but I would be cautious of the fit as many other reviewers said. I am a 5'9 man 170lbs pretty athletic build, and the shirt does fit very loose in a size small. That however is not a problem, as many want a baggy fit - it is just that the shirt is quite long and will likely bunch up around the waist which may not be the most flattering. I am actually considering cropping the shirt for style reasons but again, this may or may not be undesirable to you, I would prefer if it sat a little smoother and didn't bunch up. *** I usually wear mediums and fit perfect, the small for this shirt fits like a big medium for me*** If you have ever worn a uniqlo U t-shirt, the medium in that fits like this one.",

                "reviewText": "Dicke Baumwolle, stabile Verarbeitung und guter f\u00fcr breite Schultern und dicken Bauch - leider in Deutschland kaum zu bekommen.Wieso 5 Sterne?Stabile Verarbeitung, fairer Preis (30 Euro), beggy Schnitt, der an den Armen und Schultern gut sitzt, Shirt ist lang genug, um es gut in die Hose zu stecken.Bemerkung:Leider sind die Shirts online kaum in Deutschland zu finden, habe mich daher \u00fcber die M\u00f6glichkeit gefreut, das Ganze \u00fcber Amazon in den Staaten zu bestellen. Der Versand ist dementsprechend l\u00e4nger - ist f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich aber kein Problem.Schnitt ist Big and Tall - das Shirt ist auf jeden Fall beggy. Wenn man - wieso auch immer - dieses Shirt eng sitzen haben m\u00f6chte, lieber eine Nummer kleiner bestellen.",
