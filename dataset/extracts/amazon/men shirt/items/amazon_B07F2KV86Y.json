There's a slit at the bottom of the packet; if, like me, you're ordering a white dress shirt for an impending event, it could easily have been damaged and/or stained.

                "reviewText": "Once upon a time, in a wardrobe not too far away, Kenneth Cole Men's Dress Shirts were the knights in shining armor for every style-conscious gentleman. But alas, this latest Slim Fit Solid edition seems to have lost its way in the fashion forest.This shirt promised the sleek, sophisticated silhouette of a slim fit. What it delivers, however, is a fit so peculiar it could only have been designed by a committee of contortionists. It's as if the shirt was made for a mannequin that decided to go on an extreme diet - unnaturally snug in some places, bewilderingly baggy in others.The quality, once the pride of the Kenneth Cole empire, now whispers tales of cost-cutting woes. The fabric feels like it gave up on life, and the stitching seems to be hanging on by a thread, both literally and metaphorically.It's a heartbreaking tale for anyone who once relied on this brand for their sartorial staples. Like seeing your favorite rock band from the '80s attempting a comeback, only to realize they should have left the memories alone.TL;DR: Kenneth Cole's Men's Dress Shirt Slim Fit Solid is a stark reminder that all that glitters is not gold. What was once a go-to for sharp, reliable dressing has now taken a turn down Cheap Avenue. It's a shirt best left on the rack, unless you're dressing a scarecrow with unusual dimensions.",
