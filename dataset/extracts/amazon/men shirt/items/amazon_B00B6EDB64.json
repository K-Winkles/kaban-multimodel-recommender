Well, I normally would order Carhartt brand, which is double the price of Dickie's brand, but my son is a autobody technician and ruins all his clothes. So, when I went on Amazon in search of good quality shirts for a great price, I found the Dickies Heavy weight crew neck shirts with great reviews and great pricing. I ordered 3 for him and of course, I was ready to send them back before even receiving them! As soon as I opened the package, I was so pleased!!! These tees are truly of great quality, accurate sizing and heavy weight cotton material! Great product!!! Very pleased and my son loved them. They wash up wonderfully! No color fading and no shrinkage.",

It started out slightly snug around the love handles, but as he wore it that part loosened up a little. It is nice and long, coming down almost to his hip. It looks much better on, than his old ones that have gotten saggy and too loose. It is also much heavier fabric than the Fruity one, and I expect it to be more durable. I removed the Dickies tag from the pocket with no problem. It was not glued, so I just carefully worked the stitches loose with a seam ripper. I will order several more in different colors, I believe this will be his go-to shirt from now on!",
