                "reviewText": "The Hanes Beefy-T has been around for over 45 years, and for good reason. Here's my take on this classic tee after putting it through its paces:Comfort: This tee is all about comfort. The 6.1 oz. jersey cotton is soft and breathable, and it gets even softer with every wash. It's not too thin or too thick, just the right weight for year-round wear. Plus, the full-cut fit gives you plenty of room to move without feeling constricting.Durability: This tee is built to last. The double stitching at the sleeves and hem holds up well to washing and wear, and the non-chafe fabric taping reinforces the neck and shoulders. I haven't experienced any shrinking or fading, even after several washes.Style: The Hanes Beefy-T comes in a whopping 30 colors, so you're sure to find one (or a few!) that you love. Whether you prefer classic black and white, or want to add a pop of color with neon blue heather or deep forest, there's a Beefy-T for you.Value: The Hanes Beefy-T offers great value. It's a quality tee that you can wear and wash over and over again without breaking the bank.Overall:The Hanes Beefy-T is a classic for a reason. It's comfortable, durable, stylish, and affordable. It's a great everyday tee that you can reach for again and again. Whether you're lounging at home, running errands, or hitting the gym, the Beefy-T has you covered.",

My husband is 6 foot 11.75 inches tall, 240lb and has a hard time finding shirts that fit well. He is muscular but slim, and prefers his shirts to fit long without being too boxy. We buy XXL tall and they fit him well. He always wants thicker shirts (similar to an older vintage style shirt, with sturdy material versus the thinner shirts that fall apart really easily) and these have been the best option, especially at this price point. They\u2019re thick, well made, sturdy shirts that have held up lots of wears and lots of washes. Despite being thicker, they are not rough, and the material is quite soft. They\u2019re nice and long, so they fit very tall men very well. He washes them on cold, with other black clothing, and hangs them to dry. They have kept their shape well and they have not shrunk or fallen apart. We have not had any issues with the black shirts losing their color at all, and they\u2019ve maintained a dark black color thus far. Will update if that changes. We have not tried any of the other colors yet, but will look to try the blue in the future.",

I'm 6' 1\" and about 215 pounds, and the 2XLTall fits me perfectly, with just enough room to wear a short- or long-sleeved t-shirt underneath for comfort or warmth (the back room at work gets very cold in winter.)It has surprisingly good thickness and durability for the price and shrinks only minimally. It comes down below my waist far enough to keep my rear end covered when I bend over (I have to bend and squat a lot for work.) It comes in a wide variety of colors, including the particular one I need for work.I've ordered the two-pack a couple times, and the color and fit were consistent.So five stars for this one: price, comfort, durability, functionality and color are all just right for me.",

                "reviewText": "Most of my t shirts for the past few years have been thin, so I wanted to try a thicker t shirt for the colder season. I first bought a Beefy T shirt from Amazon. The shirt was amazing, regular fit, nice thick collar, and was made with 100% American cotton. I tried buying the same beefy t from another site (Jiffyshirts) to see if I could save money (although the price difference wasn\u2019t that much). The Hanes t shirts from Jiffyshirts were not the same ones from Amazon. They were 90% cotton and 10% polyester. It felt way cheaper and did not drape like the Amazon Beefy ts. I bought more shirts from Amazon (black, olive, smoke, charcoal grey, and dark forest). I noticed a difference between some colors. The Olive and charcoal grey shirts are made in El Salvador, while the black, smoke, and dark forest are made in Haiti. Both are made of 100% cotton but the quality and thickness of the Haitian made shirts were slightly better than the ones made in El Salvador. My point is if you like Hanes Beefy Ts then get them from Amazon.",

With this tee comparative to the ones I've had before, I can tell that the quality has degraded as the construction isn't as firm and the quality of the fabric isn't as thick.Overall, it's still a very nice tee. It's built to fit wide, thick, broad shoulders with a big chest and some room around the midriff and biceps. I noticed that the shirt is a little short (coming from someone who is 5'9 and wearing a Large) and could be slightly longer to fit just right and to be tuck-able within pants.It continues to get more and more comfortable with every wash. The Hanes Beefy-T I would argue is the highest quality Hanes blank tee you can get your hands on.I will continue my hunt for the best every-day tee to rule them all.3/5, because it\u2019s not the best shirt ever made, but it is a comfortable one.",
