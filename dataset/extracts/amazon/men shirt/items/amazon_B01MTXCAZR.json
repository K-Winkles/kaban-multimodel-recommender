It\u2019s a good length for me too. I hate when these are too short and wide. Doesn\u2019t look good. But these are the right length and a good cut. These are good to just wear and relax, or play basketball, workout, etc. Good quality. Only thing I didn\u2019t like was the tag inside. I just cut it off.
