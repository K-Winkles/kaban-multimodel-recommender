                "reviewText": "I now own three of these shirts, and all perform as consistently as the first, 'test' shirt. They fit properly (as most Amazon Essentials wear does for me). I live in the South so flannel shirts are not an essential staple most of the year--I won't claim to have put these shirts to the test running the Iditarod or anything--but I didn't have any classic plaid flannel and didn't feel like shelling out $45+ for LL Bean.Like white tee shirts, blue jeans, and baseball caps there is a timeless, classic American quality to your standard flannel-plaid long-sleeve button-up shirt. Everything good about the category is good about this specific shirt. They are warm, they're perfect for layering and they get softer and more comfortable the longer you have them (we'll see how this cheap flannel ages but so far, so good). They are not fancy. They are practical, and they will never go out of style.As for the specifics: Amazon Essentials continues to surprise me with the relative quality of fabrics, cuts and construction. Being the house value brand it's surprisingly comparable in quality to more premium AZ brands such as Goodthreads or national brands. I even ended up buying a Good Threads shirt for nearly ten dollars more partly to compare (more on that later). The Goodthreads shirt was of a softer flannel--just noticeable. The slim cut was a little slimmer--whereas the slim-cut in Amazon Essentials feels closer to a regular fit (I didn't try what they labeled as regular fit) and honestly fits me better. The stitching, the buttons, everything else was so close you'd really have to look carefully to notice. That's not to say the Goodthreads shirt is bad--just that the Amazon Essentials ones are very respectable, and for under $20 they're rock-solid. And other than the different patterns of plaid, the three shirts are seemingly identical--great QC.About the patterns: I'm docking one star for the product page itself and the fact that of the RED plaids--the obvious bold/iconic choice, of which every self-respecting wearer of men's clothing ought to own at least one--the first two, most traditional-looking red plaids were SOLD OUT in size medium, and stayed that way over the month or so that I kept coming back to check before finally purchasing the shirt in the weird (but not deal-breaking) red and yellow plaid pictured here. The buffalo and red and black? You can't have one. Other colors of plaid? Sure. I got a blue green and a blue and black and they both look very nice. But the classic, the go-to, the 'original' red plaid flannel? No way.That's part of the reason I purchased the Good Threads one, and I felt like I'd been upsold--we're out of that color in the value-brand, but if you step up to the midrange, we've got plenty on that floor. Whatever. Now Amazon is recommending me blonde mullet wigs and Wayne's World trucker hats. Crazy world we live in.",
