                "reviewText": "I take photo trips for 2 or 3 weeks at a time and dealing with clothing on top of my gear is a PITA. The Columbia Bahama helps me keep it simple: super lightweight and folds tiny, can be washed in hotel room sinks and dries fast. Plus it's comfortable, cool, not prone to wrinkles and rocks the safari look. I love the sage color but be forewarned it's similar to park ranger and zoo keeper attire. I was asked for park information a couple times while enjoying the California Redwoods! Next time around, I'll spring for the blue Bahama...The workmanship of this made in Vietnam shirt is excellent but, as other reviewers noted, runs at least one size too large. I'm 5'8\" 140LBs with slim athletic build (biker/runner) and normally wear small. However, I bought extra small and it fits okay but is still oversized, sort of a 1980s tent shirt fit. I've been wearing Columbia jackets and shirts for years and most run a size large, so par for the course.I live in the tropics and the sun burns me through my t-shirt within 30 minutes. UV protection is excellent and I'm good for hours of shooting without a hint of redness. As for coolness, it's okay but not much better than a normal light cotton shirt. The nylon fabric is more prone to abrasion than cotton shirts: Cordura bags and daypack straps tend to \"sand\" it if you walk around all day.Finally, as a photographer I find the large pockets useful for holding filters, memory cards, lens caps, etc. The velcro makes for quick one-handed access and the pockets expand enough to hold a small lens. All in all a great shirt for photographers, travelers and outdoorsmen.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison of Columbia Tamiami II, Bahama II, Blood & Guts III, and Bonehead PFG Shirts",
                "reviewText": "Columbia makes some fantastic shirts, but make sure to order the appropriate size. I am 5\u201910\u201d, 195 lbs, and would typically wear a Large in most similar styled (button-up) shirts, but I have to get a Medium in Columbia PFG shirts. (The Medium is still a moderately loose fit, as the Large is like a tent on me). Tip number two is that because these shirts are on different sizing scale, many get returned to the Amazon Warehouse, so keep an eye for Amazon Warehouse deals on these shirts (see tips to finds the easiest way to compare prices across sizes and colors at the conclusion of this review). I have tried the Tamiami II, Bahama II, and Bonehead (AND new Blood & Guts III \u2013 see below for updated comparison including the BG3 series) versions of the Columbia PFG shirts, and have been mostly pleased with all of them. The Tamiami II was my favorite due to the cooling effect of the weave, but the similar Blood & Guts III is now right there with it. My reasoning for giving the Bahama II 4 starts instead of 5, is that out of the four series discussed in this review, it is my least favorite. The Bahama II tends to wrinkle, is not as cool feeling in extreme heat as the open weave Tamiami or Blood&Guts, and the nylon tend to feel slimy during periods of heavy perspiration. Below I have noted the differences in four of the PFG styles, for those trying to decide which shirt they may prefer.TAMIAMI II STYLE (POLY) - SUMMERTIME CASUAL FAVORITEThe Tamiami II (T2) and the Blood & Guts III (BG3) are my favorite of the aforementioned PFG styles. The main difference between each of these styles is material. The T2 & BG3 are 100% polyester (liner and exterior), the Bahama II (Ba2) is nylon, and the Bonehead (BH) is poplin cotton. The T2 is the thinnest/lightest (most breathable) material of the three styles, also has a slightly shinier appearance, and is probably the most wrinkle resistant of the three (as the fabric is less rigid that the nylon Bahama II or cotton Bonehead). (Update 7/11/16 \u2013 The Blood & Guts series is also breathable polyester similar to the Tamiami with a slightly different styling, and stain resistant fabric. See update at end of review for full comparison.) The T2 has a snap button pocket on top with Velcro pockets underneath on both sides, which I also prefer over the pocket style on the other two (Ba2 & BH have identical pocket styles). The synthetic T2 and Ba2 both wick moisture and create a cooling effect better than the cotton BH, but the lightness and weave of the T2 makes it by far the coolest wearing of the three. For outdoor activity in the heat and humidity of summer, it would definitely be my preferred choice. The long-sleeve version is fantastic for offshore fishing when lightweight sun protection is essential. The Ta series also does not wrinkle as badly as the Ba and BH series shirts do. (The PFG apparel which has an SPF rating, such as the Tamiami & Blood/Guts series, has an open fabric weave which is \u201close\u201d enough to allow some penetration of UV through the material itself; which means the material is much more breathable ergo cool feeling, although technically you could get some UV exposure through the shirt.)BAHAMA II STYLE (NYLON) - WORK WEAR IN MILD WEATHERThe Bahama II is the middle ground between the T2 and the BH. It is synthetic - similar to the T2, but is a nylon exterior shell with a polyester liner (whereas T2 is poly liner and shell). The pockets on the Ba are the same traditional Columbia PFG look as the pockets on the Bonehead. The slightly more rigid feel of the nylon, also gives the Bahama a more traditional (cotton-look) appearance than the T2. In a certain respect, the Ba nylon manages moisture better than the BH cotton version \u2013 i.e. it evaporates sweat more quickly. On the other hand, the nylon does not absorb moisture as cotton does, so while it does dry faster, it has a \u201cslimy\u201d feel to when sweaty that simply is not comfortable. The Bahama also wrinkles worse than any of the other PFG series shirts, so it is my least favorite series. That said, it is still a good quality shirt, and makes for a great work shirt during temperate weather (i.e. when it isn\u2019t going to get slimy with sweat).BONEHEAD STYLE (COTTON) - COOL WEATHER FAVORITEMost everything has already been covered. The BH and the aforementioned Ba styles look virtually identical. Essentially, I like the Bonehead over the Bahama because it does not get that slimy feeling when you sweat, and it is slightly better from a wrinkle perspective. The Bonehead is probably my favorite series when moisture management and cooling effect are not important, so I like these in long sleeve for fall and winter wear. I also like the traditional appearance of the Ba and the BH for work wear, but the T2 look I like better for casual. (The newer Blood & Guts series has the comfort of the Tamiami series, but has a look similar to the Bonehead, so it is my new favorite summertime work shirt.) The Bonehead long sleeve also makes a great layering option for hunting season, and Sage is a great natural neutral (earth tone) color for this purpose.UPDATE 7/11/16 \u2013 BLOOD & GUTS III (POLY) - HOT WEATHER FISHING FAVORITEWhen this review was originally posted, I only contrasted the Bahama, Tamiami, and Bonehead series shirts, but recently I have found a new favorite \u2013 the Blood & Guts III (BG3). While the name may not be all that appealing, these are really great shirts. They have an SPF rating, therefore breathable/open weave, similar to the Tamiami, with a styling that more closely resembles the Bahama & Bonehead series. The BG3 is also treated for stain resistance, making it a great shirt for fishing, work, and outdoor activities. Finally, the BG3 does not wrinkle nearly as severely as the Bahama nylon or Bonehead cotton shirts do. Out of the four PFG series shirts discussed, the BG3 series probably have the tightest fit. I still wear a medium in the BG3, but the series has a slimmer type cut than the previous versions discussed. All in all, this is my favorite alongside the Tamiami. I slightly prefer the Blood & Guts for fishing due to the stain resistance, whereas, I prefer the Tamiami for casual and boating wear just from an aesthetic standpoint. The Tamiami may have the slightest of edges in the cooling department, but they are very close in that regard.AMAZON PRICE COMPARISON & WAREHOUSE DEALSI used to always get aggravated at the way Amazon list apparel items with multiple colors, as it can take forever to search through multiple color (and size) options to see the cheapest offerings. On my iPad version the color prices are displayed in a list style automatically, but on my PC desktop I would have to select each color/size to see the price options. I did not realize there is a much simpler way. Select the \u201cnew and used from\u201d (or \u201cnew\u201d if no used offerings available) icon, which will take you to a list view. There must be multiple offerings for the exact size and color selected for this option to appear, so if you do not see the \u201cnew and used from\u201d hyper-link, then select another size/color combination till the link appears.) In the list view screen, select your size and click the \u201clowest offer for each\u201d icon beside the color selector. It will display the cheapest offering for each color shirt in that size, so you can quickly see which colors are the cheapest. Also, this view will show any Amazon Warehouse Deals available. As mentioned in the first paragraph, these shirts get returned often due to sizing issues, so many times the Warehouse deals are shirts that were tried on and immediately returned for a smaller size.",

I bought it primarily because it has built-in sunscreen to protect my skin from the bright/hot Texas sun. The color of this shirt is a beautiful rusty red that looks nice with my tan skin and dark hair. I must have 10+ Columbia Bahama II / Tamiami shirts, both short sleeve as well as long sleeve, for all indoor-outdoor occasions. These shirts are incredibly lightweight and wick away moisture really well, keeping me cool in the Texas heat. They also wash and dry really nicely and never need ironing. Amazon has a great price, which is much less than the Columbia retail price. This shirt is definitely worth more money and looks much more expensive than it was. I'm pleased with my purchase definitely recommend this shirt, especially if you're looking for sun protection. It's the perfect thing to wear in Texas or any place with a bright sun.",
