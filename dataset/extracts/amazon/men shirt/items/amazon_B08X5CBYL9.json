                "reviewText": "Shirt meets all expectations and is as described on listing. Material is very soft and comfortable medium/light weight flannel. Weight is good for autumn and spring, maybe not for cold winter temps (unless worn layered, not a thick \u201clumberjack\u201d type cotton or wool flannel weight). Thin enough to even wear in moderate summer temps when worn without undershirt (I like the soft feel and texture of flannel compared to poplin or oxford cloth against my skin).Washed in cold water then tumbled air dry. Did not shrink and was color fast (purchased in navy blue color). Size was as described and expected (slim fit medium). Fits athletic body type well and drapes well without being too tight. Beer belly guys need not apply, it is after all, a slim fit.Since all cotton, wrinkling out of wash and tumble air dry was also as expected (same as all my other 100% all cotton flannel shirts) and required ironing when still very very slightly damp to sharpen up the look by getting rid of wrinkles and slight puckering at any seams and at edging stitches. Again, expected of any cotton flannels. Only washed once so far, but absolutely no piling of fabric surface so far. Stitching was very good at all seams and edging as well as buttons stitching was very good.Solid colors were priced higher than plaids ($23.70 vs $19.92 at my time of purchase) but was still good value for the quality. Overall, very pleased with purchase.",

I have a horrible time finding flannels, or any long sleeve button down shirts, that fit right... 99% are boxy, even the slim fit.Got 2 of these in XL Slim.... Very disappointed. Still a boxy fit... Slim does not mean tapered waist. The shirt fits tighter at chest, but still loose and boxy at waist.... and the XL is short... Without washing it goes barely past my beltline, so I'm sure it will shrink. Sleeves are short.... if you extend your arms in front of you, the sleeves pull up 5-6 inches from your wrist....If you're under 6'0 and average build, this might work for you... If you work out and look like it, this shirt is not flattering and not a real slim or tapered athletic fit.I gave it 3 stars because the material is nice, soft, and warm. The quality of manufacturing also seems good. The fit is not for everyone. Wish Amazon made an athletic fit flannel....If you're on the fence, just try it and return if it doesn't work for you.",
