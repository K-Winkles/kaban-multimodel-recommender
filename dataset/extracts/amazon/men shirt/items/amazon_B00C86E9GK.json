I wanted some company branded shirts, but their supplier only offered standard fit shirts (that are oddly large around the torso).These are available in several colors. The fit is almost perfect (for me anyway), they\u2019re wrinkle free, and the price is right. I initially did a \u201ctry before you buy\u201d with three different colors. I liked them so much I paid for those and ordered a fourth.",

                "reviewText": "My stats (to help you choose a size):5\u2019 8\u201d / 210 lbs / chest 47\u201d / waist 36 (in Levi\u2019s) / biceps 16\u201d.Perfect fit for me: 17.5\u201d 34/35 (xl), feels tailored. A great option if a classic/regular size is too big, but slim fit is too tight. The fabric does have a very slight stretch to it, but not enough to matter. I wish it had a little more, but thats not a deal breaker. (Look at Van Heusen Fitted Stretch if you want more. Excellent shirts w/ same fit but very limited colors).I have a large 17 3/4\u201d neck, so I can\u2019t wear a tie, but the fit across chest is great. It\u2019s fitted around the belly, but not so much where it makes you look like sausage. You\u2019ll actually look leaner and more polished off. I\u2019m a little wide in the shoulders, so if I reach out, it\u2019s a little tight around the upper back. So I wouldn\u2019t take this shirt out dancing. If I got the 18\u201d version, it would fit at the neck, but too loose everywhere else . The 17 inch version would be way too tight.All in all, it\u2019s a sharp looking shirt that would be great for the office or out to dinner.",

Needed the 17 1/2 \" neck but the chest size would be larger, so learned to use the 17\" neck size and not fasten the collar button and use the tie a little loose fitting.Will buy again",
