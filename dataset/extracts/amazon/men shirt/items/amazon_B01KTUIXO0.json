This long sleeve plaid button-down casual shirt has become a staple in my wardrobe, and it has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort, and value.The best feature of this flannel shirt is its exceptional quality. The fabric feels durable and well-made, with a softness that makes it incredibly comfortable to wear. Despite its rugged appearance, it is surprisingly lightweight and breathable, making it suitable for a variety of weather conditions.Another standout aspect of this shirt is its affordable price point. Given the high quality and stylish design, I was pleasantly surprised by how reasonable the price was. It's a great value for the level of craftsmanship and comfort it provides, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers.The comfort of this shirt is unmatched. The relaxed fit allows for easy movement, and the fabric feels soft against the skin. Whether I'm wearing it for outdoor activities or simply lounging at home, it always feels comfortable and cozy.The only downside I've noticed is that the sizing runs a little larger compared to regular sizes. While this hasn't been a major issue for me, some may prefer a more fitted look and may need to consider sizing down for a better fit.In summary, the Legendary Whitetails Men's Buck Camp Flannel is a top-quality shirt that offers exceptional comfort, style, and value. Its superior craftsmanship, affordable price, and comfortable fit make it a standout choice for anyone in search of a reliable and stylish flannel shirt.I hope this review helps!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Legendary Whitetails Men's Buck Camp Flannel for my husband, an avid Harley rider and fan. The vibrant colors of this flannel immediately reminded me of the iconic Harley Davidson aesthetic, so I decided to surprise him with it. I'm delighted to say it was a complete win!I opted for his regular size, and the fit is spot on. The flannel is not lightweight, offering a substantial thickness without being overly bulky. It's perfect for those lukewarm rides, providing just the right amount of warmth without the need for a heavier jacket. While it may not be ideal for freezing temperatures, it's a fantastic choice for cruising around in the 60s.One notable feature is its resistance to wrinkles. I usually take it out of the dryer promptly to hang, and this has minimized any issues with creasing. The color combination is outstanding, capturing that classic Harley vibe, and the corduroy adds a touch of rugged charm.Overall, the Legendary Whitetails Buck Camp Flannel has proven to be a great addition to my husband's wardrobe. It not only meets the style preferences of a Harley enthusiast but also serves its purpose in terms of comfort and versatility. It's a win-win, and my husband couldn't be happier with this thoughtful and stylish addition to his wardrobe.",

The only drawback to ordering the larger size is that these go down to almost my knees-- but that's okay if you are wearing a long Winter coat or are tucking them into your pants.These are comfy, durable, great Deep Winter shirts.",

I'd recommend this style, but if you are between sizes or like a more fitted look, size down. My boyfriend usually wears a large in all shirts and this was way, way too big. We hated to send it back, but will order a Medium in the future!",

Washed once and it is very soft and a warm shirt...not to heavy as to not be able to wear in the house without sweating. EXCELLENT quality, long enough he can wear it while riding his motorcycle and not have wind go up his backside...lol. Great armlength also...very nice looking and well constructed! Extremely impressed and he is picky when it comes to his clothes, so impressed I just ordered him another one in a different color!",

He finds the length and arms great for moving around. The weight of the material is just about right for flannel type shirts. The big boys won't sweat to death but keeps him warm enough that he doesn't need an extra layer. Over all the stitching is great and it's a quality product. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

The quality seems quite high, and I plan to enjoy it for years to come.",

It was very long on my boyfriend and the sleeves were also super long. He is usually a large in normal cotton t shirts and flannels. We are going to order a medium and see how that works. If you want oversized, go norma. But id size down if you want it to fit properly!",
