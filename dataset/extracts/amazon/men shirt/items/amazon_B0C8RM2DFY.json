                "reviewText": "I'm in my 40's but do lift regularly while also enjoying food and wine regularly. I wanted nice, soft t-shirts that were fitted up top without being skin-tight and clingy, but with a middle that was just a little relaxed so as to not cling to my less-than-washboard abs. These shirts fit the bill. Super soft, nice cut, they fit up top they way I wanted them to, they're a little relaxed below the chest, and they seem to be wearing well through wash and dry cycles. I haven't noticed any shrinking washing them medium hot and drying on low. You can get less expensive shirts, but I think there's good value to these from a price/quality perspective.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re scrolling through endless T-shirt options and wondering which one will change your life, stop right here. I stumbled upon this T-shirt brand, and let\u2019s just say my wardrobe (and love life) has never been the same.Every time I slip one of these shirts on, my girlfriend suddenly forgets the concept of personal space \u2013 it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been dipped in boyfriend catnip! I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the fabric or the fit, but she can\u2019t keep her hands off me. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ve bought so many, I\u2019m giving Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs a run for their money in the signature look department.But seriously, these tees are fantastic \u2013 comfortable, stylish, and apparently woven with some sort of irresistible charm thread. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your T-shirt game to \u2018tech mogul\u2019 level and score some extra cuddles, this is your brand. Five stars, would recommend if you\u2019re ready to be the center of attention (and affection)!",
