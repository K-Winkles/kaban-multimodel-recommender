                "reviewText": "Have to start with saying that these are some of the better shirts that I like, these are very cool on the body. What I like about these shirts is that you can wash them and on like cotton. They stay their size which is good for me cuz I'm a big boy. I've been using these guys for sublimation but there was a little bit of a learning curve being that the material is not as thick as cotton per se. Another thing I like about these shirts is the comfortability, The shirt stretch as you move which is kind of nice for my line of work but also for like kids. Soccer practice really nice as well. As far as value for money goes, I haven't been able to find anything cheaper than this unless you buy like in bulk.",

I have already used up the other shirts making bowling jerseys and didn\u2019t see the hole until it was too late. I contacted the seller asking to possibly replace just the 1 jersey. Overall, these are ok. Lightweight but thin. Reason for the 3 stars is because of the lack of response from the seller and these rather thin. Maybe the last time I order these. I\u2019ve had dry fit shirts before and they were at least thick enough where it wasn\u2019t see through but light enough to feel comfortable in.",
