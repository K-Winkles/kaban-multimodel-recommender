                "reviewText": "I was skeptical of this shirt at first, and when it arrived, it looked like it wouldn't smooth out like my cotton dress shirts. But after a quick tailor of the arms and a wash, it's become one of my favorite shirts. It fits great, it feels great, and it looks great. It doesn't flatten to a perfect smooth look, but it also isn't wrinkly (if that makes sense). It gives a professional look while also remaining a bit more casual. The material is also very comfortable. It fits very well too. I wear a pretty standard medium American T-shirt size, and this fits perfectly (US 40M). Don't mind my comment about the arm tailoring. There isn't a long sleeved shirt on the planet that fits my arms right out of the box.",

Amazon recommended a medium based on my previous orders but I had to return that because it was too tight around the shoulders and waist. I ordered a large and love the fit around the torso. The sleeves are too long but I don't mind because I roll them up anyways. The army green and sky blue are very nice. The grey blue looks amazing so I bought a second one because I wear it twice a week. My favorite shirt.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Quality/accuracy of dye varies",
                "reviewText": "The color of the shirt is described as grey/blue. Using a color corrected and calibrated monitor (used for digital photo processing in my work), the product photo appears with higher value, less chroma and with a hue that is much more blue. Shirt is much lower in value, more saturated (hgher chroma) and has a hue (color) that is much more on the grey side. In lay terms, the shirt I received is much more dark grey/purple than the grey/blue as shown. That being said, the color is ok, just not what I expected.Of greater significance is that the dye is lighter where the shirt was folded for packaging. So even if the fold creases are taken care of after washing and steaming to get out most wrinkles (I did not wash to check as I am returning this shirt immediately), I suspect that the dye lines will remain. I expect slight wrinkling with a linen textured shirt, but also expect a relatively uniform color or dye throughout the fabric without light lines indicating where the shirt was folded when packaged/shipped. I suspect this will not be a problem with the very light colors, but in the ordered shade, it makes the shirt look very cheap and presents a messy, unkept look.Size was good and fit was vey slightly tapered to fit but with nice room for comfort. As I did not wash the shirt since I am returning it, I cannot speak to the color fastness of the dye from experience. However, I suspect that since the dye is already slightly lighter in the creases, I would be very careful to hand wash separately several times especially with any of the darker colors.",

No wash instruction labels or makers name. Just a label, 55% linen 45% cotton. Fabric is medium light weight & softer than most linen blends. Construction quality & sewing is quite good. If they're real linen, time will tell.",
