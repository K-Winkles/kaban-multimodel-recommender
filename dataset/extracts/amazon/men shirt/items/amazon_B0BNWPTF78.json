The sleeves are also nice and long which I like in t-shirts.The material is soft and high quality, and the moonless night color is a beautiful almost black color.The Henley/buttons on this make it dressy enough that I can actually wear it in place of a dress shirt at times.Overall - it's a great shirt. If you like the style, you will love this shirt, and it has easily become my new favorite.",

This is a really nice shirt, the \"fossil\" color is really nice, it's a light light brown, hard to describe...fossil-like I suppose. The shirt fits well, and has three buttons at the top which you can unbutton if you want, they are not just for aesthetics. No complaints.",

The only real issue I had that after a wash it just doesn\u2019t look as nice so I ended up ironing it. I feel like I might try steam settings on my dryer next time to get it a bit more better looking. Other than that it\u2019s an awesome addition for summer outwear shirts for husband and it\u2019s really comfortable.",

It has a vintage (well worn) look to the material. Sizing is mostly accurate but is on the smaller side for a large. If you tend to fit between sizes I would recommend sizing up for a looser fit. But if you like a more form fitting shirt, stick with your main size.",

I think it's just another way of saying casual. But that's fine with me. I love the way this shirt looks, and it's very comfortable to wear. It goes well with many of the pants I will be wearing this summer. I noticed that it's also on sale right now, so if you like this shirt it would be a good time to buy it.",
