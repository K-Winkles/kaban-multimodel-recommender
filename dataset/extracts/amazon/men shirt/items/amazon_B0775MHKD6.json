                "reviewText": "I've worn a variety of button-up shirts over the years, from Prada to Carhartt, for different occasions \u2013 from operas to blue-collar work. Let me tell you this right now: this shirt can work for just about any occasion.What I love about it: the fit, feel, and durability. I lost a good amount of weight and needed to size down, I tried a few Amazon brands, and one black shirt really stood out. It's this model. I've had it for about a year, machine-washed and dried it regularly, and it still looks as good as new. I bought another one a couple months later. It's 100% cotton, which I love for its breathability, but it does wrinkle a bit. Usually it's a trade off in shirts, but again; AMAZING FEEL. It's fairly light so definitely layer up if it's cold; I wore a merino wool base layer underneath and holy guacamole was I comfortable! Although it is long sleeve, it might not keep you the warmest alone, but if you use it in the spring/summer, you're going to love it. When I used it for working on my dad's farm, I honestly didn't care about the wrinkles, but it was never terrible wrinkling. In fact, I got the sleeves hemmed and noticed the wringling on the sleeves is minimal compared to how it was prior, so be prepared to stop by the tailor if you're on the shorter side for that perfect fit (def worth it though). If you ever want to use it for an interview or something, this might not be ideal, but definitely can pass if you hang it in the shower to steam and can impress if you take the time to iron and starche it. I'm on the shorter side, so I usually rolled up the sleeves to avoid wrinkling prior to getting them altered.I'm 5'6\", and am just got the sleeves hemmed. I love this shirt so much I bought multiple. So it'll be nice having more colors in my wardrobe that are good quality and fit well. I'm a fan of the pocket too, even though I don't use it much.Now, here's the thing I don't like, and it's not what you'd expect. Have you ever heard of an expression, something along the lines of \"if you're not paying for it, someone else is\" in regards to fast fashion like Shein and such...It's the ethical aspect \u2013 I don't know who made this shirt or the conditions they worked in. I'm hoping the quality speaks for itself as this is far from the \"fast fashion\" quality you see in modern clothes nowadays. The price isn't terribly cheap...but still, it could be made by kids in the same environment as those old Nike documentaries. I've shifted to buying from countries where I know workers aren't exploited (such as in the USA or Japan). As one working man trying to build a better life for himself, I don't want to shop at the expense of someone else. I had a difficult time finding information, but I'm kind of in a tricky spot as I lost some weight and need something in my closet. But if you're looking for quality that lasts and looks good, this shirt delivers. Try one or two first, and if it feels great, go for it.I'm graduating university soon and hope to make more money where I can buy stuff 100% ethically, so don't think I'll be buying this again unless they make it very transparent where it's coming from. But for interviews or hardworking days when you need something sturdy, I highly recommend this; nothing comes close to bang for buck. If I find out it's ethically made, this will be my first choice for life indefinitely. This is the type of standard quality clothes that were originally held to decades ago.[update: all of my shirts say they're made in Vietnam. I feel it's a step above China and Bangladesh, and the fact that Amazon is putting its name on it, I'm hoping it's at least following stricter labor standards, as there are some good trends in Vietnam humanity speaking. Feel pretty good about buying from them :) Again, typically, I try to buy from the US or Japan, but since I'm on a budget, I am perfectly happy with this and can recommend it to anyone else! changing review to 5/5 stars!]",

They don't have collar stays. I would use these shirts for casual wear, but if you were to wear this at my job, which is a fine dining restaurant, they would. laugh at you. It looks terrible because it looks washed and faded. and just a little bit of oil on it or something and it stains..",
