                "reviewText": "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",

I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",

Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure.",
