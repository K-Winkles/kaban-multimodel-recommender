Unfortunately there was a slice in the back of the collar like someone caught it with a box knife. No problem, requested an exchange for exact same product. Just received the new shirt, that looks like IT was a return itself, it was wadded up into a clear bag, then into an amazon mailer both of which also had a huge slice. I take the shirt out and inspect it, doesn't look damaged but again it's been wadded up into a ball and on top of that it's a 5X. Tried another exchange and was given an error with only option being a refund. Disappointing because my husband likes the shirt.",

Put a tie on with this shirt and one can certainly wear it to the office or church.
