Staying true to the rich heritage \u2014 and authentic, all-American spirit \u2014 of denim, Lucky Brand began crafting great-fitting, vintage-inspired jeans in Los Angeles in 1990. We gave them their distinctively Lucky look by literally putting them through the wringer \u2014 ripping, fraying, sanding, patching and washing by hand \u2014 to give them true character and soul. Then, we added authentic hardware, personalized touches and playful details, and an American legend was born.",

Great purchase.I'm 6'1, 215 with what clothing companies would call an \"Athletic build,\" Meaning I'm a big guy with broad shoulders, but not significantly overweight (maybe 10 pounds over, which for my body type isn't very much.) Most T-shirts for around $20 don't fit me very well. XL is usually too big, hanging like curtains below my shoulders. And L is generally right on the edge for me. If I'm 10 pounds over my normal, as I am right now (and likely will be for the foreseeable future), a size Large will be too tight across my chest.The wrong fit can really make me look bad by adding perceived weight, while the right fit usually brings a lot of \"Hey, did you lose weight?\" questions.These shirts, in an XL are perfect for me. Big enough to fit my shoulders, tapering a little bit in across my 'not bad' torso. Well worth the extra money. Love them.",

                "reviewText": "These shirts are a great alternative to men's T-shirts. They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It's a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you'd think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the \"white\" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time. Several of my male friends have pretty much abandoned their old t-shirts in favor of a collection of the Venice Burn-out shirts. I sure I'll be buying more of them!",

(Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn\u2019t get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you\u2019re in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or \u201cpile\u201d up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one! You\u2019ll love it.True to size. Good length. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d 210, about a 40cm bicep. Sleeves are slightly snug on my arms for a nice look.",
