                "reviewText": "Update: Feb 13th, 2023I decided to order a Medium in the color Caviar. It arrived the following day. The color is true to the product photo. I was surprised to see the inside label was different, there was no small, red Wrangler label on the lower side seam, and the price tag was different-noteably missing the \u201cRelaxed Fit\u201d text that was on the size Large. I slipped it on and it fits PERFECTLY. I took it off and laid it on top of the Large to see where the dimensions actually differ. The length of the seam from the collar to the shoulder is the same. The length of the seam from the armpit to the hem of the shirt is the same. The length of the sleeves is the same. The difference is the sleeves are about 2-3 inches more fitting and the body is about 4-5 inches more fitting. I ordered a second one in medium to see if this was a fluke. It arrived the following day. The labels and the fit are the same as the Caviar Medium, but the colors are WAY off, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good looking shirt. The product photo shows a dark blue, a light blue and white. This shirt is MIDNIGHT blue (almost black) and white, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a very abrupt contrast and I don\u2019t personally like it. Maybe it will grow on me. I\u2019ve re ordered first pattern I ordered in a medium now and for whatever reason, it\u2019s delivery is expected 3 weeks from now. We\u2019ll have to wait to see if it\u2019s the same as these mediums or it\u2019s a \u201crelaxed fit\u201d like the Large I got that took three weeks to arrive.Initial impressions: Feb. 7th, 2023For sizing purposes, I'm a fit 220lbs, 6'0\" tall, and wear size large shirts and 34/34 pants. I ordered a size Large on Jan. 22nd. I am a Prime member. The order was fulfilled by Amazon. The order didn't ship until Feb. 6th and it arrived Feb. 7th. Not sure what the hold up on delivery was since it was obviously shipped from a local fulfillment center to arrive in one day. Fortunately the shirt is worth the wait. As described, the shirt is made of heavy-weight fleece. It's obviously going to be lighter than the Wrangler Sherpa-lined shirts and jackets, but it is still a heavy-weight shirt. I would say the fit is relaxed. It fits perfect across the shoulders but it has a lot of room in the waist for me. It does have side pockets, but they are sewn into the side hem which is somewhat awkward as most lower pockets (at least on jackets) are oriented toward the front of the body. It's also fairly long and the sleeves are a good length. It has two sewn on tags that both say Wrangler. It also had the original $16.99 price tag attached. Inflation-what are ya gunna do? Anyway, great shirt. Would recommend.",
