                "reviewText": "Ordered two of these shirts. Same shirt, same size just different colors. Unpacked and inspected them and found some obvious differences in the details between the two. One has a pen access on the left pocket the other doesn't. One has two buttons at the cuff the other doesn't. One has a small button on the midpoint of the sleeve opening the other doesn't. None of these things is any big deal just struck me as odd. Either is acceptable so I'm keeping them both. My go to shirts have been LLBean sun washed canvas for many years but they've gotten out of my price bracket. These shirts are what I would call a medium weight fabric. Not thin like a regular cotton dress shirt but not heavy like a traditional chambray fabric. Seems like a good medium weight for most year round use. I'm 5' 10\", 150# and they (both) are a perfect fit. Not too baggy but still with plenty of room to move. The tails are nice and long and will stay tucked in. The sleeve length, neck and overall fit is perfect for me. My regular sleeve length in a good quality dress shirt is 32-33 and I would say the mediums that I ordered fall right in this range.",

                "reviewText": "Bought 6 shirts in total. 2x burnt olive, 2x Grey (not dark grey), 2x blue light chambray. All of which turned out great and continue to be great nearly half a year later. The fit is more of a looser fit (little more baggy in the sleeves than typical off the shelf shirts). as a slim 6ft tall 160 lbs dude the medium fit me best, but i also always pinch the seems of the torso a bit by sewing 1 inch on each side. So the fit around the torso becomes a little more conforming (but that's every button up/down shirt i buy). In my opinion the material felt comfortable enough to wear in the summer (high humidity between mid 80s and low 90s *Fahrenheit* felt comfortable enough to me with the shirt and a tee underneath) Due to it's more loose fitting nature it is easy to layer stuff under, so it fits the year round needs/wants for me. Had no issues with the shirts in regards to any fraying, fading, or shrinking from the washer and dryer (cold washes and low heat drying) The shirts seem to be quite wrinkle resistant. I haven't had any spots needing any ironing by any means at any point. I've always had the problem of having the sleeves either not be long enough or simply gradually shortened from washes, but these haven't seen that problem yet (half a year later).",

For some reason, however, this shirt did not have a slit at the top of the left pocket for pen/pencil, which was a feature I specifically sought. The other 4 did have it. Fabric is a bit too coarse to be wrinkle free, especially if hung to dry. Overall, though, great shirt; comfortable, and nice looking enough that it can be worn for board meetings, or general maintenance tasks around our facilities. I will order more of these.",

                "reviewText": "So I'm sitting here contemplating the dermatologist's orders (rather standard, but in these parts standardly ignored) that every square inch of skin must be covered up when one is out of doors here in lovely uptown Arizona.Well, in a country where most women decline to wear burqas, that's not very practical advice... Oh well. Then I remembered: the chambray shirt!Whoa! Literally... Back in the day, when we had a ranch and I used to ride a horse around the boondocks at every possible chance, Phoenix used to host a store called Yellow Front. An odd emporium, it had features of a general store, a Sportsman's Warehouse, and a blue-collar worker's supply. I bought a pair of saddlebags for Babe there -- very handy! And jeans and bandannas and fishing gear and a felt-covered canteen and...all sorts of cool stuff.One of the cool things you could get there were men's blue chambray work shirts. They were cotton plus some kind of synthetic, as I recall -- so you didn't have to iron the damn things, the way you had to iron your daddy's khaki shirts once a week. And they were the bidness! Loose-fitting even in the smallest men's size (which was the only size that would even remotely fit a 120-pound woman), they let air flow all around you (if you left the tails untucked) and so, much like an Arab's white robes, would keep you cool on a warm day by blocking the direct sun while creating a kind of natural air-conditioning.Yellow Front, like all things American and Good, is long gone. In the past I've looked for the things at joints like Target and Walmart and found them...disappeared. Hmmm... chambray chAMbray chAMAZONbray! Why the heck not?Off to the Web! Look it up, and lo! Wrangler still makes them!!! And Amazon has got them!HOT diggety DAYum!Order one up. Late this morning, stroll out to the front courtyard to imbibe the remains of the day's coffee, and lo! There's a package from Amazon. Grab. Rip open. And lo! There's a good old chambray shirt.This one's fabric is a little heavier gauge than the ones I recall. It's 100% cotton. And instead of being made somewhere in New England or the Midwest, it's fabriqu\u00e9 in Bangladesh, which is too bad. Shame on Wrangler! Still...at least they're still making them and shipping them to...Amazon. Yeah.And the \"small\" size does still fit. A little long in the arms, which as I recall was the case with the original. I used to roll up the sleeves, aping a handsome young man whose style I admired. For an old lady's purposes, though, this is...umh, handy, because when left to their own whim, the cuffs slide down past your wrists and cover about half the back of your hand, thereby protecting the supposedly precancerous area from the dreaded sun.This kind of shirt makes a great lounge-around-the-house cover-up when the weather's cold, too. I don't run the heat in the winter -- saving the power then makes it marginally affordable to run the air conditioning in the summertime. So what's needed here at the Funny Farm is something to keep off the chill that can be run through the washer and is not too fancy to wear while gardening and cleaning the pool and scrubbing down the kitchen and is sturdy enough to hold up to said activities. For the summer: all of the above, except substitute \"keep off the sun\" for the first desideratum.Just the ticket.Heh. Wrangler. I used to wear Wranglers jeans. That was SO outr\u00e9! Lawyers' wives did not wear Wranglers. No, nooo, dear, it was just not done! At the worst, you could wear Levis, but even that...tsk tsk. If it cost less than $50, it was just...no.Well, being the sassy little broad that I was, of course I wore Wranglers, because the things fit. Levis do not fit a 120-pound woman with a 130-pound rear-end. :-D Do not now, did not then, never will. Wranglers would fit real women, and they fit women who were given to riding horses. Not only could you breathe in the things, you could swing your leg up over a saddle and push yourself clear of a horse that was going down or trying to throw you. Not only did I wear the things, I wore them to teach in graduate school. So there!Think I'll order up a few more of these fine garments. Now...if only I could get ahold of another mare...",

                "reviewText": "My husband has decided he has a thing for denim shirts. So this year in the cold season I ordered a few denim shirts for him. And this was one of them. I ordered it in black \u2013 since he loves wearing black shirts. We were both surprised at how coarse and odd feeling the fabric is, but the wrinkling is minimal when washing and drying. It had no shrinkage as far as either he or I could tell. I had planned on ironing it after the last washing and he grabbed it off the hanger before I could do it. And it actually looked decent . I was pleased about that, because who wants to spend their life ironing?The fit is very nice. my husband has a barrel chest so finding shirts sometimes that will button across the chest and still feel comfortable can be a challenge. This particular shirt does fit the way he likes, looks very nice. And it washes and dries very nicely, and as I said, before, no shrinkage.",
