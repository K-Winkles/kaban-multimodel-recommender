If you need a XL order and L and so on. They really are about one size too big.",

I found that to not be true. So, the shirt for my son ended up being my husband's and I had to order another one for my son. They are pretty true to size, and were a nice buy. Even if the fish aren't biting, I'm sure my boys will all look stylish while fishing in these shirts this summer!!!",

The shirts do tend to run big so I purchased my XL husband a L & it is perfect! These shirts are perfect for fishing, but nice enough to be worn out to earn or dress it up with a pair of khakis. I bought a total of 5 in different colors!",

My wife washed the shirt then hung it to dry, skipping the dryer and the shirt isn't grossly wrinkled. As a workshirt, it's just fine that way without ironing. There was no shrinkage after washing ... we wash in cold water. I usually wear size large unless a shirt is cut big, then I wear medium. I ordered this shirt in medium and it fits very loose on me. I recommend you order one size smaller than you usually wear with these as they are cut big.",

This a great shirt you're outside in the heat, but if you are going to be driving for a long period of time, wear something else. The mesh can be a bit uncomfortable if it's pressed against your back for a long period of time.",
