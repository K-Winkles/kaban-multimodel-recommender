But I wear mine when it is in the mid 40s Fahrenheit. With a good thermo base layer it works (for me) in the low 40s. I like mine so much I purchased a second one in the more faded color. If you are from a warmer climate you might want to wear this hoodie in the upper 40s low 50s Fahrenheit. Amazon offers some pretty good (brand name) Parkas as well. I hope this helps",
