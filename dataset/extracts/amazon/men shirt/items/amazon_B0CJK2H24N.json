                "reviewText": "Size and Fit (1/5): The main issue with this product is its sizing. While I ordered a medium, the actual size of the item I received was excessively large. It was so oversized that it felt more like an extra-large or even larger. This is a significant concern because the fit is a crucial aspect of clothing.Material and Build (3/5): The material and build of the item seem average. The quality of the fabric is decent, and the stitching looks durable enough for regular use. However, the sizing issue overshadows these aspects as the item is not wearable due to its disproportionate size.Overall Experience (2/5): My overall experience with this purchase has been underwhelming. It's frustrating when you order your usual size and receive something that is far from what you expected. This inconsistency in sizing could be a hassle, especially for online shoppers who rely on size charts and standard sizing.Advice to Buyers (2/5): If you're considering purchasing this item, I'd recommend being very cautious about the size. You might need to order a size smaller than your usual, but even then, there's no guarantee it will fit as expected.Overall (2/5): Unfortunately, I have to give this product a low rating due to the major sizing issue. The quality may be acceptable, but the fit is a critical aspect of clothing, and this product fails significantly in this regard.",
