It has a really flattering fit and looks good enough to wear any time, not just hiking. He wore it to Easter with the family and got compliments. The sleeves actually come to the right spot on his wrists and can be rolled up if he wants to. He usually has to roll up sleeves just to make them look right because they never reach his wrists.The shirt keeps him cool and but doesn't look boxy like a lot of other camping shirts. He hasn't experienced any humidity in it yet, but we're planning on taking it to Orlando for a WDW visit later this year. It definitely works well in the Rocky Mountains.",

                "reviewText": "I have several shirts from the ATG line including a few long sleave and several short sleave versions. I really like these shirts because they are comfortable and can be worn casually or professionally. This is my second shirt of this model, one recently purchased and the other from a couple years ago. The quality of the recent purchase is a little disappointing. The fabric doesn't feel to the same level (doesn't have cotton like the other ATG shirts), the fit is a little off (tighter in the arms and pits), and for some reason the buttons are plastic instead metal like my other ATG shirts. Seems silly because buttons can't save more than a few pennies in cost. But, overall, the shirt is still good, but not to the level it should be.",

                "reviewText": "I got this shirt for backpacking to replace synthetic t-shirts I've typically worn. I've hiked about 150 miles in it so far and love the versatility of long sleeves and roll-up option, along with an ability to unbutton the front to increase ventilation. The shirt dries very quickly, typically within minutes of taking my pack off. I like that this shirt has more discrete chest pockets than other companies/models and the plaid style is more unique than standard solid print shirts. The build quality is decent, with some loose threads, but I think the shirt is great inexpensive option for anyone experimenting with your gear and wanting to try out a long-sleeve without breaking the bank! One feature to note is that the sleeve attachments leave the cuffed sleeve on your forearm, as opposed to above the elbow in other shirts.",
