                "reviewText": "I am a black male, 6\u20193\u201d and about 208lbs. I am pretty lean in build. I have decent arm size but they\u2019re not bulky. I ordered 3 shirts size 15 1/2, 34/35 (White, Almond and Sundew). For the price, these shirts are okay. Just okay. The almond was the most opaque of the 3. The sundew and white were pretty see-through, but that\u2019s kind of normal to me for lighter colored shirts. I tried on a thicker white dress shirt I own and could still see my white undershirt, but less than the one I purchased here.Honestly, I think these land somewhere in between regular and slim fit\u2014as they\u2019re not quite as baggy as regular fit, but not quite slim fit either. I decided to keep them because I plan to wear them underneath a suit most of the time so the transparency isn\u2019t a big issue to me. Plus since my skin is darker, it\u2019s somewhat normal to me to see my skin through the shirt depending on the shirt color. The rest of the fit is good\u2014neck size is perfect and the shirt rests nicely on my body.A decent low budget buy.",
