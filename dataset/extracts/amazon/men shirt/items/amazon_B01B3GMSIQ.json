I was especially glad to find that the XL has a generous sleeve length! I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d with long arms and torso and often have to buy a 2XL for the extra length, even though it ends up loose/baggy around my middle\u2014not so with this shirt; the XL sleeves are between 36-37\u201d in length and don\u2019t ride up on me, even after washing. Awesome!The cut of the shirt is not great (fairly shapeless, really) but I guess that makes it work better for more body types; it will be fine for bumming around the house or layering under another shirt this winter.",
