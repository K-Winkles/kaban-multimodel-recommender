These athletic men's polo shirts strike a good balance between style and functionality.Performance:One of the standout features of these polos is their quick-dry technology. Playing golf under the summer sun can be quite sweaty, but these shirts wick away moisture efficiently, keeping you dry and comfortable. The lightweight fabric is breathable, allowing for unrestricted movement during your swing.Design:The design is sleek and modern, making these polos not only suitable for the golf course but also for casual outings. The slim fit gives them a stylish edge, and the variety of available colors allows you to express your personal style.Durability:So far, the BALENNZ Golf Polos have held up well to regular wear and washing. The stitching is solid, and the fabric retains its shape and color even after several rounds of golf.Comfort:The soft and stretchy fabric feels great against the skin, and the shirts provide ample room for movement. The collar sits nicely, and the buttoned placket adds a touch of sophistication.",

I ordered one in a small to see if I like the fit, and it fit exactly the way I wanted. I am a male 5\u201910, 155 pounds with a muscular/athletic build. Personally I was looking for something not too tight but not very loose. Just something tight enough to show off my chest and arm definition but not so tight to where it restricts movement. It meets all those criteria. It also very breathable and light weight but not extremely thin. It\u2019s just the right thickness. It has a decent feel and durability to it so it doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019ll fall apart. The only thing I can\u2019t say for sure is how it\u2019ll hold up after a wash but because of the material it\u2019s made out of I don\u2019t see it shrinking or falling apart. I\u2019m for sure going to cop the 7 pack.",

Like most overweight males I carry the majority of that weight over my stomach yet these shirts are NOT tight at all. Zero wrinkling and (this one shocked me), I spilled coffee all down the front of me RIGHT out of the laundry. I literally could see no trace of it when I wiped it dry. Clearly, this material also resists absorption of liquids. Very impressed!HOWEVERThis is also the type of material you have to be EXTRA careful not to catch on anything the least bit sharp, as they snag VERY easily. Still - I easily give this 5 stars and would give it more, if I could.",
