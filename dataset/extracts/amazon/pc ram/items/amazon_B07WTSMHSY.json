Skill Trident Z Neo 3600 MHz DDR4 Memory (this)Sapphire Radeon Pulse 5700XT Video CardSamsung EVO 1TB SSD (OS drive)Seagate 2TB SSHD (Data)Seagate 5TB HD (Backup/more data)This system is a true beast, with some BIOS tweaks I am hitting 4.6 Ghz boost clocks and it chews through all my software and games.32 GB of memory is a bit overkill with 16 GB being the sweet spot currently, but I was running 32 GB with my old system so figured I would keep the memory at the same level.This memory performs perfect, is very fast, looks great, and is highly recommended. I have used G. Skill memory for about 8 years now and always get it for my PC builds. I can give this a no-brainer \"get this\" if you need memory for a Ryzen build. It works at advertised speeds and even allows tighter timings if you so desire. The one thing that is wrong in the specs is it is Hynix memory, not Samsung. In the pictures you will see my CPU-Z results and information.",

I am running this on an Asus Tuf gaming plus wifi with AMD Ryzen 5 3600 x stock settings with xmp set.No issues other than user error, I did not push one of the sticks all the way in so it only showed 1 stick in bios.The set I purchased is cl18 with Hynix a-die for anyone who is interested.I am not sure on overclocking I am in the process of learning about clocking. I would have purchased the cl16 kit had I found it on Amazon but thats ok.Overall I am pleased.",

I originally bought 2 sticks for 32gb a couple years ago, and recently bought 2 more sticks to upgrade my system to 64GB. Setting up the first 2 sticks was a little confusing just because I did not understand the \"profiles\" thing in my BIOS. When I got the extra 2 sticks though, no additional setup was needed, so it was seamless.",
