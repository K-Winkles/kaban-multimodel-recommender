Big benefit is that you can now use it in your laptop or desktop whenever you wish.This issue I only had was that one of the RAM sticks had a bent prong that holds the laptop RAM in place. I just bent it a little to make it accessible to insert and hold the laptop RAM.Other than that, the devices worked fine for me. I had purchased 2 of them so that I can use them a spare desktop motherboard that I'm going to use for a side project. Hopefully this will help me out in the long run.Remember, everything has a way of being used in another way. Especially with something like this.",
