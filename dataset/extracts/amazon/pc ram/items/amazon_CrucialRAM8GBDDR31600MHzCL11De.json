                "reviewText": "I have never witnessed the awesome performance upgrade that adding additional RAM to a PC can provide. Just WOW! The internet is becoming far more advanced with each passing day, and because of this simple, low memory tasks of that past are no more. Mostly everything requires lots of RAM, so if you only have 8GB of RAM you know the pain...So, after pulling my last hair out waiting for Google Chrome to load a webpage I decided to finally see if my PC was able to upgrade the RAM. Sho nuf!! I had 8GB installed and was expandable to 16GB so the decision was a no brainer. First of all, I couldn't believe how cheap RAM was...I was expecting to pay an arm and a leg for some reason...Anyway, if you have working fingers and are able to unscrew screws then you can do this, it's that simple! I managed my way inside my PC and popped out the two child's play 4GB RAM and stuck in the two brand new 8GB sticks giving me 16 total GB. My PC absolutely FLIES now!! I'm so mad I didn't do this earlier. It was so easy, so cheap, and the instant performance is unreal. Once you get the RAM installed in their slot, there is nothing else to do the PC software instantly recognizes the new RAM and takes over from there. I can't recommend doing RAM upgrade, especially for us lowly 8GB RAM plebes. Just do it, do it! Upgrade *if possible* and thank me later!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to upgrade our older Lenovo desktop from its standard 4 Gigs of ram.Crucial's tool for recommending memory upgrades got me the part number. Ipurchased this module via Amazon Marketing. Delivery was reasonable afterthe order was confirmed. The part appears to be new as other posters havewrote that end of life computer memory is often pulled out of computers.Installation was reasonably easy. Windows 10 recognized the memory and itappears that the pc is running a bit faster. I am holding the original 4 Gigs ofram as a fall-back. Thought about seeing if it would work along with the newram, but I don't think it will improve performance much more. Thanks Amazon.",
