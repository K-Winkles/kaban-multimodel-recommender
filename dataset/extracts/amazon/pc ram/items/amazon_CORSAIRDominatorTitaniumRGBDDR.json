                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently made a significant RAM upgrade for my ASUS z790 Hero motherboard, switching from 2 sticks of Corsair Dominator 32GB 6200 RAM to the Corsair Titanium 64GB 6400 RAM \u2013 and the results have been nothing short of amazing!First and foremost, the installation was a breeze. I popped all four sticks into the motherboard, and they were recognized immediately. The memory retrained effortlessly, and I was up and running at the full 6400MHz right out of the box. No hassles, no headaches \u2013 just plug and play. Corsair really hit the mark with this one!The performance boost has been substantial. Everything from gaming to multitasking has seen a noticeable improvement. Running memory-intensive applications is a breeze, and I no longer experience any slowdowns or lag. The Corsair Titanium RAM has made my computing experience smoother and more efficient than ever before.What's even more impressive is that everyone has heard about the horror stories of running quad-channel RAM and XMP profiles having issues, but not with these sticks. They have been rock solid from day one, and I haven't encountered a single hiccup. It's reassuring to know that I made the right choice with Corsair.Aside from the incredible performance, these sticks also look fantastic with their sleek design and built-in RGB lighting. It's a small touch, but it adds a lot to the overall aesthetics of my setup.Corsair has always been a trusted brand for me, and this product reaffirms why. The quality and reliability are top-notch, and I couldn't be happier with this RAM upgrade. It's a definite game-changer for anyone looking to boost their PC's performance without any hassle.In conclusion, if you're in the market for high-performance RAM that delivers as promised, the Corsair Titanium 64GB 6400 RAM is the way to go. Easy installation, blazing fast speeds, and Corsair's reputation for quality make this a winning choice. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "These sticks look nice and I was able to get them working with their stock EXPO/XMP profile (the 6400MHz one, not the 6600MHz one) on my Asus X670E ProArt motherboard (BIOS 0805, anything newer fails to POST with non-JEDEC speeds for me) & 7950X. I was actually pretty surprised it managed over 6000MHz. As for the DIMMS, they look nice, the RGB customization seems very good (lots of effects, very bright but can be dimmed, and easy to use). My only complaints/ warnings is that they are tall. They might interfere with your cooler or at the very least, block the fan a bit. I'm not super concerned with my U14S, but a dual tower cooler might have issues. I've included a comparison with a much lower profile set of DDR5.",
