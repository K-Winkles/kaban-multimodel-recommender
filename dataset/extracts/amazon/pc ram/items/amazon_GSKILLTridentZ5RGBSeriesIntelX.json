                "reviewText": "I had first purchased the 6600 kit. It did not go well with my asus z690-e. Had issues with bluescreen, several blue screen errors. No matter the xmp profile, I had just issues. Sure was a fault kit since I was able to boot and pass memtest86 using my brother's corsair 6600 kit. So I decided to try again but, in this case, the 6400 cl32. Installed the kits, cleared cmos, booted in bios, choose xmp2 and boom, working perfect in my system. Passed twice memtest86, no more bluescreen and the system is stable as it can be. I see a lot of people saying DDR5 is requieres fine tweek and bla bla bla. Fake. If you kit is under the memory compatibility list from MB manufacturer, it should work just fine with xmp1 or xmp2. If you are having issues like blue screen, failed memtest86 you have either fault kit or fault MB. Also always remember to have latest BIOS, firmware and chipset drivers.",

I was able to clock to 6800 Mhz on a i9-13900K with timings of CL34-45-45-108 and 1.40V. Anything higher resulted in unstable behavior and errors while running test on an ASUS Z690-E Gaming board with BIOS 2305.Ran Linpack Extreme and Cinebench test for a few hours with no issues or errors at 6800, however these modules do run a little warmer than I like around 45C+ when overclocked. At 7000+ speeds, my system would boot but memory test would fail with errors on each test run.Overall, I am extremely happy with G.Skill memory and value. I wished they made these modules with the TridentZ Royal heatsink.",
