Packaging was as expected for memory: a well-fitting plastic case that held the stick securely in place. Plug and play installation worked exactly as it should.I don\u2019t normally use single sticks of memory in a setup - I was taught it\u2019s always better to use paired for best performance, but this came as a solo stick and seems OK. I always have the option of buying a second stick to go with the one I have (or, ultimately, replacing with an exactly paired two stick kit).
