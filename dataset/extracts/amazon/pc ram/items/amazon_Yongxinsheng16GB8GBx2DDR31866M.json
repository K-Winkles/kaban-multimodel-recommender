It allows your computer system to load programs faster, increase responsiveness and run data-intensive programs with ease. Allowing for increased multitasking Having multiple apps or programs open can slow down your system as each competes for a limited amount of memory resources. By adding extra computer memory, not only are you extending the lifetime of the machine, you're increasing your computer multitasking capabilities. Easy Installation (Plug N Play) There is no configuration, no sitting around waiting to update and backup document. You can upgrade your laptop system within a few minutes with a simple screwdriver.",

                "reviewText": "So I was sitting here with an 8 year old HP desktop and pondering a full upgrade. I was running Windows 8, and the stock configuration which included an HHD and 8GB of DDR3 ram. Instead of splurging and spending $500+ for anything decent and new, I decided to do 3 things. 1. Got a free upgrade to Windows 10 which I didn't even realize I could do. 2. Upgraded the hard drive from an HHD to a Samsung SSD. And then 3. Upgraded the ram from 8gb to 32gb of this. And yeah, I think I'm all set for AT LEAST a year, if not more. My computer runs like a dream, it boots up extremely quickly and the lag is gone when I toggle between sites or add new tabs. I don't play any games, but I do often have 10+ tabs open in Chrome with spreadsheets and other things like that. Installation is a breeze, I simply popped out the old RAM and put this in. It took about 5 minutes total. You unscrew the computer case, swap RAM, and you're done. No setup needed at all, the computer recognized it and I was all set. I did have one instance, and only one, where I was toggling between tabs and the computer totally froze up. I just did a hard reboot and it was fine, nothing lost etc. Since I use the computer daily that's pretty good. Make sure your system can handle this RAM but otherwise no sweat, just buy it and enjoy.Looking back, instead of spending $500-1k+ on new hardware, I spend $0 for windows upgrade, and around $65 each for the SSD and 32GB RAM. So about $130 will buy me at least a year if not multiple more years of what I need. A great deal, and by the time I finally do upgrade my hardware (now I'm maxed on RAM since this machine only can handle 32 GB) things will be much more advanced and who knows how much faster and better things will be. Anyway, just buy this RAM, pop it in, and you're good to go. A great value. I would also highly recommend upgrading to a SSD hard drive (my samsung works well) if you have an older machine running an HHD.",

                "reviewText": "My son was complaining about Fortnight freezing up, then the computer started BSODing (Blue Screen of Death) after startup, and would go into a reboot loop after signing in. Every time it would BSOD it would give a DIFFERENT error as to why it was crashing. At first, I thought it was the hard drive I just got from the month before, but after scanning the hard drive for system errors and viruses, I moved on to the next culprit - an NVIDIA driver update (I still haven't ruled that out), but then I went through the DELL system diagnostics partition on the hard drive, and it said that of the four memory modules I had installed (which two were 8GB chips and two were 4GB chips) it was only reading 20GB. The diagnostics determined that I had one bad RAM chip. I decided to replace all four RAMs, since one of the remaining good ones was a lower MHz reading - cant remember right now, it was like a 1200 MHz, while the other two were 1600 MHz. Anyway, for around $50, I was able to replace all four RAM sticks and boost the computer to its intended 32GB, which I verified after start up and running System Information. Me and my son played Fortnight for a good 2 hours, one day, and BeamNG the next day for another 2 hours. He was bragging that his game loaded faster than mine. ,but then again, he has a desktop with a 1080TI gpu, a now fully working 32 GB RAM, and a 650w psu, while I have a laptop with a 1060 and only 8GB RAM. After a couple of days, the RAM seems to be doing great. My 10 year old was able to install one of the RAMs himself. There have been no BSDs or freezing in any of the games since the installation of the memory. I like how the memor is sheilded. This is a good product for the time we have been using it.",

I can't enable XMP unfortunately to verify that, but I'm quite confident that will work. The heat spreader makes this RAM look and feel far nicer than you'd expect too which is always nice. I've attached a screenshot of CPU-Z showing the timings, again nothing blazingly fast, but plenty enough for a mid range gaming CPU or a light workstation rig like I've installed in. Uses SK Hynix chips too, so the underlying memory chips are a good quality brand, I'd be very confident in the longevity.",
