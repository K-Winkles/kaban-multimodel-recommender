Forget a stress test, also you can't even complete a memtest with xmp enabled either. It's just junk.Currently waiting on gskills support to respond to my first inquiry but as I haven't even received anything back after sending a support ticket, I doubt that will go anywhere.Honestly just completely disappointed with this whole scenario. When gskills support fails to fix this issue with correct parameters or sending me a replacement I'm most likely going to just refund this back to Amazon.",
