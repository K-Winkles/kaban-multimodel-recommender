Things are snappy again and games saw 30-40 % improvement over a clarkdale 870 4/8 intel 8gb ram with RX 480.Who cares about systems. Does it work? YES. Is it affordable? YES. Is it 16fb of RAM @3200mhz with XMP enabled? YES. Default to 1.35v from 1.20 @ stock speed ? YES. Should you buy it? If you need 2x8gb kit of ddr4 ram woth room to grow assuming you have 4 dimm slots. YES.Simply unbeatable value for half the price other 16fb kits are going for from the big boys in ram.Only thing I didn\u2019t do was check to see the ram module manufacturer. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Samsung or some other A grade vendor.Will end up buying another for 32gb before it goes up and ddr5 or some other memory upgrade comes out.Sweet spot for speed and performance for AMD I believe.",

The computer is stable and the memory clears the new HUGE heatsync I also upgraded to so something to keep in mind if anyone is thinking of adding a overkill large air cooler to their system. Also the price on these has dropped 20 bucks since I got my sticks so they are very reasonably pricedtoo.",

I shopped around a bit and found this, the price was right so I bought it. I have had no crashes or reported error with the RAM, so it's doing what it should and I'm pleased with it.Silly PC still won't brew coffee for me, sigh :)",
