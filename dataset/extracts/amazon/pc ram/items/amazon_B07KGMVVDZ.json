Now I notice that I don't have many issues with it hitching up and slowing down and a much better computing experience. I might even add another 16 GB at some point to get it to 24 GB or buy two RAM modules to take it to full 32 GB which is the system limitations. Easy to install though the computer is a bit of a problem with limited space being a small form factor desktop. However, that isn't a problem with this RAM just a computer manufacturer issue in that they don't give you enough space to easily access the RAM. Great little product and really affordable.",

Now the dislike was the shipping it both my fault and shipment that it did not reach it destination about 11 days late. I should of add a note on the paper with my number and office information. Then the shipment fault that it did not came into the working time. again, it was both errors. but the result was it came in perfectly, fit in my desktop, and it did made changes to my desktop to go faster, but the memory did not improve. at least I upgrade the desktop and function very well.",
