                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very good RAM. I recommend.",
                "reviewText": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.I recommend.I ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.At the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.Other than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.On the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.Other than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.It is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.This Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.MSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.Running Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.I am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.The board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.I recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a non-rgb SFF build on a 12 series Intel system.The product arrived very quickly and packaged nice for safe transport.I needed lower profile memory for a SFF build and decided to try this memory out. I have seen it recommended by PC builders for the last few years and decided it must be sufficient.I have been using this memory now for a couple months and am completely satisfied with the performance, reliability, and the great value compared to other big name brands. It is not that bad looking as well.Performance wise, it is on par with any other memory with the same MHZ and timings. It also overclocks nicely if that's still your thing.I would definitely recommend this to others",

In Apex Legends, what I most play, I got a boost of about 15fps from 150 to 165fps avg. Clearly I was bottlenecked by my ram and this upgrade really helped",

Now, I decided to give my 1st Gen Ryzen build an upgraded (R7 1700 to R5 5600X, Vega 56 to RX 6800XT and 16GB RAM to 32GB), and gave Teamgroup another chance... I was pleasantly surprised! Not only did it ran perfectly out of the box, XMP worked right away and I was even able to tighten the timings a little from CL16-20-20-40 to CL16-18-18-38 without any issues even after some stress testing.",
