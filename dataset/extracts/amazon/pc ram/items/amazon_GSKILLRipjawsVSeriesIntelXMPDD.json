Proceeded to update all drivers on new W11 install, nothin. I thought maybe maybe the power supply wasn't up to snuff, then I ran mem test. Immediate mem errors.Moved the sticks from slots 1,2 to slots 3,4 and wham, no errors, crashes, bsod's. ( or maybe I moved it from 3,4 to 1,2) Either way, that fixed the issue. Mem tested with zero errors after moving the sticks, and been running flawless for almost a week. Gonna buy two more 32G sticks.Hope this helps.",

So i sought a new kit and settled on this kit, Ripjaws 64GB 3600mhz and could only be happier if i had more of it!XMP worked flawlessly to get this RAM up to speed on my motherboard and it survived several nights of memory testing to validate stability. The performance boost from running RAM that is 60% faster than my last kit, and lets me run the Infinity Fabric on my Ryzen 9 5950x also 60% faster, has been quite a surprise to my minimum frame rates in games. But more importantly, has speed up software compiling significantly, light baking, and build compiling in unreal engine. The bump to 64GB\u2019s from 32 has also has helped a lot with dealing with Houdini and Unreal Engine 5\u2019s penchant for eating RAM. Its been so nice to have stable and fast RAM again!I would highly recommend this kit to any Zen 3 Ryzen build!\u2014\u2014\u2014-Update a year later and the kit is still running flawlessly! Picture is from the setup it is used in, a DR. Zaber Sentry 2.0.",

                "reviewText": "What bothered me about this item the most is that it was poorly packaged and can be left out there in the freezing cold/blistering heat and that may affect its performance once u install it. The original packaging is the type that u can open and close anytime so I would not classify it as Sealed. The RAM sticks are secured inside the packaging but it can be resold as supposedly \"New\". The only thing I felt good about it is that the stickers on the RAM told me they were manufactured in October 2021, and I bought them in November 2021 but even then that doesn't guarantee anything, so u have to kind of just believe that ur not being taken for a fool. After thinking that I broke my computer because I did the BIOS update everyone recommends (my computer would not take me to the start screen anymore, it was stuck in some type of recovery mode) the XMP profile finally showed that these were indeed 3600 but u may get an error that they are 2600 or something of the like, like I did. I'm more of a software guy (not hardware) so I took me a bit longer than it should have to get these RAM sticks going. If u install them as u should (read as many reviews as u can to understand the process) (unless u know exactly what ur doing) they are pretty plug and play. Good luck.",

As like with the first set , it runs super stable and overclocks the exact same as well ; T1-16-26-26-26-50-65 . Both sets were Hynix , of which I have had great results with them . ~ I run my rigs hard , gaming or other wise and have not had a single problem with this GSkill version running in my Ryzen pc's . ~ Recommend !",
