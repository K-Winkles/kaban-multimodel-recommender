                "reviewText": "I had a Toshiba C55 B with a Celeron processor that was so slow it was unusable. I basically got it for free, so I thought I would get some parts to make it usable. First, I knew the Celeron processor must go, so I exchanged the motherboard for a used C55Dt with an AMD A8 quad core processor. I also modified the case bottom to create a vent for the fan, as the computer was detecting a cooling issue. That worked great.At this point, I thought I would replace some other components bottle-necking the performance of the laptop. Naturally, I knew that a RAM increase and a Solid State Drive would probably complete my project. Currently with only about $35 invested I didn't want to spend much money. I also knew that Toshiba is fairly proprietary about modifying their Laptops and upgrades. So, I researched about brands and types of upgrades with which Toshiba will be compatible.I did find that Intel processors for that generation, at least, require 1.5 volt RAM and that the AMD processors required only 1.35 volts but would work with up to 1.5 volts. That is something anyone upgrading RAM should probably check. This Ram will not work with the Intel chipset which requires 1.5 volt RAM.When I thought I had the required specifications figured out, I searched for the least expensive RAM that still had some good ratings. I never tried Timetec before, but it came up on amazon as the cheapest (by a lot), but also had several hundred great reviews.I purchased the Timetec RAM and Timetec Solid State Drive (likewise a bargain). It arrive days sooner than I was told to expect. I installed them and Windows 10 that night. These Timetec parts work and play well with Toshiba!That Toshiba Laptop is now more than adequate for my purposes and is fast booting, opening applications, Saving etc. I think this laptop could last me for several years. This is definitely a great computer for a total investment of just over a hundred bucks.",

                "reviewText": "I bought Timetec 8GB RAM for $32.99 from Timetec International Inc on May 28, 2019. I wanted to add an additional memory module to my Synology DS218+ and researched for a long time to figure out which RAM would be compatible with my hardware. The RAM installed on the DS218+ is a DDR3L 1866 2GB CL13 1.35V module, and I wanted to get the biggest size that would work with my DS218+.Although Synology states that additional 4GB RAM is the maximum you can add to the DS218+, the processor and the motherboard supports up to 8GB RAM modules. A lot of people were buying other brands, but the specs on those other modules that people bought did not match the 2GB RAM module already installed in the DS218+ (for example, the popular Crucial 8GB RAM module was 1600Mhz and not 1866MHz). I decided to get this Timetec 8GB RAM because it was the least expensive 1866MHz CL13 1.35V RAM module.The 8GB RAM is working well in my DS218+ and I recommend this to anybody who is looking to upgrade their DS218+.",

I thought the memory was of wrong spec, so returned it. But I verified online the same spec should have worked. So I ordered this Timetec memory from Amazon and to my surprise it worked!! So the original memory I had purchased was bad.NOTE: From my experience after sticking the memory on Bank0 and Bank1 and powering Synology DS718+ the blue light will blink for a while but no more than 2- 4 minutes. If it goes beyond that then the memory is bad and Synology DS718+ is not able to recognize it.",
