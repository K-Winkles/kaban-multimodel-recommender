                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I chose this memory for Corsair's reputation, the price point, and for a new gaming PC build that I had to budget all other components. I started with purchase of two 4GB modules and was going to double that in a month or two. I would have loved to get faster timings, but the prices just went sky hi. After installing the two 4Gb modules, assembly of the rest of the PC with all brand new components, the PC booted perfectly, windows 10 installed easily and quickly (under 15 minutes to desktop!). I used the computer for about a day and a half installing my programs, just enjoying getting things back up to speed.Then I noticed that my games crashed. A few minutes later a dread BSOD and another. Things were getting obviously unstable, so I checked Event Log (useless unless one has the time to run and troubleshoot dozens of possibilities). Started to panic until somewhere I read to check memory, using Prime95. Having built PC's in the past, and similar experiences with bad modules, Long story short with both modules I got over 10,000 errors and the test aborted automatically. I then ran Prime95 test with 1 module at a time, and found the trouble maker. 1 module was error free after over 1 hour running the test, the second module was toast.Just to be sure, I booted up Windows with the 'good' 4GB RAM and used my PC for a couple hours with no issues whatsoever. So I contacted Amazon and arranged a return. I wasn't aware they would just send me a replacement FIRST and ask me to return the defective part AFTER, so I just purchased a replacement then called them. I didn't want to be 'down' for two days without any memory.Turns out I now have 16 Gb of RAM instead of 8. Works perfectly BTW and I am very happy, I don't yet overclock so no comments but will eventually play around with it.Happy with Amazon's customer service, I understand even brand new parts can 'hiccup' so still offering up 5 stars based on reliability after the replacement. This PC, see specs below, is awesome fast. Upgraded from a 5 year old mid range gaming PC so I am very happy with all of it.Fractal Design Meshify C WhiteGigabyte Z390 AORUS PRO WiFi Intel LGA1151/Z390/ATX/2xM.2 Intel Core i9-9900KF Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked Without Processor GraphicsXPG GAMMIX 1TB S11 Pro 3D NAND PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 SSD Ultra-Fast PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 Interface Read/Write up to 3500/3000MB/sCORSAIR H115i RGB PLATINUM AIO Liquid CPU Cooler 280mmCORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB PRO 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3000MHz C15 LED Desktop MemoryEVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3, 80 Plus Gold 650W, Fully ModularMicrosoft Windows 10 ProThermaltake Pure Plus 12 RGB TT Premium Edition 120mm Software Enabled Circular 9 Controllable LEDs PWM Case/Radiator Fan - Triple Pack",

                "reviewText": "When I initially was looking for RAM, I was going to go with the previous version of this RAM because it was on the QVL from MSI. I'm so glad I took the risk on these, listened to the reviews about these sticks working on AMD boards, and bought these for my first build. The LEDs are stunning and look amazing. I honestly have kept them at the stock color effect, and I didn't even think I was going to like that effect the most! It perfectly compliments my Cryorig H7 cooler with the white fan because it reflects the colors off of it.I did run into one issue initially. I was trying to overclock them to the A-XMP speed that my motherboard, MSI B450 Tomahawk, allowed (which is 2933 for the 3000mhz sticks). For some reason, I was getting issues where it would not go to the rated speeds. I went to the Corsair Reddit and submitted a post about it. Got feedback from one of the mods to try switching the RAM and using them individually. At first, I thought I had a dead stick because the system did not post. I later reinstalled the stick into the motherboard because I wanted to keep the colors running. Turns out I just needed to switch the RAM to the other's slot, which was odd. Not sure if it was a RAM problem or a motherboard problem. Point is, it works now. It recognized that I had 16GB usable and installed, and I was able to activate A-XMP and it posted immediately with that overclock. Works like a charm.Another note: as of this review, I've had zero problems with MSI Mystic Light working with Corsair iCue software. I use iCue to run the lighting effects on the RAM, and Mystic light for my motherboard and my RGB front fans.",

I recently upgraded my gaming rig's memory to the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB kit (2 x 8 GB) DDR4 3000 MHz C15, and I'm absolutely thrilled with the results. This kit delivers on both performance and aesthetics, making it a perfect choice for enthusiasts and gamers alike.The memory modules are rock-solid performers, with a clock speed of 3000 MHz and a low CAS latency of C15. This translates into snappy responsiveness and smooth multitasking, which are crucial for gaming and content creation. I've noticed a significant improvement in loading times and overall system responsiveness, making my gaming experience much more enjoyable.What sets this kit apart, however, is the mesmerizing RGB lighting. The customizable lighting effects are a treat for the eyes and allow for seamless integration with the rest of my RGB setup. Corsair's iCUE software provides an easy and intuitive way to fine-tune the lighting to match my setup's aesthetics perfectly.Installation was a breeze; the modules fit snugly into my motherboard, and XMP profiling worked flawlessly to achieve the advertised speeds without any manual tweaking required.Corsair's build quality shines through as well. The heat spreaders not only keep the modules cool but also add to the overall aesthetics. The kit feels sturdy and well-made, which is something I value in any PC component.In conclusion, the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB kit is a top-tier choice for anyone looking to enhance their system's performance and visual appeal.
