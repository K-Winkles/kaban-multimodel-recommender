Not seeing as much slowdown as before, although the startup time didn't seem to change that much. But general workflow is faster, so I'm happy. Hope to get a few more years out of the system before I need to upgrade the whole thing.",

                "reviewText": "Although one could probably use many different name brands that would work.. as long of course they meet the basic requirements of your computer, I chose to use the one my computer company/builder suggest. They suggest I use the exact same ram that was already in my machine, so i did. I opened my computer case and popped the new ram in 16 gigs. It recognized the ram without issue and was instantly ready to use. I don't know how much difference it has made at this point as I have not put it to the test, but I do know that my computer is really fast. This ram is a good price ( on Amazon) and very easy to install. If you have never opened a computer case and dealt with installing ram or other components before...you might want to ask someone who knows to show you how, I have found that people who have no computer hardware skills do not usually use this much ram anyway, but if you want to and not have previous knowledge, make sure to find someone that can guide you --if you feel the least bit doubtful about putting in the ram yourself. I highly recommend this ram when you go looking for some to purchase.",

I have an aging HP desktop with an i5 processor that was really slowing down, despite religiously running my system utilities, defragging, etc. There was 8 gigs of RAM in there, even though that processor can accommodate up to 16. So I ordered two of these and discarded the old card. BAM! Runs like a brand new computer! Probably could have bought any brand but Patriot appears to get some respect, AND this card fit the specs of my vintage DDR 3 RAM slots. There's a bump up in clock speed too, to 1600 MHz. The old cards were 1333 MHz. So if your ol' box is lettin' ya down, think RAM!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my Cybertron desktop gaming computer. I bought the computer in 2015 but never got around to upgrading it because the games I was playing put very few demands on my system.Now I am playing heavily modded Fallout 4 and I was really noticing the limitations of my 8 GB RAM and GeForce GT 740. I contacted Cybertron to ask which of the myriad choices for RAM was the proper one and they pointed to the Patriot Signature 8GM DIMM DDR3 CL11 PC3-12800 (1600MHz). They also told me I could buy it cheaper from Amazon than from them.I ordered the RAM, had it two days later, and immediately installed it. I booted up my computer and checked to make sure the upgrade registered with the system and there it was: 16GB RAM. Beautiful.Everything worked fine. I started up Fallout 4 and immediately noticed an improvement in performance. A lot less stuttering. I went to work tweaking my load order and if I still lack a high-end gaming computer (and need to upgrade my graphics card) I can at least play and enjoy the modded atmosphere, particularly Vivid Commonwealth and Calamity Weathers.I have been using it all week now, playing at least 20 hours this week as I tweak my game setup. The Patriot RAM does what it is supposed to do and without a hitch. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I have a seven year old HP desktop computer with 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. I've only used 250GB of the 1TB and after upgrading to Windows 10 my computer progressively became sluggish. It got to the point it took over a minute for my computer to wake up from sleep state when moving the mouse or pressing the keys. I was just dealing with it for a long time and was going to buy a new computer, but I looked at the specs and saw the RAM was upgradable to 16GB. For $17.00 I thought why not give it a try. I received this 8GB stick, just popped it in and my computer runs like new. Everything runs much faster and it immediately wakes up from the sleeping state. I would recommend anyone in this situation give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "Ziel war es, einen 10 Jahre alten Server von 8 auf 16 GB RAM aufzur\u00fcsten - und das m\u00f6glichst preisg\u00fcnstig, da die Kiste als Medienserver/NAS eh die meiste Zeit nicht viel zu tun hat.Ich war bei diesem Speicherriegel zuerst skeptisch. Unbekannter Hersteller und der Preis liegt ungef\u00e4hr bei der H\u00e4lfte der meisten anderen 8 GB-Riegel und DDR3 ist ja sowieso nicht mehr so g\u00e4ngig. Sofort hatte ich die \u00fcblichen Fragen im Kopf: Wird der Riegel \u00fcberhaupt erkannt werden? Wird er zusammen mit dem vorhandene, 10 Jahre alten 8 GB-Riegel funktionieren? Wird das System danach wegen irgendwelcher seltsamen Speicherfehler dauernd abst\u00fcrzen?Ich habe es trotzdem gewagt, vor allem auch, weil der Versand direkt \u00fcber Amazon erfolgte. Ergebnis: Alle Sorgen waren unberechtigt. Der Riegel kam einen Tag sp\u00e4ter an, habe ihn eingebaut, Rechner eingeschaltet und alles war in Ordnung. 16 GB wurden sofort erkannt, der MemoryTest lief ohne Probleme durch. \u00dcber ein Tool konnte ich auslesen, dass dieser Riegel, trotz DDR3, erst vor ein paar Wochen produziert wurde - hier wird also auch keine Altware verkauft. Und der Server l\u00e4uft weiter stabil ohne einen einzigen Absturz.Volle Empfehlung von mir hier zuzuschlagen, wenn jemand preisg\u00fcnstig aber gut ein altes System aufr\u00fcsten m\u00f6chte!",
