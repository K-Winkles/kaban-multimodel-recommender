                "reviewText": "The delivery was prompt even during this Covid19 epidemic, even arriving a day earlier than I expected it to. Once it arrived, opening, unpacking the box, opening the package the RAM came in all took longer than the actual installation into my Acer Aspire desktop. All in all, it probably took less than 10 minutes from the time the delivery was dropped off to starting up the computer with the additional 16GB of memory.To begin with I only had 1 stick of 16GB, so adding this doubled it to my computer's maximum of 32GB. Once installed, the boot-up time for my Debian-based Linux distro was noticeable quicker, as well as the time it took to automatically login. Furthermore there was a great increase in both the time it took to launch several apps along with running those several at the same time. For instance, prior to adding this RAM I was able to run several apps all at once, but each app made the computer lag a little bit more each time. Now I can run VLC, Firefox with YouTube playing, GIMP, Inkscape, my Terminal and Libreoffice without noticing any lag whatsoever.I won't lie, there's probably some better, faster RAM available, but since I don't play any games, this RAM is a great, budget-friendly addition which makes using my computer quicker and more reliable for everyday use, plus coding, watching videos, playing music, and graphic design here and there, and so on and so forth.If you need some additional RAM for the uses I've described, this 16GB will suite your needs perfectly. I imagine the same is true if you need Timetec's other sizes like 4GB, 8Gb, and 32Gb, in both the desktop and laptop varieties. I don't think the make single sticks of more than 32GB, but they do make kits ranging from 1x4GB, 2x4GB, 4x4GB, 1x8GB, 4x8GB, all the way up to 8x16GB and 4x32GB, both of which would give you a whopping 128GB RAM.What's more all these various kits are quite reasonably priced. Like I said above, these may not be the top of the line when it comes to RAM like HyperX, Corsair, Patriot, or G.Skill, but at the end of the day all you need is budget-friendly, easy to install, and reliable memory, this Timetec Hynix IC 16GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM is a perfect fit. I also imagine the plethora of other kits made by Timetec will suit your needs for a good price and reliability as well!",

Although, I have no idea why anyone would ship delicate computer parts packaged in a flimsy plastic container in a thin plastic envelope with zero protective padding! Thank god the memory sticks arrived undamaged!Also, these were a pain in the ass to install; because, the retaining clips failed to stay secure and the memory stick was able to slide out. I had to put more downward pressure than necessary to get the memory stick deep enough into the slot for the clips to click secured. This despite the description saying these memory sticks are appropriate for my Lenovo ideacentre-720.",
