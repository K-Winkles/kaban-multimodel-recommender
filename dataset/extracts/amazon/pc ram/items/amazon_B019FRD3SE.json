Overcome this by installing high-density modules in each memory slot on your laptop for seamless multitasking. Install with ease \u2013 no computer skills required With just a screwdriver, your owner\u2019s manual, and a few minutes of time, you can install memory \u2013 no computer skills necessary.

                "reviewText": "Having always had great experiences with Crucial in the past, I bought this 16GB RAM kit to replace a single stick of 8GB RAM in a Thinkpad A475, and it is working great. Probably a little overkill, frankly, given that the A475's CPU is probably its bottleneck. Regardless, excellent RAM, and a worthwhile addition to most laptops if you are stuck at 8GB.A note on installation - depending on your motherboard configuration, you may need to install one of the RAM sticks *upside-down!* This is not an issue, and it is fine to do so as long as the stick is keyed correctly as to match up with the slot.",

Running at 2400 is technically an overclock anyway so I wouldn't want to run it any fast anyway in a server. Great price to performance. Seems to have really good compatibility as well.",
