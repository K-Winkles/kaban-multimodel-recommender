After i spent 15 minutes trying to slide it in, i powered up the laptop and got a completely black screen. Then i properly dismounted both my ram sticks and put them in properly. You need to slide them into slot at 45 degree angle, then push them into place until you hear a slight click. If you do it right it's easy and if you are struggling means you're doing it wrong, no need to force anything. After that the laptop works, new memory is identified. Happy with price and service, would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first review ever on any items I've purchased online. As well as I am quite the beginner when it comes to laptops and upgrading them. But with the help from plenty of reviews online I was able to make an informed decision.I recently purchased the Samusng ativ book 7 Ultrabook and I am very satisfied with the way the laptop is built. To me it feels like a high end ultrabook compared to a lot of other laptops out there. I read up on numerous reviews before making the purchase and the thing that excited me was the ability to upgrade the RAM. The ultrabook is already very fast without any upgrades with only 4GB RAM built in so I thought it really couldn't get it any faster. After reading up on how to upgrade the laptop I thought I would take a shot at it and purchase this 4GB RAM stick to make it dual channel to match with what is already installed. Plus its a super easy install especially when following some youtube videos.Boy oh boy!! I didn't think I would be able to tell the difference. It did not take long for me to see the difference first hand. All in all the response from turning it on, to opening apps, to typing, to saving documents, etc. has been unbelievable. I couldn't be happier with the purchase of the Samsung 4GB RAM nor happier with a different laptop. Most ultrabooks wont allow you to upgrade the hardware inside but with the Samsung ativ book 7 you can turn this puppy into something that will rival most ultrabooks in the market today. I would highly recommend upgrading your RAM and the Samsung ativ book 7 Ultrabook if you are shopping around. You can't go wrong with this purchase.I hope that helps you make a decision. Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "I have an old Lenovo E530 that is many years old that I have been upgrading piece by piece to avoid buying new. Originally it had Win7 and 4GB memory. I had switched over to an SSD and did the Win10 upgrades but moving to Win10 seemed to stress the machine more and made performance slower and a little more uneven (browser often locked up). So this product was the original single 4GB memory in the machine and so I looked for an identical add-on to bump up to 8GB. I found this product and only one number was different of all the codes and numbers on the stick. So what the heck, I bought two (they were cheap anyway) and replaced the existing one and added another. The Lenovo has easy access to the memory card location.I have noticed an improvement in boot times and in browser stability/performance so far. It was an easy upgrade that was inexpensive and made a noticeable difference. Win-win!",

                "reviewText": "This is a cheap upgrade for the Samsung Series 7/Ativ Book 7 (NP740U3E) which only comes with one 4GB SODIMM DDR3 1600 from the factory. However, most NP740U3E models can be upgraded because the memory is not soldered onto the motherboard and it has 2 memory slots. *Please note I think there is one international model that only has one memory slot because it has dedicated graphics.This memory is identical to the one that came with my Series 7, so there are no compatibility issues. Besides, Samsung makes the majority of the industry's memory anyway, so compatibility problems is probably relatively low regardless of what brand you go with. The memory came enclosed in a sealed static free pouch like it should.I had a little lag before when using apps like Photoshop or Adobe Premier and didn't know if it was the 3rd gen I5 3337u or 4gb of RAM that was causing the bottleneck. After the upgrade, it seems fairly safe to say it was the lack of memory because I've had zero lag.Bottom line, 4gb is a little lacking with today's modern apps, which is why I recommend 8gb or more. Also, it's memory and hard for you to have issues or problems; you'll know if you got a bad stick. Most of the time when my friends have had problems with memory, it's because the two sticks weren't matching (e.g. 4gb stick paired with 8gb stick; 1600 MHz paird with 1866 MHz; etc)Probably a longer review than needed for memory. MUST HAVE UPGRADE IF YOU OWN A SAMSUNG SERIES 7/ATIV BOOK 7 NP740U3E",

The users laptop was underspec'd at 6 gigs of ram on windows 10. Now there's alot more headroom in the users build. (also did a clean install onto an SSD of 10 pro and viola, this old laptop is like new again)",

However,I thought that my Mac would have a tangible difference in speed after upgrading from 4GB RAM to 8GB(I bought two of these) Sad to say, that's not the case. Anyway, after replacing my HDD with a SSD, hopefully, that would change.Edit: Giving it 5 stars. After using it for a few days, the RAM is giving my Mac a couple more years of usability.",
