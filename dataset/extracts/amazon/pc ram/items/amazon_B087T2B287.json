                "reviewText": "Update: G.Skill has a lifetime warranty on their RAM and from personal experience the process to replace it is very simple. I still can't give them 5 stars since it was a defective product and I had to pay for shipping it off for replacement but that is still only a fraction of the cost of buying a replacement.-----[Original Review Below]-----So I installed two of these, giving my system 128GB of RAM (32GBx4). The computer has run mostly fine though I noticed a little bit of instability every so often where it would randomly hard reboot. It almost never happened (maybe once every couple of months) and the system passed all the stress test so I just thought it was some software fluke.Then recently I started running a new program and it would hard reboot after only a few minutes, every single time. I went even harder on testing, including taking everything apart and running specialized testing software on each individual component. Finally found that there is a narrow section of memory addresses on a single DIMM that throw error codes, most likely a single memory chip. After removing that DIMM my system was suddenly 100% stable so it was bad from when it arrived. It was manufactured less than a month before I received and installed it so most likely bad from the factory.",
