I have a noctua air cooler and clearances were something I wanted to make sure I wasn't dealing with. I bought 2 sets of the 5200 speed for 4 sticks. By doing this the XMP mode would just go into a loop boot. If I went \"auto\" in bios it was defaulting to 4000 speed. I was able to work it up to 4800 speed, I may try getting closer to 5200 but right now I prefer stability over crashes. I'm on a Z690 prime asus board with the 19-12900k cpu. My last PC lasted me nearly 10 years so I'm hoping this will keep me future proof for another 10.",

And to be honest, while the transfer speeds is improved over DDR4, the latency isn't so the net effect isn't exactly a huge improvement over quality DDR4, but my mobo requires DDR5 and going forward that's what everyone is going to. Install is easy, I mean, it's RAM, there's not much to it. My motherboard was a little finicky about the kit being in the A1 and B1 slots. So moved the sticks to the A2 and B2 slots, and everything was fine. Enabled XMP and it went to it's rated speed right away. No problems so far.",

                "reviewText": "Needed DDR5s for a new build and after some research, decided that these Kingston's in 2x16 Gbs offered the best choice, at least for my purposes. While generally speaking, though DDR5 pricing has come down quite a bit, it isn't very cost effective when compared to DDR4s, which offer much more bang for the buck.But, having said that, since these kits are for a new build with Intel's Alder Lake, I thought I'd go with these. In my view, I opted for the pair of 16Gbs because the 2x8Gb kits appear to have only 4 banks, while the 16's have the expected 8. In addition, with the 5600 kits, there's a pretty high probability of receiving the SK hynix chips. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to receive a kit with the hynix chips which is preferable to Samsung's, at least for my purposes.So, all in all, I'd say it's a pretty good deal, all things considered. Still kind of overpriced at this stage compared to DDR4s, but, at least, for SK hynix DDR5s at this price point isn't insanely overpriced, as had been the case with DDR5s most of the past year or so.",

It defaults to 4800MHz and you need to tell the BIOS to use the rated speed, but that's not a problem with the memory. So far no issues what so ever.But there was something odd in the Amazon stock system. I ordered two and got one and a little anti static back with an inch diameter fury ring.Amazon customer service were great and ordered a replacement, but due to over helpfulness on their part, they ordered two replacements. OK, well I don't want to stop the delivery, so I figured I'd return the spare again. Again I got one and small fury ring in an anti static bag. How can this happen. In the end I have what I ordered.",
