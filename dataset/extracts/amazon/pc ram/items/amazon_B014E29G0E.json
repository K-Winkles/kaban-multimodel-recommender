                "reviewText": "So, let me start with a warning. If you are planning on upgrading an older laptop running windows 10, with an Intel CPU, and an older style AMD \"GPU\", such as the HD series, then there are some serious compatibility issues... but non of them are the fault of this memory. In my case, I upgraded an HP Envy 14 Beats 2020NR.After the upgrade, system became super unstable, which I'm guessing was somehow related to the 2nd RAM slot being used for the first time ever, but who knows. Regardless, the system had become virtually unusable, even with only the old Samsung RAM installed. To make a long story short, I reset everything on this system every way possible, and read every article, post, or thread on the internet that had anything to do with the problem. Best I could do, a stable system with 2 minute start-up and shutdown times. But just recently I struck gold, so just in case there's someone who could use this, I thought I should share...First, reset everything. Start with fresh install of Windows, newly formatted drive (if possible), I even did a factory reset on my BIOS. Then install only 1 of the new TimeTec RAM, boot off your Windows install drive of choice, and wait for Windows to do it's thing. After system install, as long as everything is running stable, add the 2nd stick of RAM. Check stability again, then update windows and your drivers to current. And that is where the super long boot and shutdown times will appear. I actually wasted tons of time trying to optimize my drivers manually, then recently discovered driver management software. I highly recommend this approach, as it optimized all my drivers based on my system, even rolled a few back. While it immediately improved my computer's performance in a number of ways, it also highlighted the culprit. The software for my AMD Radeon HD 6630M, which it had completely removed due to the issues. Knowing the problem specifics, I was able to finally do a proper search, and discover that it essentially Windows asking the AMD driver a question it didn't know how to answer, so it basically didn't and caused a long delay. One little change to the registry, and Voila! If you don't know what you're doing here (like me), just find detailed instructions and follow them.During all this, I initially thought the TimeTec RAM was at fault, so their customer support immediately sent me a replacement so I could rule out their product. Super nice people with just over a week turnaround on the whole exchange. Thanks TimeTec!",

                "reviewText": "Was looking to upgrade the RAM in an old laptop. Ordered the 16GB and my laptop gave me all sorts of BSOD errors when trying to boot--passed memory tests in BIOS but wouldn't start Windows. Contacted the seller and they helped me figure out my laptop model could only handle 8GB (other similar models could handle the 16GB, but not mine). Seller allowed me to return the 16GB and order the 8GB. The 8GB worked perfectly. Seller checked in with me a couple times along the way and a follow-up afterwards. Rockstar 5-start support for my own user error on the initial purchase. As far as the product, so far so good. The older laptop is a backup and doesn't get much use but seems to be working well with the new memory.",
