They work pretty well and are super easy to overclock (3000mhz) using the XMP profile in BIOS. Probably the best RAM in this price range i highly reccomend getting this if youre on a budget and dont care about RGB RAM sticks. Make sure to clean slots/sticks and make sure they are properly installed or else you will have display and boot issues. This randomly happened to me while using it a few weeks after building my PC. And when I put in 2 more sticks. They are very sensitive to debris and how you place them but that goes for any RAM. BUY THESE over any other non-RGB RAM.",

I was given a budget of $1000 and I came in at $670. Using a 4 core ryzen and this cheap yet fast enough ram I was able to build a system that exceeded their needs.They are genuinely shocked how fast it is for how little was spent. So I'd you're doing a budget build this memory is great. I had no issues overclocking it either.*Update*They have had the system for a while now and I've managed to get even more performance out of this memory without increasing latency so it definitely gets my seal of approval.

                "reviewText": "It works great I had one issue clocking it to 3000hz but then I realized I needed to up the dram voltage to 1.350 instead of the 1.200 that was stock in the bios it took me a little while to figure that out I ended up seeing it on the back of the package in summary don\u2019t be dumb like me and clock it correctly I\u2019m guessing most of the bad reviews saying it didn\u2019t over clock was because of this",

Not the fastest memory for the price, but being limited on the RAM speed I could it's not a con in my case.",
