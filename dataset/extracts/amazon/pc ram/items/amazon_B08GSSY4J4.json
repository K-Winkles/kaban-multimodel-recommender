Since the machine has not been taxed by any of the games being played on it, nor do I have any tools for measuring its overall performance, I would have to say that these memory modules are great and function as designed. Love the colorful lights on them. They are bright and are constantly changing color in a wave style from one side to the other length wise. Overall, I'm happy with it & would recommend it to anyone looking to add some colorful memory modules to a gaming PC.",

Otherwise you may default to 2166 or something like that. Depending on the chips in your specific memory kit you may be able to get away with tighter timings or slightly higher frequency with the same C18 timing. But do that at your own risk. Make sure your MOBO can support 3600 MT/s as well. Quite happy with the kit as it helped with my FPS 1% and .1% lows",
