                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sincere thanks to this Chinese company for their efforts to continue manufacturing DDR-2 memory.",
                "reviewText": "I received all three memory packs relatively quickly with respect to the first Amazon forecast. The presentation of the modules in their boxes and plastics was correct. I ordered three boxes, each with two 2Gb DDR-2 RAM modules.In two of the boxes all the DDR-2 modules were brand new and very well presented and manufactured. The third box contained one module with small (almost imperceptible) flaws. Probably that DDR-2 module was from a return and whoever used it was not particularly careful with the module, however the module worked fine. I suggest to the manufacturer of these modules to examine them with a magnifying glass when they have a return, I think it is good that if they work they resell them, but the modules should always be sold as new, especially if it clearly indicates that a product is being sold as new. :)But in general I have to say that I am happy with the product and I appreciate the customer service shown by this Chinese company, taking an interest in everything being correct, taking care that the product arrives on time and that everything works correctly, offering their help by email.And now the second part of this \"review\" :) . All the DDR-2 modules I have received work and pass several times an intense memory test. But my model motherboard \"Intel Desktop Board DP35DP\" with a Intel Core-Duo processor has some problem and for some reason when I put 4 DDR-2 (8Gb) modules at the same time the BIOS detects them but the intensive memory test with \"Memtest86 v5.1\" hangs a few seconds after starting.If I put only 2 DDR-2 modules (4Gb) everything works correctly, the detection and the intense memory test works. I have also tried the combination of two 2Gb DDR-2 with my two previous 1Gb DDR-2 modules and the memory test also crashes, so I deduce that the problem must also come, at least in part, from my motherboard. I also deduce that in part the problem could come from the mixture of the different memory chips that make these DDR-2 memories possible in 2023. In my case, the motherboard indicates a mixture of Kingston and Samsung DDR-2 chips in the modules that I've received.With my second PC with a motherboard \"Intel Desktop Board D946GZIS\" I have not had any problems. I have expanded it from 2Gb to 4Gb with the modules that I have received and they are detected and pass the memory test several times without any problem.In conclusion, I am grateful for the work that this Chinese company does. I would have liked to have changed that DDR-2 module that is not completely new but it does not make sense because the shipping cost is equal to the cost of the product, and also the module works well. In the end I keep the 4 modules as spare memory and at least I have managed to expand one of my two 2007 PCs that still have a long and ecological useful life left. :)I hope this \"review\" can be useful for other people like me who refuse to part with hardware that is 15 years old already but still works perfectly with the free Gnu/Linux operating systems today.Excuse any possible errors because I have used an online translator. Greetings to all. :)",
