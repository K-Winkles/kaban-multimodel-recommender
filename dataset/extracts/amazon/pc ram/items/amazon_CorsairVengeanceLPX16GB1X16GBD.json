                "reviewText": "At first, I bought and installed a Crucial 16GB Single DDR4 UDIMM CL17 memory into my new MSI X470 Gaming Plus motherboard with Ryzen 5 CPU. I'm experienced with building PC's from scratch, been my hobby since college. When I started the computer for the first time, it would not post or allow me to go into BIOS, and gave out 3 long beeps. Online search found that it's a memory not detected, or faulty. I don't think it's a bad motherboard because I've never had a motherboard fail, but I've had lots of memory cards that did fail even when new. If cheap components are used in a memory card, it will have lots of quality and compatibility issues. After trying to re-seat the 16GB card many times, it finally worked without explanation. In BIOS, I wasn't able to enable my motherboard's XMP to adjust memory speed or settings (all XMP settings were locked out). After running it for a few hours, I shut the PC down to install a new CD-Rom. Then when I turn my PC on, again would not post or allow me to go into BIOS, gave three long beeps, memory issue again. I finally gave up on the Crucial 16GB card and bought a premium gaming memory, CORSAIR 16GB (8GB x 2) Vengeance LPX, CL15, 3000 Mhz. After installing the Corsair memory cards, the computer booted fine the first time, and booted up twice as fast into Windows 10. My first guess is the Crucial memory cards are defective or has compatibility issues. My second guess is the CL17 of the Crucial memory is too slow for the Ryzen 5 2nd gen CPU and motherboard, and Ryzen 5 needs memory cards rated at CL15 and CL16 or faster (the lower the CL the faster the memory). Funny thing is after I purchased the Corsair Vengeance, as I was waiting for it to ship to my house, the Crucial 16GB was working again, computer was able to boot up. It's as if it knows the Crucial memory is getting replaced and it decided to work again. After installing the Corsair Vengeance cards, the default speed was at 2100 Mhz, without XMP configuration. I went into the Bios, enabled A-XMP, set it to profile 2, and it's now operating at 2933 Mhz, close to the advertised speed of 3000 Mhz! Very happy with the Corasir Vengeance memory cards ($110 at time of purchase) even though it was $11 more than the Crucial card.Pro's:1. Much faster than CL17 cards, noticeable shorter boot time to Windows 10 (10 seconds versus 20 seconds on the CL17 card), faster shut down2. Very sleek looking and has aluminum heat sinks for cooling, improves durability and life3. XMP compatible. Easy to configure over clocking using most newer motherboards that has XMP.4. More reliable and higher quality. Didn't have trouble on first boot.Cons:1. A bit more expensive than the average memory cards.2. 8GB x 2 cards used up 2 of my 4 slots on an ATX motherboard. If one is building on a Micro ATX motherboard where there are only 2 memory slots, one will not be able to expand the memory in the future as both slots are used up.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good Timings, Impeccable Service, Amazing Product",
                "reviewText": "I've turned into the kind of dad that looks over his power bill and watches the thermostat like a hawk, so after a few painful power bills in a row I finally retired my first-gen socket 1366 Intel Core i7 system (the processor used over 250 watts when overclocked!) to a new and more efficient Skylake system. It kind of hurt to do since I had no performance problems even six years after I built it, but it was probably time.Anyways, this kit was the best price for 4x8GB DDR4 memory I saw on Amazon at the time of purchase, and since I've had to deal with Corsair's excellent support in the past I generally lean toward buying their products. Their warranty, in my opinion, is the best in the business -- most recently they replaced the 6x2GB triple channel kit from that 1366 PC more than 6 years after I bought it, no hassle and no cost on my end.As of late October the C15 kit (also 2666MHz) is listed for just $10 more than this one, so it may be the better buy right now. When I purchased this kit, the C15 version was about $50 more and I didn't want to stretch my budget any further since I sprang for the i7 over the i5.I am using this memory in a ASUS Z170-A socket 1151 motherboard. An earlier review said the rated speed/timings didn't work on an X99-based motherboard, which may be the case, but I can verify that this kit works as advertised on my particular system. All modules were immediately recognized on POST and all I had to do was set the timings (16-18-18-35), the speed (2666MHz), and the voltage (1.2v) in the BIOS and I was done.The only negative, and it's a stretch, is that the suggested timings were not printed anywhere on the box or individual modules, nor was there a slip of paper with that information in the box -- I don't know if my package had been tampered with or something, but that is basic information that needs to be included with the product.This is just a minor gripe, really, but I'm the kinda old-school PC guy that builds his systems out of the case on a static-free workbench, far away from my router, so I ended up having to look up the timings on my phone. I could have let them run at the default values (MB set them to 15-15-15-36 @ 2133MHz) and set the timings later, but I don't think I should have to go online to get that information.All in all, the kit works at the advertised speed/timings with no hassle and have the added bonus of Corsair's warranty/support. I'm confident that I won't have to buy another kit until it comes time for me to build a new PC -- which hopefully isn't for another six years! I'm sure there is more overhead in these modules for overclockers who want to get every last drop of performance, but I haven't had the time or energy to sit down and focus on that -- maybe I'll play around with it over the Thanksgiving holiday as an excuse to get away from the in-laws. If so, I'll report back with whatever timings give me stable performance.",

                "reviewText": "Installed in a roughly 5 year old system (i5-7500). Removed 2x8GB DD4 and replaced with 2x16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX . Took about 5 minutes to change and system automatically detected the additional RAM. No before and after benchmarks, but the system does seem more responsive. Hope to extend the useful life of this old computer another year or two.",
