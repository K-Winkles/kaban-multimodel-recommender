At first, I was skeptical since I reached out to ASUS support to see if these would work. They could neither confirm nor deny that these specific ram would work. Additionally, the ASUS website states that the max RAM upgrade is 32GB. I ended up buying these and thankfully it works flawlessly. I am assuming that the 32GB are for 1 RAM. So total max RAM upgrade is 64GB (2x32). The laptop I installed these on are the ASUS ROG G713PV (2023) for anyone who\u2019s wondering.",

                "reviewText": "I wrote this computer product review primarily for those Amazon product consumers that are not that computer savvy when it comes to buying IT products for their home or small business...First of all in a day and age when almost every country in the world seems to be manufacturing Information Technology computerized media products it is hard to know who you can trust to deliver high quality computer IT media products and electronic computing devices.However, with that said I have been an diehard IT product consumer of the Corsair brand name IT computer products for many years now.First off, I bought a Corsair brand wireless gaming mouse about 6 or 7 years ago that was a top notch computerized gaming peripheral device bosting legendary DPI settings at the time in past gaming history, and this gaming mouse lasted me over five years of everyday gaming for 5 to 6 hours of continuous hard usage.So, it's a proven fact that Corsair Computer product brand is a reputable long lasting IT product brand in my avid gamer geekdom opinion.Now, about a month ago I decided to buy another Corsair brand IT computer memory card product; the CORSAIR VENGEANCE SODIMM DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 4800MHz...Peeps, let me tell you that these Corsair Vengeance memory cards are lighting fast and they are pure adrenalin junkie, pumped-up speed demons for sure.My gaming laptop PC start-up time is now less then 60 seconds, no B.S. I kid you not!!!My HP OMEN 16 literally flies like a bat out of hell now that she's over-endowed with these Corsair killer speed demon memory cards...Would, I actually recommend this brand of high performance memory cards for your gaming PC?Heck, yeah I would these Corsair Vengeance memory cards, because they are incredibly rocket fast and the selling price isn't too steep either.So, if you indeed have the need for triple warp speed?I'd gladly say go for it all the way \"Capt. Kirk\" engage your PC ships warp drive engines in your gaming beast rig, buy yourself some Corsair memory cards and feel your blood rush straight to your head today!",

                "reviewText": "I took a chance and so far, so good but it didn't look good for a moment.I'm not sure all Alienware m17 r5s are upgradable. Depending on the graphics card, you may have less options. I may be thinking about the extra SSD slot my model has.Anyways, I got the 64 gig kit from this listing and put it in after disconnecting the battery from motherboard.I was expecting a long boot time and possible failure.The laptop took two minutes before the power/ alien head flashed 3 times red then two times blue (or 3 blue 2 red, I'd make a terrible witness sorry)I thought oh well, this ram won't work...I got an Alienware splash screen that said F2 for bios setup or F12 for boot options. I tried hitting F2 and nothing happened so I held F2 and the power button for 20 seconds or so and surprisingly the laptop booted into Windows. I don't know if simply holding the power button would have done the same. I never entered the bios menu.I opened Lightroom and Photoshop and played quake champions for 30 minutes or so with those programs still open. Task manager was reporting around 50% of the ram was being used.So far, seems stable, will update if that changes.",

Do not buy this product if you have a laptop of that brand, and much less buy if you do not live in the US. AMAZON DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RETURN if the product was purchased for abroad, and therefore you lose the money because the cost of returning the product is almost the same as the product itself.Pese a que las caracteristicas son las se\u00f1aladas y la pagina web de corsair \"garantiza\" que son compatibles con portatiles alienware, no lo son. No comprar este producto si tienes un portatil de esa marca, y mucho menos compres si no vives en EEUU. AMAZON NO SE HACE CARGO DE LA DEVOLUCI\u00d3N especialmente si el producto fue comprado por alguien fuera del territorio continental de los EEUU. El costo de devoluci\u00f3n es casi el mismo del producto, y por tanto es dinero perdido.",
