                "reviewText": "Several months ago I bought two of these 8GB memory sticks to install next to my existing two Ballistix GB sticks. That didn't work. That's when I learned that mixing manufacturers, even if everything else is supposedly the same [aka DDR3 UDIMM 1600MHz]. I thought if I ordered the same configuration I'd be OK, but NO!So, I waited until I had some more disposable income and bought two more of the EXACT SAME memory sticks, and THAT WORKED!! I removed the Ballstix memory sticks, then installed the two new ones and powered up my PC. It ran for a few seconds, when power cycles, then ran for a few more seconds, then power cycled, etc. After few more of these, I pulled the plug and removed one of the new sticks, then powered up again. It power cycled a few more times and then POST succeeded and it made it to the Windows {10] login. After I verified that 24GB was present, I powered down and installed the re-installed the fourth memory stick, and powered back up. I don't remember if it power cycled one more time, or if it just booted up, but after that I was able to verify 32 GB!!I often run many programs at once [e.g. Firefox, DipTrace, MikroC Pro, NotePad++, PainShopPro, AdobeAcrobat, MPLAB X IPE, occasionally Adobe Illustrator -- in other words, as lot of electrical engineering stuff, and or Web Developing stuff, and/or Graphic Design stuff.] So far, with 32GB I'm not running out of memory so often [occasionally I still need to run RamMap, and Empty the Standby List -- the fact that Win 10 programs reserve so much \"Stand By\" memory is ridiculous, and tends to negate the advantages of a multitasking platform!]",

I ended up having to use unhoused RAM sticks which worked fine but was rather odd to me because I already had two housed Corsair RAM stick in my motherboard.",

When I installed it and turned on the computer, I received light codes indicating a problem. I removed all the ram and added the Patriot ram to the computer as a single and double stick, each time I received the light codes. Dell computers can be finicky with memory sticks so I did some research and was able to find a compatible brand. I decided to see if this would work in my HP Prodesk 600 G1 Tower, it works just fine. There was nothing wrong with the memory. I will be purchasing two more sticks to upgrade my HP computer to 32GB of ram. On both computers, I run virtual machines, one with Windows and one with Linux.",
