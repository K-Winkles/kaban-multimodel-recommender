I also swapped out my hard disc drive for a one TB solid state drive from Amazon, extending the life of my laptop was simple and light on my wallet. all necessary parts and tools came from Amazon and the instructions and courage was all YouTube. pay close attention when formatting your new Drive so you don't end up with the same size drive you are replacing.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this memory to install in and upgrade my son's Acer Aspire E15 Laptop which originally came brand new with 6 GB of installed RAM, 1 4 GB stick and a 2 GB stick How dumb is that? So I immediately added a second 4 GB stick to bring the RAM up to 8 GB but my son wasn't happy. Neither was I.I'm not saying that 8 GB is horrible for most users by any means but my son is an autistic 21 year old who refuses to ever turn off his machine because he leaves numerous windows open, he has everything on it running all the time and it was really running slow. Tortoise like slow!Install was simple, it took under 5 minutes. I removed 3 tiny screw on the back of the laptop to remove a panel so that I had access to the old memory. I pinched both clips on each stick and they flipped up for easy extraction. From there it was just a matter of inserting the new RAM and giving each module a gentle push downward to lock them in and then replace the panel on the back. Voila! Upon booting up the first time after the swap I had no issues. The computer recognized 16 GB as expected and it is now much more responsive.As I did this job while he was sleeping I took the liberty of doing some maintenance work. I defragged, ran the cleaner, did the various updates, etc. Oh, and I deleted his old unread gmail. About 4500 of them! LOLAlthough I haven't owned this RAM for an extended period of time I'm not bothered by reviewing at such an early date. There are so many positive reviews and I have never had an issue with any RAM myself so I am confident.This product is a bargain in price as far as I am concerned. It has made a huge improvement in performance and is worth it's modest price easily. I highly recommend this memory.",
