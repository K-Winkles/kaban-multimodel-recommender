There's been no memory-related problems at this time (about a week after installing), if anything should change I'll update accordingly.",

                "reviewText": "Replacement RAM for a system which previously had a bad RAM module, and which crashed (on average) once a week during high memory load.We had two identical systems. Now one uses Mushkin's Silverline PC3200 2x32gb (this product). The other uses a popular gaming RAM which is rated higher on benchmarks, but which is actually less stable overall during long-term use.There have been 181 crashes on the non-Mushkin system, and just 10 crashes on the Mushkin system in just a bit over 6 months of ownership. The other RAM's benchmarks insist it's a better build; but the lowered stress factor in knowing that the Mushkin system probably won't crash is actually what makes it a better machine. While I'm not sure what the actual issue is with the crashing (I'd be guessing if I asserted any particular cause), what I can say is that the stability makes it feel like a better option.The TPM module was activated in both machines for getting Windows 11, and the upgrade has lowered the number of crashes. But the other platform's rate is still well over ten times that of the Mushkin system, which runs AutoCAD, Blender, and video processing software such as Adobe's AfterEffects and Premiere. It's supposed to be faster on the other system according to benchmarks, but it crashes so much more often that we tend to get more done on the Mushkin-installed system.I can't give a more glowing review. This product's superior engineering has basically earned my business for every future build in the foreseeable future. Sure, I'll probably spend about 10% more, but with 50% of the stress level gone, that's something money just can't buy.",
