Running an X570 ASUS TUF Pro Plus Wifi with a 5800X and was able to enable docp which is asus's version of XMP. So if you have problem with locating XMP, look for the DOCP setting in the AI tweaker section of your bios, which should be located in the advance menu. Anything older than a 3rd gen ryzen will have some trouble hitting the 3600 speed mark, but there may be enough support out there now that, that may not be the case. Anyways, I love the ram, and I'm sure you will as well, as long as you meet the requirement.",

After that, the ram timing is reset. Not sure what the issue is but I will not go with G Skill ever again.",
