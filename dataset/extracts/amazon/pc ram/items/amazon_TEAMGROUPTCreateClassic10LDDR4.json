In fact, I have transferred this particular kit between different systems and it is currently serving as the main memory in a dedicated Ryzen game server. While these sticks may not be the fastest on the market, they are more than sufficient for the majority of consumers considering their affordable price. If you are still using 8 GB or less of RAM in your older DDR4 system, upgrading to this kit would be a reliable choice. It's worth mentioning that Teamgroup has a strong track record of providing exceptional customer support. In the past, they have even offered me replacements for sticks that were damaged due to a motherboard issue.",
