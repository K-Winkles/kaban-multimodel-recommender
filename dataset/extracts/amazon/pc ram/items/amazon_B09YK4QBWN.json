I'm stable at 5000MHz, and could probably go higher, but like to play it safe.I'm disappointed that I can't get the full 5600MHz, but can't blame G.Skill (or anyone else) for that. The mobo QVL has very few sticks listed as compatible for 4 32GB sticks (most are either 2 sticks, or 8/16GB). Hopefully a BIOS update will take care of it.Despite being a bit disappointed, I figure it deserves a full 5 stars: the RAM works perfectly and is stable. The only issue is not getting the 5600 speed, but I assume that is a motherboard issue, and G.Skill shouldn't lose any stars for that.",
