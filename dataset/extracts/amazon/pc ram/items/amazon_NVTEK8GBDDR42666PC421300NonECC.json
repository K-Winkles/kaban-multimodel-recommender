                "reviewText": "Item arrived quickly, and was as described. Popped this single stick of RAM right into my motherboard to pair it with our existing single RAM stick (generic Chinese RAM which ships standard with Lenovo MoBo), and it worked like a charm! NOTE: I DID NEED TO REBOOT THE SYSTEM TWICE before Windows recognized the additional RAM, but a quick trip to the BIOS settings showed the system board DID recognize it on first boot, so this may have been more of a Windows10 issue rather than a hardware issue. But it's been a solid week of observation, and the thing works and performs great! Computer is much faster, programs load better, websites load faster, system doesn't hang anymore.It is hard to tell how long RAM will last, but in my experience RAM either works right from the start, or not at all. But once it's working, RAM usually lasts for the life of the system (or longer). I've never really seen a system fail due to RAM module failure (although I'm sure it's possible).I took care to match the RAM stick I bought with the stick I had in both speed (MHz) AND voltage (something not talked about as much). My current RAM runs at a 1.2v (as determined by CPU-Z), and so that's why I purchased this particular product because it matched all 3 measures of my current RAM: capacity, speed, and voltage. When pairing RAM, speed and voltage really should match. Manufacturer and capacity not as important (IMHO).In short, once you know what you need, this is a great brand of RAM at a great price. Would buy again, or for my next system.",

It's decently priced at around 33$, it looks plain, but thanks to it's black PCB it will still look good in your build. And it just works, it also includes a lifetime warranty for peace of mind, but only time will tell if the company actually holds up to it. Will update the review if anything bad happens, but at this point I can recommend this RAM kit.",
