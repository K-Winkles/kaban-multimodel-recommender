                "reviewText": "A bit pricy but A- tech has yet to fail me.Originally the Toshibas above were only spec'd out to run 4GB ram memory. But if you have a 64 bit OS like Linux or WIndows XP/7/8/10 and also have a 64 bit processor you can put 8 GB (2 x 4GB) of ram into these machines.Upgrade the processor (800 MHZ FSB max with the GL40 chipset) with something like an Intel T9500 core 2 duo or lower, switch to an SSD drive, and upgrade the wireless card with an Intel AC 7260 and you have a real screamer of a laptop for a media server or a simply way to surf the web at over 800 mbs/sec. (if your router and ISP are up to the job).These laptops were made in 2009 and still handle windows well with the upgrades. It might not be great for more modern games that require high end graphics cards/chips but it can definitely go retro without a hitch.Currently I am running windows 8.1 64-bit and the system is a real screamer. Perfect for a budget rebuild. I max out my ISP transfer rates at 200 mb/s. These upgrades are perfect for a child's first computer.",
