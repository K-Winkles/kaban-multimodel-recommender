                "reviewText": "My biggest gripe (which is for all laptop memory with heat spreaders) is about the heat spreaders being on the same side for both modules. I would prefer that a kit comes with the heat spreaders on opposite or both sides because it may or may not be healthy for a PCB to have heat dissipating directly towards the motherboard. I'd prefer both heat spreaders to releasing heat towards the bottom cover for the laptop.In any case this memory works as expected. I was expecting a 20% boost moving from a single channel configuration and this memory did its job. It has a slightly lower/faster cas latency which isn't really all that noticeable but it is nice knowing that it operates just a smidge quicker.",
