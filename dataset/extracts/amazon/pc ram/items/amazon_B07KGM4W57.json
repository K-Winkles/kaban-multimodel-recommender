The one I used on their site suggested a different brand but again, it being an all in one I was not hopeful. I reached out to their seller page by message and asked if they had ram to fit my hp all in one, they responded less than 24 hours later with the correct product they had that would and i purchased an upgrade to that immediately. It showed up a day sooner than expected and took less than 10 minutes to install thanks to youtube. All in all, customer service plus product being perfect, it was a great buy. Would do business with again in the future.",
