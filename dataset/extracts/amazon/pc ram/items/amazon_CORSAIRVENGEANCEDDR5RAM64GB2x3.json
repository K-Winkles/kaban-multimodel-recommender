Given the pickiness of the Ryzen CPU and the chipset, I just accepted that as part of the deal. And with this new rig I expected similar issues, so I went for a really high-rated memory to hopefully get to 6000 speeds with some downclocking.Boy. I was wrong. These sticks, after simply instructing my BIOS to use their \"overclocking\" profile data (which it technically is, running these sticks at 6600), run 100% stable (OCCT stress test for more than twelve hours with Furmark also running to mess up my GPU) at their advertised speeds and timings - CL32-39-39-76 (verified with CPU-Z).GET THESE! They're awesome.",
