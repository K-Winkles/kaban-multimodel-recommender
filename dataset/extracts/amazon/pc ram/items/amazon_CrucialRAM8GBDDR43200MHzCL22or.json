The packaging was a nice easy to open plastic packaging that did not require scissors and did not cut my fingers when opening. Opening the Vostro was way more effort than the RAMs packaging. Highly recommend Crucial as a brand for RAM.",

The stick paired perfectly with my existing ram and everything is running at 2933mhz. There is a noticeable difference in speed and total performance.

The module easily fit into the appropriate slot on my motherboard, and I had no issues connecting it properly. The fact that Crucial provides clear instructions and reliable support made the whole process smooth and hassle-free.Once installed, I immediately noticed a significant improvement in my computer's overall speed and responsiveness. The additional 8GB of memory has allowed me to multitask seamlessly, and I no longer experience any frustrating lag or slowdowns, even when running resource-intensive applications.
