                "reviewText": "This gave me a nice memory upgrade for a Dell USFF 990. It is only rated by Dell for 8GB but since CPU handles ram I read that it actually would support 16 or 32. 16GB was plenty for my needs and made a difference for sure. I like to keep a lot of things and tabs open so routinely I would get to 95% ram usage and it would start to slow down. Now I run around 55% usage with everything open and it keeps going fine!",

                "reviewText": "Old work Dell Optiplex 3010 DT Small form factor workstation PC. Did bios update, then it accepted this 16Gb of ram without issue and registers it just fine. (Again after bios update) manual and everything online says 8GB max but again these worked just fine and again registers as 16GB of Ram in Windows 10 64 bit home. Again old Work PC, Intel Core i5 3450, that had 4GGB of ram was going to be donated or recycled, replaced with this 16Gb of ram, a MSI LP GTX 1650 (yes it runs on the 240 watt power supply) disconnected the DVD drive, no need and less power draw and replaced Hard Drive with 2TB SSD. (also less power draw than regular HD) Runs perfect at 4K 60Hz as a HTPC that also fits perfectly in my stereo rack. Also replaced dell fan with cable adapter (needed to replace dell fans) and Noctua fan for increased airflow as it did get pretty warm before swapping the dell fan for a much more proficient and better intake fan. (Now stays fairly cool - but cool enough) Even plays some moderate games at 1080p and at some decent frame rates, but main purpose is 4K HTPC and great fairly inexpensive box to modify as aforementioned.Good ram, I am pleased with the purchase and price and for my need.",

However, after doing research at the Dell forums, I found a person who had upgraded to 32Gb of RAM and had done so 6 years ago. The post indicated that he haven't had any problem since then. Anyway I took the risk and I'm happy I did. Brought back life to my Bob the Builder PC (I work, play and do media in it).Excellent product with full compatibility.",
