It IS a little of a pain in the bu** to get them installed on the ReadyNAS (just very tight space) but they work perfectly once installed. Have bought several sets. Will buy again of need arises.",

                "reviewText": "When I began to randomly get the dreaded \"blue screen\" I tested my old Optiplex 760's memory at startup by pressing the F12 key and, sure enough, there was a memory problem. Rummaging around on the web I found a description of the memory in this machine and did a search on Amazon. A huge number of choices came up but I picked this one based on the reviews about the reliability of the company and the support. It came a day early, was packaged professionally and the information on the package and the leaflet was obviously written by someone who was both knowledgable and proficient in English -- something that is becoming increasingly rare these days when instructions are often incomprehensibly written by a person struggling with a second language. There was a little card enclosed with installation hints, troubleshooting tips, a support number, and a believable promise of satisfaction. The memory installed without a hitch, fit perfectly in the slots in the computer, and worked flawlessly as well as passing the startup diagnostic tests when I ran them. I'll use A-Tech again!",

                "reviewText": "Bought the 1 GB per stick version: 2GB kit (1GBx2) DDR2 PC2-6400 DESKTOP Memory Modules (240-pin DIMM, 800MHz) Genuine A-Tech Brand For two sets of 1 GB pairs, the speeds matched, timings matched, and no problems detected through a 24 hour run of Memtest86+ (13 passes total through the 4 GB).If you're still reading then I suppose you may not know what you're fully getting (in terms of the product itself). A little backstory, DDR2 has been replaced quickly ever since DDR3 came out like 8 years ago. I don't think any manufacturer makes new DDR2 sticks for that reason, especially with DDR4 soon to repeat that history.Imagine hundreds of thousands of computer towers recycled/scavenged with those DDR2 DIMMs still lying within its chassis. Millions of obsolete sticks in storage boxes. Then for whatever reason, you've now ended up needing DDR2 again because you didn't want to let go of that HP/Dell/Acer/etc tower because \"it still worked\". It perhaps had 2 or 3 GB inside, and mix and match speeds, might even have been running in Single channel all this time, finally needing to set things right (instead of putting it out to pasture). I had a tower lying around with a AMD Athlon 64 X2, their first dual core CPUs. I had a choice between finding an upgrade to the CPU (which would have made the bigger difference, though not worth the effort), or at least making sure the ram was not the bottleneck (I could not even watch YouTube @ 1080p without hiccups).So what are you getting from \"Genuine A-Tech Brand\"? Refurbished DIMMs.In my case CPU-Z stated one pair came from lifetimememory, while the other pair is from Nanya (which included serial number/manufacturing date), That's definitely not a problem, ram is ram, so as long as it works at the listed specifications, which it does.After installing and running the checks, definitely a noticeable performance improvement from a 3GB, single channel setup (don't ask). YouTube @ 1080p worked fine at 30 FPS, but it still struggled for a full 60 FPS video (but a remarkable improvement). Netflix at least runs smoothly now, which was my main reason for keeping it and hooking up to a TV. Upgrading ram may not work for all scenarios, but for mine it's no longer ram, but a CPU bottleneck confirmed.Why knock off one star? They put those stickers right on top of the memory modules. For the 2 GB sticks they may have them back/front and is unavoidable, but the 1 GB sticks had an empty backside they could have stuck their stickers on instead. The old DIMMs I pulled out had the stickers peeling off because the stickers were on the modules as well (and these were OEM sticks). Wouldn't warranty be voided if the stickers were removed, even if naturally peeling off? Then again, by that time I hope to not be needing a replacement.",

Very glad I found these.Ordered these sticks and had them delivered to my wife's parent's place in HI on our last visit. The pc booted up right away without issues. As soon as I could I copied \"My Documents\" and all important files to their OneDrive cloud storage.There were hundreds of family photos that dated back to 2009 that weren't backed up anywhere. We continued to use this desktop for the couple of weeks we were there without any hiccups.Good ram at a fair price and quick delivery. I can recommend this product.",
