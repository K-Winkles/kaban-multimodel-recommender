As Windows has grown, and has the amount of memory that web pages take up, I found my PC swapping out a lot with the hard drive, and sometimes Chrome would lockup for minutes on end when I had lots of tabs open (not uncommon for me to have 20+ tabs open at once).Adding this memory into my Dell's second slot a couple of months ago, which doubled my RAM from 8 to 16G, has prevented such slowdowns from recurring. I haven't had any problem with this memory thus far and am extremely happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "After much price comparison (and soul searching) I decided to upgrade my ASUS desktop computer's RAM: if you are serious about multicore CPUs (multicore CPUs offer potentially greater benefit than overclocking a single CPU core) then you provide ample RAM. I've had good experience with Kingston RAM upgrade earlier purchases, the Kingston website suggested this DIMM matched pair, and Kingston suggested upgrades had the lowest price. I bought this DIMM matched pair kit, I removed my single existing DIMM, and I installed the Kingston DIMM pair. Now I learn that my ASUS motherboard uses dual-channel RAM: it is good that I purchased matched DIMMs.DIMMs are static-sensitive; you must follow the rules. During the installation I wore non-static rubber-soled jogging shoes; I kept my knees pressed against the metal desk's walls; the desktop computer was completely unplugged; I wore a cheap anti-static wrist strap clipped to the desktop computer's chassis; and I installed the DIMMs gently (the DIMMs and the DIMM sockets are precision equipment; applying muscle here only creates problems).Before the installation I downloaded MemTest86 free software, I built a MemTest86 bootable CD-ROM, and I verified that my pre-existing RAM was faultless. After the Kingston DIMM installation I verified that the Kingston DIMMs were faultless. I also verified that Windows 8.1 recognizes my upgraded RAM. I know that my Kingston RAM upgrade was successful and beneficial.",

                "reviewText": "I used this Kingston \"Value RAM\" to double my memory from 4GB to 8GB on a mainstream HP Windows desktop that came standard with 4GB of Kingston memory. Install was straightforward, and when I booted up the new memory was recognized immediately. Besides the additional RAM, I also now have a matched pair of memory sticks (2 X 4GB), and so I get increased memory bandwidth from this dual-channel configuration. Wow, my computer response really pops! I redid the \"Windows Experience Index\" evaluation, and subscore for Memory Operations per Second increased from 5.9 to 7.5. And since I'm using the integrated Intel HD 4400 graphics (which uses system memory), the subscore for Aero Graphics increased from 5.0 to 5.9. I'm a long-time Amazon customer, but was actually pointed to Amazon from the Kingston web site. I found the memory I wanted on the Kingston site, clicked the purchase button, and Amazon was one of the options--thank you Kingston & Amazon.",
