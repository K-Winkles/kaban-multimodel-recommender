                "reviewText": "I knew going in that I would probably not be able to run this at the 3600 mhz that it was rated to work at, when I installed it on my setup. I am currently running a Corsair Vengeance computer with an i7 11700 non k cpu, and a MSI Z490-A pro motherboard.Once installed and set to XMP it gave me the overclock error. I dropped it to 3200 mhz and it booted fine with no problems since. I am running bios E7C751Z1.2CB, or 2.CB is how CPU Z reads it.It should easily go higher, but I will have to play with the overclock settings and see how high I can get it to work while being stable. This kit is using Nanya chips, at least the sticks I have, which is fine.Even if it goes no higher, it has been a good upgrade from 16 gb. Things seem to run very smoothly and I have no problems running discord and surfing the web on my second monitor, while gaming on my main one. I have two 27\" MSI monitors side by side.The rgb looks great, and since I have a Corsair Vengeance computer already it just worked right off the bat with my icue software.I feel much better about having 32 gbs of memory for my future PC games. I also know that, although I have no plans too, in the future if I upgrade or change the motherboard and possibly the cpu, I can still use this memory and it will work fine at its rated speed of 3600 mhz.I have no cons. Corsair makes great memory and other computer components, and this memory was a great value at this low of a price in the summer of 2023.",

These are massive though, so if you don't have a lot of room, maybe look for something else (see picture comparing to old RAM).While the physical sticks are great, I did take 1 star because I am not a fan of their software, iCUE, for lighting. It is not very straightforward and confusing as hell. Fix the software and you'll get the star back",
