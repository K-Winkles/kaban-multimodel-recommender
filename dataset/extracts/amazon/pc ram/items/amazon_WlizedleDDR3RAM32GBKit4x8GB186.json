                "reviewText": "This was an upgrade to a workstation computer that had 16 gigabytes of RAM, being able to double the ram for 44 dollars was a easy decision. The ram caused zero problems once the system was turned back on. Benchmark scores were much higher and large files and other graphic tasks were easier and faster without the hard drive having to churn to deliver the data. The memory chips are slightly overclocked (14%) and have exhibited no issues. Bottom line if you are looking for some reliable DDR-3 ram, this will do the job.",

They seem to not snap in but they will with pressure for some odd reason but the computer will recognize it so I put it into another computer. That's a ddR3 that I just purchased for a retro system and it seems not to snap in either correctly even though it's the right way. So I put some stock rim in both motherboards to see if it was the ram. The other ram seems to snap in perfectly with no problems. I don't know what's going on with this rim but it does work but I don't recommend because it has a problem clipping into the rim slots on three or four different GDR3 motherboards that have no problems with the stock",
