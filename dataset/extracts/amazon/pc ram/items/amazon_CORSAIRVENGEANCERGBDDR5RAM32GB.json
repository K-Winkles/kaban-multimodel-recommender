Snapping the RAM dimms (sticks) into their slots is a breeze, and you don't have to worry about breaking these RAM dimms when pushing them in. Furthermore, the RGB that comes on this ram works seamlessly with Corsair's free iCue software (to be downloaded by user) to create an immersive custom RGB experience, or even just to turn it off when needed!",
