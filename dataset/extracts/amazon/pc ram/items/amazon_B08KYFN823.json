                "reviewText": "Set-up MSI B550 with AMD 5600X. Was still using DDR4 2400 overclocked to 2800. So the move to 3200 should be awesome, not so much, it is okay. At DDR4 2800 old memory, Passmark score 3,144, memory latency 46. This ram can be overclocked, but it was tricky. First it did not recognize the memory and would not boot, had to clear CMOS. Once in DDR2666 is what this memory defaulted, so changed everything back in BIOS, change RAM to DDR4-3200, timings 16-18-18-18-38 (yes there is additional timing in MSI settings), Passmark 3457. Now to the overclocking, DDR4-3800 failed every time. So I decided on DDR4-3600, the initial timings failed, but the interesting part. When I went back into the BIOS went to the timing the motherboard had suggested timing (no it would not auto tune these to these timings). The final working and stable 20-19-19-19-43, Passmark result 3548, latency 43. However one other interesting thing occurred, my processor is running faster. I have the 5600X overclocked previous Passmark 23,838, moved 24,012, not significant 1% but interesting. Next steps is can I adjust the PBO curve even further at 15 (negative) currently on all cores, to see if this has any relationship the fabric clock improvement. As the fabric clock is at 1800 for now which is its max I think I will keep it at this speed. Being that DDR5 is around the corner, this is a good purchase until the next evolution. When purchased they were $140 32GB versus others running at $94 for 16GB from almost everyone else. But this has RGB and it is controlled by the motherboard. I do have increase in my SSD from 14k to 16k in Passmark, but that could be just by chance always get big swing on this rating, otherwise no other noticeable improvements. Now more storage for large video file editing, tons of other things I do I my PC, now back to the games...UPDATE, without getting into the sub timings, I have a stable and fastest timing for the RAM at DDR4 3600, 18-19-19-39 (or MSI 18-19-19-19-39. This improved the Passmark result slighting to 3603, a slight drop in latency to 42. No other system performance gains. Userbenchmark has the latency at 60 ns., with multi-core at 39.7 GB/s and single core at 34.5 GB/s.",
