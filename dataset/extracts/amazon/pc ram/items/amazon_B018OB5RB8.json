                "reviewText": "So, I purchased this set of 32GBs for my ASUS Z170 motherboard, which already had a 16GBs kit of the older Dual Channel memory; G.Skill (2 x 8GB) Ripjaws IV Series. Today marks the 1 month of moderate usage.Originally, I wanted to increase the memory because I will be doing a good chunk of HD AVCHD video recording and editing. In addition to this, a few times in the past, this computer locked up into slug mode and/or crashed because it ran out of memory with too many Apps open and too many Chrome tabs active.So, I was uncertain if this newer version (G.Skill Ripjaws V Series) would work with the older IV (4) Series.Once it arrived, I installed it alongside the older memory sticks and it appeared to run flawlessly.With the Amazon guarantee of return within a limited time, I also decided to put these two sticks, and then all 4 sticks together through extensive memory testing; all together it was over 21 hours of continuous multiple tests using both HCi Design's MemTestPro and the popular MemoryTest86.Result: All memory sticks, 48GBs of dual channel, came through with flying colors.I only needed to increase the memory to 32GBs, but, for the price and the uncertainty of not working well with the older series, I went with this kit of 32GBs.Good news! Now I will never run out of memory in this machine.ps: It arrived in extremely fast timing.",
