                "reviewText": "Update: I tried reseating the RAM sticks, and everything seems to work perfectly normally. I feel silly for not trying that before writing the review, but yay for the edit button.Original:When I have XMP enabled on a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Elite AX, games tend to crash to desktop (CTD). When I disable XMP, I don't get CTDs. I performed a DRAM test with OCCT with XMP on and off, and only XMP off is stable.I'm unsure if it's the motherboard's fault or this RAM's.These sticks are models F5-6000J3040G32GA2-RS5K with Hynix chips. Gigabyte's memory support lists nearly the same (\"GX2\" instead of \"GA2\") with Samsung chips. Apparently, the only difference between GX and GA is vendor designation, where GA is designated for the Racerspeed vendor on Amazon.Regardless, I ordered a new set of GX sticks (which may or may not come with Samsung chips, it's unclear) from Newegg to see if there's any difference. I'll try to update.",

I used to have a bunch of frame stutters and lag when using only a 16GB kit that was rated for 5000mhz on some games like fortnite, siege, and even rocket league. I installed this ram, something weird happened it wasn\u2019t going above 4000mhz but then i went into the bios and set it to 6000mhz and it was still displaying 4000mhz in task manager. So I had to go into the bios again, instead of 6000mhz i set it to 6200mhz. Boom it worked great and is 200mhz over what its rated and i\u2019m very happy its super stable and no more lag stutters!",
