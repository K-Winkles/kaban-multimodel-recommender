Definitely not low profile and they are not visually pleasing to look at. Good thing I don't have a glass side panel otherwise I would've spent the extra $40 and just got regular DIMMs.",

But it will not work at 3200.Not surprised.But it could work at DDR4-3200 if it had attenuators (resistors) on all the signal lines. The problem is at higher speeds too much of reflected signals to and from the ram begins to overlap with the proceeding data transfer. This is due to the introduction of another connector and stub lines that go between the motherboard DIMM socket and the SO-DIMM socket. Someone should make a converter with resistors on all the signal lines to fix this. The downside is you might have to run the DIMMs and IMC at higher voltage to compensate but it would work.The maximum frequency I was able to achieve was 1333MHz (DDR4-2666)",
