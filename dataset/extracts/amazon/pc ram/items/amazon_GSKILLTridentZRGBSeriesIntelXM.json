                "reviewText": "Some of the ratings questions are tough to answer, ease of installation? It's RAM, it's all the same to install, so if you think RAM is hard to install, this will follow suit.Anyways, its RAM, you want to make sure you put the 2 sticks in the correct DIMMS, usually alternating, make sure then lock into place (and make sure you unlock the little tab before trying to slide these in)Its a good value to performance ratio, and has the cool glowing RGB on top if that's your thing.There are faster options out there, and there are cheaper options. But for what it is, I think it's a quality RAM. I've had 2 of these installed in my gaming rig for I believe 3 years now with no issues, and added another 2 when I purchased these.When buying RAM, make sure its the correct DDR for your motherboard, and find out what speed your rig supports. You'll want to use the same type/speed/size if you upgrade again, so if you buy 2 sticks now, you'll want to buy this same set in the future to have all 4 slots used.As far as RAM goes I mean, it's a little tight fit next to each other with all 4, due to the heatshield/RGB but they fit just fine.If you put them in and then get any issues with your machine starting up, make sure the sticks are pushed in all the way and the clips lock in place.If you try everything and still get issues, return them, sometimes RAM will be DOA, and a bad RAM stick will make your pc not start up correctly.I did NOT have any of those issues, just trying to be helpful, these have worked great for me. And with modern computing using more and more RAM just for the OS and web browsing, having an extra 16gb will certainly help.",

                "reviewText": "The only brand of RAM I've used in my systems is G.Skill. Over the course of last year, I had the urge to spice my rig up with some proper RGB lighting. I knew this RAM kit was popular and reliable so I went with them. Typical with any RAM swap, it was quick and easy and everything worked instantly. On to the RGB strips on this kit, they use a frosted diffuser which spreads the light very evenly. However, something that I can't help but notice is the lack of brightness when set to a bright color such as white. Every other RGB item in my case nails the white color, bright and very.. white. The LEDs on this kit, however, fail to match up to the brightness of my other hardware. Having an almost greyish-white and has a cold spot to top it off. So I settled with more forgiving colors that seem to blend much better, syncing with Razer Chroma and using the fire effect for my Dark Souls bonfire theme.",

Stable at the full 3600mHz, and it's very stable at high load/unload rates.Probably all you'd need for gaming. Really, all you'd need more memory for is CAD, video rendering, or running an ML algorithm, so I'm all good with this.Also even though it rates the CAS at 18, all of mine were fairly stable down to 16, so good candidate to try and tweak in your bios if you're into that.",

When I enabled DOCP, the system would repeatedly fail to POST before finally setting the RAM to default speed of 2133 MTS. I tried several times to manually overclock it well below the rated clock speed of 3600 MTS (including 3200, 3000, and 2800) but it failed each time. I finally relented and ran it at the stock 2133 MTS with no issues, including some benchmarks.When I replaced the 2400G with a Ryzen 7 5700G, the system booted up and overclocked the RAM to 3600 MTS with no issues. The benchmarks showed the expected high performance.",
