Asus released max memory support and high speed on the ROG Z790 E-wifi on a bios update, then my 4 sticks did not work, status 55, I removed 2 sticks and worked fine, but stutters were visible. I tried the 2 sticks 72kMTs and Call of Duty crashed, I tried the 2x32 6600 I tried the regular 2 stick 2x16 5600MTs and same issue. Then I check the Asus support memory support page and every single ram brand were not compatible, of course. But even one that was compatible also did not work, the Corsair Vengeance 2x32 at 6600MTs. Then I read a post online that COD works perfectly with this configuration, 2x16GB 6000 36-36-36-76 1.35 I play and play non stop for 4-5 hours and no crashes. these below are the brands that were having issues in COD, and the last that doesn't.Team T-Force Delta RGB (2 x 16GB) 6000 FF3D532G6000HC30DC01 30-36-36-76 - does not workTeam T-Force Delta RGB (2 x 16GB) 7200 FF3D532G7200HC34ADC01 34-42-42-84 - does not workCORSAIR Vengeance 2 x 32GB) 6600 CMK64GX5M2B6600C32 32-39-39-76 - does not workG.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series (2 x 16GB) 5600 F5-5600J2834F16GX2-RS5K 28-34-34-89 - does not workCORSAIR VENGEANCE (2x16GB) 6000 CMK32GX5M2D6000C36 36-36-36-76 - no issues. with XMPI hope this helps.",

The overall profile of the ram is low, and I was able to install it easily despite one of the memory slots being encroached upon by my large CPU heatsink/fan.The black and grey heatsink has some interesting textures and should look good with almost any colour scheme. This RAM is assembled in Taiwan.I\u2019m using this with my i7-13700K and Asus TUF Gaming Z690-Plus motherboard, and haven\u2019t had any stability issues running at 6000MHz.I used UserBenchmark to create benchmarks with default XMP settings (see screenshot attached):Corsair Vengeance 2 x 16GB @ 6000MHz / 36-36-36-76 timing selected by XMPMulti-core Read/write/mixed/average (GB/s, higher is better): 80.2/75.7/71.9/75.9Single-core Rear/write/mixed/average (GB/s, higher is better): 23/52.7/33/36.2Latency \u2013 66.6nsI also tried a using Crucial Pro 6000MHz RAM, but switched back to this as it performed better and was cheaper.Overall, I\u2019m really happy with the price and performance.",
