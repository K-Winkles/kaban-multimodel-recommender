                "reviewText": "I was nervous because this is my first time buying and installing memory on a iMac computer. I have a 2009 late iMac which comes with only 4gb of ram. I mostly use the computer for video editing in final cut pro, I use Lightroom, and adobe Photoshop. I was all was having crashes and my computer would freeze up while doing these programs. When editing my videos would be so darn sluggish in final cut pro to wear I wanted to just hang myself with a thread of yarn. The shipping was fast and the memory look so good in hand. I exchanged it with no problem. The computer booted up as normal but a tad bit faster. Once it came to the main screen it didn't take forever for programs to pull up which was amazing. I opened up Final Cut Pro and It's was quick. Not lighten fast but it was quick. I started editing some footage and mannnnnn!!! That joint was working way faster than before. My videos weren't skipping like before and my playbacks and imports were smooth. I've seen a big difference in my speed performance. If you need a boost..this memory will restore the walking dead. I do still have issues every now and then which isn't all the ram but the ram is solid and you should get it now if you need that boost.",

It's a late 2009 so I ordered a New battery, new fan, SSD, and more Ram. Apple said the most I could go was 4GB but I had read some where (OWC) I could go as much as 8GB. I was really undecided, ignore Apple and take a chance and just go big. I'm so glad I went big. As soon as I received my new RAM I installed it. It was the first item to arrive out of my order and I wanted to see if that change alone would make a difference. It made a huge difference. My laptop is like new. I can jump from page to page no waiting, no spinning dial, truly amazing. Now I'm thinking I really don't need to change out my Hard drive to Solid State, hard to imagine it running any better.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to upgrade the memory on my Mac Mini, mid-2010.Even though the specs officially say it only supports 8 GB of ram, with an EFI update, which everybody should already have, even if they're making a half-hearted attempt to do software updates on their Mac Mini, it can support 16 GB of ram.I took out the 4 GB (2 dimms) and replaced it with the 16 GB kit, and I booted it up, and it worked flawlessly.I'll also say that I thought about cheaping out and getting the 8 GB, but I'm happy I paid the extra amount for the 16 GB. When I looked at the memory used, it was already exceeding 8 GB (yes, I realize that OS X has its own algorithm and wouldn't have used that much had total memory been limited to 8 GB, but to me, it means that if things are unrestricted, OS X would have used >= 8 GB).This totally breathes new life into my Mac Mini, and I won't be replacing it *anytime* soon at all.",

                "reviewText": "Booted right up. Has some unusual behavior though. When this Mac Mini (2010) had only 2 gigs of ram the video on YouTube ran real slow. Now it is much faster and runs video much better and without hesitation. However, while running programs, the system does periodic time outs that last nearly a second. I don't if the memory has anything to do with it though. I was given this Mac to learn a specific program native to Mac. I am a lifetime Microsoft PC user. I was thinking of upgrading the HDD with an SSD. Other Mac Mini users have done this and it seemed to reportedly work out well for them. I have SSD on 2 different i7 PC notebooks and they are extremely fast. I'm thinking its a timing issue between the new ram and the dual-core cpu. Even though this ram is the same speed as the old ram, it may be too much for the cpu? If anyone has any takes on this to share, please do.Update and review change 1/19/2018I called OWC tech support today about the new memory I purchased from Amazon. When I called OWC wanted to establish where I got the memory. I found out it was from another vendor at Amazon. However, they were still very helpful and started a ticket. The tech, Chris T. was very helpful and gave me some recommendations to try out. My computer started behaving better afterward but still glitched out on me. This time it was for a much longer time 5-10 seconds. I then moved the Mac Mini in question and it glitched again. During the conversation with Chris he said it may be a video issue, in passing. Remembering that I grabbed the HDMI cable and got the Mac to glitch out on demand. It is a video issue. I wanted to give kudo's to Chris and OWC for the great tech support.",
