The two 8-Gig modules in this upgrade kit were easy to install. My PC is now running as well as it did when it was new. So far, it has also been very stable - no unexplained hangs or errors. Considering the relatively low price, this seems like a great deal to me. One that I would recommend to others without hesitation.",

The downside is that no matter what settings in put in for the ram timings, I could not get it to boot at DDR3-1600 speeds. It would only boot at 1333 (knocking down 1 start). However, this may not be the fault of the ram, as my Asus P6D mobo pre-dates XMP by quite a bit. In any case, this is good, stable, and inexpensive ram.",
