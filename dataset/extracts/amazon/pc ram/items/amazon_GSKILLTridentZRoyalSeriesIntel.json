Previously I had tried to use Crucial's 2 x 64GB, only to have an error code 53 come up on the motherboard's Dr. Doctor indicator. That code meant the Crucial's memory wasnt being detected. Amazon got these to me next day and after install, no error code 53, the PC posted the BIOS setup first shot. All 128GB available. Wow. They are even pretty cool with the color, but for me the performance of these are everything..I will provide a follow up post on their longevity and performance after I run them for a number of months. Suffice it to say, these are a great product and Im extremely pleased.Only one thing to make note of, watch your fingers when you push them into the slots on the motherboard as the shiny heatsinks can be a tad sharp especially when trying to snap them into their final positions. I used a small piece of a cut static bag to get them in and protect my fingers.",
