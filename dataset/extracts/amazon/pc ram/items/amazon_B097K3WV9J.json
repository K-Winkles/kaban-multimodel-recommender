I'm still running about 50% usage, but it feels so much better being able to have so many things open. This is my first experience upgrading RAM in a PC. I've done it on a Mac several times, but dang, you really have to push them in there to make the notch clip on. It feels like you're going to snap the motherboard in half. It scared me half to death. But I finally got it working. I know this RAM isn't as cheap as some other brands were offering, but I read a lot of reviews, and people tend to prefer the Kingston Fury. They seem very durable and a lot better manufactured than my XLR8s. I like that they're also smaller and just look better on your motherboard. I'll definitely consider this for any future upgrades. I know some day I'll probably want the 128GB.",

                "reviewText": "I live on my HP Omen 30L as if the computer is my liver. my computer came pre installed with 16g of ram and i was checking out upgrade options and was nervous on doing it myself. but I was glad I went ahead with this purchase.. the installation was a breeze from down under. HP omen 30l was so easy to open and put back together.. i first unlocked the case of the computer opening access to the motherboard I then released the 2 slots of ram allowing the new ram to be put into its place. I pushed down with the new ram until the sides locked the ram into place and a sound of clicking would be made when the completion of the ram was inserted. so my story is that i added onto the ram that was already installed on my computer thus going from 16g of ram to 48 g of ram so technically i added 2 X16g of ram in the open 2 slots that were available. they say not to mix and match other types of ram but lucky for me Kensington was being used in my computer and this type of ram on amazon is also a Kensington so it was a win win win for me. I gave the computer a good air duster cleaning before installing the ram only because dust was collecting because I smoked near the computer for about 6 months.. got all the dust off the mother board and fans as good as I could.. but I recommend using youtube.com in getting a more extensive comprehension of the ram installation .. but every computer is different so make sure you do your homework before jumping head first into this pond. \ud83d\ude0d I am never going back to 16g of ram ever after upgrading... i found out they don't makethe fury type of ram any more and the these from amazon were compatible with the old ram thus allowing me to add on to the ram rather than replacing.. thus giving me 48g of ram using 4 slots of ram. and they are rgb because my hp allows me to see into the computer.",

Since this is an HP PC with its own BIOS it has protection built in so not to overclock beyond the hardware's limit. XMP profile 1 showed 3600MHz but HP reduced it down to 3467 MHz. I attempted a custom profile with 3600MHz and the BEAST did not like it. It would not start-up but the BIOS automatically reduced it down to plug-n-play speed (2400 MHz). Regardless, I always use Kingston memory as it has proven reliable for me and works well in all of our PCs. Even HP uses the brand for its gaming PCs so can't go wrong.",
