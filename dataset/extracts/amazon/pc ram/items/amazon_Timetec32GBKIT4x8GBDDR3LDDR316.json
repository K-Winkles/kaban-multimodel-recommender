                "reviewText": "Ordered this ram upgrade for my refurbished HP EliteDesk 800 G1. Photo shows \"before\" memory upgrade which consisted of 2 4GB memory modules (8GB total). This is a \"mini\" PC (only about 10 X 10 inches) so only 2 memory memory slots.PC seemed to run OK with 8GB (max possible was 16GB) but Google seemed to often not load a new internet screen without using \"Reload\" from a drop-down menu. Online search suggested that problem may be insufficient ram. So, I figured that more ram at least couldn't hurt.There seem to be many different suppliers to choose from at many prices. I wanted to replace the 2 4GB modules with 2 8GB modules (16GB total). Perhaps a single 16 GB module would have worked but I didn't want to add any more unknowns than necessary so I wanted 2 8GB modules.In the HP, the ram modules are readily accessible and easily removed and replaced. Not swapping ram in and out much anymore, the module configuration specification numbers were to some extent undecipherable to me. So, I looked for replacements that had most if not all of the same specifications. Furthermore, it was not exactly clear if the offer (price) was for one or two modules. THESE modules had the exact numbers plus said \"kit\" so I knew I was getting 2 modules.Installation was literally a 1 minute job! Of course, be careful and concerned about physical damage and ESD damage. I took a number of photos before replacement including photos of the various external cable connections. I further cloned the internal SSD drive to an external drive that I regularly use for weekly clones.At startup after upgrading, the BIOS recognized that the ram configuration had changed and showed \"press F1\" to do something. In the \"old\" days, you HAD to go into the BIOS and agree or set the new size. Here, I just pressed any key without getting into the BIOS and the PC successfully booted into W10. I could visually see that speed of had increased. Next, had to verify that everything was working.Everything except my USB sound speakers was working fine. I didn't see how the memory upgrade could possibly affect sound. Online suggested to \"reload\" the sound driver. I did and this fixed it. Haven't seem the Google \"reload\" requirement.In summary, easy, safe upgrade for me and good price and quality - they work!",

                "reviewText": "I had an old laptop with 4 GB of RAM in it that I wanted to upgrade to its max, and convert to a Linux PC. This product made that process go smoothly. Installation was easy, but this will definitely vary based on your comfort level with disassembling laptops for RAM upgrades. Some laptops make this easy, while others require you to remove their motherboard for a full upgrade.That being said, this RAM fit into the old laptop easily because I made sure the form factor was the same. I'm not expecting extremely fast RAM, based on what the maximum spec for this generation is. That being said, everything seems sufficiently fast for me on this older PC now that I've installed this. If you have an old PC that you would like to change into a productivity computer for not very intense use cases, I would recommend this.",

I like this pos, perfectly great looking 17\" laptop other than super slow to boot up, open apps, basically slow at anything you want to do. I decided if ram upgrade didn't improve speed, I would retire this old gal. Well, with a ram installed and fingers crossed I booted her up. Took 5 minutes to think and go thru new ram recognition. But after it finally opened, she is on fire and as good as new or even better. Opens up excel, illustrator, photoshop simultaneously, literally less than 5 seconds flat. I nearly fell off the chair, doing cartwheels as I write this review. Just pissed I didn't think to ram up sooner. I love it, I recommend it 100%. Also, ram came super fast.",
