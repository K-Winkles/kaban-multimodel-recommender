                "reviewText": "UPDATE (7/9/2022):I stopped using this memory module a few weeks ago. I had it in my Centos 7 server and the server would crash (kernel panic) at random times for no reason. The error logs pointed to hardware issues related to either CPU or Memory, it's very hard to define specifically at that level. So I started with a memory replacement, I took the Simmtec module out of the system and installed a different manufacturer in the server. The server has been crash free for several weeks. I'm very disappointed with reliability issues in such a crucial component, and I can't recommend this product. Downgrading my rating to 1 star.-------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I paired this module with a 16GB 2400Mhz module that I already had in my system (for a total of 32GB of RAM), but the computer wouldn't boot. I installed each module separately and the computer boots just fine. I reset the BIOS, played with the settings (switched XMP on, off and back on), tried different slots, but nothing worked.The motherboard is a brand new $400 Gigabyte Z590 Aorus Master.I still gave this module 3 stars because it works on its own (I am currently using it for my CentOS server, it's the only RAM module on it) and chances are it would pair up fine with a second identical module. Still, it should work with a different module since the specs are the same/compatible, hence the 2 stars removed.",

                "reviewText": "Having an early generation Ryzen system 'workstation' I needed more ram for my VMs that operate a few older programs. Luckily the ram in my system is only 2666Mhz so I am not really taking a huge performance loss with mixing in RAM modules.Luckily, the ram was plug-n-play with my system but couldn't change any timings or OC for its life; I tried to get it to play nice with just the single stick but couldn't get anything to stay reliable enough for everyday use - so if you plan to get this don't expect anything other than the advertised timings with 2666Mhz.It works fine though after stress testing the ram for an entire day and having yet to see any memory-related issues pop up.",

Still, it does the basic job just fine, although it does not seem to like being paired with the 2666 memory in my Alienware (don't judge me) computer. As long as I run it on its own channel, it is happy and a good value. I would guess that two of these would work fine together and I have had the same issue with some more expensive brands with my computer.",
