                "reviewText": "I think the cards I got were working because I ran memtest and they passed but for whatever reason my MOBO did NOT like them when I tried using them booted into windows.I was getting constant BSOD. Different errors every time. So if your MOBO is the same as mine get something different. I tried manually setting the clock speed to 2666Mhz, I tried manually setting the clock speed lower (which made it slightly more stable), I tried upping the Voltage all the way up to 1.4V (again slightly more stable). Final ALMOST stable setting was at 2133 Mhz at 1.4V and I would still BSOD at least once a day. It just didn't like the memory for whatever reason.If you have a different set up then give it a shot. I don't think the memory was the issue. I think it was a compatibility issue with my MOBO. This is only a warning for people who have a similar setup.My system specs are:CPU: i5-6600K 3.3GhzGPU: GTX 970MOBO: ASUS Z170 Pro GamingI just put in different RAM and my PC is back to working flawlessly.If you have the same MOBO look into the G.SKILL RIPJAWS DDR4-3200. It's slightly more expensive but it has better performance and most importantly, it is stable with the setup I have.",

I picked up 4x 32GB Kits for a 128GB setup on an older X99 platform with a 12 core Xeon and a 2070 Super graphics card. Zero issues. I ran each kit through 4 passes of memtest and all passed. So far very happy.",
