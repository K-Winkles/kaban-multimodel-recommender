If you receive an error message or hear a series of beeps, the system may not recognize the new memory. Remove and reinstall the modules to ensure that they are firmly seated in the slots. 2. If your system fails to boot, check all connections within your computer. It is easy to poke and unplug a cable, which disables devices like the hard drive or CD-ROM. 3. When the system reboots, a message may appear asking you to update the configuration settings. Please refer to the instruction manual for more information. 4. If you receive a memory mismatch message, follow the instructions to enter the setup menu, and then select Save and Exit. (This is not a bug, some systems will need to do this to update system settings.) 5. If it doesn't work on your devices, carefully clean the connecting figure (golden finger) with an eraser.",
