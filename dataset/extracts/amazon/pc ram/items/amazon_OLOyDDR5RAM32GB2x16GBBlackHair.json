The lights themselves look fairly handsome, but I cannot STAND that they don't sync automatically.Even when they're in the same deck, even when they start at the same time, I tried everything but can't get them to sync. With the waterfall / cascading effect they are going for, it makes it all the more obnoxious to see the light animation being played syncopated between the two.",

I installed this ram (2x8GB) in a Gigabyte B450M Aorus motherboard.Pros:-RGB works well w/ Gigabyte RGB Fusion.-Ram is speedy, as expected.-Overall aesthetics are nice (I have the Red version)-Cost is very competitive and reasonable.-3000 clock is just fine most any gaming and typical usage.Cons:-The sticks are bigger and slightly wider than some other sticks on the market.Overall, I'm very much satisfied with this ram. It's performed as advertised and expected; of equal importance, it looks great and the RGB has synced perfectly fine with the RGB fusion software for my Gigabyte B450M Aorus board. I've not had any issues with compatibility, performance, or defect. Further, I've been able to slightly overclock this ram via bios settings and it was totally stable; I've since brought it back to normal settings because I don't think increasing the clock speeds accounts for any noticeable difference in day to day performance. I would highly recommend this ram to anyone looking for good DDR4 Ram with RGB capability at a very reasonable price!",

                "reviewText": "When my son\u2019s 3rd generation i5 gaming system wouldn\u2019t accept the upgrade of a modern video card I had to make a decision: New motherboard or new system. We decided to build a new system and this OLOy Memory DDR4 16GB (2x8GB) 3000 MHz CL16 1.35V 288-Pin Desktop Gaming UDIMM for Intel (MD4U083016IBDA) being only slightly higher in price than 16GB of DDR3 helped make that decision. Up until now his system only had 8GB of RAM.I\u2019ve not run any benchmarks, but I\u2019ve not had any issues with the new build. No issues installing, the motherboard lists the correct speed, and everything is running smoothly. It also matches his case red/black theme nicely. I\u2019d recommend it and buy it again.",
