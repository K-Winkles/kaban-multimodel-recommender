Installed it on my desktop PC, and the kit ran well without any issues thanks to my motherboard automatically lowering the max speed down to 2666 MHz. Now I don't have to worry about Edge taking up RAM space sitting at a comfortable 10GB, leaving me headroom! This is an amazing product I highly recommend if you are on an AMD build. Also works for Intel builds as well. Make sure your chosen motherboard is compatible with it with BIOS updates.",
