I did not really want RGB LEDs, but during the installation, I found this feature to be helpful because when the machine was booted, I could instantly see which of the DIMMS were illuminated. In fact, I needed to re-seat the RAM a few times to get all of the DIMMs to register. At first, the machine set the frequency to 2133 MHz, but after going into the UEFI BIOS and manually setting the frequency to 3200 MHz, DRAM voltage to 1.35 volts, and timings to 16-18-18-36, I was able to run the RAM at its rated speed. Installation was relatively easy and considering current prices, this RAM was a fairly good value for the money.",

Who has two thumbs and installed the RAM without verifying the timings had been updated? This guy! :)The RAM runs great paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and Asus ROG Strix X570-E Gaming motherboard (BIOS version 2407). I ran Memtest86 for ten hours (2 full passes) to verify the RAM was fault-free before booting into Windows 10. Ran a couple of 3DMark benchmarks to make sure the RAM could handle gaming, as well.Though the default Rainbow RGB pattern makes lovely colors, it gets old fast with how bright they are. iCUE quickly fixed that.Over the next few weeks I will keep burning them in with gaming, Chrome tabs, virtualization, video editing, photo processing, and more. Should I come across any adverse findings, I will update my review appropriately!",

After a few days, they finally responded to me saying that \"due to discrepancies with my receipt\" they could not assist me. My receipt was the saved PDF of Amazon's invoice, one which they can easily cross-reference with Amazon to ensure it's legit. They literally made up an excuse to not honor my warranty.DO NOT BUY. Not only is there a chance of the RAM corrupting, there's a chance Corsair won't RMA it either!",

                "reviewText": "There is not much I can say for the memory itself, it's well built and crushes the competition. As for the software, that is a different story. I have an ASUS current motherboard and the Corsair iCue software requires that I have ASUS Aura installed so it can control Aura RGB lighting. Well, if you want everything to work well together then you better have all RGB hardware baring the Corsair name. If you don't then good luck my friend because you are in for annoyances and difficult to find solutions. First noticeable annoyance is a hardware disconnect sound every time the iCue software starts. Secondly you will not want iCue to control Asus Aura devices if you have other name brand products in your system (Like a Coolermaster AIO cooler). Other name brand RGB product's lighting can freeze up especially if they use a 5V addressable headers on the motherboard. In the end I could not get rid of the Disconnect sound but I was able to disconnect iCue software from controlling ASUS Aura devices by deleting the ASUS plugin from the Corsair Plugins folder. If they fix their software and give clear easy instructions that are easily accessible and easy to read then I will gladly give a 5 star rating.",
