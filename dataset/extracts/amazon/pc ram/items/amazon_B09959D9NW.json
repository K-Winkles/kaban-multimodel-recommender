                "reviewText": "I have been using Corsair's RGB Pro SL in another computer. I needed more ram for a 2nd computer, so I ordered the v-Color Prism Pro. After using this ram I believe it is a better value than Corsair's RGB Pro SL. It runs at its advertised speed after enabling the XMP Profile, is less expensive and the RGB is brighter than the Corsair's RGB. The RGB is controllable with Gigabytes RGB Fusion 2.0. Just make sure you have downloaded the latest version of the RGB software from Gigabyte. I have just ordered 4 more sticks of this ram and will no longer be buying ram from Corsair.",

I asked them if these were the same and I could just buy another set of 2 and go. They said yes after confirmation of original date of purchase of my last dimms. So I ordered up 2 more. Got them this week and went to install them and realized the latency values are different (slower) than the other dimms I have. It's not listed on here but the 2 pack has a latency of 16-20-20-38 and the single sticks have values of 16-18-18-38 (which is listed on here for the single sticks) so I'm taking away a star, because I got wrong answers from the seller and cuz their 2 pack dimms don't match their single sticks.That being said, I'm buying 2 single sticks and running them cuz this ram is awesome other than the compatibility of the latency.",
