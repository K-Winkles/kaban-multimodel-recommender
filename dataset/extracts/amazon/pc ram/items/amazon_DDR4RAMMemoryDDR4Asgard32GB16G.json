This option was not made available at first, or while I was on the phone with customer service. I was able to get a replacement set in, and my system's been running smooth as silk since. Updated rating to four stars, because the new product is working well, but the company never even responded to me, and this was a pain.I installed this RAM, and gave my old chips to a friend with the same set up. Ever since installing this, my computer has been crashing with memory management and hardware defect errors roughly every 2-3 hours. These have included: PFN_LIST_CORRUPT, bad pool caller, and I think 3 separate other memory errors- all with the likely cause of defective RAM. I reached out to the company a week ago to request replacement, and have not gotten a response. This is on my work computer, and it is happening even when not in active use. I've made no other modifications to my system, and this started literally about 3 hours after installation. I've made sure my bios was up to date, had to minimize all other RAM usage components, and I'm still having these issues.",
