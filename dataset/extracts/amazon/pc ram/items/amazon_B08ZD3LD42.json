                "reviewText": "Bought two of the V-Color 8GB (1 x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 2666MHz (PC4-21300) CL19 1.2V U-DIMM Desktop Memory (TD48G26S819-VC) for a total of 16G and $58.44 shipped to my door step.V-Color is a nice refreshing change over components of late with names like Xtreem PulverizzzEr RGB Octane 2000 ROG or some silly nonsense. Didn't have to pay extra for a heatsink that sinks no heat nor pay extra for flashy blinky lights that increase the price, but provide no real value.Back to the RAM, I plugged them into my MSI Performance Gaming AMD X470 Plus with a Ryzen 5 2600x along side some Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3000MHz C15 RAM.Booted right to the BIOS, and set speed to 3000. Rebooted without issue and continues to work fine.I can't speak to the long term durability of these bad boys, but 16G for $58.44 righto my doorstep is a tad bit unreal. But, is very real.",

They don\u2019t ever get hot, so the heat sink isn\u2019t really something to worry about. The max temps I\u2019ve gotten are around 27\u00b0 C but my case runs hot. Excellent value for the money.
