                "reviewText": "I had bought these Kingston memory chips for my AMD Threadripper workstation. I do a lot of graphics, both 2D and 3D and computer graphics take a lot of computer resources to make them work. I had placed in A-TECH chips, but the motherboard would not allow all the memory slots taken up with memory chips. So, I bought these and replaced the A-TECH chips with them. Installing the chips were no problem. The computer worked fine and was working (and still is) working well. Only thing is if I use the 3600 Profile on my memory settings in the bios and start working on a graphics program, the computer crashed big time. So, I set the memory profile back to Auto and have had no problems since then. Yet, the computer has not really sped up as it should have with more memory, but I can do a bit more than I used to! One slight issue I have is with the delivery guy. He left the package with the memory chips on the driveway where they could have been crushed by someone's vehicle or someone taking them because they were in complete sight for everyone to see.",
