Only 4 single channel sticks will work. These are dual channel and my B650 Gaming plus Wifi Mobo refused to post with 4 of these. If you use 32gb or above, expect to use pairs only. And make sure you enable EXPO or XMP, these are at 4800Mhz out of the box. You need to enable that to use the listed 6000Mhz.",

                "reviewText": "MSI did not say that this kit was compatible with my motherboard, but the g.skill website said it was compatible. The memory refused to run any of its expo profiles and this memory kit is made specifically for expo and has no XMP support. That means it is supposed to be tailored to AMD AM5.When running it with no expo, it still took an inordinate amount of time (2 minutes) to boot each time. I'm just talking about finishing the memory training portion of the boot, not getting into Windows time.Not only that, it always reported memory errors in Windows and caused blue screens of death unless I was willing to add more voltage than the package said it should run at. I was advised to give it more voltage when I called gskill customer support to \" make it stable.\" This advice did work, but I feel it is deceptive advertising and deceptive practice to say that this kit runs at 1.35 volts when it requires 1.4 to be stable in my system. On those grounds I am returning it.A competitor's memory kit runs at expo without any additional voltage, and it also finishes memory training in about 20 seconds. It does not need any additional voltage or tinkering on my part for it to run at its advertised speed. Do not trust the g.skill website, only trust your motherboard's QVL. The customer support was also extremely hostile to my insistence that they needed to look into this incompatibility and take the RAM kit off the compatible list on their own website. I was told I should just return it if I really don't like it in a tone of voice that suggested I needed to hang up before things got nasty.",

The cooler is so large the front fan sits on top of the RAM. This RAM is the lowest profile DDR5 quality (Hynix) RAM I could find at 6000MHz with a CAS Latency of 30. The others are either slower, higher latency or higher profile. Check that you have the latest BIOS as the RAM's rated voltage of 1.35 will be activated when you turn on EXPO. That is quite close to the SOC danger zone of 1.4V+, you need the new BIOS with built in safeguards.The only downside if you are in the UK is that it ships from New Jersey, for me it took 9 days to arrive.",
