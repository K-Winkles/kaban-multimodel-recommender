                "reviewText": "This is the perfect RAM kit if you are looking for something that's low profile enough to fit under even the largest of heatsinks, fast enough to have a great gaming experience, while also having lots of capacity to spare for future-proofing or productivity work such as video editing.The RAM itself was seamless to install, and it only took me a few seconds in the BIOS to enable the XMP profile and set it to the 3200MHz speed. This RAM is not the fastest you can get, yet most users won't notice much of a performance difference between this and faster speed variations. I am easily able to get 100+ FPS in most games at 1440p High Settings when paired with both a 4070 Ti and a Ryzen 7 5800X, which is more than good enough for me. The RAM is also very zippy when editing videos as I am easily able to move around my production timeline with no lag whatsoever. Aside from all of that, this RAM kit also manages to be very low profile to where even very large Air Coolers will still fit over the top of the RAM with no issues with fan clearance at all. The DIMMs also stay cool under load, and while they only have a heat spreader on one side of each DIMM, it doesn't seem to affect its temps.Overall, this is an incredible value of a deal for RAM without sacrificing performance or capacity. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "My computer came with only one 8gb memory module and was not making use of the Dual Data Rate memory architecture that it has. Installing this kit solved the issue and my system can now address the memory faster and run smoother. As you can see in the attached pictures, you must install DDR memory in pairs. The slots are normally 1 color for the \"pair\" and another color for the 2nd pair. In this instance, i installed the memory in the first bank (some systems identify it as bank 0 or in my case bank 1). The Bank 1 connector is blue, therefore both modules must be installed in the blue memory slots. Installation was that simple and things run a lot smoother with less paging to the virtual memory. Great value and have been working flawlessly for months. PRO TIP: Make sure power is off and that you have discharged yourself of any static electricity before installing anything to your motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "Using this in a desktop PC running ProxMox and upgraded from 16 GB to 32 GB as I was running out of memory. Cheap and works great but little disappointed in the deceiving pictures as the heat spreader is only on one side. Probably other reviews said this and I didn't notice but it seems silly, what could it cost to put another one on the other side? For me and this use there is no need for any just figured it was a bonus. If you are going to be looking at this in a case with a window it may not be the best option. So far though RAM works great and have had no issues with it.",
