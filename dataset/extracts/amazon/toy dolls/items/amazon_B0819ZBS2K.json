Maybe it will work better the longer we have it . When you flip it upside down it does empty out like it is being consumed however it doesn\u2019t all disappear . It ends up lookig like the baby doll drank like 3/4 of it or maybe 5/8ths . That\u2019s my only dislike about this set and the questions they raised by my kid about do people really give newborns OJ? Or carrot juice ? I told her no not newborns but toddlers yes and that satisfied those questions. Overall they work good , to others who didn\u2019t grow up playing with them it would be a 5 star product . It came in basic packaging, good gift .You get both the milk (white) and orange bottles in the pack . It says it is Made in China",
