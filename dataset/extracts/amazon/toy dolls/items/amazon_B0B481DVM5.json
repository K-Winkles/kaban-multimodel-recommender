                "reviewText": "This doll is a faithful recreation of the weird dress they decided to use in the movie...The face sculpt is a brand new one in the likeness of Halle Bailey. I personally love this sculpt and think it really captures Halle\u2019s face(even better than the Disney Store one).Ariel\u2019s hair is saran with some twists rooted along the part line(it looks like yarn, but I\u2019m not sure what it is). The hair is a movie-accurate reddish-brown color and is crimped down to her waist. The doll doesn\u2019t come with a headband as depicted in the movie, so I made one from an old sweater.The dress is a light blue material that has a weird stretchy ruffle that is so painfully eighties. It has a neck ruffle and puffy sleeves made of a matching blue tulle. The corset part is a blue satin-like material. Overall, for a budget doll it is very movie-accurate.Although I am sad that these aren\u2019t the lace-up boots, I do like these sandals. They\u2019re a brown plastic and the sculpt is very detailed.Ariel has the basic 5 points of articulation: head, shoulders, and hipsSo cute and definitely worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "This doll itself is gorgeous, being the perfect likeness of Ariel from the live action movie. I think Mattel did even better than Disney in capturing the actress's appearance for this. However, the problem arises when it comes to the outfit. While the dress looks just like the one in the movie too, it fits really oddly on the doll. It barely closes in the back and feels like it's about to rip because it's so tight on the doll--it's almost like this was made for a different doll and awkwardly fit onto the Ariel Barbie, rather than actually being meant for her. I could see a kid accidentally ripping it if they try to re-dress Ariel at any point. Beautiful doll but they needed quality control on the dress fit.",
