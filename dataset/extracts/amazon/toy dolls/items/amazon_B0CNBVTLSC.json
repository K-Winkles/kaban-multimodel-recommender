                "reviewText": "Most of the stuffed toys I've made were not intended to be toys and were made using lightweight yarns and threads. However, I'm really enjoying some of the heavier yarns used in some current patterns, so I figured these joints might add a nice touch to those. And I was right. The joints give these animals more of a toy vibe rather than a display piece. They appear to be working well, as in providing movement but not pushing through the crocheted fabric. When making toys, you need to use a tighter stitch and smaller hook to keep the holes small and stuffing from showing, which also helps with keeping safety eyes and joints inside the toy. I still would not let teething children or babies play with an item like this unattended, but an older toddler should be OK. And adults would love your creations, too! I have a display cabinet full of critters & dolls I've made and folks have made for me. Handmade (crocheted, knitted or sewn) animals are some of the best gifts to give or receive!",

                "reviewText": "I make quite a few crochet plushies and usually use a sewing method to create jointed parts. I really like the plush that have moving arms and legs. I had no idea that you could just get joints like this!The basic principal of the joint is the same as safety eyes. You pop the stem of the joint from inside out on your limb and then close it up. Then you put the washer inside the body and you pop the stem through like a safety eye and voila! The limb stays secure in the washer.They were very easy to install and so much less time consuming than stitching back and forth and trying to keep the yarn tight across. Would highly recommend if you are into making plushies.",
