These are two sweet infant dolls with darling faces and a perfect size for a 3 year old +. But there are no directions for the dolls to make the baby noises that is advertised with the dolls on Amazon. I read everything on the package, the only tip off was a warning about the battery. I went back to Amazon and re-read the information. Nothing. So I took the clothes off the doll and unvelcroed the body. Out fell the small box that made the doll giggle, coo, and cry. There was a small tab that I pulled out (as a result of experience, not instruction) and still no sounds. I pushed on the top and finally I heard somewhat muffled cooing. At this point I decided the doll didn\u2019t not need cooing/crying sounds for my two little girls to enjoy the baby dolls. In this world of everything being electronic, it\u2019s ok to pretend. That\u2019s what I did as a young girl. Pretend. My girls are loving the dolls and the doll bodies are softer without the plastic box inside the body. They came with two bottles, which are fun. I would still buy them again.",
