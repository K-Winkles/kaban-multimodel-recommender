The second disc features 1985's #4 Indie Chart album A Far Out Disc which includes the Indie hit singles 'We're Mad' (#4) and 'She Goes To Finos' (#4). Idle Gossip, the band's third album and an Indie Chart #12 is to be found on Disc Three and it includes the 'Geordie's Gone To Jail' hit single. Disc Four features 1987's Bare Faced Cheek LP with it's seminal 'Yul Brynner Was A Skinhead' opus! The fifth disc features 20 non-LP cuts by the band including their ultra-rare debut 45s, their contribution to the legendary Strength Thru Oi! Compilation plus the not so rare but very important UK National Chart #3 smash hit 'Nellie The Elephant'. The booklet includes notes on each of the albums plus pictures of all the sleeves whilst each disc comes in a cardboard wallet depicting the original artwork. All housed in a sturdy clam shell box!",

                "reviewText": "this is a great 5 cd box set of the best and probably most popular and legendary toy dolls records released between 1983 and 1987, all cds are remastered to sound there best, all come housed in mini style lp jackets like the original lps did, this also comes with a really nice booklet and the 5th disc wich is a bonus disc is loaded with b sides and rarites from the 80s when the toy dolls where kind of big but never huge, my introduction to the toy dolls was when they came to nyc in 1986 and i saw them open for the dickies, what a show so needless to say within a few days i was at the local record shop that sold all the great punk imports at the time buying DIG THAT GROOVE & A FAR OUT DISC!!!!!!! i was hooked right away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they where touring the idle gossip record when i saw them in 86, anyway i am still a fan today, i spent the 1990s buying all there then new records ( my favorite from the 90s was obsurd ditties & orchastrated) wich where fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as far as i know the toy dolls still do a number of gigs a year here and there but dont really release anything new anymore, i pretty much have every album this band has ever made except the solo album olga did a few years ago. anyway if you where on the punk scene like i was back in the 80s and you where a fan almost everything from that era is here, i still have all the original vinyl , 45s and everything these guys where a lot of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sadly i only saw them live the one time as i do not remember them ever returning to nyc for a gig after 1986.......................",
