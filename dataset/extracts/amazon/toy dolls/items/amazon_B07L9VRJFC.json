                "reviewText": "I got this doll+stroller combo for my 21 month old daughter and it was an instant hit! After reading the bad reviews here, I was a bit skeptical but took a chance. The doll came tightly packed in a narrow tall box but instead of pulling the doll's head out, I used gravity to let the stroller and the doll slide out with little help. The doll is very cute (see close up picture), especially the eyes which look so real and the lips that have a slight shimmer on it. My daughter played with her all day, pushing the cute little stroller all around the house and even took her to bed. It has a perfectly soft body for toddlers transitioning from soft toys/dolls to firmer/harder material dolls. The accessories are good quality (bib, dress and bottle) which my daughter enjoys. The only issues I would say is that the stroller is very smooth and rolls quickly before my daughter has finished securing the doll in the stroller seat so it gets a bit challenging for her and the stroller cloth seat comes off from the frame at the corners quite a few times. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it.",

The baby that comes with it is cute, and comes with an extra clothing set and a couple of other accessories. The three stars are for the actual seat of the stroller, it does come off all the time. When the stroller is assembled, the fabric of the seat just goes over the metal frame. Well, every time the baby is taken off the seat the seat comes off the frame. It sounds like it's not a big deal,but a toddler would put and take out that baby multiple time in a matter of minutes and every time somebody (me in this case) needs to fix the seat. After the 2-3 times of doing that, my toddler just takes the baby and puts it in an older stroller.",
