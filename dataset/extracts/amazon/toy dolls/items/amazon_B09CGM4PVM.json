The accurate product you're getting is the Woody shown in the box, with his mouth open slightly. He looks pretty good though. I searched for some time to find a Woody doll that looked the most like the movie, as some of them have some pretty creepy faces and are too cartoony. It seems like it should be pretty easy to recreate but apparently it is not. This one is quite close, though.Yes, his voice is clearly not Tom Hanks, but it's not TOO far off, honestly.My 4 and 1 year old both love him so much and he seems plenty durable so far! The \"pull string\" which doesn't really pull hasn't broken and is fun for both of them.",
