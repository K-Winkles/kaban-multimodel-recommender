                "reviewText": "At first I found that these dolls are quite scary and much more for being with their mouths open with a smile. I kept them hidden saying if I should give them to my 2-year-old daughter or I should take them to the trash, in this way I would lose my money, but I would protect my daughter from possible trauma, and then I decided to take a chance, because I taught them to my daughter and It was love at first sight I was totally in love with her baby dolls and I hug them with a lot of love, seeing their happiness made buying these dolls worth every dollar. When I received them, they had exactly the same outfits as those illustrated (pink and blue stripes with owls) They may be a little smaller than illustrated, but they are the perfect size for a child 3 years old and up. Playability The open mouth baby is perfect for feeding and its bottles and pacifiers perfectly in its mouth. materials The plastic is soft, smooth to the touch and the body is soft. I put them directly in my washing machine (I washed the outfit separately) and they came out perfect.",
