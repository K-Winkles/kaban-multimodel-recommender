Ever. Well, about 2 years afterward, it came up missing (I still have the orher one.) It was nowhere. The rooms have been cleaned out multiple times, and my parents knew how much I loved it, nevertheless, it was gone. I thought about this baby doll for years since. Now I'm 18, and at 1am I did some digging and found the doll on Google, and after cross examination with Amazon, found it. The clothes were lighter than before, now being a pale pink whereas before they were hot pink, and the top on the old one was an actual top, where this one was a tie. However, the doll looks exactly the same, feels the same, same size, whole thing. Thank you for still having this doll",

I would give it a 5 star, except, I was aware she a was anatomically doll, but was totally shocked when we saw the belly button. It looks like a boy's thing. My Grandaughter asked why it looked that way. Her parents were not sure if they would let her keep it, because of this. She is seven. We explained to her that sometimes newborns belly buttons can look like this, she has to keep the white strip over it. So please in the future, consider one that doesn't look like this. This is the second doll I bought for her, the first one was a mini, just adorable. We are greatly satisfied with her, even the girl part, but not the belly button. I am planning on buying more jc dolls, as they are the best I found that look real, and your company is very helpful, friendly.",

                "reviewText": "Normally I wait a few days before reviewing a doll so I've had time to live with it and get a real opinion, but I can't imagine my opinion changing. I adore this doll. It is extremely detailed and has an adorable expression that can melt hearts. It is made of fairly solid vinyl, so it isn't what I would call cuddly, but since that isn't why I got it, I'm fine with that.Preemie sized baby clothes fits it fairly well, though those clothes are a bit on the long side. It won't fit perfectly, but the preemie sized stuff I have for my other dolls fits it well enough.I'm not a fan of the clothes it comes in. They doesn't seem to fit the doll very well and just isn't to my liking, but since I prefer to change my doll's clothes (I collect various types of semi-realistic dolls), that doesn't bother me and isn't worth knocking a star off since the doll itself is everything I expected and wanted.It definitely looks better in real life than in the provided pictures here on Amazon. I may be able to add pictures in a few days, once I get them off my camera.This doll is a very good addition to my collection and I think anyone who wants a small (14 inch) full bodied doll would be very pleased with this one. I certainly couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.",
