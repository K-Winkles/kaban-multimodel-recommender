And the perfect height for my 2 year old great granddaughter. When she opened it she immediately said doll, so we put the 15\u201d doll we got her for a Christmas in it and she put all of the accessories that came with the doll in the back basket and took her fit a walk. It is absolutely the perfect size for a 2 year old and very sturdy. I like that it won\u2019t fold up on her. I\u2019m very happy with this as is she.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is adorable with all the bells and whistles of an actual full size stroller. Very easy to open and fold but sturdy when open. I am positive my granddaughter is going to love it. Amazon failed on the packaging for me though. Opened Amazon packed box and stroller was just loose in the box. Completely outside it's original packaging but still needing two legs/wheels assembled. This was obviously a return as original packaging was just a large clear bag ripped open from the Cardboard Hanging tab at the top. I inspected and nothing was wrong with the stroller so I'm fine with it and will just present it open and assembled with a bow. I would not say it's giftable the way it comes packaged anyway, looks cheap so I probably would have presented the same even if it wasn't open already.",
