                "reviewText": "Our 2 year old loves the trilogy Toy Story, almost as much as my husband and I! Oh, the look on his face when he laid eyes on his own Woody doll was absolutely priceless!! Other than Woody looking so much like the character in the movie, his pull string sayings are to the \"T\"! So cute! Two things I would change,(that really didn't effect how much we loved it) #1: A hat that stays on Woody's head - Darn hat does not stay on at all! If you keep this doll on a stand (not included) and never move or touch him, the hat will stay on his head, otherwise good luck. We've had Woody a couple of days now, and I think we've lost the hat! #2: A place to write our son's name on the bottom of Woody's boot - As my excited husband was opening the box to retrieve Woody, he said, \"oh I can't wait to sharpie our son's name on the bottom of his foot, just like the movie!\" And wouldn't you know it, just like the movie, there was Andy's name. Nice they stayed true to the movie, but this is not Andy's Woody, it's our sons now! You might asking me why not the other boot, well there is a very long product number in black that you could write over but, it's just not the same. I'm thinking about sanding down/ painting over Andy's name just like in Toy Story 2. Like I said before, neither of these two things made us waver our love for the doll and it's likeness to the movie. This Woody doll looks so much like the Woody in the movie, we're convinced he's running around our house playing with other toys while we sleep!",

                "reviewText": "First off, for the price, I am satisfied with this product. I could have gone out and bought a $55 Woody, but after much research opted for this Woody, so for basically $29, I expected what I got. My two and a half year old daughter absolutely adores him and has rarely put him down since we got him.Yes, his hat is constantly falling off, but we have to remember and I am always reminding her that this is not a movie, his hat IS going to fall off. It actually stays on a lot better than I did expect after reading the reviews of this Woody. If we get it on just right, we can wave him around and his hat stays on.The voice is NOT as bad as I thought it was going to be. He does sound very much like the woody in the movie with only a hint of a difference. Does my daughter notice the difference? No. So does it bother me? Nope! He also says most of the original first movie sayings except for the obvious \"somebody's poisoned the waterhole\" saying. Does it bother me? Not at all! I actually was relieved when we pulled the string and he said \"there's a snake in my boot!\" I think that was the number one saying I was hoping for.There are only two negative things I have to say about him, which is why I gave him 4 stars.Number one: We have had him now a full 24 hours and his knee seam as already come undone. I managed to knot it back up as so the thread didn't unthread itself, BUT now we have a long piece of thread hanging out of his knee. She hasn't even been rough with him.Number two: When you glance at him, his eyes look like they are looking straight forward, but when you really look at him one eye is looking forward and one eyes is looking slightly to the right. But right now I think that's more of an annoyance to me than it is to my daughter.Overall, again, he's exactly what I was hoping for with the price I paid for him! I was really nervous he was not going to be all that great. And I am actually glad that he doesn't have a play mode. I felt that being the toy he is in the movie, he shouldn't have any extra features as the toy outside the movie, and this Woody certainly doesn't have those extra features!",

                "reviewText": "So I had read a bunch of bad reviews but I figured the doll itself would be ebough for my son to overlook all the bad. I was banning on gluing the string on to the ring so it wouldn't slip off as well.When the shipping box arrived it was huge, opened it and the actually do lease was very unique and big also. My son couldn't wait to get ahold of it. It was a bit difficult to get out of the box but we'll worth it.My son's favorite toy. Our Woody doll sounds just like the one in the movie. And his pull string is very well attached. So we'll attached that when I had to wash Woody one day because my son thought it was a great idea to take Woody a bath in orange juice, I had to actually cut the string.Just like everyone else's complaint, hat doesn't stay on well. But if you force it on at a different angle it stays on great. If we are out though I do not allow Woody to wear his hat.Great Woody doll. Very glad I didn't listen to all the negative reviews. My son never plays with the same toy for too long. I've wasted a lot of money buying things he might like. This I am proud to say has been the toy I needed. He adores his doll. When he can't find him he runs around yelling Woody as if the doll might just say one day, \"I'm over here.\"",
