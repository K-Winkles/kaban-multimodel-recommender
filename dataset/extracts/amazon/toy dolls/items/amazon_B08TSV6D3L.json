                "reviewText": "My daughter loves dolls and blind bag toys, so I thought this would be the perfect gift. The packaging it comes in is super cute and fun. I love that the box turns into a playset, and all the accessories come in paper bags. The doll is a lot smaller than I expected and not the best quality, but my daughter liked it anyway. She comes with a variety of accessories that you can add altogether to make a keychain. You can change her outfits, which are made of rubber and surprisingly they were easy to change. Overall my daughter really liked it and has had fun playing with it. I do think it's a bit overpriced though.",

It was fun watching my daughter unpack all the little items and as shown, we got the girl that was on the box. She had lots of fun playing with her and I think it was really cute. Plus I like that we can put all the items into the little back pack. My daughter can take her on the go!",
