My nephew enjoys playing with his \"buddy\" that's bigger than his other human toys. He likes practicing how to tie, button, and zip since it's in a more realistic manner compared to a non-human toy to practice motor skills on. This doll is darker than pictured, but plush as described. Also, there's only one button, zipper, and shoe to tie as pictured. Although, this toy is targeted at toddlers, this is good for kids with autism to sharpen their motor skills. I got this toy on sale with a coupon, so that's a bonus! If you do decide to get this item, get it while it's discounted.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two dolls for my grandsons. I tried to get them to look as close to them as possible. I ordered one with dark brown hair(or black) and one with brown. They are both so cute but the one with brown hair has a much darker skin color than the picture on line. I dont know if thats the way he is supposed to be. sometimes dye lots are different.. please let me know, I would have prefered a doll to match his looks as much as possible. thank you. I wanted it for this coming friday as a gift. Thank you",
