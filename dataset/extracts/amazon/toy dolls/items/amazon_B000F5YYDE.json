                "reviewText": "Words simply cannot express how excited to see that the Joovy baby car seat/carrier was back in stock on Amazon. I have done tons of research looking for the perfect baby doll car seat for my daughter and trust me this Joovy seat is the One and Only in my opinion. My daughter received the Joovy stroller for Christmas about four or five years ago and still uses it all the time. It has held up remarkably over time. As a matter of fact it still looks brand new.This Joovy seat is identical to a real one in every way imaginable. It has the harness that buckles at the chest and between the legs, the adjustable handle for carrying, the safety warning on the fabric, removable cover for washing, hole for seat belt to go thru between car seat and base, seat is light enough for small children, and best of all it comes out of the base for carrying the doll around. It also comes in blue or pink! All of the other play car seats come up way short when compared to the Joovy seat.I was so disappointed when I tried to find one for my daughter at Christmas and then at her birthday in February and there were none to be found. I started thinking they must have been discontinued. Sometimes a used one would pop up and the bidding would go really high and it would be gone really fast. I finally won a bid on a used Joovy toddler doll car seat. It is also very well made but my child plays with small baby dolls and I really wanted this one for her. These are nice but you cannot use it as a carrier, only a car seat. I was so excited when they were back in stock on Amazon and I bought one right away. Lets just say she LOVES it and all the kids want to play with it when they come over. Its a big hit at my house....so if you are thinking of buying one...do it now before its gone!Update: both of my girls loved the Joovy doll seat and stroller. One child had the pink and the other had the blue. Now I have a niece and she loves it so much I bought her one for her birthday and she was so excited! This makes three that I\u2019ve bought so far! They are a wonderful toy that looks looks so real that I\u2019m kind of scared for my daughter to leave her very real looking baby in it....scared someone will think a real baby has been left in the car and bust my window or call the police\ud83d\ude2c",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Spent weeks looking for a non cheap car seat that would not tumble over when my daughter is carrying her reborns, and I am so glad I came across this one!It is literally a replica of a real car seat. Even comes with a base and the straps work by snapping into place versus velcro like most have.The handle locks into place so it does not let the car seat tumble due to weight. Most people have said it's hard for the handle to move, however if you push the handles outwards they pop out of place so that you can move them back and it locks back into place do the same by pushing the handles outwards and move it back into the carrying position. It's easy if doing it correctly.My daughter is 8 but is a little Smaller for her age and she handles carrying this around with ease. Much easier than the generic ones that flop around.If you're looking for a car seat that you're not going to have to buy multiple of because they break, inevitably still spending the same price within a month or two.... Looking for one that actually holds a reborn, looking for one that actually looks and functions real, just looking for something well worth the money than this is it.",
