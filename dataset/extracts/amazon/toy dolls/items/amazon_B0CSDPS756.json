BUT.... there are a few stain-like marks down on the far back, that no matter how much I puff and pinch and fluff just don't come out. I've even tried a damp cloth wipe - still there. I'm hoping it won't matter to her - tho the spots ARE noticeable. I guess for the price, I would have wanted totally nothing to be wrong.",
