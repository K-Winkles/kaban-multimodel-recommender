She gave me a total and I pretended to give her a certain amount of money and asked her how much change do I get back. She did great at 8 just turning 9, she is very advance when it comes to monetary and has been taught by her mom since she was 4. But we love them. \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "The food is super cute and is the perfect size for Barbies, OMG's, rainbow high dolls and similar. My daughter is always looking for accessories for these dolls and this is perfect. The refrigerator is an awkward size as it is too short for these sized dolls and is more of a traditional doll house size. So I feel they don't match well if you have a child who is particular.As to can see in the photo, the bottle items do not all fit well in the door shelving but they do fit. *These items are very small and not suitable for very young children*.I like how the shelves can be removed and the freezer door comes all the way out. I was slightly confused with the large bag of beads that are meant to be ice cubes. While they would fill the freezer portion, they will make quite the mess and feel unnecessary, but would make for realistic play.I only gave this 4 starts because the fridge and food are not proportionate to eachother. However my daughter loves it all and was exactly what she was looking for.",
