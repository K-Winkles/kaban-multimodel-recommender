                "reviewText": "I was disappointed overall with the Wish movie, but I've still got to give Disney props for their character design. The dress, the hair, the freckles all make for a distinctive Disney heroine and the doll looks as good as she did in the movie. And for young kids - who aren't jaded about film theory and enjoyed the movie more than I did - this would be a fantastic gift.The doll itself is best described as Barbie doll quality - poseable with limits but with great hair and clothes. The \"secret\" woodland friends make for a unique and fun unboxing experience - it's a cute idea, and also gives you a little more bang for your buck. The additional figurines aren't poseable or anything, but still provide more opportunities for imaginative play.Short story: good quality doll that even an old jaded fuddy-duddy like me can appreciate.",

She has movable arms and legs, a colorful dress and plastic belt and removable shoes. Her hair is long, fashioned into tiny braids. The details are stunning, including her big amber brown eyes and freckles across her nose. Her face wears a contented smile. She's packaged very nicely with her accompaniments, and the contents are easy to slide out (or, open the perforated windows to get to the surprises). This would be an amazing gift for any child or adult who loves the movie, or collects Disney collectibles.",

The doll is well made, great clothes and wonderfully textured hair. It does have limited movement, similar to a classic Barbie doll. The surprises are great accessories and help add to the play factor for this toy.I appreciate the simplicity. No batteries. No complicated instructions. No annoying noises. Just plenty of opportunity for imaginative play.Please not that the packaging does recommend for kids 3 and up. Some of the surprise figures are small enough to be choking hazards for littles. Keep this in mind if you are considering purchasing for a small kid or have littles around the house. We have to keep it in mind because our toddler puts everything in his mouth.",

                "reviewText": "The packaging on this is stunning. It's set up like an advent surprise box, even though it's not marketed as one, you could always buy it to do a smaller advent countdown if you wanted. The doll is in a big compartment with a clear window, and the animal friends and basket are behind little doors that you open to reveal. The doll is a really nice size, well made with a beautiful dress. Hair looks nice. All in all this is a really great little gift set that would be perfect for a birthday, easter basket, christmas etc. It's packaged nicely.",

                "reviewText": "This Asha doll is so pretty and would make the perfect gift for any fan of Wish! I absolutely LOVE that the box is made like an advent calendar. You have to open each door to reveal a special surprise!Sometimes the accessories that come with dolls are a real let down but in this case, the accessories are just as much fun as the doll! Asha comes with some super cute, detailed accessories - 6 woodland friends, adorable Star and a basket.Asha is dressed in her beautiful, iconic purple dress. Her shoes are removable but they don't always stay on that well. Her gorgeous braided hair looks just like it does in the movie!",
