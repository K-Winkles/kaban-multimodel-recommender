They love playing with the figures and re-creating the scenes in the movies. My 4 year old likes to dress and undress her Barbie dolls and she did the same with these characters. The clothing is not really meant to be removed and replaced because they fit kind of tight. The only problem we have had with it is the hairbrush that is included in the kit. Kristoff's hair cannot be combed and Elsa and Anna both have braided hair. It wasn't long before Anna's braids were combed out with the hairbrush. We caught her and prevented Anna from suffering the same fate. That hair is awfully short to try to re-braid so Elsa will have to live with it. My advice is to remove the hairbrush from the kit. There are also a lot of little pieces that really do not have a place to go, so have a ziplock bag handy for them.",
