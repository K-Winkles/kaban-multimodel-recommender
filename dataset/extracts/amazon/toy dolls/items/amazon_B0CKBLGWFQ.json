However, it is weird that it's a Cinderella doll singing the Frozen song. My daughter is 2, so she does not know and thinks she is Elsa. It was fairly simple to put this together and dances around our tile floor wonderfully. The problem with this doll is that if your kiddo is like mine who wants to constantly touch it or pick it up, the top piece easily comes off from the bottom portion of the body, so be prepared for a kid asking you to click it back together. I love the pretty lights that are reflected on the ground in the shape of hearts around the doll.",

                "reviewText": "I'm actually kind of impressed with this little toy. The light show is really neat and carried out well. The princess starts to sing and slowly the flaps of her dress start to raise up as the led lights come on. She then starts to spin and roll around the floor surprisingly turning around once coming in contact with a wall or any other obstacles. By this point she has now started singing...Not the right song but...still singing and spinning to the music which made my toddler squeal in delight. However, I thought it was kind of comical how I received very clearly a Cinderella figurine that sings only one song over and over on repeat until you cut it off. And no, it wasn't \"the dreams that you wish will come true\". Nope. Instead, I was instantly thrown off when the Cinderella toy started to sing \"Let it go\" from the Frozen movie. Quickly doing a double take to confirm that I wasn't dreaming and yes, it was indeed Cinderella singing a Frozen song which honestly made me laugh. So while there is room for some minor improvements my toddler didn't seem to mind at all. Quite the opposite actually; she plays with it all the time. To the point that I eventually have to call it a day and turn it off because unfortunately there is no volume control on this thing and no setting to allow it to cut off after so many times singing. So after hearing \"Let it go\" on repeat for the ten trillionth time because my toddler has gotten distracted and moved on to the next to after the 20th time singing the song; I am ready to pluck out my ear drums so that I don't have to hear the stupid song anymore ever again. So I have to switch it off for her. These aren't deal breaker flaws but definitely something worth taking a second look at for improvement. A few tweaks on these issues and this could be a hot commodity for little girls.",

They have different dolls, but they all come in the same box from what can tell, so if your giving as a gift it could be a little confusing. There is no volume control on this doll, so it will drive you nuts after awhile. I wish that it had the option to just dance without the music or at least have a volume control option. It works great and moves around flawlessly. I like that it depicts the hearts on the walls and floors as well. It's magical and my toddler loves it",
