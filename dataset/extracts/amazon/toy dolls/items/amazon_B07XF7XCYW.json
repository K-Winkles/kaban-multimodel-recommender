The carrier is cute, the accessories are well enough made. The dog is small, but not super tiny. My daughter wanted a \"puppy\" and this fits her needs perfectly. The second picture is with her regular sized stuffed animal dog for size comparison.This toy is very soft and better quality than I was expecting. I'd definitely buy this again or give as a gift.",
