However, being so small, the clothes are a little difficult to get on and off so it might be tedious for a 3-year-old. For our 5yo, it is still tough, but she is up to the challenge and hopefully her dexterity will improve. As for the stars that are supposed to appear on the face at 0 degrees, I couldn't make that happen. I put her in the freezer which is set a -2, so that should have done the job. That wasn't so important to me, just don't make it a selling point for your little one.",
