                "reviewText": "My 7-year-old daughter was requesting another American Girl Wellie Wisher doll, but specifically wanted a doll with hair she could style. I was looking for a 14\" doll that would be compatible with the Wellies and I'm so glad I found these new Glitter Girls. Battat really got the look and design right with their posable Glitter Girl collection. This doll is a Christmas present, so it hasn't been opened or played with yet. Her eyes are bright blue and the lashes are a nice touch. Her outfit seems well made with quality materials. One thing that surprised me was the darkness of her complexion. Her skin color is much darker in person than my daughters' Wellies and Disney princess dolls. Its even more noticable with the blonde hair, green eyed Glitter Girl I bought my 4-year-old. It looks like they have tans and reminds me of my Malibu Barbie from childhood. Its not a deal breaker for me since I'm mostly buying for the hair, but there is a clear difference between the Amazon photos and what I received. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait to hear what my daughters think. I really like the price compared to spending $60 on a Wellie Wisher, and will definitely be purchasing more Glitter Girls and accessories in the future.11/15/2020 UPDATE:My daughter LOVES this doll and plays with it daily.The Glitter Girl's hair is fun to style, and still in great shape after almost 2 years. With a wired doll brush and water spray we have NOT had a problem with hair coming out.The doll is easy to dress, which prevents damage to it's clothes and allows for more independent play. Some glitter has worn off of the shoes, but otherwise the outfit is still in good shape.The only thing missing is underwear. My daughter borrows the Wellie's underwear when dressing the doll in skirts and dresses. Underwear would be a nice addition or accessory pack in the future.Last Christmas we added the horses, stable and several outfits to our families GG collection. This year we will be getting 2 new dolls and some more outfits.I highly recommend Glitter Girls! Durable, easy to dress and reasonably priced for little kids (age 3 to 7). Fun, creative play for older girls who like to style hair, outfits and pose dolls (age 8+).",
