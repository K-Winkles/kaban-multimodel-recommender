It's easy to fold and store to take with you. It has a foam grip handle and a basket underneath for all the doll accessories. It fits dolls up to 15\"",

Assembly was easy enough and it does look nice, but looking at the finished assembled product is massively underwhelming when you consider the cost of it.I ordered this and put it together to show my other half before telling her the price. She had no complaints and found no massive flaws or imperfections, and then I told her the price tag! This is pushchair is a decent enough toy but is something you'd expect to pay \u00a310-\u00a315 for, maybe \u00a320 at a push. At \u00a349.99 you're getting close to the toy versions of well-known prams and pushchairs and this doesn't compare.Overall, we'd give the product a thumbs up for quality but there is nothing to justify the inflated price.",

The pram looks pretty pink color and good size, well made and sturdy the baby doll is basic and cute but nothing special, I will call this combo as a \u201emy first pram and baby doll,as not much going on just basic toys perfect for a first experience toy 1 dropped a star because it's a bit too pricy, otherwise everything is good.",
