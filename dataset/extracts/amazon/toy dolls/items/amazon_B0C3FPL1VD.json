We love the quality and how large of a doll this is (great for her rough handedness). The only issue is (with this one, anyways) as mentioned in the other reviews is the hair. It does not lock together with the head and constantly falls off. Very annoying. Even had the hubby try to use some man-strength to help. Nada. Other than that it\u2019s a very cute idea.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter is a huge Roblox fan, so I bought her this doll as a birthday gift. She was thrilled to have a doll that she could dress up and change its facial expression. However, the hair on the doll was a bit of a problem. As many reviews had pointed out, it had difficulty staying on - in fact, it just wouldn't stay on at all. This was frustrating for my daughter, and she ended up playing with the doll bald until we super glued the hair on. Once we did that, though, she started playing with the doll nonstop- she even cuddles with it at bedtime. All in all, I do recommend this doll, but it's important to note that the hairpiece can be a bit of an issue. However, if you're willing to do a little MacGyvering, the toy is worth buying, especially if your kid is into Roblox.",
