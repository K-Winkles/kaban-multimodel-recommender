This Tiny Power purse compact features an adorable seashell shape sprinkled with colorful stars and hearts and includes micro Polly and Lila mermaid dolls. Dive into the under-the-sea fun and discover a sea castle (Polly and Lila dolls can enter and relax on the seashell throne); they can swing on the seashell swing; and find a pearl in a clam! The fun continues with even more exciting under-sea-action as Polly and Lila ride a surfboard that rocks on the wave; they can sway on the anchor (dolls clip on); sit on the seahorse and spin 360 degrees; and go for a boat ride! Place Polly or Lila doll in the octopus's arms and spin it for an exciting ride and then twist the small starfish to make the shark and turtle spin. It's so much fun under-the-sea! The Seashell purse compact also has a strap so kids can wear it as a purse or transform it into a fanny pack with a belt! With Polly Stick technology, the micro dolls can stick anywhere on the purse compact. Place a sticker from the sticker sheet (included) on the purse compact and the dolls will stick to the sticker wherever placed.
