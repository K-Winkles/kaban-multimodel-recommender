                "reviewText": "Both of me nieces are super into baby dolls, they both have lower end \u201creborn baby\u201d dolls (not the real ones that cost hundreds, the ones you can get on Amazon for $50-$100). They carry them around everywhere! So when I saw this kids baby carrier I figured it would be perfect!This thing is definitely made for kids, and smaller kids at that. I first attempted to give this to my 9 year old niece who is pretty average stature, maybe slightly on the still has a little baby fat scale (she wears a size youth Large or youth XL depending on the brand). This didn\u2019t fit her unfortunately. I could just, and I mean just get this clipped in the back. But because it was so tight it didn\u2019t leave any room for the baby. Also it sits really high on her torso and was barely under her chest area. So she agreed and we ended up giving it to my niece that is 7 but is thin as a rail and short, and this works perfectly for her. So just don\u2019t expect this to fit bigger kids.As far as the overall quality goes I really don\u2019t have any complaints at all regarding the quality and the materials used. In fact I would go as far to say that I expected it to be worse quality than it is considering the low price point. Overall it\u2019s cute and I would totally recommend it if you have a smaller child whom is into dolls.",

                "reviewText": "This baby doll carrier is hilarious and adorable. My 3.5-year-old wears it around the house with her little doll in it like she\u2019s a busy mom. I had to tighten it all the way for her since she\u2019s so small, but she will be able to still play with it as she grows! It\u2019s very durable and holds the baby in nice and tight so that the baby doesn\u2019t even slip out during a sword fight (very important activity with her older brother, haha). It\u2019s great at keeping the baby doll safe and happy during the sword fight! This would make a great gift for any little girl who loves to play mommy.",

                "reviewText": "Die Lictin Puppentrage hat unsere Erwartungen mehr als erf\u00fcllt und ist ein absolutes Must-Have f\u00fcr kleine Puppenmamas. Die 3-in-1-Funktion erm\u00f6glicht es, die Puppe auf unterschiedliche Weisen zu tragen, was die Spielm\u00f6glichkeiten vielseitig gestaltet.Das Material, 100% Baumwolle, verleiht der Puppentrage eine angenehme Haptik und macht sie sehr hautfreundlich. Die Verarbeitung ist qualitativ hochwertig, was der kleinen Tr\u00e4gerin ein realistisches Trageerlebnis bietet. Die Liebe zum Detail zeigt sich insbesondere im niedlichen Tierdesign.Was diese Puppentrage besonders ansprechend macht, ist ihre \u00c4hnlichkeit zu einer echten Babytrage. Dies f\u00f6rdert nicht nur die Fantasie der Kinder, sondern erm\u00f6glicht es ihnen auch, die Rolle einer f\u00fcrsorglichen Mutter nachzuempfinden. Die Puppentrage ist leicht anzulegen und vermittelt den kleinen Puppenmamas ein Gef\u00fchl von Verantwortung und F\u00fcrsorglichkeit.Ein weiterer positiver Aspekt ist, dass es keinen unangenehmen Geruch beim Auspacken gab. Dies zeigt die gute Verarbeitung und die Verwendung von schadstofffreien Materialien. Die Puppentrage eignet sich nicht nur hervorragend als Spielzeug, sondern kann auch dabei helfen, soziale F\u00e4higkeiten und Empathie bei Kindern zu f\u00f6rdern.Insgesamt sind wir von der Lictin Puppentrage begeistert und k\u00f6nnen sie allen Eltern empfehlen, die ihren Kindern eine realistische und liebevolle Spielumgebung bieten m\u00f6chten. Dieses Puppenzubeh\u00f6r bringt nicht nur strahlende Kinderaugen, sondern f\u00f6rdert auch wertvolle Entwicklungsaspekte auf spielerische Weise.!",
