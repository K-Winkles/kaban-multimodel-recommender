I'm an adult collector and someone who wants another baby, but can't currently have one.The good. This baby is realistic looking. It's got a beautiful face, good realistic features(veins, cheeks, coloring, nails). It is completely intact in the nether area. Beautiful eyelashes. Wears a size premie to newborn(although some newborn clothes may be big)The bad. He is a bit smaller, not quite as heavy as a normal baby. He came with a pink pacifier although he is a boy. The clothes did not seem to do him justice. Clothing can make or break a \"reborn\", as soon as I put better clothes on him and a hat, he became more beautiful. He feels like a cross between vinyl and silicone, he's not completely hard, but also not soft. Holding him does feel like a real baby, minus weight. At some point I will get a full silicone, but for now, he definitely makes the cut. He also is in competition with much higher cost babies in craftsmanship. I give him an A. I did knock down a star for weight, clothing and the pink pacifier. If you are looking for a quality baby though, this is a great pick.",
