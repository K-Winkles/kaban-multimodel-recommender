        "description": "Walt Disney Animation Studio\u2019s 60th feature, Encanto, tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal every child except one, Mirabel. But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family\u2019s last hope. Mirabel Madrigal from Disney\u2019s Encanto comes wearing her signature outfit and accessories! Just like in the film, Mirabel\u2019s dress features a beautiful scalloped collar and sleeves with authentic embroidery-style designs. Her long teal skirt features colorful icons and patterns inspired by her family\u2019s magical gifts, just like in the film! Look closely at the designs, and you\u2019ll find Mirabel\u2019s name printed onto her skirt, just like her dress in Encanto! Her bright green glasses and magenta espadrille shoes complete her classic look. With your new friend Mirabel Madrigal, you can pretend to go on your own magical adventures!",

My three year old is obsessed with Encanto right now and she loves playing with this Mirabel Doll and an Isabela doll I also purchased. I like the size of these, as they are bigger (14 inches) as opposed to a Barbie size. The price was good for the value of the doll. The only thing I am not the biggest fan of is the fact that they come with small earrings, about the size of a pinky nail. My child still tends to put things in her mouth, so I get paranoid about the small pieces. I also just don't like losing accessories...overall I still give this doll a five star review.",
