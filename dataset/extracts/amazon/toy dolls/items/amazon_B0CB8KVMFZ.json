Definitely one of my new favorite dolls!I will admit that based off the pictures, I was worried about what the quality of the doll\u2019s paint. I didn\u2019t need to worry, because the painting is actually very good quality!His eyebrows look a little weird. They look a lot darker than baby eyelashes normally do. The eyebrows make him look a little less realistic than he would otherwise.This is a cute doll, and I would definitely recommend getting one. The vinyl/plastic is a lot softer than expected.
