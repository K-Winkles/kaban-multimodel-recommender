The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal\u2014every child except one, Mirabel. But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family\u2019s last hope.

Just like in the film, Isabela\u2019s stunning lavender dress features beautiful ruffle details on her collar and sleeves. Her delicate layered skirt is decorated with gorgeous pink, purple, and blue flowers, just like her dress in Encanto!
