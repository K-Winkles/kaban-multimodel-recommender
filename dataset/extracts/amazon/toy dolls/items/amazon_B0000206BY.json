                "reviewText": "Somewhere along punk's path of evolution, or deevolution as the case may be, the fun aspect of the form was left by the wayside as every budding Rotten, Strummer, or Idol tried so hard to prove to their audience that they meant it MAAAAAN! There's something strangely comforting and downright endearing to know that Olga and his cohorts in the Toy Dolls never grew up, existing in the same strange musical and cultural vacuum they occupied back in the late 1970's. Like an immature kid brother, the Toy Dolls are still picking their collective noses and flicking it at a once-again bloated music industry hell bent on reducing everything down to some lowest common denominator and churning out mindless pabulum for the masses. This albums collects some of the Toy Dolls' earliest sides and songs like \"Tommy Kowey's Car\" and \"I've Got Asthma\" will leave you wondering how anyone can play so fast and hold it all together, almost as if they've been up all night mainlining diet pills and coffee. Olga's voice still sounds like he's been sucking helium all of his life. Highly recommended for fans of both the Ramones and the Dickies, but be forewarned that these guys are so goofy they make either of those bands seem downright morose by comparision.",
