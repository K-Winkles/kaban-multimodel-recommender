                "reviewText": "I was intrigued by these because they have completely plush bodies, and the reviews I've seen on YouTube were very positive. I think this doll is so much cuter in person, and her soft body is great for cuddling and displaying! I love the details and the color palette of each of the characters, but I was drawn to Luna most as I used to do ballet! My only complaint about this doll is that it's a little different than the photos; I would have preferred the dream catcher bracelet in the pictures, but for some reason, mine has a little ballet slipper bracelet. The hair also isn't as plentiful as the photos, but neither bits bother me too much as the hair is very soft and the bracelet is still cute; the doll also came with cute hair clips. These dolls are very high-quality and BIG for their price; I highly recommend these for kids and collectors!",
