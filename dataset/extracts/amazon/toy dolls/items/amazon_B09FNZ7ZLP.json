We received the blue set and she was so thrilled - all was well and they were in perfect condition. Then the pink set arrived, the fairy out of the box had a sliced in half right leg, but it\u2019s fine, no big as Amazon made it right with a replacement set the next day and she didn\u2019t have to part with that beloved pink unicorn that came with the broken fairy. The set arrives and we get the packaging open, dip the doll and her right leg comes completely off in the middle exactly where the first one was broken right out of the package. Maybe a quality control issue or an assembly line mishap? Who knows, Amazon refunded the item which was lovely but now we have a bummed little one and 2 fairies that can\u2019t be played with.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a bunch of these as gifts for Operation Christmas Child Shoeboxes. First of all, the dolls were not the color that I ordered. Secondly, they come naked, and aren't clothed until you drench them in water. Others reported having their skin break out after coming in contact with the water once the doll had been in it. I wasn't taking any chances, so I returned them all.",

That said, they aren\u2019t the same quality as Barbie stuff, but still good enough. If your child hasn\u2019t asked for them specifically, then I would skip these due to the little plastic feel.",
