I opened the box and a bunch of packages, cheap cardboard walls and dolls that are pretty cheap. All the cheap plastic parts are so flimsy that it's actually difficult to put some pieces together without the pieces bending. The dolls are very cheap as well. There are two dolls that are made of the same cheap bendy plastic and are notReallyMe at to play with. You can't bend them so they sit in chairs. The other two can sit in chairs but don't stay without falling off the chairs. These two same doll when bent to try to sit them in chairs the velcro keeping coming lose so the clothes come off.I definitely got what I paid for. It will all go into the recycle bin.",
