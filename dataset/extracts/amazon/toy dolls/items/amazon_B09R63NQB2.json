I recommend the doll for children age 2 years and up.The doll is truly adorable! There is a plastic piece located on the back of the dolls head that can be removed, so you can fill it with water, thus creating the \u201ccry baby\u201d effect. This feature works okay, but we did find after repeated use the water does seem to leak a little. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker! It holds very little water, so not a big mess to clean up or anything. Don\u2019t let this discourage you from purchasing!Overall, this is a super, cute doll that any child would love to have! I would absolutely recommend! Price is good too!",
