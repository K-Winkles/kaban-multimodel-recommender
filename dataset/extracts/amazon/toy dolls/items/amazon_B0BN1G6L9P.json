                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got this for my daughter after she saw an add on youtube. This was her birthday gift and let me tell you. My 9 year old has loved this toy since she got it in December.The casing was easy to open and provided a magical experience for my daughter when she knocked on it so the fairy would come out. She couldn't stop showing everyone what she could do. It was easy to reload the doll back into the case to keep knocking and having the fairy appear.The doll itself is great! She flies perfectly and as high as you want (sometimes a little too high if your an adult playing with the toy jaja) but easy to control and great fun for everyone involved. The doll also has a button you can push on it (small black button) to be able to use without the case if you wanted to continue playing without having to knock on the case itself. Just place the doll in the case without closing it, gently press the doll against the back, the little black button will get pressed and there you go. Let the good times continue!Overall this was a perfect gift that had both kids and adults wanting to continue playing. I love this product because as an adult you want to find things you and your child can play with and this is one of those things! Gets everyone up and moving and its so exciting watching the little fairy actually fly!",
