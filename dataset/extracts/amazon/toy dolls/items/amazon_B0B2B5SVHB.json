                "reviewText": "Pros:- Looks very close to Moana. This isn't a knock-off brand or anything, so I'm glad that it looks so much like Moana from the movie and my daughter instantly recognized her and was super excited!- No small parts, which makes this ideal for smaller kids, less so for older ones that want included accessories.- Sings 30 seconds of a song from the movie! That's just enough to not be annoying when played over and over and over again (because it will be). It doesn't end abruptly; there's a fade and it's at an appropriate spot in the song.- Lots and lots of hair! I love that is feels pretty soft, too! You can do lots of hair styles with this length and fullness.- Vibrant colors. The patterns do not look washed out or faded.Things to Consider:- The shirt is not fabric, it's plastic and cannot be removed. This isn't really a doll you'd dress up.- The skirt is a flimsy fabric. I do worry that the fringe will shred or tear at some point. I feel like this is a very common material for doll's clothes, though, so nothing out of the ordinary.Cons:- No accessories. Not even shoes. I know Moana doesn't wear shoes in the movies, but kids typically enjoy accessories.Overall thoughts:My daughter loves this doll! It's super cute and sings a song in good enough quality (not super tinny sounding) and at a good volume. She likes singing along and hugging the doll, but there isn't anything else that you can do with it, other than play with her hair, since there isn't any accessories included. At the very least, they should have packaged her with a hei-hei or pua doll. If this had included a couple themed accessories, it'd be a perfect product. I think a child who loves dolls and Moana would love to get this for a special occasion (or even just because).",
