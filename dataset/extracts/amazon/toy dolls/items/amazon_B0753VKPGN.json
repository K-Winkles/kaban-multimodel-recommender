However, the other brand, the baby bottles are really microsized, much smaller than I expected. This brand that I am reviewing right now that you are about to purchase is exactly the right size and does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. It makes it look like the babydoll is drinking milk. Brings back good memories and I can\u2019t wait to see my granddaughter and my little niece Enjoy these baby bottles!!!",
