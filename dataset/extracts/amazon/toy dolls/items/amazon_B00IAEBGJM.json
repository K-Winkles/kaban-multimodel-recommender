                "reviewText": "this is a great live combo budget issue of the classic toy dolls live from 2004 in the netherlands, i know this dvd has been available before but i either missed the cd 10 years ago or this is the first time the audio part of this is being released im not 100% sure on that, anyway i am glad i bought this cheap budget release as the toy dolls sound the same in 2014 as they did 35 years ago in 1979 when they started, olgy is the main force behind the toy dolls like lemmy has been the main force behind motorhead ( not that you can compare the toy dolls to motorhead) i do remember something about a 25th ann tour a decade or so ago so that must have been the tour this was recorded during, the songs are all typical punchy toy dolls songs, they play most of the 80s classics that most toy dolls fans want to hear and the set is very tight, i have an old vhs tape of the toy dolls i bought about 30 years ago in 1986 and this dvd that comes here in this package is as good as the footage from 1984 and 85, nothing ever changed with this band as i said before except the line ups but as long as you got olgy on the mic then you got the toy dolls, the dvd is awesome!!!! very powerful energetic classic punk rock i am very pleased this came out in this format and for the price you just cant beat this, i have been a fan of this band for almost 3 decades now and i am so glad that olgy still brings the dolls out for a few gigs a year, sadly there touring days seem to be over but hey it is expensive to tour so i can understand why the toy dolls just come out for big festivals and stuff like that now, anyway i am very pleased the toy dolls are still rocking in 2014, i liked there last studio effort a few years back and i hope to see them live again someday as i have not seen these guys live since 1986 now when they opened for the dickies at the old ritz in nyc back in 1986, anyway if you like this band for the price HOW CAN YOU NOT GET THIS PACKAGE??????????????????????? this dvd is as good as the ten years of toys live album from 1990..",
