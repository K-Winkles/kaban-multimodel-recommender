                "reviewText": "Great for a 3+ year oldsFeels well made, some loose string needed cut out of the box otherwise stitching is holdingSturdier fabric than expectedNice colors and designsFits smaller doll OKMy son has a Melissa and Doug babydoll that he loves to take care of. Surprisingly, blue or unisex accessories are hard to find but we've managed to find a few things he wants, including this carrier. My son specifically asked for a baby carrier so he can wear his baby \"like daddies do\" so I looked for something knowing it would fit him but would probably be too large for his doll. The larger dolls this is meant for are still too large for him. Fortunately, the carrier isn't too large compared to the doll (no need to stuff a blanket under the baby) but it is obvious that this carrier was not made for this size doll (as written in the description so I was aware of this fact going in). Aside from that, this carrier is a great addition to my son's house setup. We keep the carrier straps pinned at all times and my son puts it on like a t-shirt--- pull the opening for his head wide then over his head, allow the arm openings to widen then put his arms in (like a kitchen apron if it had arm holes). Then he puts his baby in and moves on with life :) The carrier feels sturdy and the fabric is fairly thick, like a light canvas bag. The snaps take some effort but that's not a problem for us since we leave the carrier straps in place.My son is around 3ft tall, size 4t clothes and wears this comfortably.",

                "reviewText": "It is made well, however, there's not enough strap for the taller or bigger 6 yr old, so I'm adding strap to it so she can wear it and use it. It is able to hold an 18\" silicone reborn perfectly. Good price, made a wonderful birthday gift. It holds up well with all the tugging and pulling children tend to do.",

My daughters only complaint is that it does not stay on her shoulders very well, it wants to slide down all the time. Maybe adding an extra strap around the waist would solve this! Great quality fabric for the value!",

                "reviewText": "Ho recentemente acquistato questo Marsupio Porta Bambole come regalo di Natale per mia figlia di 3 anni e mezzo, e devo dire che \u00e8 stato molto apprezzato.Uno dei punti forti di questo articolo \u00e8 sicuramente la variet\u00e0 di fantasie di tessuto tra cui scegliere permettendo di personalizzarlo in base ai gusti dei piccoli. Noi abbiamo scelto la versione con fondo bianco, decorato con disegni che richiamano la natura e l'autunno e le bretelle di un bel verde.Un'altra cosa che ho apprezzato \u00e8 la versatilit\u00e0 del marsupio: si pu\u00f2 infatti indossare sia sul davanti che dietro, sulla schiena come uno zainetto. Mia figlia lo indossa principalmente davanti, dove pu\u00f2 interagire comodamente con la sua bambola. Sulla parte esterna del pannello poi \u00e8 presente una piccola tasca che consente ai bambini di inserire piccoli oggetti, come il ciuccio o il berrettino della bambola. Mia figlia, ad esempio, di solito lo indossa sopra i vestiti, ma capita che nelle uscite voglia indossarlo sopra il giubbotto e grazie alle spalline regolabili si riesce sempre ad allargarlo in modo pratico e veloce e a portarlo comodamente.Le spalline sono regolabili e consentono di adattare con facilit\u00e0 il marsupio a diverse situazioni.",
