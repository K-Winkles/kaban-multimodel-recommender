We were looking for a neutral color just because we also have a boy who might play with it, but most of the reviews for other high chairs in the color we wanted showed pictures of those breaking very quickly. We are happy that this one seems pretty durable and our daughter loves it! Other color options would be nice but we are still very happy with it! It was SO easy to put together, that I did it by myself\u2026which usually never happens. It took less than a minute. **The only real con is that the tray doesn\u2019t really fit the plate or the cup it comes with.**",

                "reviewText": "This doll high chair is so close to being brilliant and would be if the accessories supplied were a better fit!Let's start with setting it up: Assembly is simple and couldn't be easier. I've had a highchair from a big doll brand that was unnecessarily complicated and fiddly, so this gets a thumbs up there.Sturdiness: My daughters are completely different when it comes to playing with toys. One is gentle and plays carefully. My youngest is feral! She is heavy-handed and can get frustrated when some toys fall apart or break when being bumped or knocked. We have one high chair with a tray that came off constantly because of the poor design. This passed the sturdiness test without complaint.Quality: The finished product is decent but the accessories let it down. The handles stop the cup from sitting in the holder properly and the plate is too big for the tray, so nothing sits flat. They could fix this by removing the handles on the cup and getting a smaller plate, or by making the tray them.Overall build quality feels like this fits somewhere between the type of product you'd find in the big bargain shops for around \u00a315-\u00a320 and the more expensive branded toys in the \u00a340-\u00a350 range. I would have expected this to be slightly cheaper but \u00a327.99 doesn't seem too pricey. The accessories let it down but it's an easy fix if you have a similar sized cup and a smaller plate.",
