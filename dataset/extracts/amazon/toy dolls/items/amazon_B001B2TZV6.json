                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with what was in the set we ordered. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo, but I was prepared for that based on other reviews. Bottles, sippy cup, potty, dishes, a velcro diaper, bibs, booties, mittens, assorted bathing items and tiny toys. Everything fits a Fisher Price baby doll that we already have for our 2 1/2 year old. I was happy for the more muted colors, mostly blue and white, and lack of floral in the set that we got as we got this for *gasp* our little boy! He loves to take care of his stuffed animals and baby doll like he sees us take care of his baby brother. He's also potty trained, so the little potty is particularly awesome. This was the perfect set for him and he absolutely loves it. It was one of his favorite Christmas presents. He immediately started feeding his baby doll, putting it on the potty, changing his diaper, putting him to bed, giving him toys to play with, etc. Very educational and encourages his nurturing side.UPDATE: After a month of infrequent use the bag has ripped. The thin floral fabric is tearing away from the edge along the bottom. I really don't care, since the accessories are still in great shape. And I need to get a bag that's a little more macho for my little boy. :) But just giving you all a heads up.",

                "reviewText": "A year ago, I decided to enhance my daughter's playtime with her Cabbage Patch dolls by introducing these adorable baby bottles. They were her first set, a perfect fit for a two-year-old's little hands. True enough, they've become a beloved part of her daily play. She cherishes them, frequently seeking out the bottles to ensure her dolls are 'fed'.Over time, the liquid illusion \u2013 that charming 'juice' that seems to disappear as the doll drinks \u2013 has vanished. While this magical effect was part of the initial appeal, the bottles have otherwise withstood the test of time and toddlerhood. They remain a staple in her pretend kitchen, even without the vanishing act.We've decided to keep them as they still serve their purpose in imaginative play. However, for parents considering longevity in every aspect, investing a bit more in bottles that retain their visual appeal might be worth considering. Despite this, the joy these bottles bring to my daughter is undeniable",

These ones are quite a bit bigger and they seem really durable.My youngest, 20 months old/almost 2, still puts toys in her mouth. She kept trying to chew on the fake nipple of these bottles. I expected some paint to chip or it to look worse. But after a few days of that there are absolutely NO signs of wear! I\u2019m very impressed.We got a furreal tiger for.

We used them to discuss food, taking care of others, so many things. The bottles have lived through several rough little toddlers too. I worried about them breaking and so far so good. I am sure they could be broke, but normal toddler wear and tear they have survived.",

I was excited to find that the design is actually just a plastic sleeve on the outside of the bottles. I was able to snip the edge with a pair of scissors and then easily unwrap them to reveal plain bottles. These were a big hit with my toddler, and to my surprise, my husband :) He had to inspect them to figure out how they worked. Apparently he didn't have these when he was a kid ;)",
