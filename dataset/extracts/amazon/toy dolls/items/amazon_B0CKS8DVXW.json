                "reviewText": "the world of Make Believe magic and Imagination it really should never disappear. And sometimes we had children that child deep inside of us always seems to come out in some way.For me I wanted to be a cosmetologist so I've always liked to do hair nails makeup and more and that's exactly what I became a cosmetologist now that my daughter is 6 years old she wants to follow in my footsteps yes I wanted her to be president but whenever makes her happy is best for me so I went ahead and got her this cosmetology accessory set because she does have the Barbie mannequin that she got for her birthday about a month back I thought it came with the accessories but only if you so I needed to get her this now this one is really nice and what I love about it is that it comes very soon plastic holder suitcase whatever you may want to call it and it keeps all the pieces together cuz there are some small ones as in hair ties and clips and stuff like that so after playtime I enjoy really being able to put the Pieces away in a secured place in the container suitcase that they give and it's see-through too so you can see what you need right out of the container in there comes a whole lot of accessories you have hair dryers roller brushes curlers a straightener and many other things that I'm sure is included in the description as far as how the pieces are well it's really good quality they do not easily break and my daughter is learning how to get knots out of her Barbie mannequin head so I know that the brushes and combs that came with this set have to be really strong or they would have broke by now but we're doing good so far... So is like every other girl normally they like the hair accessories this was a fantastic gift and I think it would be an even better fantastic gift to be able to give it to another little child who likes this it a nice size which makes a nice gift and it opens up to creativity DIYs imagination and basically art I look at art and cosmetology because that's what I do cosmetology I think this is a good start for your child to begin to learn how to style and brush and take care of their doll's hair which will rub off for them to be able to do their own in the near future. Thank you and I hope this review was helpful enough for you to make your decision here and again I think it makes a great gift so thank you and thank you Amazon for a great prices and products...",

I did find some of the pieces cheaply made. One of my kids accidentally stepped on one of the rollers and it cracked and broke. The hair dryer is really neat though, and the aprons make it even more realistic for them which is great. This is a really great set for kids who love to pretend play.",

I was extremely pleased that this toy makes clean up time easy when we're done playing.This kit comes with lots of fun pieces, including a little haircut cape for \"clients\", an apron and a barber's belt. I like the pretend flat iron and curling iron, because they help with coordination and focus, all while playing.I would definitely recommend this product for any little \"beauty enthusiast\" in your life!",
