My only complaint is that they sent 2 of the left side (that you use to lock the stroller open) instead of a right and a left. It works but doesn't clip into place.",

                "reviewText": "The stroller is cute. But, it is difficult for a toddler to keep two dolls in the stroller. The front seat is flimsy and the seat belt is all that holds the doll in. That is as long as the toddler doesn't tip the stroller. (lLike she just did) It wasn't as sturdy as expected. I don't think it will last a long time. My daughter-n-law got a better cheaper one doll stroller at a common big chain store. I got this because she was trying to fit two dolls in the one doll stroller. Wouldn't buy again.",

But the instructions to put it together are complicated and does not make any sense. The frame we got appears to be bent like someone tried to put it together already. We tried for over 30 minutes and could not get it to work. Will be sending back.You should consider better instructions.",
