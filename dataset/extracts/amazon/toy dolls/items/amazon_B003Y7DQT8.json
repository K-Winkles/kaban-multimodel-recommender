                "reviewText": "Love this little guy's impy smile! He's so cute!This is a well crafted baby doll that I bought for my toddler. All of the features are really beautiful...dimple-y arms and legs, baby rolls...so we'll detailed! My tot loves taking the baby's hat on and off...he thinks it's hilarious.Important to note: the baby's neck is positioned as though an arm is underneath it at all times and there is no way to adjust positions...so when you try to sit the baby up in a high chair it looks super awkward with the baby staring down at his own feet. If you have the baby lying down or held like a newborn, he looks perfectly fine, but he would look super strange in a highchair or umbrella stroller. I guess it's appropriate because the doll looks like a newborn, but it does limit it's okay capabilities a tad.This is a beautifully made doll though. High quality and perfect weight for a toddler to care for!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this doll as a last minute gift for my 2 year old granddaughter. When I opened the Amazon box,I was really impressed with the quality of the set ,both the details on the doll and the well made clothing. When I helped my granddaughter remove the doll from the packaging, I was blown away when I saw the incredibly detailed fingers, toes, belly button, neck wrinkles and more! My granddaughter holds this baby so differently and much more carefully than she holds her other baby dolls. The only disappointing thing was that the child size bracelet was too tight on her chubby toddler wrists.",
