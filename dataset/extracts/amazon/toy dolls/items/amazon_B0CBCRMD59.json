                "reviewText": "First of all, the doll is beautiful, she has really pretty screening and her eyelids are molded. The hair is fully gelled in a nice hairdo. The bow is plastic, and she comes with another hair piece.She has full hand and arm articulation, and the articulation on the legs is the classic bend and snap. The body is sturdy. For this line they gave the dolls more realistic proportions, and they're a bit thicker, but still quite skinny.I've tried taking out a hand to change her dress, but there was no need, first of all it doesn't come out (unless by force) and 2nd of all, the sleeves are big enough to fit the hands through!The material of the top of the 1st (classic) dress and the entire 2nd dress (\"rag\" dress) is really satin like, very smooth and nice. The bottom of the 1st dress is a different material, but it still looks very nice. The pockets on the 2nd dress are functional!The shoes aren't very tight on the legs, so they might fall off, but they still fit well (both pairs).She can do the splits, but she can not sit normally, her legs spread when you sit her down.She comes with a bunny rabbit and a bird which can sit on her index finger, a pie, and an apple basket.The overall quality is really good! Absolutely worth it for the price!Regarding the box: it opens up in the back and has activities and coloring, it's entirely made of cardboard, and Snow White is on the cover of the box.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this Cinderella doll for 4 year old's birthday. She and her sister were playing with it. Her 8 year old sister was helping to change her outfits. The hand snapped off. As beautiful as the doll is, it is not suitable for children to play with. I have tried calling Disney several times to fix the problem, and they have hung up on my several times.I really wanted to love this product. The packaging was beautiful and contained very little single use plastic. The doll came with beautiful clothes and accessories. The doll herself and joints that could move, so that the child can pose her in different positions. My daughter loved (and still loves) the doll, but it is really not durable enough for an 8 year old let alone a 4 year old. And since Disney is not willing to support their product at all I guess we were just going to glue it back on.",

It is fully sustainable and recyclable, kudos to Disney for such creative packaging. The doll is also delightful. No horrible plastic molded clothes, sturdy body and a few points of articulation. Well rooted and thick hair. With the activities on the box and the doll inside, this would also make a cool travel gift for a child. *chef's kiss*",

I Love the beautiful yellow dress that is included with this doll. This line of doll seemingly includes a lot of cute accessories, and very detailed second outfits, at a $30 somethingprice point. You can't get a second outfit with Rainbow High Dolls anymore, so this collection is very impressive. I do wish that there was more detail in Tianna's green dress, like in the movie. That dress is so iconic, and I would love to see Princess Tianna wear the dress in it's entirety, at more budget friendly level.. She's definitely a welcomed addition, and must have,, to my collection. I can't wait to add Moanna and Snow White next.",
