                "reviewText": "I actually really like this set. It was easy and fun for my 6yr old boy. He wasn't too interested at first, but he came around once he saw all the pieces for building. My 4yr old girl was excited, but it was a little difficult for her to grasp how to put the pieces together. The set comes with plastic long and short square-shaped rods with a groove on each length face. There are blue plastic connectors that make a joint on every corner. There are 3 styles. There are chip board walls/windows/floors/etc. There are small and large pieces. Overall, I really like this set so far. The chip board is around 1/16\" and is fairly sturdy. The plastic pieces are strong. The difficulty in the build comes in placing the boards inside the squares you've made - you have to loosen it all or build it in as you go. The blue connectors have one flat side with no peg. This makes sense for doing the floors/bottom pieces, but it also means that there are times that you end up not being able to tie in a beam or build a certain direction. Not perfect, but fun for both kids. We played for over an hour and only stopped for dinner. Both kids are proud of their creations, and there is a lot to do with it. Overall: great.",

                "reviewText": "This dollhouse is perfect for children who love playing with PAW Patrol and similar figurines. It might be a bit challenging for kids aged 4-6 to build on their own, so be prepared to assist them.My daughter and I successfully built the larger house depicted on the product box in about 90 minutes, without consulting the instructions. The entire build was based solely on examining the photo on the box, and it proved to be super easy. We used almost all the included parts; only four small blue pieces and one fence panel were left. It seems like the set might have been missing one floor panel, but apart from that, everything else was there.Contrary to some reviews, I respectfully disagree about the quality. While it might not be stunning, all the included pieces fit snugly into each other. One major plus for this puzzle is its sturdiness once fully assembled. Unlike many puzzles that tend to fall apart with the slightest movement, this house remained in its original condition after a day of non-stop play with PAW Patrol figurines.The included accessories like dolls and a bicycle are not of the best quality, but we didn\u2019t use them much. They were only part of the initial setup for the sake of completeness. When buying this set, consider it as paying for the house puzzle, with the small accessories being a bonus that you may not even want to use. In our case, our daughter doesn\u2019t enjoy playing with dolls; she\u2019s in a PAW Patrol phase, and this house serves as a perfect playground for it.Considering the current price of $42, I think it\u2019s a steal for such a large puzzle. Additionally, it comes in a nice box, making it an awesome present for almost any kid.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This 342-Piece 3D Princess Castle Villa Doll House Building Toy Set makes some great doll houses however unlike similar building sets, you or your child build to desired size and design. The set is pretty heavy before opening and I really was expecting a pain in the neck of various parts and pieces but it's not that overwhelming at all. Its a basic setup with 2 different sizes of framing bars with 3 different types of blue connectors. The framing bars are either long or short and the connectors have a basic multi post piece for most of the frame work, an angled piece to make triangle roofs and the tip piece for the top of the triangle.There are many decent quality cardboard sheets with pop out pieces that become the walls, floors, roofs and fences by sliding into the framing through prebuilt slots to hold them. That's the basic idea for any house structure which can be made as big or small as you wish. The instructions give you an idea of how to start and examples of what could be built rather than a step by step guide on how to build 1 ultimate project. If your child wants a village of single room houses or one giant mansion, the parts are there and its up to the imagination. Additionally there are accessories which include 2 cheap plastic framed dolls (could have really been better), a handful of plastic framed trees, some smaller plants, a plastic cat, fence post tops, a cool bike and a night light that doesn't relate to the set that I can tell but just a little something extra. The price is up there for the quality of the set but overall it will build many skills once any child gets the hang of it although its geared towards girls. My daughter liked it and we started building a smaller house first to get the hang of it while not taking up too much room.",
