Whether for gifting or simply bringing joy to your child, the Blume Doll is a fantastic choice.\"\"In today's world of digital distractions, it's refreshing to find a toy like the Blume Doll that encourages hands-on play and sparks a child's imagination.

We loved the toy- worth the price! Doll smells very spray painted so a little worried about that when kids play and chew on the toy?",

I was geeked to see how it worked and had to stop myself from getting another one just to do it again. A fun toy with a neat reveal for fairly cheap.",

When it is made for small kids, it should be possible for them to open and close on their own without help from an adult. My daughter is 8 years old but she could not do it on her own.The crystal hair haves pores in them, a lot of flash along the parting line which makes it look like low quality product and not worth the money being paid for.The doll would not wait inside the paper seal after the main seal was removed. Even before my daughter could pour water on it, the doll emerged outside spoiling the whole idea of a blooming doll.The doll neither stands on its own nor on the stand provided for that purpose. It keeps falling again and again. It is such a difficult effort to find the center of gravity to make it stand for even a few moments.I would never buy this again.",

Alleine h\u00e4tte sie es wahrscheinlich falsch gemacht. Aber mit wenig Instruktionen konnte sie, sobald die Plastik Verpackung entfernt war, alle Schritte selber machen.Mit der kleinen Plastik Gie\u00dfkanne gie\u00dft sie die Oberfl\u00e4che. Diese ist aus gedruckter Pappe welche wie Erde aussieht. Durch das Wasser wird die Pape nass und weich somit kann die Puppe von unten nach oben ausbrechen. Wie eine Blume wachsen. Echt s\u00fc\u00df gemacht.War ne tolle \u00dcberraschung und meine kleine sagt jetzt es ist ihre Tochter da sie sie ja zum Leben gebracht hat. \ud83d\ude02Zubeh\u00f6r ist ein wenig dabei aber eher mager. Schade ist dass nachdem die Puppe \u201egeschl\u00fcpft\u201c ist man eigentlich mit dem T\u00f6pfchen nichts mehr machen kann. Meine kleine spielt zwar damit aber die Puppe passt nicht mehr rein.Sch\u00f6ner w\u00e4re gewesen ein fester Deckel und die Vase etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer.Ich fand f\u00fcr 7,99 auf jedenfall ein gutes Preis-leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis.Ich werde es auf jedenfall wieder kaufen, meine Tochter w\u00fcnscht sich alle Figuren. Sind toll zum sammeln. Gibt auch verschiedene Looks und die Haare k\u00f6nnen getauscht werden. In allem echt gut.Hoffe meine Rezession hat euch geholfen. Wenn ja Ihr kennt das Spiel. Freue mich auf den Klick und das Feedback.Viel Spa\u00df !",
