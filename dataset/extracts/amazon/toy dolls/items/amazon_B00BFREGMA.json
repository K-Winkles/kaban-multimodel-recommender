                "reviewText": "This is a cute little doll. I got it for my 14-month-old, so I\u2019m glad it\u2019s smaller than standard dolls. It\u2019s the perfect size for this age. I also like that this model has enough ethnic options that I was able to find one that resembles my daughter.The doll did develop a rip around the neck like in other pictures' reviews, within weeks of purchase, but I was able to sew it back up and it's been fine since. I shouldn't have to do that though, not at this price point!The only real negative about this doll is the smell. It's overpowering, nauseating, and took a really long time to fade away completely! So completely unnecessary!UPDATE: We've had this doll for EIGHT years now! First off, the smell took several YEARS to go away. To the manufacturer: please get rid of it, dolls don't need to be perfumed, it's annoying.This baby is still going strong 8 years later, and is still my daughter's favorite toy ever! She wants no other dolls, this is IT. It has been to several different countries and continents, got lost twice and I spent hours and hours of driving to go back and look for it. I am now putting an AirTag in its butt and buying a replacement baby just in case, to cover all my bases. I don't even know how it's still holding together after all this - my daughter isn't the gentlest with her toys - but it's doing great! And it hasn't had any other rips after that first one. It's a member of the family by this point, and will be a keepsake that will stay with her forever (if she doesn't lose it for good next time), to show to her grandkids some day, with pictures of its worldly adventures!P.S. I like knitting/sewing clothes for the baby. Here are some pictures of the baby at age 8 years old, rocking custom outfits around the world!",

                "reviewText": "This is an adorable baby doll. We always pay the extra money to get the adora dolls that open and close their eyes. Kids just seem to love that feature. However, we gave this to our 1 year old for Christmas, and so after only 3 1/2 weeks of use, the baby\u2019s eye lids are noticeably chipped and the baby\u2019s pajamas have those really unsightly and annoying clumps of fabric all over them. We haven\u2019t even washed them yet. We have also not washed the doll since we got her, and honestly for a $40 doll, we do expect the paint not to chip (or whatever the coating is on the doll\u2019s skin). Cheap clothing is usually the kind that gets the little balls of fabric all over it in no time. It happens to human clothes too. But not in just 3 weeks. I am most likely going to ask for a replacement to see if I just got a bad one, because I am still within the return period, and despite the flaws, my daughter absolutely loves her baby. The good thing about the adora dolls like this one is they are soft bodied, machine washable, and great for young children. We have another adora doll that had lasted much, much longer, and so I do have hope that the quality is typically better.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I love buying from Amazon. Being a first time Grandma of Twin Girls and having to buy double of everything can get expensive quick. I live in a different state so how grateful I am to come on line, order from Amazon with assurance that my items will be delivered right to their door. Among the first gifts that I wanted to give them for their 3rd Birthday was a Baby Doll. I looked at a lot of dolls on the Amazon site and read many reviews. This Adora Baby Doll was the one that I kept coming back too. I ordered 2 of them and heard back from my daughter that the items arrived on time and are well made and just adorable. The twins have hours of fun with them. I also purchased a Kidkraft Tiffany Bow High Chair and doll cradles. When my daughter calls and my grand babies know it's Gamma on the phone, they run and get their dolls to show me over the phone I guess. It's time to learn to skype.I recommend these dolls to anyone and I'm going to have to buy 2 more of these for my home when they should come to visit me and happen to leave their baby dolls home. Their even cute enough to put in my spare bedroom that I'll need to turn into a girls room. This won't be my last time purchasing these dolls. I am very pleased with my decision to read many reviews from different manufactures and choose these precious baby dolls. My grand daughters absolutely love their dolls.My daughter has told me how cute these carriers are and they are well made and just adorable. She is very pleased so this exceeds all of my expectations. Just looking at them on line makes even a Grandma want one for when the grand children come to visit. They are just so cute and it brings back memories of my sister and I playing house with our dolls and carriers back in the day we were young. I would highly recommend these.",
