One thing to be ware of is that the stand is a piece of round would with a sharp needle sticking out of it. The tomatoes is literally held into the stand by being skewered onto the needle so that the bottom is resting on the wood. The green top of the tomato blocks the top of the needle well enough but don't give the stand to anyone with self harm or destructive tendencies. You can just gift the tomato without the stand. It's cute but something to keep in mind when ordering.",
