I am impressed with both it quality and the packaging.Notes-- Jesse's lasso shoots out in order to try and lasso the snake! It is a fun addition to just having an action figure- Jesse is 12\" tall and has fully poseable (with a removable cowgirl hat!)- The packaging is very nice - definitely not just standard packaging. The box opens up and a nice retro look to it.- High quality Jesse - one of my complaints about contemporary kid's toys is that they are made so cheaply. That is not the case with the Jesse by Mattel. The joints are fluid and move easily. There are no flaws in the coloring. It really does feel high quality... again.. like something a collector would want!",

It came packaged just fine with no defects that I could see. Getting it out it was a figure of Jessie, a rope with a launcher, a snake for target practice, and some other cutouts that can be used for shooting. She likes playing with Jessie but when we showed her how the rope shoots out that was her big thing. For a toy for a toddler, it is surprisingly good, lord knows how many times we had to lad it for her before she figured out how to use it. She had a blast with it and last night it got the honor of sleeping with her in bed.",

There is no plastic involved in the packaging. It's all either cardboard or paper. Even the restraints used to keep Jessie in the box are made of paper. The toy itself is a lot of fun. It has multiple pieces of articulation and seems very durable. It's survived a couple of weeks of rough play from a 7 year old so far with no problem. The lasso shooter is easy to load and shoots surprisingly far. My daughter also likes that Jessie's hat is removable, and fits on the toy's head quite easily. Her only complaint is that the pull string ring on Jessie's back is molded to the toy. She would have liked if that were pullable here as well. Overall though, she loves it!",

                "reviewText": "This figure of Toy Story's Jessie is 12\" tall but it is not a normal Barbie size. Her whole body is large. She has movable arms and legs at the knees and elbows. She has a lasso action feature that shoots out of the rope after connecting it to her hand and then pushing button. A rattlesnake target stand is included. She's wearing her iconic outfit with her famous hat. Her outfit is part of her body, but hat is separate and removable. Even the box it comes in is very giftable. The front opens out to reveal Jessie and her accessories behind plastic.",

                "reviewText": "This is larger than I was expecting. The doll measures 12\" tall, but is a larger form than a Barbie doll. The lasso on this has roping action. If you like Toy Story or are a Toy Story collector, this is a must buy.",
