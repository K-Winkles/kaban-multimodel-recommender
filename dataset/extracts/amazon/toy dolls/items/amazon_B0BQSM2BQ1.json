                "reviewText": "After my daughters got others in the set for Christmas, I ended up purchasing Deerlee here so I could play with them (no shame! None at all! They're only this little once!) After seeing the gimmick of the magic mixing potion a few times already, I would have appreciated an option for someone who JUST wants the doll and is good on the experience of unboxing it.Don't get me wrong, the experience IS fun! It's a little messy but that's easy to combat, and the blue liquid dries clear. It's just time-consuming, and, yes, pretty wasteful, even though the QR code gives you ideas for how to repurpose the bottle. If you are trying to \"collect them all\", though, as our family is? That's a lot of bottles, and they end up, inevitably, in the recycling bin with the hopes that the center can take them.The dolls themselves aren't a SUPER great value for what you get, but they're lovely. The faces are pretty, detailed, and fun to look at, the clothes are charming, the scale is unusual but great for dollhouses. The hair is a high-quality nylon. I'm super glad that the Mixies franchise has expanded to high-fantasy humanoid dolls because these are lovely, and look as good on the shelf in my office as they do hopping around a playscape.",

                "reviewText": "These dolls are so cute!!! I'm an adult collector but the potion gimmick really intrigued me and the designs are absolutely darling! The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The blue liquid potion dries clear, which is very convenient because on both the bottles I did I accidentally spilled a bit of the liquid trying to pour it into the bottle. It also leaked a little into the inner chamber with the dolls themselves but it only really got on one of them(on the skirt specifically) and it dried clear very quickly so you can't even tell. The outfit tops are moulded on the bodies but the skirts are fabric. I only have 1 little gripe with these: on Amber(the teal and pink dragon girl) her skirt is made of a fake fur that very easily sheds at the edges if you mess with it. Not a problem for me as they're going to be displayed but I can easily see a kid accidentally ripping tufts out during regular play. If you're gifting these to a child I'd say they'll probably need some supervision and possibly help depending on how old they are as this could get messy if you're a little clumsy.",

Plus it didn\u2019t mix half as pretty as commercials made it seem. But it was enough to make my little ones happy and have fun. Kind of expensive for basically a doll. But the doll has a lot of cute details, and has been used for lots of pretend play. So I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great new line from Moose. The dolls are adorable and have a cute overall theme. The gimmick is \"magically creating\" your doll by making a potion. There's a few steps but nothing was difficult to figure out and it would be child friendly (with some supervision so they don't spill water all over).I was impressed that the doll did not get wet from the potion making. The packaging is actually really good. I would love to see a larger version of these dolls without the potion making gimmick. Currently, they're 6 inches tall but the details on them are super impressive for the scale. Great paint, cute body blushing, articulation at the head, shoulders, elbows, and hips. Top is molded on and painted but the skirt is fabric and the shoes are removable. The hair is SO soft. It's genuinely shocking how soft it is.My favorite part of the package design was that one of the plastic tabs you remove to make the potion ends up doubling as a STAND! It's phenomenal and a major big brain moment. Thank you Moose for making reusable plastic bits. The bottle itself can be reused after washing - either to display your doll or to do the \"other potion\" activities that you can access using a QR code on the instructions. I wasn't super impressed with the \"other potion\" crafts but at least they're trying to encourage no just throwing away the giant plastic bottle.I think this might end up being one of my favorite new doll lines from 2023!",

I know the potions gimmick is the hook (and as a kid, I personally would have gone wild for it), but I wish we could somehow get these ladies without allof that and without purchasing second hand. Love these dolls though, and I\u2019m so happy they exist. They give me 90s trolls vibes with their jewel and awesome hair!",
