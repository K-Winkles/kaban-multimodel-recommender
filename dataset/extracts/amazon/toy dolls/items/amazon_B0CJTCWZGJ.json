                "reviewText": "fantastic punk classic from 1983, the toy dolls evolved out of the early 80s oi oi scene in the uk however they did not sound anything like there counterparts like the buissness, the exploited, 4 skins, cock sparrer or the angelic upstarts, they threw a lot of humor into there songs and made themselves out to be more like a cartoon punk band, fun to watch live and great songs to go with them, of all the oi bands the toy dolls even had a big following in japan in the late 80s and early 90s, they started out in 1979 but no recorded output would be heard until 1982 with the original version of nellie the elephant, on this great captain oi reissue you get some of the tracks recorded during 1982, as for this debut album it is about the best the toys ever did becouse it got them huge very fast, some of the songs on here are some of there best and DIG THAT GROOVE became a whole new trend at this time, this album is as good as A FAR OUT DISC(1984), IDOL GOSSIP (1986 ) & BARE FACED CHEECK (1987) the toys did some good records in the 1990s as well but this was there prime era for me, the 1989 album wackey wackey was ok but lacking and not as spot on as these first 4 where, great band they where!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also lots of energy live.",

                "reviewText": "fantastic reissue of this classic punk album from 1983, after all these years i still never get sick of this record, the remastering on this is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as with all captain oi releases this comes in a great digi pack w/ full photos of the 82/83 era and great liner notes and amazing remastered sound, i still dont fully see how the toy dolls got roped into the oi scene back in the early to mid 80s since there was nothing skinhead about them but that is the scene the toy dolls ran on, as for me they reminded me of a uk version of the dickies. lots of fun, corny lyrics and a very active front man ( olgie) i cant really remember anyone else like this band back in the early 80s except maybe the french punk/new wave band the stinky toys of the late 70s, anyway this record may not have come out in 1977 or 78 but was one of the best punk albums to emerge during the explosion of the oi scene in 1983, its still a blast almost 29 years later........................",

These guys are one of the top 5 punk rock bands of all time, in my opinion, and should be more well known in the U.S. than they are. As catchy as the Ramones, with better guitar playing (sorry Johnny), this album is full of classic Toy Dolls songs that they still play to this day. You won't be disappointed. Now go buy it.",

I was taken by it's hard driving giutar work and quirky humor from the first time I heard it in my mid teens. I was thrilled to hear it again after at least a decade and was back to bouncing off the walls, just like the days of old. I highly recommend this album to any and all punk enthusiasts. Lots of humor and an energy that will get your adrenaline pumping \"Big Time.\"",
