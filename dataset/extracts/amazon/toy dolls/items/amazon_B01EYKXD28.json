It came in a box with the picture of the stroller on the front so I was glad my daughter didn\u2019t see it sitting outside since it\u2019s a surprise . It was SUPER easy to put together. Just snapping the top on and adding the tires really , really simple . Took me not even a full 5 minutes . It\u2019s sturdy and well made. Rolls so smoothly . It\u2019s bigger than I imagined . For the price I was fully expecting something small and flimsy to come . It\u2019s not at all . The basket part fits my daughters 18 inch baby doll perfectly with a little more room to spare too . I mean it\u2019s seriously just so cute and so perfect. My only dislike would be the little diaper bag that came with it . I\u2019m going to look for something else. It actually is so tiny and flimsy. Doesn\u2019t even matter or take away from the awesome stroller . It\u2019s worth every penny . Absolutely would recommend. If I can update with a picture of her pushing the stroller so you can get an idea of the size , once she opens it for her birthday I will !",
