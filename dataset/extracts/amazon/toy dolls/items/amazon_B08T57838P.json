                "reviewText": "My daughter is eight years old with learning and coordination issues and she loves JJ. So when I saw this during black Friday sales I ordered it. This wasn't the only JJ she received for Christmas but to our surprise this is the one she's been playing with continuously for the past hour. As other reviewers have said, it does take some coordination to load the spoon with peas and a bit more to get JJ to eat them. My daughter is stubborn and keeps on trying until the peas disappear though. For this reason it may prove a little too challenging for younger kids. I'm still giving a five-star review simply because my daughter loves it so much!",

My daughter is a huge Cocomelon fan which is why I bought it. Gave it to her Christmas Day and she has been obsessed since!!! Is constantly amazed when JJ \"eats\" his peas. She loves dressing and undressing him. So glad I bought it!! Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "There is no way that the JJ doll I received is a fake. It comes in frustration free packaging, so no, it is not packaged the same way as Walmart's doll. The shirt is not the same as the Walmart doll but it is a shirt that JJ wears in the Cocomelon videos.If this is a fake, it's an extremely good one. JJ says lots of phrases and sings a couple of songs. The volume is not adjustable but as far as toy volumes go, this one is pretty reasonable. It's not loud enough for the sound to be distorted, but it is still loud enough for a kid to play with while watching Cocomelon and be able to hear what JJ says.The peas and spoon... It's awesome, but like many brand new toys the mechanisms are stiff. It's hard to use because it has to hit JJs mouth perfectly for the peas to snap back into the spoon. My 2.5 year old didn't mind at all, she still thought it was great, and when she couldn't get JJs mouth to make the peas snap back, she resorted to smacking the spoon across JJs face to make the peas disappear. Aggressive, but crafty.She was so excited about JJ she didn't open any Christmas presents after him because he was IT. Now he goes everywhere with her.I would 100% recommend this doll for any cocomelon fan.",
