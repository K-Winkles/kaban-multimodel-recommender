I didn't want to pay a lot of money for a doll that might get ruined as my daughter is probably still a bit too young to take care of it properly but she really wanted a doll with long hair she could brush. This doll fits the bill. As expected, it is not the highest quality but it is good enough. My daughter loves her new \"big girl doll\" (as opposed to all of her other dolls which are baby dolls). I'm happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend for little girls who are not quite ready for the much more expensive 18 inch dolls (such as American Girl). It is a good \"training/transition\" doll so to speak.",
