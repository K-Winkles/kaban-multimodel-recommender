                "reviewText": "I have been buying LOL Surprise dolls for my daughter and I judge them a couple criteria's. 1) cost, 2) time for play 3) Cleanliness 4) repeatability. 1)COST: the doll was a good price, at 9.99 you would think it would be a slam dunk. 2)TIME FOR PLAY: this is where we hit a snag. before my daughter could play with the doll she had to \"create\" the cake her doll would sit in. this took about 15 minutes of set up before we could even unmold the dolls \"cake\" and add in the fact it took 24 hours to stop being sticky before we could even play with the dolls outside of the kitchen. 3)CLEANLINESS: this left the table a mess. Water, The bouncy ball maker material, and the confetti glitter as \"sprinkles\" let my kitchen table unusable for a solid 20 minutes it took to clean up. this toy is usually given to the child on road trips and on other outings so this toy would also be unusable if away from a water source. 4)REPEATABLITY: this was a once and done doll. I like to have things to repeat with a doll. no water bottles to make cry, spit, or pee (a major selling point.) plus the doll does NOT come with a bottom (just a shirt, shoes and painted on modesty piece). I wouldn't buy this unless your looking for a showpiece that when done goes in a cabinet or on a shelf.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really neat idea. It provides a creative outlet for kids. We got Neon Q.T. in our surprise ball, but it looks like there is a total of 9 different dolls that you can get. 3 packets of color powder come with each doll. We made the mistake of combining the colors all together, but you are supposed to layer the colors. It's fine, because it still turned out very cute! I think we spent a total of 10 minutes creating the skirt. The instructions were primarily pictures, so I'm going to provide my own instructions in writing below. Also, a QR code is provided on the instructions that show a video on how to do it, but I couldn't get it to work. I'm wondering if MGA will release refill kits so that more skirts can be made. This LOL doll was so much fun to make! My girls loved it!1. After unboxing every item, attach the handle to the side of the mixing bowl2. Leave both skirting molds together, then flip upside down in the mixing bowl.3. Fill the color powder in layers between the skirting molds. Make sure it stays between both skirts. Smooth out powder with spatula.4. Add water in the center hole until the water surrounds the entire skirt around the outside of it. Hold down for two minutes.5. Pull out of the water and peel back the exterior layer of the skirt to reveal the gel like mold. Note: Keep the interior skirt on (this is the part that goes on the doll). Let the mold sit for 5 minutes.6. Add sprinkles to the other bowl. Dunk the completed skirt mold into water, pull out, and then place sprinkles on.7. Place completed skirt onto doll . Enjoy!",

We ended up throwing out the gel skirt that it makes because it was falling apart, and just using the blue mold piece as her clothing. It still looks good though.",
