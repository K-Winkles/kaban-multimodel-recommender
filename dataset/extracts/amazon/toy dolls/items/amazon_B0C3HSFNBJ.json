It was very easy to put together, it took like 10 minutes. The play pen itself is not too sturdy and the quality is okay. On occasion, when my baby boy get upset he kicks it and it comes apart. It's very easy to out together though. My daughter loves putting her baby dolls to sleep in there and rocks them to bed, so that is what is important.",

She has a couple of larger babies, about 20 inches, and they seem to fit pretty well. It is fairly easy to put together but easier if you do it before giving it to your child. Meaning it is easier to assemble without your little helper!!! It comes with a thin pad to go into the bottom, which is easily attached. We liked the carrying bag but have not actually folded it up to see if it fits. The colors are bright and colorful and the quality is as good as any of these toys like this. Overall, I think this is a good buy and an excellent toy for the little mommy in your life!!!",
