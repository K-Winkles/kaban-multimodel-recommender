                "reviewText": "Bought this for a 5 year old--she was so EXCITED to get it---right up her ally. The box is the only thing that is not disappointing. You will need ICE not cold water. The \"magic water bottle\" is so tiny to fill it is not worth it at all. Her hair does NOT change color...don't care what the box says it doesn't . The \"wand\" is super hard to use for a 5 year old, plus the bottle given to attach it is crap too. Extremely hard to fill with \"icy cold water\"The nails don't change either--the pad they give to \"do\" the nails is crappy--breaks within the first 10 minutes. Overall, I wouldn't waste any money purchasing this for your little one. It is very disappointing.",

Al irla peinando y desenredando nudos, el cabello se iba cayendo, buscamos tratamiento para desenredar puntas de cabello para mu\u00f1ecas y funcion\u00f3 un poco ya que las puntas estaban muy enredadas. La mu\u00f1eca se ha quedado con poco pelo a una hora de comenzar a jugar despu\u00e9s de sacarla de su empaque.",
