It includes 2 dolls, the squirrel and star figures, and accessories for a tea party. The dolls are very well made and so detailed from head to toe. Everything from their hair and dress to their unique individual accessories are perfect. Even the packaging they came in is so beautiful and nice quality. My daughter was thrilled when she got this set and has been playing with it a lot. She's already asking for more dolls from the movie to add to it. Overall very satisfied and would definitely recommend it. Great for anyone who is a fan of Wish, can be a toy or collectible.",

They have only 5 points of articulation: the neck, shoulders, and upper legs.The dress is soft, which is better than the stiff fabric sometimes used. However, all of the details, except the plastic belt, are printed on. The faces are pixel-printed.The braids are cute. They are small and lay nicely. The side braids are raised and printed on. The girl with short hair has a lot of glue, keeping her hairstyle flat.The accessories have a good amount of detail. The \"wooden\" pieces even have wood grain texture printed on them.Overall I would recommend the set, but I don't think it's worth the full asking price.",
