The hair is a little unruly but can be tamed with little rubber bands. The dresses come off, but are not particularly sturdy and I don't recommend trying to change their clothes. Also, the crowns do not come off, and will destroy the hair if removed. Overall a great addition to an existing dollhouse.",
