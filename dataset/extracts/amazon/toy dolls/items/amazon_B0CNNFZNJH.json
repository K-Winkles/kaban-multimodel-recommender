I got these hoping they would be comparable they are not!!!These things are garbage! First they are cheaper looking than anything than anything I\u2019ve ever seen at any fair or any dollar store item. They sometimes will start flying when they do they do not go up and down like they are suppose to they usually go sideways hit a wall and then they won\u2019t fly again until you turn them off and on again then they immediately fly into the wall again. If you are lucky they fly for about 5 seconds. I looked them over time and time again they are put together correctly and both of them do the same thing. I wish I had spent the money on the name brand ones as these are not worth anything. They only thing they did was disappoint two little girls",

This is one of the worst quality items I've bought on Amazon lately. Buy the real Hatchimal fairy and don't waste your time on this.",
