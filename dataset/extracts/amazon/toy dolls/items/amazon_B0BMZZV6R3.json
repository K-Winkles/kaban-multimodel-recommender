The quality of the voice and volume are just right. Not too loud and not too low. Each song is about 10 seconds roughly. My daughter loves it even more seeing the film before I got this for her birthday the next day after we saw the film. Which was also good by the way. Would recommend this doll.",

Arms and legs move and when you move one arm she sings a song from the movie. Naturally, sound quality isn\u2019t top notch but it\u2019s clear enough and easily recognisable.The doll at full price is quite expensive, but good value when it\u2019s on offer.Great gift for any Wish fan!",

One of them exclaimed that she even had real braids when they finally got in to the box.It frustrates me slightly that these dolls have plastic bit s that stick inside the head. No matter how close I cut them to the hair, the still can be felt through the hair.I was a bit concerned when I moved the arm forward to test the sound whilst it was in the box. The doll only sang for a very short time. However when the doll was removed from the box she made a proper go at singing.The doll is a standard size and fits in well with the girls' other dolls. They haven't investigated changing the clothes yet, but she might be visiting Barbie's swimming pool later.",
