She has curly hair and identifies with the character Mirabel. This doll is a perfect likeness, has her voice, is a good size and can stand. It will be loved by Encanto fans \u2026 once you manage to get it out of the packaging! My granddaughter immediately put on her glasses and started dancing around to her singing. It comes with batteries which is a plus when you\u2019re gifting. The only downside is the butterfly that allows her to sing comes off easily, I wish it snapped into the wrist so it won\u2019t be lost. Good value for the money.",
