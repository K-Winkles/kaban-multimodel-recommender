                "reviewText": "The colour is as pictured and the quality was more sturdy than expected. Great value for money, my daughter loves pushing her dolls and stuffed animals around in it. The size is perfect for my toddler (16 months) and she will be able to use it for quite some time. The stability is as expected with any doll stroller, can easily tip but it is light enough for my daughter to pick it up and not get hurt. She plays with it every day. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best baby doll stroller ever! Its super good quality (my toddler sits in it all the time and is super rough with it). Its perfect for any little kid, my one and a half year old plays with it constantly but any young kid would love it. The basket down below fits lots of toys and is also very sturdy. I love that this collapses like a real stroller for easier storage when it\u2019s not being played with!For reference the doll is an american girl doll baby doll which are very large as far as baby dolls go, they even fit newborn baby clothes.",
