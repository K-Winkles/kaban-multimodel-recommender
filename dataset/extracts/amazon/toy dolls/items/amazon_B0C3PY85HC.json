I had ordered him a couple, they were wood, and a few of the pieces ended up breaking or cracking. He can be a little rough on his toys-he plays hard and with a lot of passion. But when I found these and saw that they\u2019re all silicone, I knew it would be perfect for him. This nesting doll set is good quality, well made- perfect size for little hands and easy for toddlers and little ones to play with. And because of their silicone material-they are extremely durable and study. If thrown, they actually bounce. And it\u2019s super easy to clean the parts, if needed. But kids love this, it looks cute and it\u2019s a good value for its price.",
